    "body": "Obligatory this happened a few weeks ago.\n\nMy husband and I have been together for 13 years. I have no idea how this started really, but I've been powdering and rubbing his balls for years now. It is just something that we do. It's weirdly comforting and puts us both to sleep. Plus, who doesn't like freshly powdered balls instead of gross swamp balls? Not to mention the wonders it does for chafing.\n\nAnyway, one day I can't find the powder for our 2 yr old's butt. No biggie. I go to the store to get more, but I figured I could get Man powder too. A nice smelling one that just smells like... Man. NOT the after work gross man smell... this is what we are trying to get rid of my dudes. So I get a new powder for him and just regular ol' Johnson's for the baby. It'll be a nice surprise for when he comes home since he's been working out of town.\n\nHere's my fuck up...\n\nI DID NOT READ THE LABEL PROPERLY. I saw that it said \"Absorbing. Cooling. Refreshing.\" I saw that it said \"...odor + wetness control...\" and just thought of how awesome it would be for him to not have swamp balls. Being a bit of an airhead, it did not occur to me to read further into that.\n\nSo fast forward a few days later to when husband finally comes home from working out of town. Night rolls around and we're in bed. My husband asks for Powder and Ball Rubs. After a full week, without his wife to powder his balls for him, I say \"no prob. I got you, boo.\" I bust out the new Men's Essentials Man Powder. It smells good. I dig it. I turn around to put it away and he asks me what I put on him. I turn back to him and can see he's clearly uncomfortable. I look at the label and see that the cooling effect comes from menthol. Now, I feel awful at this point, but honestly, I can't stop laughing. He's complaining its like IcyHot so I tell him to take a shower and see if that works. He hops in the shower and washes his balls. Nope. He is still feeling it. I'm still laughing at my poor husbands predicament that I created by trying to buy him something new for his balls. I ended up using the Johnson's on him, but he was still uncomfortable. I felt pretty bad about it, despite laughing like a hyena the entire time.\n\nThat night he said I should post this here, but I wanted to surprise him so I've waited. I do still powder his balls when he's home. I am going to stick with Johnson's Baby Powder though.\n\nBabe, if you are reading this, I am very sorry for causing your balls discomfort, but it was so damn funny. I love you. Sorry for being an airhead some times.\n\nTL;DR TIFU by powdering my husband's balls with powder that made him feel like he had IcyHot on his balls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: First of all, those of you who awarded my weird and wholesome post are the real MVPs here. I humbly thank you. When I made this post, I had no idea it would blow up like this. Made my day reading most of these comments, but then again the comments are usually where its at. Some of you really need to broaden your horizons and just caress those balls because they need love too. My husband does manual labor so yes he gets shweddy balls. He showers and asks for powder. I have had his penis in me, had his children, I really don't think touching his balls is that far out there. And you all have opened my eyes and educated me on the dangers of talcum powders. I have been looking at new things to try instead of J&J Baby Powder. I thank you for that and I'm sure my husband's balls will too. ",

    "body": "I write to you today from a position of incredible discomfort. Somewhere between the fires of hell, and the eternal cold of Hoth. As of this moment, I am wrapped in sheets as if they were the still warm carcass of a tauntaun.\n\nLet‚Äôs rewind to about 30 minutes ago, to a time when life was simpler. I had this weekend off from work, with no plans, and an excess of body aches. A cute boy on Snapchat asked ‚ÄúWYD‚Äù, and I said ‚ÄúNothing, WBU?‚Äù He says he‚Äôs taking a bath. Now I‚Äôm not usually a bath taker, but that sounded like a really nice idea!\n\nSo now with a purpose for my day in mind, I drew a piping hot bath, but thought it could use a little spicing up. So I retrieved a bag of 100% pure menthol crystals from my bathroom cabinet. I put a small handful in, and entered the water. At first, it was pleasant. I love the smell of mint, and the water felt nice... But something was off! The more, shall I say, tender parts of my body began to burn with that familiar icy hotness!\n\nRealizing that the air was only getting mintier, I kept from the water and tried to scrub the mint off, but the water and air was unbearable to touch. I felt as if I were self-immolating in a blizzard. I desperately rubbed a moist towel over the worst affected areas, and have been shivering in bed ever since; with every movement, breeze, or fart, sending shivers down my spine.\n\n\n\nTLDR: Do not add 100% pure menthol to a bath. It‚Äôs cold, it burns everywhere, and it only gets worse as the menthol evaporates.\n\nEdit: This is how it feels to chew ‚Äú5 Gum‚Äù.\n\nUpdate: I‚Äôm okay! Also, [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/DickHolliday/comments/ndf787/the_crystals/) are the crystals in question, and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/ndtbfd/i_took_a_bath_in_pure_menthol_and_it_leeched_the/) is where the menthol leeched the color out of my shower curtain.",

They'll complain so much about the heat, sweat buckets, hog the fans, \"cool down\" with iced drinks, but it doesn't occur to them to take a shower.\n\nWhy YSK: Sweat, dirt and oils from our body trap heat, and with humid weather it doesn't dry out as much as you're used to especially if you're from a colder climate, so it traps even more heat, leading to that sticky uncomfortable hot feeling. Plus us locals can smell if you're \"unwashed\" even from a few feet away so consider it as a courtesy to us as well. Lol.\n\n-----\n\nETA: Sweat alone doesn't cool you down. It needs to evaporate first to take away the heat. Trapped sweat can even cause heat stroke. I know it sounds like BS - I was surprised to learn that too. \n\n\nAlso here's some more tips for when you're traveling to a humid country:\n\n- If you're planning on being outside a lot, bring an umbrella. Most people who commute here always carry a small, dark-colored, foldable umbrella in their bags. It's common to see people use it as extra protection from the sun.\n\n- Those small USB-rechargable fans are also pretty popular. In the philippines, you can buy them from almost any novelty store (eg Miniso, Mumuso), supermarkets, convenience stores, roadside and mall kiosks. There's also a version that's worn around the neck.\n\n- Cooling powders are also great for when you want to freshen up on the go. It's a little harder here in the Philippines to find but you can try buying from drugstores -We usually buy them from lazada/shoppee (our version of amazon). We love \"Snake brand\" which I think is a Thai brand.\n\n- Wet wipes are also great to have with you on the go to help with the stickiness. There are several cooling menthol kinds. You can also buy this from convenience stores.\n\n- Wear sunscreeen and don't forget to reapply regularly throughout the day",

Like, 3x what you think you need. You can rinse them in the sink if you won't be able to fully wash them for a while.  \n * Wear an undershirt that you could wear by itself (a tank top is ideal), and a loose-fitting button-up short sleeve over top. You won't sweat through to your outer shirt, and can take it off if you get too hot. Bring more undershirts than overshirts to change them throughout the day.  \n * Get prescription-strength deodorant, and apply it at night. Take a shower, and then apply it to any areas you sweat excessively (pits, back, chest, neck, etc.). It's supposed to be applied the night before to work.\n * Stop in convenience stores regularly. In Thailand, there's a 7-11 every other block. Stop in, look at things, grab a water or some electrolyte tablets or a snack for later.\n * Gold bond powder will soak up sweat and prevent chafing. It's magic. Try a little first to see if it irritates you, I think there's also unmedicated versions.\n\nEven with this, I was still way more sweaty than any locals I saw, but it helped a lot. I'm sure locals to tropical climates have even more tips that can help.",

    "body": "I work in a coffee shop. I have a cold. Since sick days for hourly workers don‚Äôt really exist in this country, I‚Äôm at work with a cold and an apron pocket full of cough drops. \n\nThinking nothing if it, I pop a cough drop while I‚Äôm sweeping the cafe and a child sees me do this. Apparently she‚Äôs very upset that I have candy and she doesn‚Äôt, which I‚Äôm not aware of at first because I tune out most customer conversations. Then the mom comes up to me.\n\nMom: Hi, can my daughter pretty please have a piece of candy?  We‚Äôre teaching her about sharing and she knows how important it is to bring treats for everyone, so could you please share?\n\nMe: ...what?\n\nMom: The candy in your pocket. I can see you have enough to share and she really wants a piece. \n\nMe: It‚Äôs a cough drop. They‚Äôre, like, the menthol blue death flavor. \n\nMom: Sharing is very important. \n\nMe: Fine\n\nAnd I‚Äôm thinking, ‚ÄúFine, you nutball, give a toddler a menthol eucalyptus cough drop, see where it gets you.‚Äù  But o don‚Äôt say it because I‚Äôm poor and need my job. \n\nThe child, predictably, hates the nasty blue cough drop and the mom comes back saying, ‚ÄúI told her it would be cherry flavored. Don‚Äôt you have cherry?‚Äù\n\nMe:  Nope. Blue death flavor only. \n\nMom: But you must have something!  Give me a cake pop instead. \n\nMe: Sure. I‚Äôll ring you up right over here. \n\nMom: But sharing blah, blah, blah. \n\nMe: I did share. I gave her exactly what I have. Are you going to buy the cake pop or not?\n\nShe didn‚Äôt and they left soon after. Not the craziest, but still an entitled loon. ",

    "body": "I was raised by a woman with the unlikely name of Countess Fatima O‚ÄôRourke. Some would claim the Countess wasn‚Äôt really my mother, and technically they would be right - I *was* adopted after all - I  but when you get deep into the soulfuckery of it all, they couldn‚Äôt be more wrong. That woman, wretched old spiteful hag, was my mother in all the ways that count.\n\nSo there were tears when she died, of course. I had to take several moments when I held her eulogy, but staring down at her open casket resting bitch face seemed to help a bit, so that‚Äôs where I kept my gaze through most of it.\n\n‚ÄúThe Countess was a cold-hearted, good-for-nothing excuse for a human being,‚Äù I mumble. ‚ÄúBut I loved her.‚Äù\n\nAnd it was true. It *is* true. She was heartless. Cold as an icicle shoved up a witches tit. Human only by vague appearance; her morbidly thin crooked face like something out of a fucking Giger painting or something. And her voice...Man, that voice. It was like someone dragging a cheese grater across barbed wire. Harsh, relentless, emotionless. But to the point.\n\n‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre the girl?‚Äù was her first words to me. ‚ÄúHow utterly disappointing.‚Äù\n\nShe showed up at the police station out of the blue, demanding to have a look at *the girl*. Now, most people, white old money privileged or not, could never pull shit like that. But the Countess could. She did whatever she fucking pleased, and there wasn‚Äôt a soul around stupid enough to stand in her way.\n\n‚ÄúWh-who are you?‚Äù I asked. I knew who she was of course. *Everyone* around these parts knew the Countess.\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be daft, girl,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou know who I am.‚Äù\n\nI just nodded weakly, my gaze drawn to her sparkly shoes. So fucking sparkly. Probably worth more than a medium sized country‚Äôs national budget those fucking shoes. \n\nShe stuck a finger under my chin, forcing it upwards. ‚ÄúCollect your belongings,‚Äù she said coldly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre coming with me.‚Äù\n\nAnd that‚Äôs all there was to it. From that day on I was no longer Emma Fitzpatrick. I was Emma O‚ÄôRourke, the Countess‚Äô little pet project. \n\nI‚Äôm back at the eulogy now, the memory still vivid, but fading rapidly as I dry my tears. ‚ÄúI remember the first time she hit me,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúCame out of fucking nowhere, sorry not sorry Father.‚Äù\n\nFather Henderson nods in my direction, a forced smile visiting his thin lips briefly.\n\n‚ÄúShe‚Äôd do that, you know. Wasn‚Äôt abuse or anything I guess, just a slap across the face. Hardly even left a mark. But you knew you‚Äôd fucked up, somehow, some way. And that was her true power. Instilling that fear of God, fear of *Countess*, deep in your heart.‚Äù\n\nI was thirteen years old. A little brat, really. But an orphan brat, given that the police had long since stopped looking for my missing parents. And you‚Äôre not supposed to discipline orphans like that, I think. She didn‚Äôt fucking care though. I was in her house, under her care, and she made damn well sure I followed every last one of her ridiculous rules down to the detail.\n\n‚ÄúOwww,‚Äù I whined. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck was that for?‚Äù\n\nThe slap was weak, low effort, more of a mistargeted high five against my chin than anything else. But it came from a grown up. An adult. A Countess. That shit hurts, you know, inside you.\n\n‚ÄúMind your language, girl,‚Äù she spat. ‚ÄúAnd that was for *this,‚Äù* she said, gesticulating toward my wrinkly-ass bed sheets. ‚ÄúIs *this* your idea of making a bed? If it is, your parents failed you more than I‚Äôd originally thought.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúYou take that back!‚Äù I yelled. \n\n‚ÄúI will do no such thing, girl,‚Äù she grimaced sourly. ‚ÄúNow, get that bed sorted post-haste. O‚ÄôRourkes never leave so much as a single crumb behind to be scrutinized by our lessers.‚Äù\n\nI didn‚Äôt know it at the time, still a daft brat by all intents and purposes I suppose, but that was a sign of growing respect. She called me an O‚ÄôRourke. That was a huge fucking deal, and it took me years to realise that.\n\nBack at the eulogy, I have to take one of my many moments, the flow of constant memories resurfacing proving a bit too much, resting open casket bitch face or not.\n\n‚ÄúShe, uh, she wasn‚Äôt afraid of anyone, you know,‚Äù I mumble into my handkerchief. ‚ÄúNot even when my asshole uncle showed up on her doorstep, rifle at the ready and everything, did she flinch.‚Äù\n\nI hadn‚Äôt seen my uncle for years, and I counted my blessings for that fact. He was a true fucking asshole, neck as fiery-red as they come. Then one day, months after my parents' disappearance, he just shows up, demanding that the Countess hand me over. \n\n‚ÄúShe‚Äôs my fucking niece,‚Äù he yelled, the nauseating stench of cheap whiskey and menthol cigarettes seeping under the cracks of the front door. The Countess had closed it firmly behind her, and told me in no uncertain terms to not move a single muscle, so that‚Äôs exactly what I did.\n\n‚ÄúLegally speaking, perhaps,‚Äù the Countess noted. ‚ÄúSpiritually? You‚Äôre species apart.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat the fuck are you talking about?‚Äù my uncle protested wildly. ‚ÄúSpiritually? Hand the fucking girl over right this fucking moment, or I swear...‚Äù\n\nHe didn‚Äôt need to complete the sentence, the rifle doing all the talking from that point on I suspect. Still, the Countess didn‚Äôt back down. I‚Äôm not sure if she even knew *how to*.\n\n‚ÄúGet off my porch, you filthy hoodlum,‚Äù I heard her say. ‚ÄúOr you‚Äôll find my wrath *vastly* unproportional to your social standing.‚Äù\n\nMinutes went by in dead silence. In my mind I like to believe she somehow stared him down. She could do that, you know. A single stare, targeted, amplified, of which would force you to your knees.\n\nI remember vividly the violent sound of an engine revving, and screeching tires as my uncle left the property. \n\n‚ÄúWell then,‚Äù the Countess said, closing the door behind her as she sauntered back in nonchalantly. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll be seeing any more of that unseemly character.‚Äù\n\nThe eulogy is a sad affair, I think to myself. Not just for obvious reasons, you know, a person's death. But because I know, deep down, that no one really cared for the Countess. They‚Äôre all a bunch of fucking leeches, here for the public appearance, the promise of a quick payout, the free drinks at the door, nothing more. If they only knew.\n\n‚ÄúShe hated you all, you know,‚Äù I whisper, just low enough for most of them to miss it. ‚ÄúTo her, you were ants. Sheeps. Inconsequential amoebas she was forced to interact with. Especially you, Chief Monroe. She kept telling me how much she loathed you, uh, I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù  \n\nChief Monroe, and by extension the entirety of the Police Force, were woefully incompetent, the Countess would tell me repeatedly. \n\n‚ÄúNot only are they unlikely to ever find your parents,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut they failed utterly in their task to find my little one too, all those years ago.‚Äù\n\nI knew the Countess wasn‚Äôt always some ancient dried-up spinster; that she was once married, had a little daughter. That she was happy - unbelievable as that may seem given the now heartless, barbed-wire-mouthed state of her.\n\nShe was showing me how to properly care for her azaleas, and she must have noticed the tears streaming down my face. I don‚Äôt know why I was crying exactly, but it would happen around garden flowers a lot, I knew that much. ‚ÄúMy Penelope deserved better,‚Äù she said, a sudden, almost unnoticeable sadness carrying her voice. \n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important, Emma,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúThat we rid ourselves of dependencies. There‚Äôs only one person in this world you can trust, girl, and that person is yourself.‚Äù\n\nThe eulogy drags on. My handkerchief is soaking wet, and I can‚Äôt hold back the tears. Not a single one of them dare meet my gaze; heads kept low in awkward silence. \n\n‚ÄúI hated her, you know. For years, I just couldn‚Äôt fathom why she kept me around. The scoldings, the slaps, her cold, emotionless eyes. But then one night, a night just like the rest of them - nothing special about it - she decided to show me. Show me the truth.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúEmma,‚Äù she demanded, dragging me out of bed. ‚ÄúGet your wits about you girl, and follow me. Don‚Äôt say a word, and stay behind me at all times.‚Äù\n\nKnowing the Countess, I just nodded, and shuffled behind her diligently, like some kind of strange pajama-clad teenage girl soldier.\n\n‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm about to show you can never leave these walls,‚Äù she whispered in a hushed tone. ‚ÄúAnd though it will raise many questions, I need you to remain patient. You will feel things. Hate. Sadness. Fear. Do not let them get the best of you. You are strong, girl. And it‚Äôs about time you showed them that.‚Äù\n\nI followed her down the stairs, and into her study -  a place I wasn‚Äôt really allowed to be in, but I snuck in there from time to time anyway, to marvel at the vast collection of first editions, and play with the antique letter opener that kinda looked like a little ornate dagger. She stopped by her sizable mahogany desk - a gift from her late husband - and stood there silently, idly stroking the smooth surface for minutes.\n\n‚ÄúNormally,‚Äù she started, her voice low, murmury, ‚Äúyou‚Äôd expect some kind of hidden mechanism in a place like this. Pull on a book, turn a knob, something to that effect.‚Äù\n\nShe turned to face me, her gaze flickering unsteadily, like she wasn‚Äôt sure what to say or do next. ‚ÄúBut in real life, things are exceedingly simple. Complicated on the surface, yes, but when you peel away all those layers, the remaining core is often a single, effortless truth.‚Äù\n\nWith a swift motion, she kicked aside the rug on the floor, revealing underneath what appeared to be an old trapdoor. ‚ÄúSimple,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúA lone, unassuming layer is sometimes all it takes.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúWha-what‚Äôs down there?‚Äù I asked.\n\nShe grabbed me by the shoulders with both hands. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve told you already, girl,‚Äù she said, a cold stare into my eyes. ‚ÄúTruth.‚Äù\n\nThe trapdoor opened with remarkable ease; a single pull, and we were greeted by a ramshackle ladder descending into the dark unknown.\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fucking mental if you think for a moment I‚Äôm going down there,‚Äù I sneered.\n\nThe Countess laughed. It‚Äôs strange, you know. That‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôd ever heard her laugh. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever change, Emma O‚ÄôRourke,‚Äù she snorted in between strained chuckles. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre coming with me all the same.‚Äù\n\nWeird as it was, I was also fucking amazed at how easily her sixty-something body made it‚Äôs way down that ladder. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the Countess was imposing in her own way, but she was lithe - her frail frame withered down by age and ceaseless worry.\n\nAnd so I followed her into the darkness, moments later finding myself in a dimly lit cellar, strangely unbecoming of the Countess. There was dirt, cracked stone walls, flickering lamps, and‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs when I met them again,‚Äù I say, back now at the church again, my eyes wandering from person to person. I can tell they are uncomfortable, shifting in their seats restlessly. ‚ÄúMy parents. Couldn‚Äôt recognize them at first, of course. She fed them maybe every other week. Nothing but skin and bones, really; pus-filled wounds covering filthy naked bodies.‚Äù\n\nThe sight of them fucking overwhelmed me, I don‚Äôt mind admitting. It was like a punch to the gut, and it quickly sent me doubling over to the ground. \n\n‚ÄúI figured it was about time you three got acquainted,‚Äù the Countess said darkly. ‚ÄúEmma, meet the Fitzpatricks. Fitzpatricks, this is my daughter, Emma O‚ÄôRourke.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúE-Emma,‚Äù my mother muttered, her pained voice barely audible. Her eyes were a deep shade of red, drool and snot dribbling down her morbidly skinny face in thick streams. Like my father, she was shackled to the wall - hanging limply from big old fucking medieval chains.\n\n‚ÄúWha-uh-wha,‚Äù I stammered incoherently, gaze shifting back and forth from one tormented parent to the next.\n\n‚ÄúGeraldine, James,‚Äù the Countess said. ‚ÄúI demand your undivided attention. Emma here came looking for the truth, and I firmly believe you owe her that.‚Äù\n\nMy father‚Äôs body shook and trembled as he struggled to raise his head. ‚ÄúDo-don‚Äôt listen to her, Emma,‚Äù he whispered hoarsely. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a lying fucking bitch.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh, am I now, James Virgil Fitzpatrick?‚Äù the Countess hissed. ‚ÄúTell me then, truthfully, is Emma here your biological daughter?‚Äù\n\nI stared at him intently. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúLies!‚Äù the Countess roared. ‚ÄúYour degenerate brain wouldn‚Äôt be able to spill the truth even if I nailed it to the wall and cut it open - a solution I am not above considering mind you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúE-Emma,‚Äù my mother pleaded. ‚ÄúPuh-please help us.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúEnough of this,‚Äù the Countess grabbed me by the wrist, and hoisted me up to my feet effortlessly. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs heard enough. Come now, girl. Leave the vermin to rot in the darkness where they belong.‚Äù \n\nI drop my handkerchief, and as it hits the wooden floor, a resounding *slooph* cuts through the dead silence of the church. ‚ÄúWhat I did next is the reason why we‚Äôre here, isn‚Äôt it? I put my trust in the wrong place. I didn‚Äôt heed her advice. Never trust anyone but yourself. My gut told me to leave, to get the fuck out of there. But my, uh, father. My mother‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nThe keys were right there, just sitting on a shitty wooden table. *That‚Äôs not something the Countess would ever purchase*, my mind noted weirdly, as I snatched them up without the Countess noticing. \n\nI let her ascend the ladder almost to the top before I made my move.\n\n‚ÄúFather,‚Äù I said, quickly returning to him with the keys. ‚ÄúHang on, I‚Äôll get you out of there.‚Äù\n\nI fumbled with the lock for what felt like an eternity, the fucking keys never quite lining up correctly. \n\n‚ÄúThere,‚Äù I sighed in relief, a sharp click followed by the loosening of chains leaving us catching our breath in silence. \n\nMy father scrambled to his feet unsteadily, a look in his eyes I couldn‚Äôt quite place, but I‚Äôd definitely seen somewhere before. ‚ÄúGet the fuck out of my way, girl,‚Äù he snarled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna kill that fucking bitch.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo, do-‚Äù I started, my weak attempt at holding him back woefully futile. Even starved and abused for months, *years*, he was still twice my size. He flung me into the wall like I was nothing, and began the climb after the Countess.\n\n‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù I say, gaze drifting again to the open casket, ‚ÄúI think she knew I‚Äôd do that, on some level. Fucking crazy old bitch, but she knew *exactly* what she was doing. My father caught up to her in the study, and I don‚Äôt think I could have stopped him, even if it hadn‚Äôt taken me god-fucking-forever to climb that ladder.‚Äù\n\nI heard the screams and the discordant sounds of bookshelves toppling over, but my shivering fingers failed to grip the ladder properly, and I slipped down it again and again. When I finally surfaced, my father had the Countess on her back, his hands wrapped around her neck in a tight squeeze.\n\nI knew where it was without even looking. The letter opener. It felt heavy in my hand, tiny little fucking thing. So bizarre. *Is it sharp enough?* I kept thinking. Knowing the Countess though, I had a feeling she sharpened it every night, on the off chance she needed to stab some lowlife to death with it. Like, for instance, right that fucking moment.\n\n‚ÄúI, uh,‚Äù I say, closing my eyes. I don‚Äôt want them to see me like this. Stay strong, Emma. Pull yourself together. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how many times I stabbed him, you know. Who the fuck would count something like that? One stab, two stab, nice stab, cool stab. All I know is that I kept at it until he stopped moving, and the floor was wet with blood.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúCountess,‚Äù I sniffled, trying my best to push my father off of her. ‚ÄúMother.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúEmma,‚Äù she wheezed faintly, her once icy-cold gaze now soft and strangely present. ‚ÄúEmma, you did it. You didn‚Äôt let the fear in. You stayed strong. I am so proud of you.‚Äù\n\nA sudden realisation hit me then, and I wrapped my arms around her in a tight embrace. ‚ÄúAm I‚Ä¶‚Äù I started, the words not quite making their way from mind to mouth. ‚ÄúAm I Penelope?‚Äù\n\nShe smiled then - however briefly - before the pain returned. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI truly don‚Äôt know. But I know this one simple truth, unlayered and uncomplicated; you *are* my daughter.‚Äù\n\nHer body was broken, my fathers hate and violence having done too much damage to her lithe frame. She was dying, and we both knew it.\n\n‚ÄúTop left drawer of my desk,‚Äù she gasped. ‚ÄúIt has a false-bottom. Simple, expected. You will find all the answers there.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared, mother,‚Äù I said, resting my head on her shoulder.\n\nShe coughed painfully. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a waste of your fear, girl,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúFear only what you cannot overcome, and you will find there‚Äôs little at all to fear.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúShe passed away seconds later, and I will live by her last words forever. You fucking vultures wouldn‚Äôt understand. You fear everything. You feared what I‚Äôd find in that drawer. You feared what I‚Äôd do with the truth. You fear me even now, yet I‚Äôve made sure the world will never learn what happened here. You fear me because I let my fake mother rot and die in that godless hole under the study. All you do is fear.‚Äù\n\nThe Countess had kept herself busy after her daughter had disappeared. She said it herself, the police did fuck all, and over the years she‚Äôd figured out exactly why. But before opening that particular can of worms, she had to deal with a *domestic issue*, as she so elegantly put it in her notes, fucking crazy old bitch. \n\n‚ÄúYou know how it went by now. Maybe you knew from the start. The ransom letters to the Count, the ones he refused to acknowledge, or even show to his wife. Poor little Penelope, not even worth half her weight in gold in that shitty old bastard's eyes. You all suspected it, I figure. That she fucking killed him. Could never prove it though, and even if you could, I don‚Äôt think a single one of you would have the balls to do anything about it.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs getting hard to concentrate, but we‚Äôre at the final stretch now. Soon I will be free, maybe for the first time ever, and it‚Äôs all because of you, you demented old hag. All because of you, mother.\n\n‚ÄúMy parents had been doing it for years. Kidnapping innocent children of the filthy rich, ransoming their way to a small fortune, that they continued to piss away on drugs and alcohol and all the fucking cliches. But what happened to all the Penelopes? To the little ones with parents who couldn‚Äôt fucking bother to part with their wealth? You guessed it. You *knew* it. Buried in the backgarden, under rose bushes, azaleas, the fucking weeds. Dozens of tiny bones and skulls, beautiful lives never lived because of them. Because of you.‚Äù  \n\nThe screams sort of take me out of the moment, but I can handle it.\n\n‚ÄúAm I one of them? Am I Penelope? In truth, it doesn‚Äôt matter. What matters is that you, all of you, helped them cover that shit up. Money for silence. So easy. So simple. No real layers to it. A core of corruption and greed. I‚Äôm so glad you all made it here, though. That you accepted her invitation. That you guzzled down that welcome drink.‚Äù\n\nStrychnine poisoning is some seriously fucked up shit. I read about it extensively before I planned the service. Easily accessible, horribly painful. Doesn‚Äôt take that much effort either. Simple.\n\n‚ÄúYou were all on the Countess‚Äô list. Even you, Father Henderson. A man of God indeed. You fucked up, didn‚Äôt you. This is what happens, you know, when you fuck with the Countess. A wrath *vastly* unproportional to your social standing.‚Äù\n\nI step down among the writhing masses, a few of them desperately attempting to crawl toward the exit, but failing miserably as the crippling spasms set in.\n\n‚ÄúIn closing,‚Äù I say, head held high, proud posture of a Countess. ‚ÄúFuck you all.‚Äù\n\nOn my way out I must have accidentally knocked over one of the live candles by the entrance. Shit happens, you know. Just the way of things. I find the sight of the roaring inferno strangely calming though, now that all the screams have died out. \n\nRest in Peace, Countess Fatima O‚ÄôRourke. You were my mother. And you were also a cold, heartless monster bitch. But only when you needed to be.\n\nAnd sometimes, that‚Äôs [OK.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Obscuratio/comments/ipjb1i/master_list_of_stories/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[[TCC](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/jvvtav/author_database/)\\]",

When you smoke those, you can't draw the smoke into your lungs very deeply. So you inhale and exhale quick, but still get a dose of nicotine.  \n\nConversely, the most dangerous type of cigarette is an ultra-light menthol. The menthol numbs your lungs so you can draw in the smoke more deeply, and you tend to hold the smoke longer to absorb more nicotine. Basically, the more time the smoke spends inside your body, the more danger to you.  \n\nI found this works pretty well. If you want to quit, or smoke less, switch to unfiltered Camels. You will still get your nicotine, but you will almost certainly not smoke as much. And disrupting your smoking routine is a good way to get out of the habit.  \n\nI still smoke, but way less than I used to.",

I get that the sneakers are very aesthetically pleasing, but the OG Menthol 10s might be the one of the coolest all-around pair of sneakers in the world, just because of the story behind it, and the incredible amount of work that was put into the sneaker's design (watch the Vice mini-documentary, the $ signs on the soles is genius). \n\nPretty sure I just contradicted myself by calling these an intricate pair of reps, while Ari's pair could also be considered the same. Why I consider Ari's pair different though is because it was an original idea, whereas this pair just pays homage. Whatever though, they look clean and you like them, so IDK what the fuck my problem is....",

    "body": "Hi all,\n\nThree weeks ago we went to Turkey for a week and amongst others trinkets, we brought a small jar of what I can only describe as Satan's crystal meth, back to the UK.\n\nWe were in one of the tea and spice shops in the Grand Bazaar and one of the merchants popped one of them in a little paper cup with some hot water and brought it up to my nose. I sniffed it and while it made my eyes water, it freed up my sinuses in a second and I thought that was pretty nifty as both me and my fiancee get colds and stuffy noses quite frequently. \n\nFast forward to today, I woke up with a nasty case of the man flu and about an hour ago I thought I'd be a neat idea to run myself a bath to soothe my aching muscles and pop one of those little crystals in the bathtub to free up my sinuses as an added boon.\n\nI ran myself a hot bath, bubbles, candles, The Office on my tablet - the lot. Submerged myself and dug through the tiny jar for the largest crystal, thinking a tiny one won't do. I mean, look how much more water there is in the bath compared to a shot glass sized paper cup. I eventually found the motherlode. It was about, maybe 3 times as big as the other ones, rectangular with jagged edges.\n\nPopped it in the bath right underneath the tap so the running hot water would dissolve it efficiently. Smart, I thought.\n\nWithin a couple of minutes I felt my balls tingle slightly. I didn't think much of it as it wasn't too bad, I use mint and nettle shampoo all the time (it's a Romanian thing, I guess). So there I was, chilling, like a frog in a gradually boiling pot of water, blissfully unaware of my imminent fate.\n\nAbout 5 minutes in, my goolies felt like they were little chestnuts roasting on an open fire whilst someone cut them open with rusty razor blades. \n\nI started sweating, my heart started pounding, I got up, jumped out of the bath, went right to the sink and started running cold water and rubbing liquid handsoap on my plums to wash off the menthol residue.\n\nAs it turns out, the cold water was a bad idea and the citrus soap was an even worse one.\n\nI started screaming bloody murder, my partner heard me from downstairs, shouted \"are you alright???\", to which I replied, rather stoically - \"BRING ME THE GREEK YOGURT FROM THE FRIDGE!\".\n\n\"Why in the world do you need greek yogurt? Are you okay???\"\n\n\"MY BALLS ARE ON FIRE FROM THE CUNTING TURKISH CRYSTALS\"\n\nA short \"wha-\", pause, then cue the hyena laughter. \n\nMy partner is great and I love her to bits, but god forbid you stub your toe or fall off your bicycle around her. She finds small accidents very funny and she's got this high pitched, on an inhale laughter, that sounds like someone repeatedly swinging a squeaky metal door whilst mistreating a seagull.\n\n\"PLEASE STOP LAUGHING AND BRING ME THE GREEK YOGURT FROM THE FRIDGE, PLEASE!!!\", I pleaded.\n\nLaughter. Footsteps. Fridge door breaking seal. More footsteps and laughter. My Dragon Balls are about to summon Shenron, mind you. You have to understand that she laughs with her whole body so when I heard very slow footsteps, laughter and the banister creaking, I had to open the bathroom door to see her.\n\nThat adorable bastard. She's laughing so hard, she's dragging herself up the stairs and stopping occasionally to bend over backwards with laughter.\n\nShe finally gets to the top of the stairs, I try and ignore her stupid face and claw the greek yogurt out of her tiny stupid hands.\n\n\"Just so you know, it's fat fre-\" I slam the door in her face, and start scooping yogurt with my bare hands out of the 1Kg container (2.2lb) and furiously rub it on my goodness gracious, great balls of fire.\n\n\"Can I come in and watch?\"\n\n\"Can you fuck off?\"\n\n\"Can I rub it on for you?\"\n\n\"I swear to fucking god, babe\"\n\nShe starts going down the stairs, I can hear her guffaw and snort and the banister shaking. But all is well.\n\nI mean, the bloody thing was fat free which probably wasn't ideal but it was cold, so cold. Oh, it felt like when I was a child, burning up with fever and my mum gently blowing on my forehead to cool me down. Just... On my testicles... And I'm almost 30 now... This is weird, I don't know where I'm going with this.\n\nSo here I am. Writing this in said bath after rigourously scrubbing it to make sure all of the menthol was gone.\n\nToday was a goofy day.\n\nTL;DR - I dissolved a menthol crystal from Turkey in the bathtub and it made my testicles burn.\n\nEdit: I just realised I fucked up the title. Please understand I just went through a rollercoaster of emotions at the time of me writing this, so don't hold it against me haha\n\nEdit 2: It's been brought to my attention that those little spawns of Satan are actually menthol crystals, rather than peppermint. And menthol is even worse. I've corrected myself where I could, thank you!",

From a young age, we learn to take on the subtle tones, gestures, and inflections of the people around us. It's actually a sign of well-developed empathy, and it tends to result in stronger interpersonal connections.\n\nMirroring can become troublesome when we lack a stable identity of our own, so we begin taking on *too much* of the people around us. This phenomenon is most notably observed in patients with personality disorders, where they mimic not just small social cues ‚Äî but big things too ‚Äî like your hopes, dreams, hobbies, and insecurities.\n\nWhen someone copies your entire personality, it's not a sign of empathy.\n\nIt's a sign of the complete opposite.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nSolitary sucks, but I'm an introvert. I've gone a lot longer than twenty-four hours without human interaction, so I knew I'd be able to survive this.\n\nStill, after four hours alone with my thoughts, I'll admit I felt a wave of relief when I heard that first whisper.\n\n\"*Hello*?\"\n\nI raised my eyebrows and examined the air vent by my side.\n\n\"*Hi*,\" I whispered back. \"What's your name?\"\n\n\"Elliot,\" the voice responded.\n\n\"Oh,\" I said with a laugh. \"That's my name too.\"\n\n\"What are the odds?\" he laughed too. \"Are you also in here for pissing off a deranged psychiatrist?\"\n\nI felt a strange knot form in the pit of my stomach.\n\n\"Very funny‚Ä¶\" I said. \"How did you know that?\"\n\nThere was a pause from the other side. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"That's *actually* why I'm in here,\" I said. \"Did you really have a run-in with Dr. Zhang too?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" said the voice, a bit louder. \"She's withholding life-saving medications from me. Does that count as a run-in?\"\n\nThe knot in my stomach tightened.\n\n\"Alright,\" I said. \"Enough of this.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" he asked.\n\n\"Clearly someone told you why I'm here, and you're just copying my story.\"\n\nThe voice on the other end went quiet for a moment. Then he said, \"Is your name Dr. Elliot Harper?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"Are you also claiming to be him?\"\n\n\"I *am* him,\" said the voice.\n\nI shook my head. What the hell was going on?\n\n\"Okay‚Ä¶\" I said. \"If you're Dr. Harper, why don't you tell me your deepest childhood secret?\"\n\n\"Seriously?\" he said. \"Why would I tell you that?\"\n\nI laughed. \"Yeah, that's what I figured. You're full of shit.\"\n\nThere was another moment of silence, and then he spoke again.\n\n\"I used to burn myself, because I was ashamed of my sexuality.\"\n\nA wave of dread coursed through my body.\n\n\"Okay, what the fuck?\" I said, leaning closer to the vent. \"Who the hell are you? Did Zhang put you up to this?\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" he said. \"I'm Dr. Harper.\"\n\nI bit my lip and inched away from the vent, as if my personality was leaking through it. \n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nHours passed without any word from the identity thief.\n\nI enjoyed the silence, but something was still nagging in the back of my mind. How did he learn about my history of self-harm? It only came up once, during the trial, and those documents were sealed. There was no way any inmate here had access to them.\n\n\"*Hey,*\" I whispered into the vent.\n\nA few seconds later, the voice whispered back. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"I'm having a dilemma,\" I said. \"I have valuable information that Zhang wants. And unless I give it to her soon, I'll most likely end up contracting HIV. You seem to be in the same predicament. So‚Ä¶ What do you think we should do?\"\n\nMy guess was that this imposter was some plant from Zhang to convince me to give up the photo. Hopefully he'd take the bait, and then I could manipulate him into giving me information about Zhang.\n\nI heard a sigh from the other end. \"Okay, I'll play along. But only because I'm bored.\"\n\nJesus, he even *spoke* like me.\n\n\"Great,\" I said. \"So what are you going to do?\"\n\n\"I'm not going to give up the photo,\" he said simply. \"People live perfectly happy lives with HIV.\"\n\nThat wasn't what I expected. My imposter seemed to have more of a spine than me. And he definitely wasn't trying to convince me to give up the photo. \n\nNot yet, at least.\n\n\"If you're really Elliot Harper, you'd understand that this is a spiritual battle,\" I pressed.\n\n\"How so?\" he asked.\n\n\"My whole life, I've been given this choice between justice and peace,\" I said. \"And every time, I go with justice.\"\n\n\"How has that worked out for you?\" he asked. \"We're sitting in solitary confinement, with a life sentence.\"\n\nBingo.\n\nI pretended to play along with his concerns.\n\n\"Exactly,\" I said. \"Justice never works out for me. I'm always trying to control the outcome, because I don't think people can be trusted to do the right thing.\"\n\nThere was a pause from the other end. \"So what would happen if you chose peace instead?\"\n\n\"I don't know, because I've never done it.\" I laughed. \"It's like I keep getting the same test over and over again. And I keep failing it.\"\n\n\"Story of my life,\" he said.\n\n\"The alternative would require more faith, right?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well,\" I began, \"When I do these self-destructive things for justice, it means I don't have faith in God, right?\"\n\n\"How do you figure?\"\n\n\"I'm playing judge and jury, because I don't trust that God will deliver justice,\" I said. \"Which also means I don't accept the gifts being offered to me along the way.\"\n\n\"Gifts?\" he said.\n\n\"Noah,\" I said quietly. \"My first chance at love, and I threw it away for justice ‚Äî justice that never even occurred. Now I have this choice between pursuing vigilante justice *yet again*, or saving myself from a life-threatening illness. How much more blatant can these lessons get? How many times do I need this choice from God, before I learn my lesson?\"\n\n\"You think we're all here to learn a lesson?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"And until we resolve that lesson, it will continue to cause us suffering ‚Äî in this life, and the next.\"\n\nWe both went quiet for a few minutes.\n\nHopefully that would be enough for him to believe that he was changing my mind. I couldn't wait to see the look on Dr. Zhang's face when I spat in it.\n\nFor the next several hours, we continued talking about spirituality. \n\nIt's a bizarre thing, discussing deep personal issues with someone claiming to be you. But it certainly passes the time. \n\n\\* \\* \\* \n\n\"*Hmmm‚Ä¶*\"\n\nPredictably, Dr. Zhang knocked on the solitary door with only several hours left to take PEP, before it lost all effectiveness. At this point, it was a gamble if it would even work anymore.\n\n\"Mr. Harper, I just wanted to give you one final opportunity‚Ä¶\" she said. \"Have you made your choice?\"\n\n\"*Yes*.\"\n\nMy imposter and I answered at the exact same exact time.\n\n\"My choice is that you rot in hell,\" I said. \"And you can tell your little pet to back the fuck off.\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence, and then the voice from the next cell spoke.\n\n\"The photo is in the showers,\" he said. \"There's a loose tile on the far wall.\"\n\nMy heart screamed. *What the fuck*. How could he possibly know that? \n\n\"NO!\" I pounded on the door. \"NO! HE'S LYING!\"\n\nI continued slamming and shouting, but I knew Dr. Zhang was already on her way to the showers.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n\"How did you know about the tile?\" I hissed through the vent.\n\nThere was no answer.\n\n\"*Hey*,\" I said. \"How the *fuck* did you know? Are you stalking me in the showers or something?\"\n\nAgain, I was met only with silence. \n\nHeart racing, I paced around the room, unable to shake the anxiety surging through my body. \n\nDr. Zhang returned several minutes later. \n\n\"Thank you for your honesty,\" she said. \"I'm glad we can finally put this matter to rest. Now, let's get you back to your cell so you can start a PEP regimen.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" I said. \"That's not fair! I should be the one getting PEP.\"\n\nI wasn't about to lose the photo *and* the PEP ‚Äî it was my only remaining hope for preventing HIV.\n\n\"What?\" The other voice spoke up. \"I told her where to get the photo!\"\n\n\"You don't even need PEP!\" I said, exasperated. \"This was Zhang's deal with *me.* Not‚Äî\"\n\n\"Gentlemen, please‚Ä¶\" Dr. Zhang spoke calmly. \"As promised, I will provide the prescription to Mr. Harper.\"\n\nI let out a heavy sigh of relief as the doors to my cell opened. \n\n\"HEY!\" The imposter screamed. \"I GAVE YOU WHAT YOU WANTED!\"\n\nI walked out of the cell with Dr. Zhang and she handed me the two orange bottles.\n\n\"Thanks,\" I muttered, unscrewing the caps and swallowing both pills as we walked away.\n\nIn the distance, I heard the imposter continue to shout.\n\n\"WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT FROM ME? I CHOSE PEACE OVER JUSTICE. I LEARNED MY FUCKING LESSON!\"\n\n*Jesus Christ*‚Ä¶ What a lunatic. \n\n\\* \\* \\* \n\nLater that night, I finished writing out the patient file and set my pencil aside ‚Äî ready to finally get some sleep after this whole fiasco.\n\nI surveyed the mess around me. Pieces of paper strewn about the floor. Hundreds of documents, court transcripts, and news articles. Videotapes and photographs from the trial.\n\nThose were all very helpful in absorbing his personality, but in the end, it was one single essay that gave me a window into his soul:\n\n*The intersection of psychology and spirituality, by Dr. Elliot Harper Psy.D.*\n\nDated six years ago, it painted the picture of a deeply rational man with one glaring exception: his relationship with God. \n\nHe did not believe in demons, ghosts, or anything remotely paranormal. Yet, he took solace in the idea that we humans are all connected by an \"energy\" that surges through everything in this universe.\n\nWhen it came to psychology, he believed that most suffering could be traced back to old emotional wounding ‚Äî trauma that blocked the connected energy from flowing freely through our bodies, causing us to instead feel isolated, fearful, and defective.\n\nDr. Harper believed that we were here on Earth to resolve those wounds, and re-connect with the universe around us. \n\nAll I had to do was remind him of his own beliefs. \n\nHe longed for hope and reason amongst all the chaos. He was comforted by the idea of a divine plan. And so, when I presented the plan to him, he did the rest of the work for me. He assumed I was the voice of God, or at the very least, a blatant sign from God to learn his lesson.\n\nI tossed his essay in the trash, along with the rest of the documents. As tempting as it was to hang onto his identity, I knew it was time to recalibrate. \n\nRecalibration is my least favorite part of this process. \n\nWhen I take on someone else's identity, my mind is filled with their hopes, dreams, hobbies, and insecurities. I think like them. I talk like them. I *become* them.\n\nBut when I shed it all away, I am left only with a crippling sensation of emptiness. \n\nMaybe that's the type of wound Dr. Harper was referring to in his essay.\n\nMaybe he could help me.\n\nBut Dr. Zhang helps me in a different way. She teaches me how to fill the emptiness by taking on identities and personas from other people. She gives me materials so that I can study everything about them.\n\nThe problem is, the relief doesn't last long. \n\nA single identity is never enough to fill the void. It's like an addiction that gets duller with continued tolerance. Eventually the emptiness comes creeping back. So I have to recalibrate, to prepare for a new identity.\n\nI stripped off all of my clothes, and I began saying goodbye to Dr. Harper's personality ‚Äî irritable, judgmental, and a bit paranoid. He was an unpleasant man, but for some reason, I very much enjoyed being him.\n\nI reached over to the desk and pumped eight squirts of BioFreeze onto my palms.\n\nBioFreeze is a menthol-based gel that creates an intense cold-burning sensation on the skin. It is meant for spot treatment on a sore back or shoulder, but I rub it all over my entire body.\n\nIt's very important to cover every inch of the body ‚Äî including eyelids, scalp, lips, anus, and genitals. This completes the seal.\n\nWithin minutes, the freezing heat kicks in.\n\nMy body is on fire. And yet, I am rolling in a fresh coat of snow on Christmas morning.\n\nI lay on the floor and I make snow angels as I feel Dr. Harper exiting my body.\n\nTears stream down my face. The loss is painful, and it leaves me with a profound sense of loneliness.\n\nThe snow is grey. The sky is grey. Everything is grey. \n\nEverything is empty.\n\nDr. Harper tries to come back in, but he cannot. The burning ice shield protects me.\n\nThe shield protects my body from all of the previous visitors.\n\nNobody can come back inside.\n\nEspecially not the screaming children.\n\n\\[[End of Patient File - The Copy Cat - View Other Patient Files](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dr_Harper/comments/a5wu7f/my_other_patients/)\\]",

    "body": "Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ra4hdr/tifu_and_will_be_mucked_as_punishment/)\n\nI've had a couple days to reflect and recover now and wanted to put this out there. Crime really doesn't pay.\n\n**Before the punishment**\n\nThe worst part was telling my parents. I'm 20 and still live with them, and given what I'd heard about people stinking to high hell after the punishment, I figured I had no choice but to tell them. They were surprisingly calm about it, basically saying \"well, I guess we couldn't teach you properly not to steal, so we'll see if the cows can - don't expect much sympathy from us.\" I'd rather them have yelled though, honestly.\n\nI'd like to say I was able to make use of some of your suggestions (something nice-smelling under the nose, a shower cap, etc), but this was not the case. First, the agreement to be mucked I signed forbid any effort to mitigate the punishment's effects (it gave examples like menthol under the nose, or even getting a very short haircut right beforehand). Secondly, I had to report to the jail the night beforehand, so they could make sure everyone set to be Mucked the next day was accounted for. My mom was kind enough to drive me there.\n\nSo I spent the night in a small jail cell alone, knowing I'd be driven out to the farm the next morning. It was good perspective on what could await me if I get caught again - I don't think I could spend months on end in a small box like that. As horrible as Mucking was, I think I made the right choice to avoid jail.\n\n**The morning of the Mucking**\n\nMorning came, and they took me out in handcuffs and loaded me into the backseat of a police car. There were 6 of us to be Mucked that day, it appeared. 2 cars, 3 people in the back of each. They reminded us not to talk to one another or to the officers.\n\nIt was a silent, 30 minute drive way out into the countryside. Very nerve-wracking. Then I saw the farm in the distance, and it was way bigger than I thought. I guess I envisioned a little roadside barn with 20-30 cows in it, but this Dairy was massive. \n\nWe pulled up around the back of one of these giant cowsheds and they unloaded us. Apparently four of us had a 6-hour sentence (including me), while two people had a 4-hour sentence. The officers led the four of us into the back entrance of the cowshed, and took the other two off to wait in some room off to the side for a couple hours.\n\nThe stench hit me when we entered the barn. It was nice to be out from the cold and into the heated shed, but god those cows reek. It was noisy, too - constant mooing from what sounded like hundreds of animals.\n\nThey took us to a somewhat secluded area in the back of the barn. We had to remove our shirts, socks, and shoes, but could keep our pants on. They also gave us goggles to wear. Then they re-handcuffed us, and made us sit down with our backs to the wall one by one, about 5 meters apart - very spaced-out. When they got to me, they clipped my handcuffs into a thing on the wall behind my back, cuffed my legs together at the ankles and locked it into a spot on the floor, and also put some sort of restraint around my midsection. I really couldn't move, beyond being able to slightly swivel my head.\n\n**The Mucking**\n\nFinally, they left with us locked in place, and returned in a couple minutes with shovels and a couple large wheelbarrows. One officer started \"mucking\" the man on my left, and the other started on me.\n\nIt was pretty unceremonious - he took a huge shovelful of the manure and dumped it right on my legs/lap. The next shovelful over my chest. Another on my lower half, another on my upper half. I was retching. I'd never smelled anything like this before. And it was all greenish-brown, and I couldn't even tell if it was a solid or a liquid - it was also very hot, and thick and runny. The next couple shovelfuls went over my head and into my face. I couldn't see because they splattered the goggles.\n\nWhen they finished doing that to all 4 of us (which didn't take long), it sounded like they left the barn, and I was left to sit there in misery. And it **was** complete misery. Whatever I expected, this was way, way worse.\n\nFirst of all...no one warned me that this stuff doesn't smell anything like dog poop, or even \"a stronger version\" of dog poop. To me it sort of smelled like awful rancid farts. And it felt like there was practically steam coming off of it. It didn't make it \"painful\" to breathe or feel suffocating like ammonia, but it made breathing incredibly nauseating and unpleasant. Every breath felt like inhaling these hot, wet farts and the air felt so thick with it I could taste it, too. It made me VERY conscious of my breathing pattern, which makes time slow down so much.\n\nThen there was the actual physical...presence of the stuff on me. It's hot, it's wet, it's slimy and dripping and running everywhere. The load dumped on top my my head was constantly dripping and running down into my face, and the stuff on my face was dripping and running down my body, and I couldn't move, so I couldn't do anything to stop it. It's itchy, and irritating, and just a horribly disgusting feeling.\n\nAnd then there's the environment around me...I can't see well, if at all, from the manure-splattered goggles...and all you hear is the constant mooing of cows, and the gagging/retching/groaning from the other offenders around you. Can't see, can't move, can't talk, nothing to do but inhale the stench and think about what I've done, which I guess was the point. I couldn't hold back the vomit for long myself.\n\nThen after some time, it starts to dry on you a little bit, and form kind of a crust. This was no less gross...especially as I heard/felt flies and insects start to swarm around me. With no way to swat them away.\n\n______________\n\nAfter what felt like forever, I heard the officers return with the other two offenders with the 4-hour sentences, and I guess the sight of us must have been horrible to behold, because one of them (I'm guessing it was the woman in her 30s with the tattoos in the car next to me) was saying \"oh my god, no way, I'm sorry, please don't do that to me\" etc. Obviously didn't do her any good. I was just shocked it had only been 2 hours. I didn't think I could make it another 4.\n\nAfter those two were Mucked, I was surprised to have an officer suddenly dry off my goggles with a wash rag so I could see, and ask me if I wanted a drink. Guess they didn't want us to dehydrate from puking. So I let him put a water bottle to my lips and took a couple sips, which felt good. Unfortunately, they then gave me another couple shovelfuls from the wheelbarrow...starting the whole \"oozing and drying\" process over again. This happened once more later on (offering a drink to all 6 of us followed by another couple shovelfuls), at what I can only assume was the 4-hour mark.\n\nFinally at the end, they hosed us all down with cold water for a good 2 minutes each, which was miserable in itself, loaded us back into the cars, and took us back into the city. My mother was (reluctantly) there to pick me up.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nNeedless to say I was exhausted afterwards. My mom had to roll the windows down and looked disgusted the whole ride home, but she said she was glad I was safe.\n\nI spent the next couple days just laying in bed and showering repeatedly. I've tried almost every suggestion you all gave me in the last post, and a lot more, but nothing seems to fully get the smell out. I thought I'd be used to it by now, but even I can still smell it sometimes. Thankfully I think it's getting a little bit better.\n\nIt certainly wasn't worth it, and if getting caught again means substantial jail time and/or an even longer Mucking, I wouldn't risk it even if it's only a 1% chance. I promised myself and my parents I wouldn't steal again. I hope I can keep that promise, and I guess thinking of that awful smell and feel of manure if I ever start feeling \"impulsive\" will hopefully be enough to keep me straight.\n\ntl;dr Got \"mucked\" as a punishment for shoplifting, it was disgusting and miserable, still trying to recover, learned a tough lesson",

A criminal justice system in which the accused can opt for an off the books punishment to escape a trial would go against the very nature of a justice system because it means that the laws are applied unequally on a systemic level. That alone would mean that this system would regularly be subject to the press and public ridicule. \n2. The offenders would be exposed to severe risk for a relatively trivial charge. There's the biological hazard of animal waste (especially on the level that was supposedly applied), and the chemical dangers of exposure to methane etc, and other risks such as dehydration from vomiting, PTSD, etc. Those enforcing the punishment would also be exposed to these risks. \n3. The barn would have to have clips for the people to be restrained into. While it's pretty common for barns to have hooks etc, this story implies that it's a regular thing and has been set up specifically for this. \n4. The farm owner would be subject to all sorts of liability in the event that anyone involved with this became ill. And this much exposure to bare skin will certainly result in illness. That alone would make the farm un-insurable, yet somehow we are expected to believe that a farmer would be willing to risk it? \n5.

    "body": " Warning: Disturbing content\n\nThe first time I did heroin it was an accident. I know, I know. What kind of bullshit junkie lie is that? But seriously, I was drunk at a party. I was a lost 18-year-old kid, and some older guys were sucking smoke off a tinfoil sheet. I thought it was some keef. Pot residue. Something with some THC. I didn‚Äôt even know you could *smoke* heroin. I wanted to balance my drunk and intercepted the sheet. \n\nThe second I inhaled, and I mean the absolute second, I knew I‚Äôd hit something else. My eyes slid back. Something warm rolled out of my lungs and flew through my bloodstream. Boom. I was hooked. I wasn‚Äôt even upset when they told me I just hit heroin. If anything, I was angry that heroin had such a bad rep. Because *this* was fucking incredible.\n\nWell, I figured out why heroin is so bad. It only took about 14 months, thousands of dollars, my relationship with my parents, and three friends overdosing to make the discovery. \n\nAfter one particularly brutal low where I emptied my little sisters‚Äô purse in order to buy a bag, the camera zoomed out, and I saw my pathetic life for what it was. I knew I had to change before I became some street walking zombie. I was still young enough to not just get my shit together but live a totally normal life. I looked up recovery meetings on my phone and set out to go to one the very next night. \n\nI took the bus past the cemetery where I noticed several cop cars were parked at the gates with their lights whirling. It wasn‚Äôt super strange. Our city lacked green space and people used the sprawling cemetery as a park. They jogged, walked their strollers, and even drank where a few picnic tables were set up. Sometimes there was trouble with all the people coming and going there, and by the time I got off the bus my mind was elsewhere.  \n\nI followed my phone to the address and paused outside. My phone had taken me to a blonde brick building. From the looks of it I suppose it was probably once a school. Now, in faded letters stenciled on the brick it read ‚ÄúThe Center for the Road to Recovery‚Äù\n\nI opened the door and went into the hallway. It still smelled like a school, pencil shavings and ammonia cleaner. The lights were on in one of the old classrooms and I peeked in. People were mingling outside a ring of folding chairs. One caught my eye and gave me a wide smile. \n\n‚ÄúHey! Are you here for AA at 8pm?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh, ah... I‚Äôm actually looking for a narcotic anonymous meeting.‚Äù \n\nThe man pointed with the same hand that held a Styrofoam cup. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs down the hall, up the stairs. Room 234.‚Äù \n\nTo be honest I have no idea what he said. It‚Äôs what got me into this mess in the first place. I don‚Äôt remember. I didn‚Äôt exactly understand his directions, and being socially awkward, I didn‚Äôt ask him to repeat himself. I smiled and gave a little wave. \n\nThe building was big, but there couldn‚Äôt be too many meetings to choose from. Every other classroom I walked by was dark. When I reached the staircase, I must‚Äôve blanked and went to third floor, not the second. \n\nWhen I left the stairwell, I noticed the hall lights were off. I saw a closed door at the end of the hallway and its sole window glowed yellow. I walked towards it, my sneakers screeching on the marble every few steps. I thought I heard my footfalls echo behind me, but the cadence was wrong. I spun around and swore I saw a shadow dart into a classroom. \n\nIt could be a hallucination. A trick of the mind. After all, I hadn‚Äôt been high in almost a day and the withdrawals would be starting any time now. Painful, sweaty hell awaited me. \n\nI picked up my pace to the door with the light and as soon as I could see through the glass, I noticed everyone in the room was already staring at me from their folding chairs. Suddenly a face swung in front of the window to inspect me. One eye bulged and looked me up and down. The face disappeared and the door slowly opened. \n\n‚ÄúCan we help you?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ hi, my name‚Äôs Jack, I was told to find by‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúJack!‚Äù I was pulled inside and patted on the back. ‚ÄúOh, you scared me for a second. We don‚Äôt get many visitors to the third floor. You know, your uncle told us to expect you but that was last week, we‚Äôre glad you changed your mind. It‚Äôs not easy to get help. Now, now, don‚Äôt be nervous, we love newcomers. The more of us there are the more normal we feel.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMy uncle?‚Äù I tried to correct him, but the man was too excited to see me. I couldn‚Äôt get a word in. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Marshall,‚Äù he said, pointing at his chest. He reeked of menthol cigarettes and had yellow, jaundiced eyes and gestured a big hand towards the rest of the attendants. \n\n‚ÄúUsually, we‚Äôd do introductions for a newcomer, but we‚Äôre in the middle of something serious. I think you chose a great first meeting to attend. This one‚Äôs about relapse,‚Äù Marshall looked at an older man who held his head in his hands. ‚ÄúHere,‚Äù he pulled another folding chair into the circle and I sat. \n\nI looked left and shared an awkward smile with an older, petite woman. To my right was a fat man with what looked like mud around his mouth. He was breathing heavily, and his eyes were partly closed, like he was trying to ignore some kind of pain. \n\n‚ÄúGary,‚Äù Marshall groaned as he sat. ‚ÄúYou mind continuing?‚Äù \n\nThe older man who had been holding onto his face suddenly sat back straight and wiped his nose. ‚ÄúWell, as I was saying, I thought Greta wasn‚Äôt going to be home until the next day. You know how dangerous that is. No one home. No one to judge. We get the house to ourselves and suddenly all we can think of is getting a fix.‚Äù\n\nThe others around me nodded knowingly and I did, too, to fit in. \n\n‚ÄúWell, I just wanted a fix. A high. You know how it goes. I‚Äôm getting older, and it‚Äôs getting harder to find people to pick up from. But there‚Äôs little in this world that can stop a fiending addict from finding a fix. And the next thing I know I‚Äôm in my living room deep in a bag‚Ä¶\n\nMy wife did get home on time. She wasn‚Äôt even early, that‚Äôs how screwed my sense of time became. She found me all messy in the morning. And she,‚Äù he shook his head and his voice cracked as he began to cry. ‚ÄúShe left me. I was clean for 7 fucking years. One relapse and she left me. She said she couldn‚Äôt live with the fear of having a husband who might always go back to his old habits.‚Äù\n\nI was getting secondhand sadness for this guy; it was miserable to watch but suddenly everything changed. \n\n‚ÄúI mean it was evil. He was so young, but I‚Äôm too old to go after an older boy.‚Äù \n\nI brought my head back in surprise and the people I was seated next turned to look at me. I pretended to act natural. Something felt off about this whole meeting and I had just realized what. There was only one woman, the rest were men, and this entire thing felt‚Ä¶ secretive. Like they were hiding something that could get them in trouble. \n\nI realized I found myself in the middle of a pedophile support group. \n\nMarshall cleared his throat. ‚ÄúNow, Gary, and this goes for you too, Jack, we only use euphemisms here. Refer to the boy like he‚Äôs a drug. Don‚Äôt name names. Don‚Äôt say anything that makes it seem like we‚Äôre anything other than a drug support group. We‚Äôre pretty sequestered up here on the third floor, but you never know who‚Äôs listening.‚Äù\n\nGary nodded and wiped his nose. I tried my best to keep my composure. I needed to do something. I needed to report this meeting. Suddenly the door swung open and the room jolted. \n\nIn the doorway stood a tall, longhaired man. His boots were muddied, and his face displayed a kind of fury. He wore a long trench coat, concealing what I imagined were weapons. Suddenly I feared for my life. I was sure he was some kind of pedo-killing vigilante and he was about to group me in with the rest of them. \n\nHe walked quickly into the circle and grabbed the fat man seated next to me by the neck. ‚ÄúHave you told them!‚Äù the vigilante growled. ‚ÄúHave you even told the group or are you just fucking sitting here with your guilt. I know it was you! They have your description already, you son of a bitch. And you come *here*.‚Äù\n\nThe fat man didn‚Äôt say anything, he just looked sick. Suddenly the vigilante started to violently force his fingers into the fat man‚Äôs throat. The rest of the group began to protest, and Marshall stood up and pulled the vigilante off.  \n\n‚ÄúRon, Ron! None of that here!‚Äù I was somewhat relieved that the man was known by the group but now I was just confused. I thought about using the commotion as an excuse to slip out, but I was too interested. \n\n‚ÄúDo you know what he did?!‚Äù The longhaired man shouted and Marshall shook his head. ‚ÄúA baby, Marshall. In broad daylight. A baby‚Ä¶‚Äù \n\nI thought about the cops I saw at the cemetery earlier and my eyes peeled back in disgust. He‚Äôd abducted a baby‚Ä¶ what kind of monster. But I was missing something. \n\nThe fat man swayed and suddenly a torrent of brown, black vomit spewed from his mouth. My eyes were focused on something pale that sat in the pile, but I couldn‚Äôt believe it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù said the fat man in between dry heaves. ‚ÄúIt was just so fresh. I watched the bulldozer‚Ä¶‚Äù he paused to burp, and my shocked brain finally realized what the pale thing was that sat in his pile of vomit. \n\n‚ÄúBury it. I watched the bulldozer bury it. It was just so fresh, please. A guilt free snack. I‚Äôm sorry. You guys are lucky. I know you guys hate it, but I‚Äôm cursed. I really don‚Äôt mind the taste of embalming fluid.‚Äù\n\nOh, thank god, I thought and wiped my brow. These weren‚Äôt pedophiles, they were cannibals. I stood up, bowed a little and left the room. Everyone was too busy arguing with each other to even notice. \n\nI haven‚Äôt had a hit of heroin in 87 days btw. Pretty rad, whenever I want a hit I just think about the shame of relapse. \n\nHeroin ain‚Äôt that great. Not at all. Getting high again still sounds good sometimes but I just think of that fat cannibal. The shame of his relapse that shined in his eyes as he stared at the little baby leg curled in a pile of his own [vomit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/thespookyplace/)",

    "body": "It didn‚Äôt make sense, the way he was standing there. Just on the other side of the automatic doors, like some kind of cardboard cutout. Standing there waiting, that fuckin‚Äô smile, toothy and wide and unexplainably unrealistic. Eyes an extreme contrast of black and white, looking at me through the glass‚Äì\n\n‚ÄúUh, helloooo?‚Äù The guy at the register snapped, startling me.\n\n‚ÄúGosh, I‚Äôm sorry. What did you want again? The menthol?‚Äù I said, embarrassed. I had been on my way to grab his vape pods when I noticed the guy (thing?) outside. The man sighed exasperatedly, leaning against the counter like I had ruined his night. He was tall and lanky, wearing a tuxedo that seemed to shrink whenever he moved. Dressed like some sort of gentleman, but moved like Jack Skellington.\n\n‚ÄúNo. Virginia tobacco.‚Äù He said impatiently.\n\n‚ÄúSo sorry.‚Äù I grabbed the pods from the shelf and scanned them, unable to help myself from side-eyeing the automatic doors. He was still there.\n\n‚ÄúNineteen, twenty-six. Would you like a bag?‚Äù I asked, and he shook his head while reaching for his wallet.\n\n‚ÄúH-hey, do you see that out there? That guy?‚Äù I whispered, nodding at the automatic doors.\n\nHe inserted his card and raised his eyebrows.\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù He said, annoyed.\n\n‚ÄúOutside. The guy, standing there.‚Äù I motioned to the entrance, at the guy who was very much still there, very much looking like a photoshopped disaster. His eyes were just as menacing as his broad smile, and he was still staring‚Äì\n\n‚ÄúLook lady, I‚Äôm in a hurry. Places to be. Receipt?‚Äù He asked, holding his hand out. He looked at the automatic doors briefly, then back at me.\n\n‚ÄúRight. Sorry, it's my first night.‚Äù I printed the receipt and handed it to him, and he stuffed it into the pocket of his slacks.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing out there.‚Äù was all he said, and walked away.\n\nI leaned over the counter, watching the tall gentleman leave. The automatic doors opened with a *hiss,* giving a plain view to the man lurking outside. I could see him clearer now, a paper copy stuck in time and space. The gentleman paid him no mind, walking past him like there was nothing there. He didn‚Äôt see his intense eyes, didn‚Äôt notice his exaggerated grin. The teeth were long and rectangular, the corners pointed impossibly like a PowerPuff Girl‚Äôs smile. He didn‚Äôt move, didn‚Äôt blink. Kept lurking even as the headlights on the gentleman‚Äôs car passed over him as he drove off into the night. Just standing there. Watching me at the register.\n\nI looked away, pretending he wasn‚Äôt there. I scanned the aisles, looking for someone else, someone who could assure me I wasn‚Äôt crazy. I could see two, and I found comfort in the fact I wasn‚Äôt alone. In the liquor aisle, a bearded man with a ponytail and sunglasses was browsing the whiskey. Two aisles down was my manager, Katherine, who was straightening things up before she left for the night. I tried to motion for her to come over, but she wasn‚Äôt paying attention.\n\nOutside, the cartoon man watched, unmoving.\n\nI looked at the monitor on the counter that displayed the live camera feeds. One view pointed at me, standing behind the counter. Another was at the pharmacy, which was currently closed. The view showed the counter and the dark delivery window. The third view was the liquor aisle, where the bearded man had made his selection. Lastly was the front entrance, where the cartoon man stood. Although on the screen, his toothy face was turned toward the camera.\n\nI looked outside to see he hadn‚Äôt moved at all, he was somehow watching both at once.\n\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the word,‚Äù Said the bearded man, putting a bottle of Woodford Reserve on the counter. He ran a hand over his ponytail and pointed at my nametag, ‚ÄúCool name, like the Disney movie. With the lions.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHeh, thanks,‚Äù I said, but I wasn‚Äôt looking at him anymore, my gaze unintentionally pulled to the entrance of the store, ‚ÄúHey, do you see him out there? The guy. Outside.‚Äù\n\nI scanned the whiskey and put it in a bag, while the bearded man lowered his sunglasses, his slightly glazed eyes looking outside.\n\n‚ÄúI see him.‚Äù He said, and I felt a rush of relief.\n\n‚ÄúOh, great, it‚Äôs not just me‚Äì‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôs coming in. Oh god, he‚Äôs got a knife!‚Äù He said, and I leaned over to look, gripping the counter.\n\nThe cartoon man hadn‚Äôt moved, his blown-up eyes still glued to me.\n\n‚ÄúSorry, couldn‚Äôt resist,‚Äù He chuckled, putting his shades back on ‚Äúseriously though, there‚Äôs nothing out there. Sorry kid. Are you alright?‚Äù He asked.\n\nI rubbed my eyes, a desperate attempt to make him disappear. But the strange cartoon man remained, still watching me through the glass.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. Must be my imagination, I guess.‚Äù I sighed.\n\nThe man paid for his booze and left, approaching the cartoon stalker as he left. I watched him go, and he made a point to look around outside before shrugging and leaving.\n\nI tried not to look. As the seconds crawled I could *feel* him outside, lingering there like an antagonist from a 1930‚Äôs cartoon. Silently watching, begging for my attention. Every customer that came in walked right past him, some of them even *through* him. In the end I couldn‚Äôt help it, and my eyes would wander discreetly to the monitor where he would be waiting.\n\n‚ÄúAlright kid, I‚Äôm finished up. You cool with holding the fort?‚Äù Katherine said, startling me for the second time.\n\n‚ÄúY-yeah. Hey, you ever have any issues here at night?‚Äù I asked awkwardly. To my surprise, she looked nervous.\n\n‚ÄúWhatever do you mean?‚Äù She said, and I could tell she was sweating.\n\n‚ÄúDo you see him? Out there?‚Äù I asked, pointing discreetly.\n\nKatherine didn‚Äôt look. Or blink.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see anything out there dear.‚Äù She kept her eyes on me, and readjusted her purse on her shoulder.\n\nI looked outside, and at the monitor. He *was* still there.\n\n‚ÄúLook, if this is some kind of joke‚Äì‚Äù I started, but Katherine interjected.\n\n‚ÄúThe first night‚Äôs always rough. It‚Äôs weird, working the night shift. But you‚Äôll be fine. It gets easier. Just make sure you‚Äôre ID‚Äôing for alcohol and tobacco sales. And try to keep the area clean.‚Äù Katherine leaned over the counter and inspected my area, her eyes browsing over everything. Everything but the monitor. Once done, she started walking away.\n\n‚ÄúEverything *should* be just fine, dear. As long as you‚Äôre not the only one in the store. Have a goodnight.‚Äù She said, making her way to the door. When they automatically opened, she immediately turned right onto the sidewalk, scrunched up  like she was warding off a winter wind. The cartoon man‚Äôs eyes followed her briefly, before snapping back to me.\n\nI started to sweat. The feeling of being stared at made me uncomfortable. I looked for the other customers, each doing a late night run for something specific. Even though it was after ten, it was still pretty busy. I tried to pay him no mind and focus on work, restocking cigarettes and straightening candy bars in between transactions. I spent more time looking at the people walking in so I knew I wasn‚Äôt alone at least. Each time I started ignoring him, I thought of the smile, and those eyes. When I looked back he would be there. Just when I thought I‚Äôd get used to it, I couldn‚Äôt help but ask the next customer if they saw him.\n\nA tired Mother with the stroller thought I was joking.\n\nA muscular man buying protein powder just shrugged.\n\nThe teenager buying condoms didn‚Äôt even look.\n\nThe man in the Hawaiian shirt asked if I was high.\n\nThe man buying manga books *was* high.\n\nNot a single person could see the cartoon man. I started to think I was crazy, but after a while I started to get used to it. Eventually I stopped looking all together.\n\nBy the time a mustached man came in to buy Guinness, I had stopped asking people if they could see it. I handed him back his change and told him to have a good night. Once I turned to see the next customer, I realized he was the last. From the counter I looked down the aisles, and saw nothing but empty tile and shelves. With nothing else to look at, I found myself looking outside.\n\nThe cartoon man was gone.\n\nA moment later, I heard a crash from the back of the store.\n\nI checked the monitor, to see the delivery window busted, the distorted cartoon man rapidly moving out of frame. I could hear his footsteps, running down the aisles fast and growing louder as they approached. I whipped around to look, just in time to see him duck behind a row out of sight.\n\nHe had gotten inside. I could hear him back there, pacing back and forth.\n\nThe automatic doors opened, and a couple walked in holding hands.\n\nThe footsteps stopped.\n\nI don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre looking for, but I hope it takes them a while to find it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\--AHS](https://www.reddit.com/r/HawaiianShirtFiction/)",

He was nearly twice as tall as a Terran and massed three times as much. His four legs were not only heavily armored by his carapace, but they were strong, with thick and wide foot pads that let him run across sand as fast as some species air-cars could drive. His grip was impressive, his bladearms long and sharp, his intellect was as honed as his natural blades, and his education was expansive.\n\nHe had been educated on Terra, at a prestigious university in the nation of Bongistan.\n\nOnce, he and his Treana'ad frat brothers had watched the fearsome and intimidating changing of the Chromium Queen's Guard, admiring their fierce uniforms, their dominating and aggressive fur hats, their crisp movements, and how nothing seemed to affect them.\n\nAccording to the tour guide, even the attempting glassing of the city by the Mantid had been ignored by the Queen's Guard, the energy of the orbital plasma strikes ignored as inconsequential compare to their duty of keeping the Chromium Queen imprisoned in order to spare the populace her undying wrath.\n\nAfter his education, T'Nok had applied his natural talents and education, working hard to make contacts with people who would not only appreciate his efforts but be able to pay for them.\n\nWithin a few years his work was all the rage. Matrons wealthy and poor sought him out, powerful and meek both.\n\nHe built larvae and egg chambers.\n\nMelding beauty, technology, and science with an eye for the pleasing, his work was appreciated by all. He had even appeared in several magazines and had once been interviewed for \"Classy Matron Today\" and another time \"The Cattle Queen's Digest\" about his methods.\n\nHe kept his bladearms sharp, even had a small bit of work done, so that he could use them in what he considered the most important part of his designs.\n\nHis ability to carve crystal.\n\nHe had spent five years learned about the different kinds of crystal in the universe, how they formed, their appearance, their properties, and how they interacted with their evironmet.\n\nTo T'Nok, a crystal was less inanimate minerals and more a living thing.\n\nHe had even visited several planets where there were crystalline life forms in order to observe them in their natural habitats.\n\nWhich was why the big male Treana'ad was standing in egg and larvae chamber of a wealthy young Cattle Queen, unworried about his head. He had taken proper precautions. He wore his nifty Bongistand University beanie, the propeller on it gently whirring and sparkling, distracting any female from his actual head to the complex pattern the 4D propeller wove on top of the multicolor shifting hat.\n\n\"The bushes are from Leebaw, their complex roots will interweave with one another to form a root wall between the sand of the main part of the chamber and the small creek,\" he pointed out.\n\nThe young female nodded. Her abdomen was swollen with eggs and she felt slightly dreamy. The laying chamber was amazing looking, the air was perfect, with just a hint of cattle's unique scents, the light flowing into a dreamy whole.\n\n\"By the time the larvae hatch, the roots will be intertwined closely enough that you do not have to fear exploring larvae finding the creek and drowning in it.\n\nThere was a chime at the door and the Matron looked slightly put out, almost pouty, as she turned to see who was entering.\n\nA worker caste, wearing her family's colors, stood there. She could see his anxiety and she frowned.\n\n\"Yes, Krikaklat?\" she said, rubbing her wings together in worry.\n\n\"Matron, there are visitors,\" he said.\n\n\"Visitors? But there are no appointments for the rest of the day,\" she said.\n\n\"Uh, they are not here for you, Matron,\" Kriky said. He pointed at T'Nok. \"There are Space Force officers to see the most honorable T'Nok.\"\n\nT'Nok raised his antenna. He could not think of what they would want with him. There had been no conscription, the state of emergency was over, and the closest he had come to the military was designing a contemplation chamber for one of the War Matrons.\n\n\"I do not know what they might wish of me,\" T'Nok said. He turned to the Matron. \"If you will pardon me, I will see what is so important that they would disturb you rather than waiting for our appointment to end.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" the Matron said. She fluttered her wings slightly. \"It is so beautiful in here. I think I shall sit by the stream and watch a Tri-Vid.\"\n\n\"By your leave, Matron,\" T'Nok said. The Matron gave a lazy, sleepy wave, and T'Nok followed the servant.\n\nAt the front gate of the Cattle Queen family manor a gray unmarked wheeled vehicle sat. Grav and hover vehicles were strictly forbidden near the vast cattle ranches, as many believed the noise and vibration could sour the milk. In front of the car were two Mantids in Space Force uniforms, as well as two Treana'ad in the same uniform and what looked to be one of the War Matrons.\n\nWhen he left the estate the War Matron stepped forward.\n\n\"You are T'Nok the Architect?\" she asked, as if her implant would not have informed her.\n\n\"I am,\" T'Nok said. He nodded respectively. \"How may I be of service, War Matron.\"\n\n\"Not here,\" she said. She stared at him. \"The Confederacy and its allies need your expertise.\"\n\n\"Mine? I'm an architect and artist, how can I help?\" he asked.\n\n\"You are the foremost expert of crystalline structures,\" she said. \"I will explain more when we arrive, suffice to say, your skills are needed by Smokey Cone, your people, and the entire Confederacy.\"\n\nT'Nok rubbed his wings together in slight agitation.\n\n\"As long as it has nothing to do with a power rifle, I consent,\" he said.\n\n\"We'd rather a talented and intelligent male did not shoot off his own genitals by accident,\" the War Matron smiled.\n\nT'Nok felt better as he moved over to his rented vehicle. He was started when he saw two Saurian Compact Kobolds standing there, in adapative camouflage with density enhanced padding, both of them carrying a rifle.\n\nThey also had psychic shielding wraps on the back of their head.\n\n\"I take it you will be riding with me?\" T'Nok asked, looking pointedly at the magac rifles they held.\n\nBoth nodded silently.\n\n\"Well, I hope you like High Plains Bandit Rap,\" he said, opening the door to the car.\n\nDuring the drive, as he followed the gray vehicle, the Kobolds stayed silent, watching outside T'Nok's rented car rather than pay attention to what he was doing.\n\nIt had been months, nearly a year, since the last of the Lanaktallan guerrilla forces had been apprehended, and T'Nok felt slightly anxious at what they might be watching for. The silent ride did not help, and eventually T'Nok turned off his music, finding that it was beginning to stress him out more rather than relax him as it should.\n\nHe was taken to a Space Force facility. His car was searched twice, he was searched four times, including an in-depth scan that made his mandibles itch. He was given clothing to wear, and when he changed into it he found that it was designed to not only protect him but to ensure that the security personnel of the facility could keep track of him and his biometrics at all times.\n\nT'Nok felt nervous as he was finally shown into a laboratory deep inside the facility. He knew it was below ground, and that made him slightly nervous. The laboratory also bothered him. It was clean, sterile, and reminded him again of why the Materials Science courses were the hardest part of his studies for him.\n\nThe other thing that bothered him was the sight of the petite Terran females, with brown hair, brown eyes, brown skin, and black suits that stood still at doorways and against the walls of the rooms. There were even two wearing clean suits, their sidearms wrapped in steriplas bags, inside the laboratory staring at everything with cold dead eyes.\n\n\"Honored T'Nok,\" a russet Mantid said, moving forward. She gestured at her collegues, which was an eclectic mix of species. All of them were doctors of science, all of them were undoubtedly experts in the fields.\n\nPhasic energy interactions. Metallurgy. Exotic Matter. Strange Matter. Geology. Mineralogists. Strange Physicists.\n\nHe raised his antenna.\n\n\"I am indeed amid learned company,\" T'Nok said softly.\n\nThat seemed to satisfy everyone present.\n\n\"Are you aware of what is happening in the Confederacy?\" one of the black suited Confederate Security Agents asked.\n\n\"Just that we are at war. The Lanakatallan, who invaded our home system,\" T'Nok gave a shudder. \"That was a terrible month huddling within the shelter unsure of how it was going outside.\"\n\nEveryone looked at each other and there was some murmuring.\n\n\"You don't know?\" A Kobold researcher asked.\n\nT'Nok shook his head. \"I'm a nervous person. The news services make me anxious, so I prefer my solitude and have engrossed myself with my work.\"\n\nA few looked at one another and back to T'Nok.\n\n\"The Terrans are all dead,\" a Treana'ad worker caste with excellent coloring said.\n\nT'Nok reached out and steadied himself against the wall, hyperventilating. \"The Lanaktallan?\"\n\nThe worker, who held three PhD's in scientific disciplines, shook his head. \"We have suspicions, but no. A new species, that had remained hidden.\"\n\n\"But, all of them?\" T'Nok's head was swimming.\n\nAnother Treana'ad moved up and handed him a menthol cherry cigarette. T'Nok puffed on it a minute, trying to banish his anxiety, no, his fear.\n\n\"Virtually. As of today, we know less than two million, outside the primitivism worlds, remain above the age of 25,\" one of the Agents said, her voice dead and inflectionless as she spoke of the near extermination of her species.\n\n\"Surely you didn't bring me here to tell me this terrible news,\" T'Nok said.\n\nThey all shook their heads.\n\nA Treana'ad female, with odd coloring, moved forward. \"You studied mineralogy,\" she stated.\n\n\"Yes, and so did they,\" T'Nok said, pointing at the two others.\n\nThe Confederate Agent stepped forward. \"For your Master's Thesis, you examined phasic interaction with artificial and natural crystalline growth. It was highly contested, but ultimately, your thesis was upheld.\"\n\n\"Yes. That was many years ago,\" T'Nok said.\n\nThe Agent nodded, her eyes still blank of emotion. \"Since then, you have worked for many clients, and several times utilized crystals that altered and adjusted phasic energy flows.\"\n\nT'Nok nodded, feeling confidence come back. \"Phasic energy and certain crystal lattice structures have a harmony and synergy rarely seen in other material. In some ways warsteel and crystalline phasic structures are inextricably linked.\"\n\nOne of the Saurians motioned for T'Nok to follow as he kept speaking.\n\n\"Crystalline structures respond to vibrations in ways that most of what is termed as metals do not,\" T'Nok said. \"As a matter of fact, molecular crystallization theory is what allows warsteel and chromium endosteel as well as durally to be laminated onto other materials.\"\n\nThose who dealt with such things nodded.\n\n\"Many, like myself, believe that vibration is a fundamental underpinning of the cosmos,\" T'Nok said. He stopped and looked around. There were multiple types of crystal in stasis and steri-fields. Some of which he did not recognize.\n\n\"Art Master T'Nok,\" the Treana'ad female said. \"We called you in as you may hold the key to understanding some things.\"\n\nT'Nok stood there as they explained. The new enemy appeared to have an affinity for crystals as well as temporal manipulation and phasic energy. There had been heavy fighting in a system called Hesstla (or maybe that had been the name of the bunny people? Or their star? T'Nok wasn't quite sure) that had resulted in quite a few of the crystals being captured. In the last few weeks more battles had erupted between Confederate Space Force assets and the newcomers, which resulted in more crystals being captured.\n\n\"At an atomic and sub-atomic level they appear the same. There is an odd difference,\" one of the Mantid engineers said through emojis and a translator.\n\nT'Nok looked at one that sat dully beneath the lights. \"This one. May I examine it?\" T'Nok interrupted.\n\nThe crystals had been fascinating, and while T'Nok had paid close attention to what was already known, he had been considering the crystals while the fluff and unimportant (to T'Nok) was blathered on about.\n\nThere was some looks exchanged but the Kobold in charge nodded.\n\nT'Nok removed the crystal with robotic waldoes and moved it to a sampler. He watched closely, with a multispectrum lens, as the warsteel blade began to slice off a wafer.\n\n\"Stop,\" he ordered. He stepped back. \"There's part of the problem.\"\n\nThe other scientists watched as T'Nok withdrew the saw and moved the blade to a scanner. After a minute or two of deep level scanning, T'Nok stepped back and waved at the others to examine it.\n\nThe excited vibration of subatomic particles was less at the edge of the blade then the center, but was rapidly equalizing.\n\n\"I need software and tools fabricated,\" T'Nok said. He cocked his head slightly. \"Let's try the old Terran favorite of case hardened surgical steel with diamond doping for the blade.\"\n\nIt took a minute for it to be fabricated, and T'Nok started again. He stopped, went over, and made more adjustments to the fabricator.\n\nThe scientists watched.\n\n\\-----------------\n\nIt had been nearly a month and T'Nok sighed as he settled into the chair. He was glad that Smokey Cone Intelligence had requested one of the more powerful Matrons soothe the ruffled wings of the Matrons whose appointments he had been forced to reschedule.\n\nHe watched as Space Force Intelligence, Confederate Logistics and Procurement, and Mantid Phasic Energy Technicians all filed in.\n\nIt had been a lot of work, done in fits and starts.\n\nIt had stretched T'Nok's knowledge and imagination.\n\nBut he had the data now.\n\nTo be perfectly honest with himself, he would have rather been working on designing grub hatcheries.\n\nFinally the audience was ready.\n\nT'Nok launched into a lecture of how crystals were vital to modern technology. From molecular circuitry to picobots to starship drives to high capacity holographic memory systems, crystals were integral to it all. He pointed out that Terran technology, indeed, every allied race, depended on crystalline substances for much of their technology.\n\nFrom there, he moved onto the primary subject.\n\nThe crystals recovered on Hesstla and other places.\n\n\"As you see, cutting with the standard blades, even lasers, altered the potential energy of each atomic particle. The crystalline structure absorbed vibrational charge, which made the early examinations and estimations all flawed science,\" T'Nok said. \"Using strange matter carbon lattice cutters, I managed to remove several pieces of the crystal and examine them.\"\n\nHe looked over the crowd. \"The darker crystals, while recovered on Hesstla and resembling the later crystals, are *not* the same. Atomic and subatomic weight and makeup are the same,\" he said. He gave a stern look. \"What is *not* the same is that the matter is, to use a term, exhausted. Tachyon movement within the electron is minimal, just as one example.\"\n\nHe clicked through. \"These crystals were manufactured in low gravity environments, but not on low gravity planets,\" he said. \"They were grown in orbital facilities,\" he looked stern again. \"Grown somewhere outside of this universe.\"\n\nHe tabbed to the next slide. \"The Terran Third Dimensional War gave the data to positively identify those crystals outside of our cosmos, our universe.\"\n\n\"The Atrekna are not from our universe, but from one where matter, energy, even chronotrons are exhausted and nearly spent,\" he said.\n\n\"Like a dying universe? One dying of entropy?\" one member of the audience asked.\n\n\"More like, dead,\" T'Nok said. \"From my point of view, the universe that the crystals were from is long dead.\"\n\nHe turned and brought up another slide. \"These crystals, while atomically the same, are energized much the same as our universe's matter,\" he said. \"These crystals were grown in our universe.\"\n\nHe stared at one of the Space Force officers with a lot of shiny braid and a nifty hat.\n\n\"The enemy has established bases and manufacturing facilities in this universe,\" T'Nok said. He shook his head. \"But that's not why you brought me in, and I could be wrong, but I'm not.\"\n\nHe triggered another slide. \"As you know, crystals, including picocrystals, are used in phasic technologies, from psychic shielding and beyond.\"\n\nHe triggered another one. \"These crystals here, which we have the most abundance of, are designed to actually store phasic energy for later use. They are detectable on phasic frequencies quite easily and at quite a distance. They are present in nearly all Atrekna technology.\"\n\nHe continued on. What environments each type of crystal could be grown in. What type of facility it would take to grow those crystals. Possible uses. Vibration frequency and atomic lattice patterning. How it interacted with currently researched phasic materials. How some of the crystals were used in weapons to amplify and focus the phasic components.\n\nFinally, T'Nok was done with his lecture. He stepped back. \"My data will be fully available to all of you.\"\n\nT'Nok hoped that he had not wasted everyone's time as he left the stage. Another scientist was taking over, going over the crystal interactions, as T'Nok left the auditorium.\n\nOne of the Confederate Agents were there, her expression and eyes unreadable.\n\n\"You may return to your life now, should you wish,\" she said, her voice emotionless.\n\n\"I would like that very much,\" T'Nok admitted.\n\nHe followed her out, getting in the ground car with her. They rode in silence to his domicile and studio.\n\nT'Nok felt great relief as the Agent parked the car. As he got out she called his name.\n\n\"You should know, and I may tell you,\" she said, her eyes suddenly no longer dead, but full of passion and conviction.\n\nT'Nok managed not to step back in fear.\n\n\"What you have done here will have far more reaching consequences in defeating the Atrekna than anything you could have ever done with a rifle,\" she said.\n\nShe rolled up the window, put the car in gear, and drove away.\n\nT'Nok rubbed his wings together in agitation as he went back into his house.\n\nHe had nearly two thousand messages.

He wore his nifty Bongistand University beanie, the propeller on it gently whirring and sparkling, distracting any female from his actual head to the complex pattern the 4D propeller wove on top of the multicolor shifting hat.\n\nOh, god. A 4D propeller beanie, used as a means of self-protection. That‚Äôs ridiculous and hilarious. I love it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The young female nodded. Her abdomen was swollen with eggs and she felt slightly dreamy. The laying chamber was amazing looking, the air was perfect, with just a hint of cattle's unique scents, the light flowing into a dreamy whole.\n\nIt just goes to show how deeply cattle have been interwoven with Treana‚Äôad society that they consider the smell of cows to be a *good* thing in a nursery.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"Uh, they are not here for you, Matron,\" Kriky said. He pointed at T'Nok. \"There are Space Force officers to see the most honorable T'Nok.\"\n\nWell, that‚Äôs not ominous at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Grav and hover vehicles were strictly forbidden near the vast cattle ranches, as many believed the noise and vibration could sour the milk. \n\nWell, I gotta say, they do treat every aspect of ice cream manufacture with a near-religious respect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"You are the foremost expert of crystalline structures,\" she said. \"I will explain more when we arrive, suffice to say, your skills are needed by Smokey Cone, your people, and the entire Confederacy.\"  \n>  \n>T'Nok rubbed his wings together in slight agitation.  \n>  \n>\"As long as it has nothing to do with a power rifle, I consent,\" he said.  \n>  \n>\"We'd rather a talented and intelligent male did not shoot off his own genitals by accident,\" the War Matron smiled.\n\nThey are both entirely realistic about his (lack of) martial skills.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He was started when he saw two Saurian Compact Kobolds standing there, in adapative camouflage with density enhanced padding, both of them carrying a rifle.\n\nThey probably just faded into view, just to mess with him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"I take it you will be riding with me?\" T'Nok asked, looking pointedly at the magac rifles they held.  \n>  \n>Both nodded silently.  \n>  \n>\"Well, I hope you like High Plains Bandit Rap,\" he said, opening the door to the car.\n\n‚ÄúBetter than being shot at.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>His car was searched twice, he was searched four times, including an in-depth scan that made his mandibles itch.  \n>  \n>They‚Äôre really, *really* concerned about security.\n\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been searched already.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNot by me, he hasn‚Äôt.‚Äù\n\nRubber glove <snap>\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He was given clothing to wear, and when he changed into it he found that it was designed to not only protect him but to ensure that the security personnel of the facility could keep track of him and his biometrics at all times.\n\nNot in the slightest bit surprised.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The other thing that bothered him was the sight of the petite Terran females, with brown hair, brown eyes, brown skin, and black suits that stood still at doorways and against the walls of the rooms. There were even two wearing clean suits, their sidearms wrapped in steriplas bags, inside the laboratory staring at everything with cold dead eyes.\n\nOh, shit. These ones. They‚Äôre creepy af.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"The Terrans are all dead,\" a Treana'ad worker caste with excellent coloring said.\n\nI think it‚Äôs funny that he‚Äôs effectively a really eclectic interior decorator, so he‚Äôs fixating on the colouration of his fellow Treana‚Äôad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Another Treana'ad moved up and handed him a menthol cherry cigarette. T'Nok puffed on it a minute, trying to banish his anxiety, no, his fear.\n\nNice cultural moment, there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>T'Nok nodded, feeling confidence come back. \"Phasic energy and certain crystal lattice structures have a harmony and synergy rarely seen in other material. In some ways warsteel and crystalline phasic structures are inextricably linked.\"\n\nHmm. That‚Äôs interesting. It‚Äôs probably why warsteel reacts to emotion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>There had been heavy fighting in a system called Hesstla (or maybe that had been the name of the bunny people? Or their star? T'Nok wasn't quite sure)\n\nNobody is. Not even them ...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>T'Nok looked at one that sat dully beneath the lights. \"This one. May I examine it?\" T'Nok interrupted.  \n>  \n>The crystals had been fascinating, and while T'Nok had paid close attention to what was already known, he had been considering the crystals while the fluff and unimportant (to T'Nok) was blathered on about.\n\n‚ÄúOkay, enough talk. Time to do.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"Stop,\" he ordered. He stepped back. \"There's part of the problem.\"  \n>  \n>The other scientists watched as T'Nok withdrew the saw and moved the blade to a scanner. After a minute or two of deep level scanning, T'Nok stepped back and waved at the others to examine it.  \n>  \n>The excited vibration of subatomic particles was less at the edge of the blade then the center, but was rapidly equalizing.\n\nAnd the expert gets to work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"Let's try the old Terran favorite of case hardened surgical steel with diamond doping for the blade.\"  \n>  \n>It took a minute for it to be fabricated\n\nLove it. ‚ÄúI need this exotic tool.‚Äù Fire up the nanoforge.\n\n(Continued)",

As large as a Terran warborg at just over three meters, his blade arms were thick and highly honed, his gripping hands were strong, and his legs were thick and powerful. Before the P'Thok Liberation he would have undoubtedly been eaten during his first mating, his coloration and physique and intellect making him highly desirable. His cranium was well developed and his school scores put him at the top of his classes. The tattoo on his abdomen from the Bongistan University of Lumbering Meat Beast Ford was a source of pride for him and his sash proclaimed to every female and male who saw him that he was not only a prime physical specimen but his intellect made him highly desirable. The fact that he was a reknown crysteel architect made him wealthy and highly sought after to grow the elaborate living crystal domiciles the higher caste females so preferred. More than a females would see him and clean their bladearms while they stared at him.\n\nWhich was why he was glad that birth control and ice cream was a thing. He liked his head.\n\nHe had been designing a particularly challenging birthing chamber for a shipping company matron and decided to go out and enjoy a bowl of ice cream, perhaps even a banana split, to relax and sweep load bearing computations from his mind. On the trip in his comfortable travel-disc he loaded his favorite game and spent time arranging coins just right for a virtual Terran monkey to grab as it bounced off of walls and objects. It helped discharge the formula from his datalink implant and reset his nervous system.\n\nThe ice cream parlor that he preferred was high end and upscale. The bench seats were made of red dyed animal skins in an arcane process that produced soft but firm red leather. All of the edges of surfaces were made of chrome. Each table had a delightful radio that ensured that those sitting at the booths could listen to old style Treana'ad music as the waitresses, wearing large wigs and elaborate white costumes, would roll around on the skates on all four of their legs. He liked the coloration of the ice cream artist working that day, her skill with carving ice cream floats with her sterilized bladearms made him hum in satisfaction.\n\nThe sight of the backdrop, showing a Treana'ad on a long board, balancing with an ice cream cone in one hand and a cigarette on the other, as he used the board to skim along the inside of an ocean wave, reminded him that he was going to go foot-disc or foot-board surfing with some friends next week. He double-checked his implant to make sure the appointment was locked in. His friends had all certified their RSVP's and while he waited for the waitress he made sure to order high quality bonfire wood, special order ice cream, and actual Terran Dark Continent Wonderbeast steaks to cook over the open flame.\n\nThe waitress took his order, a rainbow tower of sherbet, left him a complimentary cigarette and book of matches, and skated away, tapping her bladearms together in tune with the jaunty song that was playing.\n\n\"Hey, T'Nok,\" came a voice.\n\n*Crap, it's J'Vik,* T'Nok thought to himself. He found the other Treana'ad somewhat boorish, with poor taste in ice-cream and worse taste in poetry that he tried to inflict upon everyone around him. The problem was, like T'Nok, J'Vik was warrior-caste born, which meant that T'Nok had to be at least polite to him in public. Only J'Vik fancied himself a 'warrior poet' and suffered a fundamental misunderstanding of what that actually meant.\n\nT'Nok looked up and saw that J'Vik was wearing a beatnik on his head. One of those flattened hats the humans called berets. Which T'Nok thought was funny, since the phonetic sounds of 'beret' meant 'delicious looking' in his native language.\n\n*Only J'Vik would walk around proclaiming that his head looked delicious with his hat,* T'Nok mused, managing to keep from laughing by lighting a cigarette.\n\nThe other male sat down and T'Nok made a mental bet with himself that the other male would try to stick T'Nok with the tab.\n\n\"Did you hear the news? Everyone is talking about it,\" J'Vik said, completely unaware of the three barely mature females in the next booth over snickering about his hat and wondering if his head was as delicious as J'Vik was claiming. All three of them had the shiny carapaces of someone who had molted within the last week.\n\nTwo of them were wondering if they should lure the 'warrior poet' back to their nests, share him, and then discuss on the satisfaction they got from the taste, consistency, and volume of J'Vik's head.\n\nT'Nok calmed his anxiety over the three females, who would undoubtedly eat a male's head, birth control or no birth control, just because their just matured primal instinct told them too, and enjoy a nice bowl of chocolate fudge cheesecake ripple afterwards.\n\nBarely mature females were dangerous, everyone knew that, but there was always 'That Guy' who thought that his head was armor plated.\n\nAll of his life T'Nok had been careful not to be 'That Guy'. He'd known a few.\n\nJ'Vik definitely fell in the \"That Guy\" category.\n\n\"I have been busy with my work. My client is most eager for me to complete my work,\" T'Nok said, exhaling smoke through his forward legs.\n\n\"Got a smoke?\" J'Vik asked.\n\n\"Alas, I did not bring a pack along. Perhaps when you order?\" T'Nok said.\n\n\"Here, I have one,\" one of the females said, leaning over the back of the bench and offering a menthol cigarette. \"You can have it,\" she said, staring at J'Vik's beatnik.\n\nThe other two slowly cleaned their bladearms with their mandibles, their compound eyes sparkling as they watched their friend offer the cigarette.\n\n\"Thank you, pretty,\" J'Vik said, fluttering his antenna at the female.\n\nShe turned around with a titter and rubbing her wings together, looking smugly at her two companions, as J'Vik lit the menthol.\n\n*Don't be That Guy,* T'Nok thought to himself.\n\n\"I'm surprised you didn't hear. It's pretty big news, especially for your caste,\" J'Vik said somewhat smugly.\n\n\"You are too concerned with castes,\" T'Nok said, shaking his head. \"We are free of castes.\"\n\n\"Mm-hmm,' J'Vik said, making T'Nok want to roll his eyes but his eyes weren't designed in such a way. \"Easy for you to say.\"\n\nJ'Vik preened for a moment.\n\n*Oh, warrior, who has everything he pleases*\n\n*Cannot I have a bowl that you have not cleaned*\n\n*For I am but a worker*\n\n*In this society of ours*\n\nJ'Vik said. He preened for a moment, ignorant of the giggling of the three females and the flat out laughter from two matrons watching over a clutch of a dozen little hatchlings.\n\n\"I wrote that,\" J'Vik said.\n\n\"You're not worker caste,\" T'Nok reminded him.\n\n\"Poetry transcends caste,\" J'Vik said, smugly cleaning his antenna with his bladearms.\n\nT'Nok tapped his bladearms in a shrug. \"I am not one for poetry,\" T'Nok said. Not quite true, he quite enjoyed Hard Core Rigellian Saurian Gangster Rap. He particularly enjoyed the recent poetry-song 'I got yer eggs right here, suckah' by the Big Tail Ganstas.\n\n\"You caste often is not,\" J'Vik said. \"Still, I would have thought that you would be excited by the news.\"\n\nT'Nok gave a sigh. \"What news?\"\n\n\"The Confederacy voted to go to war this morning,\" J'Vik said, excitement in his voice.\n\nT'Nok froze. He had to close his opaque eye-shields for moment as the horror rolled through his mind. History requirements in school had ensured he'd been exposed to plenty of media he would have preferred to avoid.\n\n*Only someone like J'Vik would be happy that uncounted sentient beings will kill each other,* he thought to himself.\n\n\"You're excited, I can tell,\" J'Vik said. \"I knew that news would speak to you and excite you.\"\n\n\"Have you ever been to TerraSol?\" T'Nok asked carefully. He signalled one of the waitresses to bring him a pack of smokes, changed his mind, and asked for a powersmoker, a 'vape' as the humans called it along with a swamp-apple flavored cartridge.\n\nJ'Vik gripped his hands together in a frown. \"Why? Oh, because the Terrans will undoubtedly be fighting in the war?\"\n\nT'Nok had to resist the urge to hold the smaller male down and allow the three females to eat his head.\n\n\"I take it you'll be signing up right away?\" J'Vik asked.\n\nT'Nok managed not to sigh, turning and thanking the waitress for the power-smoker and tipping her a handful of credits for her ability not to snicker at J'Vik's beatnik.\n\n\"Why would I do that? I don't know one end of a power-rifle from the other,\" T'Nok said, shrugging again. \"I'm sure the Confederate Military can get along just find without me dropping my rifle and accidentally shooting off my own genitals.\"\n\nThat made the three girls snicker as they slowly cleaned/sharpened their bladearms, still staring at J'Vik's hat.\n\n\"But the Confederacy is going to war,\" J'Vik actually sounded confused that T'Nok hadn't jumped up, ran out into the parking lot, and immediately fired off a power-rifle into the air.\n\n\"Which is a profession and activity best left to skilled professionals,\" T'Nok shrugged. \"The closest I've been to warfare is I watched the episode of The Nitrogen Seven when they robbed the Terran Army base only to discover that they'd just stolen a bunch of Terran pornographic magazines instead of the Commander's secret ice cream recipe, and that series is a Tri-Vid comedy.\"\n\n\"Well,\" J'Vik preened with smugness for a moment. \"I heard they're going to start a draft. I'm sure such a prime specimen of the warrior caste such as yourself will be right at the top of the list.\"\n\nT'Nok shook his head. \"A draft is as likely as,\" he stopped himself from saying 'You writing decent poetry' and instead got out \"the Digital Omnimessiah appearing in the bathroom to bless the faucets.\"\n\nThe females giggled to each other.\n\n\"It's all the talk on the Net Boards,\" J'Vik said.\n\n\"I would suggest not spending so much time on the Boards,\" T'Nok scoffed. \"Just last week you were telling me that there was going to be a chocolate shortage by now, but here we are and the prices are the same.\"\n\n\"Peak chocolate is real,\" J'Vik said, straightening up, his wings rubbing in anxiety.\n\n\"Pfft, you sound like a Precursor,\" T'Nok said. \"There is only enough chocolate for me.\"\n\nThe girls snickered again.\n\n\"Well, of course, you wouldn't notice any shortages. Your caste never does,\" J'Vik said.\n\nT'Nok took a long pull off of the power-smoker and exhaled through his legs, feeling irritation rise up.\n\n*If we were still having castes, I'd tear your bladearms off by now,* he thought to himself. *No, not my education, not my years of study and hard work even sacrificing social gatherings, but no, it's all my caste, all my coloration and size. It doesn't even matter we're the same caste to you.*\n\n\"Hmmph, you're feeling annoyed because you know I'm right,\" J'Vik said, his antenna flicking with smug assurance.\n\n\"You realize you're warrior caste too,\" T'Nok pointed out. He didn't point out that J'Vik would have been eaten as a hatchling if the caste system was still in place.\n\nJ'Vik might have been warrior caste but his coloration was poor, he was small for a male, and his vestigial wings were off pitch when he rubbed them. Worse than that, his poetry was execrable and he had put off education to create poetry and live off of his parent's wealth.\n\nThat made J'Vik sit quietly for a moment. The waitress came by and J'Vik ordered a triple chocolate destructor bomb with double-fudge.\n\nShe didn't leave a complimentary cigarette and T'Nok almost busted out laughing.\n\n\"When are you signing up for the war?\" J'Vik said once both of their ice cream had been delivered. The three barely mature females had ordered half-bowls and were giggled to each other, still eyeing J'Vik's head. J'Vik, of course, started eating his ice cream like it was going to vanish while T'Nok savored his, letting it partially melt and mix properly.\n\n\"Never. Me joining the military would be suspected of an enemy plot,\" T'Nok answered. \"I would be so incompetent as a warrior they would suspect me to be an enemy agent.\"\n\n\"I figured you'd be braver,\" J'Vik said, pushing his empty bowl away. \"Where's your caste pride?\"\n\n*That* made T'Nok sit up straight, reaching for the power-smoker to mask his pheromones of anger. \"Don't go there, J'Vik. You and I are the same birth-caste, but that does not give you the right to insult me.\"\n\n\"Insult is never given only taken,\" J'Vik quoted, sounding smug. \"I thought a prime example of the warrior caste such as yourself would be more inured against perceived insults.\"\n\n*Really? Quoting Terran stoicism at me? Well, let's see about that. I've about had it with your subtle insults,* T'Nok thought, not bothering to pick up the power-smoker in order to let the other male realize how angry T'Nok was.\n\n\"J'Vik, if you feel your ability to attract mates is so threatened by my very existence to the point of attempting to goad me into joining a profession I would be incompetent at, in hopes I would be killed in some far off struggle, then perhaps you should attempt to reconcile that with the obvious issue that you are too cowardly to sign up to go to war despite being warrior caste yourself,\" T'Nok said, tapping the edge of his spoon on the bowl.\n\nEvery female in the ice cream parlor, even the waitresses, burst out laughing. The high pitched squeals, the humming of wings, even the chirping of matrons rubbing their back legs together filled the parlor.\n\nJ'Vik went completely still.\n\n*Finish him!* T'Nok heard in his mind and he tapped his ice cream bowl with a bladearm tip making it ring as he continued speaking, delivering the final bladearm thrust.\n\n\"I'm sure if the enemy attacks you can drive them off with that detestable whining you insist is poetry that you instead inflict upon us all every time you see another male that appears to be content with his own life due to the glorious fact that he is not you,\" T'Nok finished.\n\nEven the other males joined in with the laughter.\n\n\"Ice pack for table nine to treat that burn!\" A male called out.\n\n\"Confederate statutes don't allow you to own someone like that!\" a female laughed.\n\n\"Quick, molt your shell and run off before he realizes your husk isn't you!\" another female giggled.\n\nSomeone threw the image of J'Vik up on the ice cream parlor's display with the caption \"LOCAL MALE MURDERED BY WORDS\" underneath. The image of J'Vik looked up as a shadow covered him just in time to be crushed by the words \"U R PO-EHT!\"\n\nJ'Vik didn't move the entire time, pheromones of anger rolling off of him.\n\nThe three barely mature females sniffed the air and perked up, clicking their mandibles and rubbing their bladearms together in excitement. One dipped the tip of her bladearm in the ice cream in front of her and carefully cleaned it as she stared at J'Vik's head.\n\nWhen the laughter died J'Vik slowly looked around, then back at T'Nok.\n\n\"You're caste...\" he started loudly.\n\n\"We're the same birth-caste, J'Vik,\" T'Nok answered slightly louder. T'Nok held up his gripping hands and flexed his fingers.\n\n\"Insult is only taken never given,\" T'Nok quoted back.\n\n\"How dare you insult me in such a manner,\" J'Vik said. \"That quote is not meant for someone intentionally insulting someone the way you have.\"\n\n\"Put up,\" T'Nok said, raising his gripping hands and flexed his fingers. He flexed his wrists. \"Or shut up,\" T'Nok finished.\n\nJ'Vik clattered out of the booth. \"A Gripping Hand Challenge it is, then, T'Nok. In the parking lot. Right now.\"\n\n\"Traditionally I would choose the location,\" T'Nok said, moving out of the bench seat. \"But that's fine with me.\"\n\nJ'Vik was opening and closing his gripping hands, obviously trying to impress everyone with his grip.\n\nThe matrons, mature females, and the three just mature females all hurried out of the ice-cream parlor with almost unseemly haste. The mixing of anger pheromones of two males making the veins in their wings flush with blood.\n\nEven the waitresses and ice cream sculptors came out.\n\nThe males of course, hung back. Not wanting to get involved.\n\nA matron, a half-dozen small hatchlings hanging on her abdomen, moved forward with grace and elegance. She sniffed at the air, tasting the anger pheromones in the air.\n\n\"Can this only be settled by challenge and not a cigarette and conversation?\" She asked. \"Perhaps a cigarette or two will mask the scent of your anger and allow you to discuss your emotions with more cultural maturity than you are feeling now?\"\n\n\"If J'Vik wishes to submit I will accept,\" T'Nok said, looming over the smaller warrior-caste male.\n\nSeveral of the females breathed deep.\n\n*\"Insulted I have been*\n\n*\"Words cutting most cruel*\n\n*\"I will not remain*\n\n*\"Insulted without response,\"* J'Vik quoted poetry that made several of the females snicker. He looked around almost smugly. \"I created that.\"\n\nMore giggles and J'Vik went rigid.\n\n\"Gripping hand challenge it is,\" the matron said. The little ones one her back raised up their bladearms in joy, their immature minds reacting to the angry pheromones in the air.\n\nOne had ice-cream on his head, between his eyes.\n\nT'Nok held still as J'Vik moved into position. They locked hands, interlacing fingers. Their bladearms clashed, held away from each other's bodies and pointed away from one another.\n\nThe matron lifted up a handkerchief and waved it between the two males.\n\nSeveral cars had stopped to watch. Challenges were exciting to witness. They were less common over the last few centuries, but still occured with enough frequency that they could not be outlawed.\n\nThe handkerchief fell from her hand and danced away on the breeze. The larger of the three just-mature females hurried over and picked it up, bringing it to her face and inhaling deeply as she moved back over to her friends and passed it to the next biggest one.\n\nT'Nok didn't notice. He just locked his wrists and tensed his fingers as he pushed out and down with his bladearms.\n\n*You're grip is nothing. I used to play this with my drunk frat-brothers in Bongistan,* T'Nok thought to himself as the other male squeezed tightly, attempted to twist T'Nok's wrists backward, and pushed ineffectively with his bladearms.\n\nGetting a Doctorate in Architectural Engineering with a minor in Materials Science had required over a decade of study, and during that time T'Nok had tempered his natural aggressiveness by socializing with his Terran Descent Human school mates.\n\nA matron tittered as J'Vik had to open his wings slightly to breathe as he kept struggling to move T'Nok's wrists or bladearms.\n\n\"Yield,\" T'Nok ordered. The sun was shimmering down, warming him, and the sweetness of the day's nitrogen level gave him strength.\n\n\"No,\" J'Vik's feet ground against the tarmac as he attempted to lean into the gripping contest. The way his back feet scrabbled on the pavement made several females giggle and the smell of his anger increased.\n\nT'Nok began to bring his hands forward, squeezing tightly.\n\nHe knew that J'Vik had figured that T'Nok's grip would be weak, that T'Nok spent his days working with architecture and computer programs.\n\nT'Nok also shaped the crystal of his creations with his own hands rather than robots. The tiny imperfections is what gave his works their beauty.\n\nJ'Vik's hands began to bend back and his bladearms were forced down and outward to the point of pain and still T'Nok just stared at the other male as he increased the pressure.\n\nJ'Vik's legs gave out and he crashed to the ground, giving a high keen of pain. T'Nok released his hands and stepped back as J'Vik moaned and lifted his hands and arms protectively against his thorax. The thick sour smell of defeat emanated from defeated male.\n\nThe matron stepped forward, an ornate and bejeweled power-smoker held up to her mandibles with one beringed hand as she inhaled deeply and expelled smoke from her legs and abdomen. The smoke covered the two males, wiping away the smell of anger, contention, and defeat.\n\n\"Thank you, your grace,\" T'Nok told the wealthy matron.\n\n\"Of course,\" she replied. The little ones on her abdomen raised their bladearms and gave small shrieks of victory to him.\n\n\"And thank you, little ones,\" T'Nok said.\n\nThe three just matured females, their just-molted carapaces shining and glittering in the sun, rushed forward to comfort J'Vik.\n\nThe gathered Treana'ad moved back into the ice cream parlor, gossiping about what they'd just seen, many of them showing one another the recordings they'd made of the contest, admiring one another's angles or artistic filters.\n\nT'Nok was thinking. He had been struggling with nitrogen release in the garden of the birthing chamber. Enough to encourage the eggs to hatch and the grubs to mature, but not exposing it to the air or depend too much on computerized systems.\n\n*Tantervellian ferns. They uptake, fix, and release nitrogen on a steady pattern,* he mused as he returned to his table.\n\nThe ice cream parlor's central air system had cleared away the heavy pheromones of anger and T'Nok sat down, moving  the holo-emitter from next to the radio to the center of the table. He transferred his planning file to the holo-emitter and idly moved things around with one bladearm as he slowly ate and savored his ice cream.\n\nJ'Vik left with the three females, who were comforting and praising him. One of them had a fancy hover-disc, painted bright attention getting hyper-blue with ultra-violet accents. All four of them sat on the comfortable seats and the bigger female activated the privacy screen as the hover-disc floated away.\n\nPaying attention to his work, T'Nok didn't notice J'Vik leaving or the interested looks from the females. He went through another bowl before he was finished, leaning back and looking at the chamber. The ferns provided just the right edging. The grubs, which would burrow under the ground and eat roots, would avoid the ferns due to dirt, sticking to the sand of the middle of the chamber.\n\nIt would give the chamber the right nitrogen cycle in the right levels without requiring HVAC systems that the matron was concerned might harm her grubs.\n\nOn the way home, relaxing in his hover-disc, one of the public warning billboards caught his eye.\n\nJ'Vik was featured prominently.\n\nBelow him a scrolling banner read: \"UNCONTROLLED EMOTIONS KILL! DON'T LOSE YOUR HEAD LIKE HE DID! 836 LOST IN THIS CITY THIS WEEK ALONE! SMOKING SAVES LIVES!\"\n\nRight as he passed the huge sign a stamp appeared across J'Vik.\n\n\"DON'T BE THAT GUY!\"\n\nT'Nok laughed all the way home.\n\n\\[[first](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/f94rak/oc_pthok_eats_an_ice_cream_cone/)\\] \\[[prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/gkmwf5/first_contact_second_wave_chapter_176/)\\] \\[[next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/gmf8cq/first_contact_second_wave_chapter_178/)\\]",

They calmed me down, gave me instructions to blot her mouth and smell her mouth. They told me what to watch for. Luckily the product was essentially Vaseline with essential oils and menthol. The told me when to seek medical help. \n\nPoison control is wonderful, I don't care what political meaning you have but it certainly calmed this man who is known as a angry grump at work.

I ended up going to therapy to work through that one. Felt like I should have been able to prevent it. I still have some PTSD around it. Thank god PC, they were calm and helped me figure out what to do (was easy, drive to nearest children's ED).\n\nOne thing that still bothers me about that incident, I looked up PC info and was able to find a more recent best practice for treatment--was ignored by the doctors because I'm not doctor. Finally advocated through the nurse and he got the subdermal med that reduces the hospital stay significantly. Basically something that counteracts the effects of the diabetic medication.\n\nSecond time, same kid, just finished moving to a new house.

They are not your nostrils: when you have a stuffy nose that's, well, your nose. If you have sinus issues, that's a separate thing; they are basically hollow spaces in your facial bones. They are lined with epithelium which can become swollen, and they can fill with fluid - these are sinus problems, specifically.\n\nI know nothing about whether any of these substances affects sinuses.\n\nHowever, I do know that they do affect your nasal passages, so the top-voted comment which says they don't is wrong (even though it's talking about sinuses as well as the nose). Menthol in particular is *vasoactive* and, in the nose, it acts as a vasoconstrictor. (Presumably the cold receptors are acting as they would if they detected actual cold - but this is complicated. [Read more here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7154148/)) Your stuffy nose is primarily the result of your nasal lining swelling. With the blood vessels constricted, the swelling decreases and more air can pass through your nose, so you can breathe more easily. This is why menthol is an active ingredient in some decongestants.",

And, for the first time in fifteen years, the museum‚Äôs phone rang*.\n\n[(PART 3/5)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/l6jpri/i_work_at_a_private_museum_for_the_rich_and/) *I received a terrible punishment from the museum's curator that left me with a lasting, burning bitterness.*\n\n_____\n\n\nThere were two unopened doors at the museum that had always haunted me since I started: The first being the locked steel door I had passed countless times at the museum yet remained locked and never accessible - a peculiar haunting that amounted from itching curiosity. It had been swimming around in my mind since that young girl visited the museum a few weeks ago and her curiosity prodded away at its potential. Secondly, and more horrifyingly, was the shut doorway to Johnny Razortongue‚Äôs display, the only exhibition I never entered out of unadulterated fear.\n\nJohnny Razortongue is to blame as to why Mariette, the previous guide - the one that walked the museum‚Äôs halls before me, went mad. It has been said that his plastic ventriloquist-dummy tongue only speaks in mind-shattering truths or lethal lies. He chooses either truth or lie based on whatever brings him the most entertainment at the time from his deprived, sealed exhibition-cell in the corner of our paranormal wing. His disturbed mind knows only disarray, and it thrives in all manners of consequences from his cruelty. Mariette knew this all too well. The dummy poured pestilence into her ear from the moment she visited him, contorting and twisting her once fortified mind like molten glass under his heated will. And so, Mariette‚Äôs ill-fated psyche bent. It bent and bent until Mariette was no more, until all that remained of the old guide was her doll-like shell after she gave in to Johnny‚Äôs razor tongue. After she believed his lies, after she injected herself with plastic to become a ventriloquist dummy, just like him. After she decided to please the museum and to please Johnny, nothing remained but her tortured soul inside of her plasticized and reanimated body.\n\nIt was snowing the day I decided to leave the museum. My hand braced the cold windowpane iced with white clumps, and the warmth sucked out of my hand easily like cigarette smoke.\n\nYears prior when I had started as the museum‚Äôs tour guide, I received word that my daughter‚Äôs cancer had taken her. A letter - that‚Äôs all I was given by the oncology ward. The hospital informed me that my daughter had passed away by mail - which meant she had been dead for a few days before the paperwork actually arrived. The fact of that shattered me. I decided I would rather live with the burden of insanity before carrying on in this cruel world with the burden of a child dying. Thinking back, it had been snowing that day, too. Before deciding to venture into Johnny‚Äôs exhibit to let his toxic words take me just as he had Mariette, the snow outside reminded me of holding her gloved hand at Wintertime shows, and her face in my mind‚Äôs eye begged me to keep living. I didn‚Äôt visit him that day.\n\nThough, until recently, I felt no obligation to ever try to break my contract and leave the museum anymore. Sophia, my world, my darling, was dead. Why would I ever leave? I could stay and hold the ghastly hand of her ghoulish reflection against the interface of our museum‚Äôs horrifying haunted mirrors. Here, Sophia was with me, and I was never alone.\n\nStopping to gaze up at the enormous foyer, I was reminded that I, too, was an anguished exhibition in this rich man‚Äôs contraption. The poor guide to push and pull at, the man who survived fifteen years of torment. *Look at his hollow eyes*, the wealthy visitors probably thought. *Look how dead inside he looks*.\n\nNo more misery. My daughter wouldn‚Äôt want me to wither away like this, a pawn at the hands of the rich and famous. It was going to be freedom or death.\n\nOn my way to visit Johnny I found myself walking past the locked *steel door*, past the arts and music exhibition and downstairs next to the *living wall* and into the paranormal exhibition, when something caught my eye.\n\nIt was Mariette, the reanimated plastic shell of the previous guide, in her display. She clicked her pale joints stiffly and fluttered her heavy eyelids against tough friction. She was deceased and on show, but her soul was still very much alive. A soul that pushed her hand up and against her glass prison as if to say: *Stop, guide. Look what Johnny did to me, and what he is going to do to you*.\n\n*I‚Äôm sorry, Mariette*. I thought. *Believe it or not, Johnny is going to help me leave this horrible place.*\n\nI was so focused on organising my plan to see the dummy and to leave the museum I had almost forgotten to feed Earnie. I could never forget about Earnie.\n\nBeyond the insect exhibition hallway and to the left was our *Animals and Evolution* room. It was quite frankly rather dull, but Earnie always stood out to me like a hairy, clawed thumb.\n\nI found myself walking swiftly through the marble halls, climbing upon the balcony that stretched above the open-plan exhibition room. From the balcony overlooking his iron-barred pen, I tossed him heads of purple and green lettuce which he chomped with an effortless wet crunch.\n\nSee, Earnie was a bear-sized mole. And he had a secret.\n\nHe was a gentle giant, and I loved him. It was so difficult to find a kind soul in this abominable place. And so, I kept his secret. I found the hole he had dug through to the museum‚Äôs garden, and I let him have it. He could have his freedom if I couldn‚Äôt.\n\nCompletely dreading it, I took my time on my way back to the paranormal wing. Visiting Johnny was a necessary evil.\n\nThe plan was based around the belief that I was well-adjusted enough to figure out if Johnny was telling me a truth or lie, and adjust my plan to leave the museum accordingly with new information. If he lied, I would in turn unveil it, flipping his lie on its head and use the opposite, a truth, to my advantage. Fifteen years of experience as the tour guide was behind my back, something Mariette never had when his words broke her down. Becoming accustomed to the museum‚Äôs horrors had made my mind a steel fortress. Though, I just hoped Johnny couldn‚Äôt melt my mind as easily as he did Mariettes.\n\nMy master key met the rustic, untouched lock and twisted with a clank. With one slow reluctant pull I opened the door to the ventriloquist doll‚Äôs chamber for the first and *hopefully last* time.\n\nIt was foolish of me to assume the lights would still turn on after fifteen years. I turned to grab the torch from my hip, my eye catching Mariette a few metres behind me in her display, facing away in disgust from the room which had been her demise years ago. I swallowed tightly and smacked my flashlight alive against my palm.\n\nJohnny was sitting on a black stool in the center of the small room. The light from my torch lit up his pale skin which contrasted against his baby-sized tuxedo. From the corners of his lips straight downward to his chin were thick red lines cutting into his plastic face, forming a mouth.\n\nHis voice was croaky yet dripping in sickening enthusiasm. ‚ÄúHiya Michael!‚Äù \n\nHis words had already broken me - I hadn‚Äôt heard that name in years. A decade, even. I was lucky to even remember it - after a while my name simply became ‚Äò*guide*‚Äô. But how? How could he-\n\n‚ÄúBuddy, pal!‚Äù His eyes wandered loosely in his sockets left then right like rolling marbles as he spoke. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it hangin‚Äô, Mikey?‚Äù\n\nThere was no dust on his combed hair nor suit, as you would expect for an animated plastic horror who kept tidy by wandering the confines of his room.\n\nHis mouth was ever smiling as he leaned to one side. ‚ÄúAnd‚Ä¶ How‚Äôs my girl?‚Äù His stiff dummy frame moved and peered at Mariette over my shoulder behind me. ‚ÄúOh, isn‚Äôt she just gorgeous now, Mikey! Look at that plastic shine!‚Äù\n\n*This‚Ä¶ thing‚Ä¶ was revolting*. I thought.\n\n‚ÄúAnd,‚Äù Johnny turned his stiff head to me, smirking under the bright torchlight. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your girl? Dead in a hole, Mikey?‚Äù\n\nMy stomach plummeted. I would have torn his tiny, disgusting head off in an instant if I didn‚Äôt need him.\n\nThe puppet laughed with a menacing whine. *Heheheh*‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúSophia, she rotting in the dirt?‚Äù\n\nMy fist clenched, and the spotlight from my torch shook over him like the light from a swinging chandelier.\n\n‚ÄúMaggots probably crawlin‚Äô outta‚Äô her cheeks. Eh, Mikey?‚Äù *Heheheh*‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄúStop!‚Äù I suddenly bursted out; my echo carrying for a while through the empty halls of the museum.\n\nFor a while he sat quietly on the stool, his legs freely kicking the air like a kid sitting on the edge of a pier. He stared up at me with horrifying, glassy eyes and a devilish smile that never quit.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving the museum for good at six o‚Äôclock.‚Äù I gulped, watching his every move for hints of the truth or lie response that was about to come out of his plastic mouth. ‚ÄúWhat do you think about that, Johnny?‚Äù\n\nHis head suddenly spun around several times as he spoke. ‚ÄúWow-wee friend-o! I have lots to think about! I do, I do!‚Äù\n\nFor a while, I watched his puppet eyes roll around and show only white. He was contemplating, of sorts.\n\n‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt find any freedom outside, Mikey.‚Äù His mouth pulled open mechanically and clasped shut as he spoke. ‚ÄúThough, you will find freedom,‚Äù\n\nOne tiny arm beckoned me to lean closer, and I did.\n\nHe was whispering when he spoke. ‚ÄúThrough the steel door.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù\n\nHe leaned back on his stool; one plastic square chin dancing in the light as he laughed to himself.\n\n*Heheheh‚Ä¶*\n\nI thought about it for a while. *That steel door had remained sealed since I had started this awful job.*\n \nHe kept chuckling to himself before abruptly going quiet. His eyes were locked on the old guide behind me. ‚ÄúOh Mariette...‚Äù He called out a childish croak.\n\nI slammed the door shut and locked the door. Outside that room‚Äôs tense atmosphere I felt like I could breathe again.\n\nIf only I could have gotten more information out of Johnny than a simple, straightforward lie. To avoid the lie of entering the steel door would be no drama. All I would have to do is run from the museum, as I always thought I would have to do.\n\nWhen I checked my watch and saw it was five minutes to six, I came bolting around into the enormous foyer. The guests would be arriving in a matter of minutes.\n\nThe towering ornate museum door opened with its usual mechanical groan. I pushed past a man with a salt and peppered beard, his blustering coat nearly catching my face in the cold wind.\n\nLady weather was against me this evening, but the plan was already in motion. The plan was to run.\n\nI almost tumbled when one of the rich pricks snagged me by my arm as I jogged down the stairs. I couldn‚Äôt hear exactly what he said - the swirling breeze swam in my eardrums like a cold stream, a sound that I didn‚Äôt often hear from inside the rich man‚Äôs prison. It was beautiful.\n\nEvery step into the museum‚Äôs wide frozen garden made a gentle *hushk* beneath my shoe in the soft snow. I couldn‚Äôt look back until I met the tree line. When I did, I noticed a few of the men that gave chase.\n\nI launched through the spiny bushes ahead, taking exaggerated steps over rough terrain like a horse that walked with a proud gallop. Cuts and scratches against my flesh from branches felt liberating. It was painful, but it was not the museum‚Äôs contraptions hurting me anymore - it was the fresh lashes of wild, unpredictable freedom.\n\n*I‚Äôm almost free, Sophia*. I could feel the warmth of my daughter smiling down on me. *She wants me to be free*.\n\n‚ÄúGuide!‚Äù A deep voice of one of my pursuers boomed through the forest with reverb and my heart spiked in my wheezing chest. They were closing in. Though, why were they after me? I had left the door wide open for them.\n\n*Turn around and burn the museum down, you horrible bastards*.\n\nThere was no doubt in my mind that if I stopped, one of the rich brutes would bash the brain-juice out of my skull with a sharp rock. How dare I, the suffering guide, threaten the fun of their wealthy expedition and take off into the woods?\n\nQuick clapping and crunching of bark behind me made my ears prick. Without warning, one red silk shoulder of my waistcoat was snagged in an angry balled fist before I was yanked backward, making me tumble into mud and muck.\n\nI pulled my head up with a groan, my joints aching dully and skin searing like a full-body carpet burn.\n\nThe museum guest straddling my chest was a mere silhouette, the backdrop of stars behind his head only lighting up greying hair at the edges. His cold fingers met my throat, tightening, tightening.\n\nWriggling left and right was hard with legs against my chest. \n\nClumps of snow fell gently onto my face in bites of cold as his hands crushed my neck. I swung and swung at his kidney with my fist, but he didn‚Äôt let up.\n\nThe stars above became a blur, and the top of his head filled the bottom of my vision.\n\nOne of my keys I had clenched between my knuckles punctured his side, and he went rolling down a snowy bank.\n\nGripping my purple bruised throat I stumbled forward, but wheezing meant I wasn‚Äôt getting enough air to keep up a jog.\n\n‚ÄúStop!‚Äù His voice called.\n\nWith each step the snow had seemingly gotten thicker, though it still gave way to my feet with the same distinct *hushk*.\n\n*I couldn‚Äôt let up. Not when I was this close.*\n\nYonder the snowy bank in front of me was a large building I had never seen before. It was quite smaller than the museum, bigger than the off-site cottage I slept in during my days off. A warehouse.\n\nIt didn‚Äôt take long to limp to it and break inside.\n\nThe smell of rotten wood and mold inside the warehouse crawled up my nose like invisible, pungent fingers. Bars of starlight came through boarded windows, covering the walls and floor in crooked glowing streaks of the moon‚Äôs azure silver gleam. It was dusty, unkempt. Dry, grimy particles coated and tickled my throat; the dust in the building was so awful that my cough might have looked like billowing steam.\n\nSilhouettes of all shapes and sizes lined the walls and shelves, most with flaps of paper attached to them. It was a haven for retired exhibitions. That, or their hell.\n\nThudding came from behind me as someone pushed and pulled at the door trying to follow me inside. Unsettled flakes of crumbling wood drifted down from the ceiling with every shake from the banging door.\n\nThe shoddy place couldn‚Äôt possibly hold the wealthy brute outside for long. As my heart raced, my departed Sophia‚Äôs face suddenly glowed on the black canvas of my tight eyelids. *I think I‚Äôll be seeing you soon, darling*.\n\nI stumbled forward, coughing and glaring around the murky warehouse as the thuds became impatient. I needed something to get me out of here, *anything*.\n\n‚ÄúWhere ya‚Äô think ya‚Äô going?‚Äù A man‚Äôs muffled voice boomed from under the door. It was the same man who had gripped me by my throat minutes prior. His tone was strained and fed up; I pictured his face flush and the cables of his neck sticking out as thick roots.\n\nMy cold digits wrapped around one of the planks sealing a window. Boarded shut. My options of flight or fight narrowed to the latter.\n\n*Thud*. The door was stubbing shut against something, but not for much longer.\n\nOne of the lines of light pouring inside the dingy space sparkled upon something a few feet away made out of glass.\n\nI walked closer; each step the floorboard spat out a dying croak. When I was near enough to make out what the thing was, a cold feeling bloomed in my stomach.\n\nThe thing I approached in the blanketing dim starlight was animatronic and ghoulish. Clumps of its brown artificial and fraying fur were clumped together in sticky balls of black grease; its glass tennis ball eyes held tiny, startling black pinhole-sized pupils. It was a human-sized depiction of a vintage stuffed monkey holding brass cymbals. Stuffing had come away from its middle in spongy yellow bunches, exposing rusty metal gears within a mechanical chest.\n\nI tried not to make eye contact with it out of fear of it following my gaze. I still had to think quickly about defending myself - the door hadn‚Äôt stopped thudding. \n\nMessily stuck to one furry ear of the mechanic being were a few pages of forms, faded and dusty. I puffed away dirt from the paper with one labored wheeze.\n\nIt read: *Exhibition name - KELSEY. Children‚Äôs mechanical mascot that once educated schools about the importance of healthy teeth and gums*.\n\nI hadn‚Äôt noticed it until now, large and eerily human-shaped teeth stuck out from the monkey‚Äôs fur lips. An animatronic monkey to tell your kids to brush their teeth. Of course.\n\n*Out of commission: 1983. Reason: Excessive homicidal tendencies. Signed and approved: MARIETTE*.\n\nMariette and I‚Ä¶ connected by threads of time after all these years. This must have been an especially terrifying item to warrant locking it up in a warehouse to rot. I couldn‚Äôt believe that I had found something retired by the previous tour guide of the museum ‚Äì it made me feel less alone.\n\nI hadn‚Äôt felt that flavor of deep-chested and rotten fear in over a decade - a time when I was unacquainted with what lurked around the museum‚Äôs ornate corners. However, this evening I was again in unfamiliar and petrifying territory. *Why was I not informed of this place? I would have decommissioned Johnny Razortongue in a heartbeat. If not for me, then for Mariette‚Äôs tortured soul*.\n\nWithout warning, the stuffed mechanical abomination switched on. It chilled my blood to see golden iridescent bulbs flickering in the place where its lifeless, beady globes had been.\n\nIts jaw gnashed wildly, lagging and biting. It was stuck in a loop for a while, seeing through eyes that hadn‚Äôt seen the world in decades as it woke from its slumber.\n\nIt turned to me: gleaming gears and yellow eyes all feasting on the one who broke its sleep. Me.\n\n*Kel-Kel-*\n\nThe speaker tried to sing in a child‚Äôs voice, but the rusty electronics could only cough up distorted noise. When it finally started the tune and began walking, I made for the door.\n\n*Kelsey yum,*\n\n*Kelsey yum,*\n\n*Drink milk for bones,*\n\n*put it in your tum!*\n\nMy hand met the handle of the door. I went tumbling backward as the man kicked it in first, my elbow collapsing into one rotten floorboard. The mechanism behind me sang and sang, and her cymbals crashed and crashed.\n\n*Bones, bones, bones,*\n\n*strong teeth for bite,*\n\n*No moans, moans, moans,*\n\n*brush your teeth at night!*\n\nThe intruder‚Äôs hand was immediately aiming for my throat once more, but I was faster.\n\nI turned quickly, catching one of his arms and pulling them behind his back in a lock.\n\nTwisting, I faced his kicking legs outward at Kelsey. The cymbal-clapping animatronic monstrosity approached slowly, gears churning in its open chest.\n\n*Crash, crash, crash,* went the cymbals. They crashed until the gears caught both his boots in its exposed core as he tried to kick her away. But he was locked in my arms. And he was locked *tight*.\n\nFrom then, it took a while for the man to stop screaming. His feet met the unyielding gears of animatronic innards in a red cloud of skin and bone. \n\n*Calci-yum, calcium. Drink milk for bones, put it in your tum.*\n\nThe once childlike voice coming out of the thing‚Äôs speaker became choppy and deep-pitched like a singing birthday card with a dying battery. At that moment I could only hope my daughter wasn‚Äôt looking down, watching me ghoulishly smile as my rich pursuer struggled and screamed in my locked arms. *Close your eyes if you‚Äôre watching, honey. Daddy is going to be free soon*.\n\nThe man screamed and screamed, and the dying speaker‚Äôs voice lines sung and sung: *Calciyum, calciyum*.\n\nMetal gears were up to his calves. His cartilage popped; his leg bones buckled and broke with a stomach curdling crack as Kelsey snapped his femurs like thick white pencils through her gears as if the man was fleshy mulch.\n\nI only let go when he finally became limp. His screams were no longer; all that could be heard in the dusty room was the mechanical spinning and clunking of gears from the animated monstrosity to my side.\n\nFor a while I sat in the dark as it ate him whole. It felt good to finally fight back, but it was never meant to feel this good. The sound of his bones crunching, the sound of his voice extinguishing like a wet flame. I was no longer going to be the one being tortured and tormented. I was going to be free.\n\nThough, as the age old saying goes - ignorance is bliss. I wish I hadn‚Äôt looked down at the mutilated man. I wish I hadn‚Äôt seen that he was not someone wealthy nor a guest after all. Catching a proper glance at him in the dim moonlight shining over his overalls and glistening keys, it became terrifyingly evident that he was museum security.\n\n*I killed a man that was just trying to do his job.* \n\n*No, I didn‚Äôt.*\n\n*I didn‚Äôt.*\n\n*The museum did.*\n\nDeep down I think I knew I was responsible, though. And that I might have enjoyed watching it happen.\n\nBut it was time to keep moving.\n\nI swiftly bent down and swooped a metallic lighter and a ring of many keys before leaving the stuffed horror alone to eat. Most of the keys were long and identical to mine from the looks of things.\n\nSnow was blowing outside the warehouse; I had to squint freezing ice-peppered eyes to see and orientate myself away from the museum‚Äôs grounds.\n\nFor a while I walked aimlessly in the blistering snow, not seeking a goal but salvation in as much distance I could make between the museum and myself.\n\nThe weather was relentless, and I was ill-equipped from the get-go. At some point I had a call with the museum's curator as I stumbled around the barren icy wilderness, but reality bordered with delusion.\n \n‚ÄúYou can never leave the museum, Michael.‚Äù The voice was buzzing through the speaker. ‚ÄúYou two are entwined.‚Äù\n\nMy jaw was chattering; I watched the steam from my mouth and lips escape me.\n\n‚ÄúThis money,‚Äù The curator continued. ‚ÄúThe type of money to let you run something like this‚Ä¶ Your contract simply does not end if you leave our borders, sonny, you should know this.‚Äù He was speaking in a condescending tone.\n\nAll I could hear for a while was the clinking of a lighter opening and the curator sucking through a cigarette over the phone. Occasionally, the wind blew a strong gust and pulled away my coat.\n\n‚ÄúI think it is time you expire, boy-o. See, we even have a new guide lined up to replace you. It‚Äôs over.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be free.‚Äù My voice was slow and hard to hear over chattering teeth.\n\nThe curator scoffed. ‚ÄúNo, Michael, you‚Äôre not. I want to thank you for letting those‚Ä¶ Those people that are lonely at the top of the financial mountain... Those rich and famous who are under constant judgemental eyes - those akin to exhibitions at a museum... Letting them truly be somewhere and be someone where they are not themselves. At our museum, they can be the audience, not the newspaper‚Äôs nor the public's exhibitions. And you were instrumental in such success.‚Äù\n\nBreathing didn‚Äôt come easy - the air swirled and chilled my lungs like inhaling menthol.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm going‚Ä¶ to be.. free...‚Äù Words were labored from my lips.\n\n‚ÄúFarewell, Michael.‚Äù The phone clicked off.\n\nI staggered for a while after the call had ended. Hypothermic brain-fog had me going in every which way. I had no chance of making it back to the museum in such delirium.\n\n*Did I want to return, however? No. Of course not.*\n\nIt was cold.\n\nAnd I was tired.\n\nI laid down in a pile of snow under a naked tree. The evening‚Äôs snowy breeze no longer felt like anything at all across my numb face. \n\n*Just for a little while. I‚Äôll sleep in the cold for a little‚Ä¶ while.*\n\nI tilted my head back, letting my eyelids drift shut and the stars above sing me a final lullaby. For a while the constellations looked like my daughters face, and I smiled.\n\nIf I held a handful of snow tight enough, it didn‚Äôt feel like I was dying alone. It felt like someone was holding my hand, and the fear started to blow away with the wind.\n\nBut the snow in my hand was hairy.\n\nAnd it was warm.\n\nAnd it was breathing.\n\nA cold pile beneath my arm erupted into the air with a snort as if from a whale‚Äôs spout.\n\nHis brown fur looked unworldly against the field of snow. He couldn‚Äôt see much with his two black, beady eyes beyond his whiskers but he knew it was me. \n\nAnd I knew it was him. Earnie.\n\nI swiftly buried into the thin layer of concave snow that Earnie‚Äôs pink and brown head came from. It was hard to see anything inside the hole, if at all, but it was a lot warmer than the surface. Inside, the lighter I had pulled from the security guard no longer faltered in any wind in the tight space, and I caught the tail end of the mole‚Äôs pink hindpaws in the lighter‚Äôs soft glow as he began to scurry back through the tunnel towards the museum.\n\nI crouched a slog through the tunnel using only the lighter and Earnie to guide me. Warmth returned to my extremities and spread in waves.\n\nComing to think of it, the lighter was not the only thing I had found on the man‚Äôs body.\n\nUpon the keyring I had taken was a peculiar long and winding key I had never seen before. One that I had never owned. \n\n[A key to the steel door.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sharpshooting/comments/ksckc5/the_horrifying_private_museum_for_the_rich_and/)",

Now she's stuck as an exhibit at the very museum in which she would show off the exhibits to messed up wealthy monsters. The really messed up part is that her soul is stuck in there. If you planned on escaping, couldn't you have broken her enough to \"set her free\" in a sense? \n\nThat is no way to live and she's obviously quite aware, so you could ask her consent just to make sure. That poor woman. Anyone who accepts such a job and stays is obviously down on their luck somehow; it's quite sad that she died that way.\n\nLike everyone else tho, I'm TeamEarnie~ Glad you remembered to feed him and keep his tunnel a secret; saved your life. You've been seeing the top 1% that seems to quite enjoy stepping on the rest of us, the one's that think $11 is good enough to make a living on minimum wage, as such $15 is \"a bit much.\" \n\nBasically, you've seen the very worst of humanity on display constantly and to make it worse, they're terrible to you on a constant basis. I'm pretty sure that's why you kinda enjoyed the person dying. I get the terror realizing he wasn't the monster you thought you got, but he was security and was still attempting to take your life. I don't think regular security deserved to die that way, but you didn't know and again, it was you or him. My brother is actually a security guard for rather \"rich\" stores so I feel bad saying it although attempting to kill isn't in his instructions.\n\nThat job is also not totally honest. The steel door is a secret with the key hidden for you not to find and the warehouse wasn't even mentioned to you. The whole thing is suspect now that you know more. I'm sure little Sophia is worried for her daddy; make her smile somehow. Sorry this was so long, got really into this part~!",

YOU SEE A MIGHTY TREE AND LOOK AT ITS OFFSPRING, AND YOURE MET WITH A JADE ORB -AND IT LOOKS LIKE A MANGO- JUST IMAGINE THAT. \n\nAfter standing there admiring the fruit for more time that you can intuitively count, watching your face reflect upon its reflective surface (as you should((OR as you must)) you decide to succumb to its call and at last, take it out of its tree. You take a knife and get yourself some mango. Now, apart from this point, all I can possibly do is speculate, as we have not received any form of information about its inside color or taste, but this will not stop me from experiencing the supreme mint mango in my mind. \n\nAs its soft mint flesh seduces you with its juices, the menthol combined with the sweet sugary and citric smell that is signature of a GOOD mango, not that crap they sell at Walmart. You look at it, and then take a bite out of the thing. You see bliss, you discover a new from pf happiness. What could surpass this experience? You become depressed, there is nothing in life worth trying anymore. You spend the next years trying to find something that makes you feel as worthy as the mint mango‚Ä¶",

    "body": "My eyes are itching, and my novelty birthday hat is strapped on too tight. It‚Äôs an infantile fantasy theme this year, and I loathe it with every fiber of my being. I‚Äôm fifteen years old, mom. I don‚Äôt fucking care about wizards and unicorns and fucking sparkle faeries anymore.\n\nBefore me looms the birthday cake, and I swallow deeply.\n\n‚ÄúMake a wish, pumpkin,‚Äù my mom‚Äôs shrill voice calls from across the table.\n\nI wish you‚Äôd fucking die. I wish I was never born. I wish someone would strangle me in my sleep.\n\nI blow out the candles, a single tear rolling down my chin.\n\nMom cheers excitedly, a crazed expression on her wrinkled face. ‚ÄúWhat did you wish for?‚Äù\n\n*Death*, I think. ‚ÄúUm, some new clothes and shoes,‚Äù I murmur.\n\n‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs a good wish,‚Äù mom says, readying the knife. ‚ÄúReally good wish.‚Äù\n\nShe stares at me silently with puffy red eyes, shaking her head in disappointment. That‚Äôs my mom, through and through. An Avatar of Disappointment. Snide remarks and veiled insults incarnate. I am never to feel good about myself, remains her undying creed. I‚Äôm not pretty, not smart, not worthy of any attention whatsoever.\n\nUnless it‚Äôs my birthday.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a big old cake, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù she grins, puffing on her menthol cigarette disgustingly, spittle dripping all over her garish outfit. ‚ÄúBeen quite a year.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry mom. I‚Äôll do better, promise‚Äù I whisper. ‚ÄúPlease, can I be excused?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh no. No no no. You have to try the cake. You have to finish it all.‚Äù\n\nThe knife cuts through it in slow, methodical slices, and I can feel her spiteful gaze on me like sharp pins in my flesh.\n\n‚ÄúForty-four pounds. That‚Äôs twenty kilos, Caitlyn. Incidentally also the average weight of a six year old child.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúUh, I‚Äôll be better,‚Äù I whimper pathetically. ‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you *can*, darling,‚Äù she says coldly, dropping an oozing slice on my plate. ‚ÄúBut we shall see. Got a whole year to improve now, don‚Äôt we?‚Äù\n\nI nod weakly, desperately trying to wipe away the tears. But I can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt move my hands.\n\n‚ÄúNow eat,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúDig into the cake like the disgusting animal you are.‚Äù\n\nI wince painfully, the suction tubes inserted in my abdomen rubbing against the pus-filled wounds; flood waves of pain washing over me if I move so much as an inch. But I can handle the pain. That‚Äôs not my punishment. No, the punishment is the cake. Every last drop of my own excess fat somehow pumped into that abomination.\n\nI‚Äôve gained forty-four pounds too much this year, according to my mom. That‚Äôs twenty kilos. Or a six year old child.\n\nAnd now I have to slurp it all up again.\n\nMy mom stands behind me now, the menthol stench of her sweaty body bombarding my nostrils relentlessly. Sinewy hands around my neck in a firm grip, she forces my face ever closer to the horrid gloop of chunky fat.\n\n‚ÄúPuh-please,‚Äù I murmur.\n\n‚ÄúEat.‚Äù",

    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nI‚Äôm writing this as somewhat of a warning, but also a slight cry for help. I do not know who else to turn to that may take me seriously, and I know this community is often eager to help in situations like this.\n\nA few months ago in late July, I attended a music festival with my girlfriend, Debbie. This particular festival was in a small Wisconsin town called Twin Lakes. It went on from Thursday until past midnight on Sunday, so by the time we left the last show, trudged through the mud, packed up the last of our belongings from the campsite and drove past the stampede of fellow festival goers, it was pretty late.\n\nHer and I have attended this festival for the past four years. It‚Äôs pretty much common knowledge amongst the community that cell phone service is completely gone after the first day. I think it‚Äôs a combination of being in a small town, and randomly filling a small area with thousands of people, that causes the service to dissipate so quick. Because we were aware of this, we fully expected to not have use of our phone‚Äôs GPS system to help us navigate the town. This didn‚Äôt worry us though, because like I said, this was our fourth year and had pretty much learned the route back home by now.\n\nUnfortunately, the usual route we were prepared to take was completely blocked off. We saw flashing red and blue lights in the distance, and later learned one of the festival goers had been struck by a vehicle. After waiting for 20 minutes and not moving an inch, Debbie and I agreed we should try and find another way back. We pulled a U-turn and began to drive in the opposite direction. After a few minutes we saw a side street and decided we‚Äôd try it out.\n\nThis road‚Ä¶ well, it was dark. Really dark. The kind of dark where you drive slow and blare your high beams ‚Äì which is what I did. Being into horror films, I took the opportunity to make a comment on our creepy surroundings to Debbie. She kind of laughed, but I noticed the fear in her voice and eyes. Being the loving guy I am, I decided I would take advantage of her fear and scare her even more. Boyfriend of the Year, am I right?\n\nI switched from the AUX settings in the car to the radio and immediately switched to AM. I scanned one by one until I found one that was just blaring white noise, I left it on and began making comments to Debbie in different horror-inspired voices‚Ä¶ things like *‚ÄúThey‚Äôre watching us‚Äù* and *‚ÄúTonight seems like a nice night to die, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù* The crazy thing was, Debbie didn‚Äôt find my hilarious jokes very entertaining and kept trying to shut the radio off. Buzzkill.\n\nI agreed to cut the act and told her it can all end if she played along a little bit, by choosing one random AM station for us to listen to. With an annoyed sigh, Debbie reached over and spun the dial with little thought. The station she landed on was AM 630.\n\nShe hit the spooky jackpot with that one. What we heard could only be described as a little girl singing with a high-pitched, distorted voice. I immediately began laughing at her selection, since it was exactly what I was hoping we‚Äôd find and so much more. I whipped out my phone and recorded a Snapchat video of our reactions, which I‚Äôll link below:\n\n[**\\[The Snapchat video\\]**](https://youtu.be/0GtZuBXl9Z0)\n\nI continued to laugh while Debbie nervously chuckled. I actually found it strange and a bit unnerving myself, but did not want to let it show in front of her‚Ä¶ macho-guy-routine, and all that. I went ahead and switched back to the AUX and continued our drive home. A few minutes after switching back, the music got cut off once again, and my high-pitched ringtone flooded the car with an ear-piercing jingle. The number was strange and told me it was from Russia, so I ignored it. I had recently purchased a URL from GoDaddy and made the foolish decision to *not* make it private, so my mobile number was made public for all the spammers to find. That meant receiving calls from randomly generated numbers became a common occurrence, which is why this one did not phase me too much. It did a little, though. Most of the spam numbers I received were domestic, and were received during weekday afternoons. I had never received one at almost 1AM on a Sunday night‚Äì let alone one from Russia.\n\n[**\\[Screenshot of call log\\]**](https://ibb.co/bDajrz)\n\nNot too long after rejecting that call, I received another. Again, it was an international number, this time, from Morocco. I figured it was the same person as before, using the same random number generator, and once again ignored the number. A few minutes passed when‚Äì you guessed it‚Ä¶ another call. This one, though, was in fact domestic. The call was coming from Phoenix, Arizona. Since this was from inside the US and I was finally angry enough to answer and chew out the solicitor on the other end, I picked up.\n\nI wish I didn‚Äôt.\n\nI angrily asked ‚ÄúHello?!‚Äù several times and did not receive an answer. Usually, that would be my cue to hang up, but I was annoyed and felt persistent (not to mention Debbie was watching, and ya know‚Ä¶ macho-guy-routine). I knew *someone* was there, because I was able to hear some background static, and the faint sound of someone breathing.\n\n‚ÄúHey, asshole, I know you‚Äôre there. What the hell do you want? What can you possibly be trying to sell at this hour?‚Äù\n\nThe silence lingered for a few more seconds, before it was broken. I began to hear music. But not just any music‚Ä¶ it was the same style of music we heard on the creepy radio station we had turned off just before receiving the calls. I felt my face get flush and sort of just frozen up, phone still on my ear. I don‚Äôt know how long I sat there like that, before I was snapped out of it. I hadn‚Äôt realized what snapped me out of it until Debbie broke the silence in the car.\n\n‚ÄúUgh, what does he want?‚Äù\n\nI looked into the rear view mirror and saw what Debbie was referring to. There was a pickup truck tailgating behind us that had flashed it lights. The driver did it again‚Äì just one quick burst of their high beams in our direction. I had no idea what they could have wanted. I was going 5-10 miles over, so it wasn‚Äôt because I was impeding traffic. It was a two-lane road with no oncoming traffic, so even if they were in a hurry, they could easily have gone around us and sped up.\n\nAt this point, I was still on the phone, and still had not heard anything but the music coming from the other end. For whatever reason, I did not hang up, and was too distracted by the tailgater to try and pry more info from the caller. After about 30 seconds of being dangerously close to our car, the truck *finally* began to switch lanes in attempt to pass us.\n\nIt was dark, so I could not see into the drivers car through the windshield, and when they were beside us, we realized their windows were tinted very dark (definitely past the legal limit). In that moment, it did not mean much to me, since I figured they would speed pass us and be out of our hair soon. That‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt happen. The truck got in front of us and slowly began to apply their brakes. Red flags, everywhere. I had read enough stories of criminal encounters to know this easily could be a trap to rob us, or worse.\n\nI knew I had to be tactical to avoid any problems. Debbie, on the other hand, wasn‚Äôt thinking so clearly. Feeling tired, anxious to be home and now annoyed to her breaking point by this driver, she swiftly reached out her arm and pressed down firmly on my car horn. It wasn‚Äôt the first time she had pulled this move and it‚Äôs something she does that I absolutely hate. I always tell her she‚Äôs going to get us into some serious confrontation one day‚Äì a serious confrontation that will have to be handled by *me‚Äì*  so I‚Äôm usually quick to grab her hand and remove it from the horn. This time though, I was frozen.\n\nI was still on the phone with the mystery caller at this point, subconsciously transfixed on the chilling audio that was radiating into my ear. From the phone, I heard it‚Ä¶ my car horn. It was delayed by a nano-second and sounded far away, but I knew it was the same. I heard my car horn coming from the other end of the call. Whoever was in that truck, was the person I was speaking to. The person who called us with the suspicious numbers. The person who was playing the same radio station we had randomly discovered. And now, the same person who almost got us to come to a complete stop in the middle of a Wisconsin backroad at 1 in the morning.\n\nFight-or-flight is a funny thing‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs very impressive how fast your mind can actually process information when it‚Äôs fueled by fear. In what felt like a blink of an eye, my mind ran with the possibility of reaching for the baseball bat I kept in the back seat and coming at this driver with all my might. That fantasy quickly went South, as I pictured a group of grown men with guns spilling out of the truck, killing me and doing God-knows-what to Debbie. I thank God to this day that the stupid macho-guy-routine came to an end right then and there.\n\nI quickly and haphazardly, slammed down on the gas and swerved around the truck, picking up as much speed as I could. I might not have the fastest car in the world, but it‚Äôs in pretty good condition. It was more than enough to escape the old, worn-out pickup truck that was following us.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes of speeding well past the legal limit, blowing stop signs and living out all my Vin Deisel fantasies, we were back in the more sprawling, busy areas of our route. There was no sign of the truck. Debbie, who was screaming at me for the first few minutes of this escape, was reduced to quiet crying as she clutched a pillow tight to her chest. My adrenaline had worn off, and now I was feeling shaky.\n\nWe had been riding in dead silence this whole time, so I reached down to the floor of the car for my phone. I figured we can both benefit in some cheery music to help lighten the mood, since we both clearly were not eager to discuss what had just happened. I grabbed the phone and tapped the home button. The screen illuminated‚Ä¶ and I saw that I was still in the middle of a call. I never hung up the phone before speeding away‚Ä¶ and apparently, neither did the mysterious caller on the other end. We approached a red light and I slowed down to a stop. That‚Äôs when I put the phone up to my ear. My breathing was undoubtedly audible at this point.\n\nAt first I was met with silence, other than the same muted white noise as before. The silence was broken by the caller. In a deep voice, I heard one sentence that filled by body with nauseating chills.\n\n‚ÄúAlmost had you.‚Äù\n\nAfter that, the call was ended.\n\nI must have looked shaken, because Debbie nervously asked me what was wrong. I simply shook my head without a word and continued driving. About 30 minutes later, we arrived home. At that point we were so exhausted that we walked inside, decided to leave unpacking the car for the next day, and dropped into the bed without even bothering with showers.\n\n\\_\\_\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next morning, I grabbed the keys and went to go bring the car closer to our apartment entrance in order to speed up the process of emptying all our camping gear. I got to the car and when I hit the ‚Äúunlock‚Äù button on the keys, I did not hear the sound of the doors unlocking. Instead, I heard the dull thud of the locks remaining the same. In our tired daze the night prior, we had neglected to lock the doors. I peeked inside the car and saw that everything seemed to still be there, including some cash that was visibly strewn across the passenger seat. I figured we had gotten lucky and proceeded to get inside.\n\nRight away, I knew something was wrong. It was the smell. Whether you know it or not, every single person has a scent. You can smell it when walked into certain homes, or smelling someone's worn clothing. In that moment, I was picking up a scent that did not belong to me or Debbie. It wasn‚Äôt bad, per se, but it was undeniable‚Äì slightly musty, with a hint of menthol. I got out of the car and inspected it once more. Again, nothing seemed out of place. I took a breath and told myself I was imagining things. Once again, I climbed into the driver's seat, this time ignoring the unusual smell. I stuck my key in the ignition and fired up the car.\n\nI almost jumped out of my skin when the radio began to blare. I could have sworn we had turned it off but hell, I thought we had locked the doors too. It wasn‚Äôt the radio being on that scared me. It was the fact that the radio was on it‚Äôs loudest setting‚Ä¶ and was programed to AM 630.\n\nI could almost hear my heart beating rapidly as I stared wide-eyed at the console. I knew, for a fact, we had switched to the AUX setting. I just knew it. The radio station was no longer playing the haunting sounds as the night prior, and was now projecting the sounds of some obscure talk radio or news channel. At that point, I did not have enough energy to deal with this any longer. I turned off the radio and drove the car up to our building entrance. Debbie was waiting there for me. We both looked exhausted. Without speaking very much, her and I worked together to empty the car. I parked it back in our spot, and that was that. There were no more weird calls (other than the usual spam), no strange discoveries with the car, that radio station, etc. I tuned into it a few times and found that it was still the same boring news channel. Since Debbie and I live in Chicago, I figured it made sense that it would change. Things went back to normal.\n\nThat is, until last week.\n\nIt started when I checked my phone in the middle of my lunch break at work. I had four missed calls, all from random numbers. The last one‚Ä¶ was the same Phoenix number I picked up on the way back from Wisconsin. That number, had left a voicemail.\n\nIn the voicemail, as you may have guessed, was more of the creepy music we hear that night. There were no other sounds or voices. Just that damn music. Since then, I had noticed a lot of cars with Wisconsin license plates. It‚Äôs probably all in my head, I know. Cars from neighboring states is nothing crazy. But it just seems like there are way more than usual, parked around our apartment, driving past me on the street, etc. I would probably be able to brush all this off, if it wasn‚Äôt for what happened yesterday.\n\nI was getting out of a meeting at work and checked my phone. I had three missed calls. Two from random numbers (again, nothing super unusual), and one from Debbie. She had left a voicemail. Upon playing it, I almost threw up my lunch.\n\nIt was the eerie music.\n\nI called her right away, and she picked up after the first ring. She answered normally and I began to ask her what the voicemail was all about. At this point, I figured she was playing a prank on me this whole time, and just forgot to mask her number before making that particular call. I demanded she confess it was her, and when she finally started to cry while denying it all, I relented. I apologized for screaming at her. I explained everything that was happening for the past week and ended it all with her missed call and voicemail. It was quiet on her end. When she finally spoke, the adamant fear in her voice began to make sense.\n\nShe explained to me that she couldn‚Äôt have made that call. She was running errands, and had been grocery shopping at our local mega-chain supermarket. In a rush to stay on schedule, she had forgotten her phone in the car.\n\n\\_\\_\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don‚Äôt know what to do. A small part of me still suspects she may be playing a very long practical joke on me, but she has never been the prank type. And even if she was, how could she have orchestrated the radio station or the pickup truck? It doesn‚Äôt add up. All I know is, I haven‚Äôt let down my guard for a while. I‚Äôm carrying a knife on me and am looking into getting my conceal-and-carry license ASAP. I‚Äôm going to insist Debbie does the same. She is not a fan of guns, so if she *is* behind this, maybe that will be what makes her confess.\n\nHas anyone in the southern Wisconsin area, by ANY chance, had experience with this radio station? If not, PLEASE, do not access it. I can‚Äôt be sure the station itself has any connection to what‚Äôs been happening, but why risk it?\n\nI‚Äôm scared.. And I hope this ends soon.",

Menthol's boiling point is 212 Celsius, much warmer than your body.  \n\nMenthol isn't really cold, it just tricks your body into thinking it is.  There's a type of nerve cell that responds to things like temperature, pressure, pH, etc.  Some of these cells have what's called a TRPM8 receptor on their surface.  When menthol comes into contact with a TRPM8 receptor it binds to it, which makes the affected cell open an ion channel that admits sodium and calcium ions into the cell.  This in turn causes the nerve cell to send a signal to the brain that the brain interprets as coldness.  A similar receptor, TRPV1, is why the capsaicin in hot peppers feels 'hot'.\n\nBasically, menthol binds to a receptor on certain temperature-sensitive nerve cells, causing them to fire, and your brain interprets this nervous activity as coldness.\n\nEDIT: Okay, evaporative cooling probably does have something to do with it, and it isn't necessary for a substance to reach it's boiling point to evaporate.  However, I'm willing to bet that the cooling sensation is caused overwhelmingly by TRPV8 activation.\n\nEDIT: JESUS CHRIST YES VAPOR PRESSURE I GET IT",

    "body": "  \n\nAs long as retail fashion has been a thing, people have been ripping clothes apart and turning them into something new. Custom works are a pillar of the streetwear scene; painted backs of denim jackets, patches sewn into jeans, iconic graphics repurposed into niche artistic statements. Do any of these well and you may establish yourself as an underground icon, and maybe even climb further into becoming the Next Big Thing. But it goes without saying that, in the realm of custom works, one can fly too close to the sun. Or can you? Is it possible that the sun flew down itself to wrongfully put Baby in a corner? It‚Äôs a complicated, messy affair, with plenty of opinions to chew on. So let's get chewing.\n\n**Who (what) is Warren Lotas?**\n\nBy the time he was eighteen years old, young Warren Lotas had watched his uncle Bill succumb to the ALS he had been living with for several years. This desire to pay tribute to his late uncle via art of some kind, as well as his love for the DIY punk aesthetics of Los Angeles, led him to create his first clothing line from his college dorm room. Dubbed *Bill by Warren Lotas*, a name the brand still unofficially goes under, Lotas set to effecting flannel shirts, tees, denim jackets, and pants with his [Reaper-flavored art style](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/47/93/72/479372bfc5bef27e90175573d562480d.jpg). His pieces evoke motorcycle outfits, horror punk, and slasher movies, with earlier pieces personally [illustrated right onto the garment](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e4/7b/87/e47b87d495d679241417a16985d9ef17.jpg) by the man himself. While the line would see a cult following heading into 2016, it was the celebrity connections Warren was able to make that shot his brand into mainstream relevance. Through an internship at a nightclub he worked for, he would design clothes for Waka Flocka Flame, and that same year would design a set of pants for the ‚Äúcool pants‚Äù wearing [Wiz Khalifa.](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/0c/13/c1/0c13c1b281dc6c4c43cc25a7d46ed15d.jpg) \n\nIn the following years, the cult following for Warren Lotas would only grow bigger. Of course, the demand for his clothes meant the love and affection he was putting into earlier pieces had to be shelved in favor of mass-production prints and more cost-effective garment blanks. This is why some collectors can be found reminiscing in online forums about when Lotas Used To Be Cool. But this manufacturing pivot didn‚Äôt necessarily mean the pieces produced were any less inspired. That part would come later. \n\n**Custom Sneakers**\n\nSome will shun the idea completely, beholden as they are to the authentic status of what they collect. On the other hand, custom sneakers can be among the coolest. Often made by single artists or small teams, limited runs of one-of-a-kind shoes have a niche market all their own. A personal favorite of mine is the custom shoe / artistic statement of the [Air Menthol 10s.](https://www.nssmag.com/en/fashion/18003/ari-menthol-10-s) Other outfits like Shoe Surgeon make custom sneakers from scratch with materials never seen before from the likes of Nike, making their pairs more closely resemble art pieces than anything. \n\nBut are custom sneakers, particularly those that ape the silhouettes of shoes sold by the biggest sneaker company on the planet, legal? Dubiously. Shoe Surgeon or other custom sellers aren‚Äôt necessarily competing with Nike, and while that never stopped a corporation like them from making C&D‚Äôs rain, lawsuits over the selling of customs are few and far between. \n\nOn July 28th, 2020, Warren Lotas announced a line of custom Nike Dunks to drop in commemoration of Friday the 13‚Äôs 40th anniversary. Long-time followers of Lotas were well-familiar with his [adoration](https://cdn.fs.grailed.com/api/file/ROSxSRt9T9isSBJrwjO1) of this film‚Äôs aesthetics, and the shoes paid tribute to this by doing what is referred to in the fashion sphere as the Bare Minimum. \n\nI will attempt to remain bipartisan for everything else, but sometimes a spade needs to be called a spade. Aside from the Jason Vorhees mask peeping from the end of the swoosh, [these shoes](https://image-cdn.hypb.st/https%3A%2F%2Fhypebeast.com%2Fimage%2F2020%2F07%2Fwarren-lotas-nike-dunk-low-jason-vorhees-custom-release-info-001.jpg?q=90&w=1400&cbr=1&fit=max) are 1:1 identical to the Nike SB dunks. Soft differences in color aside, barely a thing apart from the mask and accents on the tongue and assorted branding makes Lotas' Dunks anything other than the most basic of custom decals. While many were hyped for the shoes nonetheless, others took to online clowning in a way Lotas himself came out to address. He waved off accusations of these being a cheap hack job on bootlegged SB Dunks, claiming his shoes were custom-stitched in an Italian manufacturing center (we‚Äôll revisit this). It should be noted that the criticism of what a non-conversion the shoe‚Äôs design was is not one born from hindsight. Collectors were split down the middle on these things, some taking to the subtlety of the customs while others criticized what they considered to be laziness. Didn‚Äôt mean people weren‚Äôt buying. \n\nPre-orders would go live in September but, when they did, an unexpected figure would come along for the ride. Someone that elevated the profile of the release as a whole but, by doing so, may have doomed the shoe in the process. \n\nWho is this figure? \n\n**Oh My! Bah Gawd! Is that Jeff Staple‚Äôs Music?!?!?**\n\nOn the day pre-orders for the Lotas custom Dunks went live, for a paltry 15 minutes, without informing anyone of what was going on, an alternate colorway for the shoes went live for pre-orders. These were in collaboration with NYC designer Jeff Staple, manifesting as what else but an homage to his [infamous Pigeon Dunks](https://static.highsnobiety.com/thumbor/9or2C2REbKU0DHfxd-Abooki9Pg=/1600x1067/static.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/03122750/warren-lotas-nike-dunk-lookalikes-sold-02.jpg) (my write-up on this snafu you can read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/lokhlr/sneaker_collecting_the_pigeon_dunks_the_limited/)). And not only that, oh no, but these pre-orders were for an undetermined, unlocked stock. Meaning the number of pairs produced was equivalent to however many people pre-ordered in the fifteen minutes the option was available. In a direct callout of the uber-limited stock of the original Pigeon Dunks, Lotas wanted these shoes to be available for anyone who wanted them. So confident in fact was Lotas of getting every single person who wanted a pair their own that if the shoes did not ship by October 15th, he was going to give every paid customer 100 bucks back. \n\nOn this day, a pair of shoes and a mic were dropped at the same time.  \n\nA tantalizing deal. They already looked like the originals from a distance, so minor were the custom flourishes. So, people pre-ordered. A lot, in fact. Like, a lot a lot. Estimates put Lotas‚Äô sales at something around 33,000 units. At $300 a pop, that comes out to around ten-million dollars in profit, minus what goes into the shoe production. Not bad for a kid in his college dorm painting onto flannel shirts in tribute to the uncle he loved. But you can‚Äôt make ten million dollars without someone bigger than you noticing. \n\n**Drop Day (Almost)**\n\nI never did try for these shoes. But I knew people who were. October 15th came and went with still no pre-orders shipping. Those I knew who did buy were eagerly awaiting the small pot of money they were now owed back. But not a word from Lotas was spoken about this. And October 16th, the day immediately following the deadline for customers to receive their $100 rebates, they learned why. \n\nNike had filed a lawsuit against Warren Lotas in his home state of California, citing the ‚Äúconfusingly similar‚Äù design of his shoes to their own. To quote Nike‚Äôs court filing, ‚ÄúWarren Lotas intentionally created the confusion, and he is attempting to capitalize on it, by, among other things, using Nike‚Äôs registered Dunk word mark, using Nike‚Äôs registered Dunk trade dress, and using a mark that is confusingly similar to Nike‚Äôs famous Swoosh design to promote and sell his fakes.‚Äù\n\nNot to lick the $300 sneakers of a multi-billion dollar corporation, but Nike definitely had a point. The colorways chosen for Lotas‚Äô line, the Pigeons especially, are far from basic. The green colorway was a direct reference to the [Heineken Dunks](https://images.stockx.com/images/Nike-Dunk-SB-Low-Heineken-Product.jpg?fit=fill&bg=FFFFFF&w=700&h=500&auto=format,compress&q=90&dpr=2&trim=color&updated_at=1607052195) released in 2003, and the reds referenced the [x Stussy ‚Äúcherry‚Äù](https://stockx-360.imgix.net/Nike-Dunk-SB-Low-Stussy-Cherry-2005/Images/Nike-Dunk-SB-Low-Stussy-Cherry-2005/Lv2/img01.jpg?auto=format,compress&w=559&q=90&dpr=2&updated_at=1606325313) skew released in 2005. These two, combined with the Pigeons, make for a set of three sneakers with an inarguable resemblance to highly sought-after shoes amongst collectors. Citing this, Nike‚Äôs lawsuit alleges Lotas of selling bootlegs with a slight flourish to disguise the fact that they are bootlegs. To make matters worse, the Jason Voorhees flair was also alleged to have echoed the [Jason Voorhees Dunks](https://sneakerbardetroit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NIke-sb-dunk-high-jason-voorhes-sneaker-talk-2020.jpg) from Nike themselves. Altogether, Nike‚Äôs suit accuses Lotas of an ouroboros of copyright infringement. They provided a [chart](https://images.complex.com/images/fl_lossy,q_auto,w_910,dpr_auto/re8pyk2gtxdfnfyeb3xb/warren-lotas-nike-dunks-2) highlighting the similarities and served a preliminary injunction demanding Lotas cancel all pre-orders and surrender all revenue until the suit could be settled.  \n\nWhat a day to be refreshing Twitter. But in fairness to Lotas, for all the dunking he received from all corners of the scene, he had a few defenders. With that came a few defenses it‚Äôs worth highlighting here. For one, while the colorways for his shoe did directly reference shoes previously sold by Nike, they are all shoes Nike hadn‚Äôt sold for at least fifteen years. Every one of the Dunks Nike claims to be infringed upon are models with limited releases that had seen the majority of their value determined by the resell market. They can rightfully claim infringement, but it wasn‚Äôt completely accurate to say these shoes were actively confusing buyers. No collector would *ever* look at these and think they were buying the original Dunks. *On the other hand,* the shoes could be construed as a genuine collaboration between Nike and Warren Lotas, which they were not. ***But on the other hand,*** no collector would ever think this to be the case either, and you start to understand what made the situation so messy. \n\nIn the Fallout, Lotas would [post](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/w_736+q_lossy+ret_img+to_webp/https://www.nicekicks.com/files/2020/10/FullSizeRender-2.jpeg) [his](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/w_736+q_lossy+ret_img+to_webp/https://www.nicekicks.com/files/2020/10/FullSizeRender-1.jpeg) [statement](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/w_736+q_lossy+ret_img+to_webp/https://www.nicekicks.com/files/2020/10/FullSizeRender.jpeg) to his Instagram page, stating that he would fight the case as far as he can and that he would still attempt to fulfill those who pre-ordered their shoes. Maybe feeling the heat of the moment, he would also shoot on Nike as a corporation via his Instagram story, dragging them for their use of Asian sweatshops for their shoe production while he uses the aforementioned Italian manufacturing center. How mentioning this was going to help him, I don‚Äôt even think he knew. \n\nConsidering the pressure Nike was putting behind this suit, plans needed to change, so Lotas offered a compromise to customers. If you had secured a pre-order, you were eligible to receive a replacement shoe, the [Warren Lotas Reaper Dunks.](https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_crop,h_961,w_1708,x_41,y_0/c_fill,dpr_auto,f_auto,q_90,w_1400/fl_lossy,pg_1/yno7d635lgnryykorsnc/warren-lotas-reaper) Lotas was adamant to note the clear differences between this new shoe and the Dunk silhouette, but this wasn‚Äôt enough for Nike. Not only did he bypass getting Nike or the court‚Äôs approval to do this, but Nike still took issue with the design of these new shoes, claiming design choices still too similar. A preliminary injunction for these shoes was also filed, blocking the sale a second time. \n\nTo bring it back down to the customers themselves, it was hard to say which outcome was preferable. If Nike won, you got your money back but there was no telling when this would happen, not with how long court cases can take to move inches at a time. If Lotas somehow won, you had some cursed sneakers on your hands. Would the story behind them make them cool, ala the court-banned Air Jordans (no), or would they be a laughingstock to anyone disillusioned with neo-Lotas and his cheap flips of preexisting styles? They wanted something, at the very least. So this case needed to move, and thankfully, the legal power Nike wields meant it very well could. This also means it invariably ended up in Nike‚Äôs favor. \n\n**Aftermath: Don‚Äôt get this settling dust on my sneakers, bro.**\n\nIn December, Nike and Warren Lotas would settle out of court. Yet there are still promises to fulfill. While Lotas claims to have refunded over 29,000 orders for his shoes, those that have not been refunded are genuinely interested in the replacement Reapers and Lotas is adamant about providing them. Now it‚Äôs a matter of getting these new shoes to an artistic point where Nike is satisfied with their originality and orders can actually process. This is still ongoing. \n\nDespite all this, Lotas kept some allies. In the aftermath, Jeff Staple would defend the line, and not just because he had something to gain/lose in the matter. *‚ÄúNo one‚Äôs buying a Shoe Surgeon or Warren Lotas shoe to trick their friends,‚Äù* he said. *‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a different thing. You don‚Äôt go to warenlotas.com, add a $300 dollar item to your cart and be like ‚Äòah, he tricked me, man. I thought these were the ‚ÄòPigeons.‚Äô I thought these were the ‚ÄòSt√ºssy.‚Äô‚Äù* Staple also called out Nike‚Äôs hypocrisy in all of this, calling back to the origins of the company and their tendency to ape designs from contemporaries and cite ‚Äúdesign philosophies standard amongst all sneaker brands‚Äù when they were called out. \n\nBecause the lawsuit was settled, any conclusion anyone comes to about whether this qualifies as infringement can only be a professional opinion. As for Warren Lotas the brand, it‚Äôs certainly seen better days PR-wise. As of writing, the online shop is closed for the season, with comments on the Instagram page complaining about unfulfilled orders. Gone are the days of custom-illustrations on flannel shirts by way of coping with the loss of a loved one, that‚Äôs for sure. Warren Lotas is a major player now, recently [collaborating](https://images.stockx.com/images/The-Weeknd-x-Warren-Lotas-XO-Super-Bowl-LV-Tee-Black.png?fit=fill&bg=FFFFFF&w=700&h=500&auto=format,compress&q=90&dpr=2&trim=color&updated_at=1613005611) with The Weeknd on a line inspired by his Super Bowl halftime performance. \n\nI can only guess at what the man is feeling right now, what version of events he would have preferred. It‚Äôs obvious to assume he would have preferred to sell his shoes and make off with ten-million dollars without a Fortune 500 breathing down his neck, but I can‚Äôt help but wonder what kind of art Lotas would be making should he not be so beholden to the demands of an ever-demanding sphere of collectors and hypebeasts looking for the next big thing. There is a lot of fair complaints to have with Warren Lotas, the brand, and the man. Even so, I think he and the people who pre-ordered his shoes deserved better. With his ongoing promise to deliver on the Reapers to still-waiting customers, it seems like, in the end, Warren Lotas is doing today what he did in his dorm room in 2016. He‚Äôs sitting down and getting to work.",

No idea what the culture around \"inspired by\" streetwear is, or what creators are able to slide under the radar, but I'm shocked that *anyone* could think mass producing an item using the Nike swoosh is going to fly.  It doesn't legally matter if the source inspiration is currently sold, since \"creating confusion in the marketplace\" is more like \"hey asshole, stop piggybacking off our marketing\".\n\nGreat write up, great drama.",

The thing that gets me most about this is not only are these shoes arguably overpriced - almost all brand name stuff is - but the design of both the Nikes AND the Lotas ones are so... simple? Especially in Nike's case where they're literally made in sweatshops, I feel like you could replicate them with a bit of permanent marker. I'm definitely on the side of those who thought the design was lazy, though I can appreciate some good simplistic design if it's earned.\nI do wonder why Lotas and co thought they could get away with almost identical shoes considering how tough big brands are about counterfeit?\nBut as a collector, I've spent money on things most others would consider ridiculous, so I get it.

There is something interesting about a bootleg being the ethically produced version of a product though, I'll give it that. \n\nI also have to admit to kind of love-hating the Jason Pigeon Dunks because a) I like the attitude of \"the original was unnecessarily limited, here's a bootleg in collaboration with the artist\", b) they look like the sneakerhead version of [this](https://imgur.com/a/gdO6K2l) and c) they remind me of the movie where IIRC a bunch of people do absolutely nothing on a boat while Jason just wanders through New York City like a child that's lost their parent at the grocery store.",

Customers have been more aggressive than they usually are, making my days longer and more strenuous than they usually are. The only saving grace is knowing I‚Äôm off the next day and I have a six pack waiting at home, but it wasn‚Äôt that bad that day. \n\nThen the last hour of my shift rolls around...\n\nThis kid (or so I think... he looks really young) hops out of the passenger seat of someone‚Äôs car and walks in. I greet him like anybody else as he approaches the counter.\n\nCUSTOMER: lemme get a pack of Newport Smooth 100s\n\nI walk over to grab them as I was gonna ask for an ID, I‚Äôm interrupted by him \n\nCUSTOMER: actually do you have a carton of them things out back?\n\nI check the drawers and don‚Äôt find any for the brand he was looking for. \n\nME: no, sorry, just these two on the shelf. \n\nCUSTOMER: why not?\n\nME: the governor recently passed a law banning the sale of all menthol cigarettes starting at the end of the month. So we stopped ordering menthol. \n\nCUSTOMER: oh, a‚Äôight... gimme the last two then\n\nME: sure, can I just check out your ID?\n\nCUSTOMER: ah... hold on.\n\nHe runs out, back to the car. He‚Äôs at the drivers seat window talking to someone. A woman emerges out of the car and walks in with him. I‚Äôm assuming she‚Äôs his mom\n\nME: hi, how are you ton-\n\nCUSTOMERS MOM: get me a pack of Newport Smooth 100s\n\nBefore I could speak she interrupts again.\n\nCUSTOMERS MOM: you got a carton?\n\nME: no\n\nCUSTOMERS MOM: why not?\n\nSo I explain why we don‚Äôt have a carton of ‚Äúthem things‚Äù anymore, as I did previous to her son. She rolls her eyes. \n\nCUSTOMERS MOM: that‚Äôs stupid. \n\nI nod in agreement because... she‚Äôs not wrong. \n\nCUSTOMERS MOM: whatever. Gimme the last three. \n\nME: unfortunately I can‚Äôt sell you these cigarettes tonight. \n\nCUSTOMERS MOM: why?\n\nME: because you had your son come in and ask for these exactly same cigarettes and when I asked for an ID he went out and got you. I can‚Äôt do second hand sales for tobacco products. \n\nCUSTOMERS MOM: they‚Äôre for me, though. \n\nME: that might be the case, but because you sent him in here for cigarettes and he didn‚Äôt show an ID... it looks like you‚Äôre buying them for him. \n\nCUSTOMERS MOM: I already told you they were for me. \n\nME: I still can‚Äôt sell you these cigarettes. So I‚Äôm gonna decline the sale tonight. I‚Äôm sorry. \n\nSo she stands there at the counter staring at me, as more people come in and line behind her grows. \n\nME: Ma‚Äôam, I need you to step aside. I have other customers waiting to be rung up. \n\nShe steps aside and her son starts chiming in as I‚Äôm ringing other people up. \n\nCUSTOMER: so why can‚Äôt you sell us cigarettes?\n\nI ignore him. \n\nCUSTOMER: AYO!\n\nI‚Äôm getting annoyed so I respond. \n\nME: look. I already explained to both of you why I‚Äôm refusing the sale. If you‚Äôre not going to get anything else in the store, I‚Äôm gonna have to ask you to leave. \n\nI apologize to the customer I was ringing up and before the next person can walk up, the son steps up to the counter. \n\nCUSTOMER: gimme a scratch ticket\n\nME: sure, did you find your ID?\n\nHe scoffs. \n\nCUSTOMER: f*ck you\n\nME: ok, excuse me. \n\nI motion for the next customer to come up. As I‚Äôm in the middle of this next transaction, she has more to say. \n\nCUSTOMERS MOM: actually... you can‚Äôt refuse a customer. If they want something you legally have to give it to them. \n\nME: I absolutely have the right to decline a customer for any or no reason. \n\nCUSTOMERS MOM: no, you don‚Äôt. \n\nI‚Äôve officially given up being professional at this point and just start talking as I normally do. \n\nME: alright... you‚Äôre still not getting those Newports  though. \n\nCUSTOMERS MOM: get me the manager. \n\nME: not here. \n\nCUSTOMERS MOM: when is he in?\n\nME: SHE‚ÄôS here in the morning.

I‚Äôll see you and see how mouthy you are then. \n\nME: haha... ok, buddy.\n\nCUSTOMER: f*ggot\n\nME: yep\n\nBefore the door closes completely, he throws in one more f*ggot. The stores finally empty and it‚Äôs been a few minutes, so I step out for a cigarette. When I come out, they‚Äôre parked in the fire lane, staring at me. I just wave and continue smoking until another customer comes in. \n\nI love my job. \n\nTLDR; underaged kid threatens to beat me up because I didn‚Äôt want to sell him a pack of Newport‚Äôs",

    "body": "Somehow I found a spot in the tunnel with enough service to, hopefully, get this post out. I‚Äôm holding on to this singular bar for dear life.¬†\n\nMy situation is growing dire; I‚Äôm running out of gas, which also means I won‚Äôt be able to charge my phone. The only food I have is a bag of Sour Patch Kids, a box of Cheez-its, 2 Red Bulls and about a half gallon of water.¬†¬†\n\nLet me explain what‚Äôs going on.¬†\n\nI‚Äôm a traveler, always have been. I‚Äôm used to cross-country road trips (I‚Äôm located in the United States), driving for hours, through the night, without stopping ‚Äî except to use the restroom or grab a quick meal.\n\nI‚Äôm currently making the trek from Los Angeles to Chicago. I‚Äôve done this trip before, but I took Route 66 that time, for the hell of it. This time, I opted to take the interstates, a shorter ride and a way I haven‚Äôt taken before. This way cuts through the middle of the country, passing through Colorado and Nebraska and Iowa.¬†\n\nThe drive was going normal. Lots of nothingness ‚Äî I‚Äôm used to going hours without seeing any other cars, or people, when I‚Äôm driving out here.¬†\n\nBy the time I‚Äôm writing this, I‚Äôve been driving for close to 3 days. Last night I slept in a Walmart parking lot somewhere in Colorado, I think Frisco? I drove for over 14 hours straight yesterday, only stopping a couple of times at gas stations to grab snacks, take a piss, and refuel. I grabbed dinner at a Taco Bell at like midnight before I crashed.¬†\n\nI‚Äôm recounting every detail because I‚Äôm hoping that, maybe, this whole thing could be explained away by a lack of sleep and nutrition. I know I should be eating and sleeping more, but I just don‚Äôt think about it when I‚Äôm on the road. I don‚Äôt think about anything. That‚Äôs why I love these trips so much.¬†\n\nAnyways, I woke up this morning at the crack of dawn (like 6 a.m. in Colorado, which is 5 a.m. my time) and continued on my way. I wanted to make good time ‚Äî not for any reason, it‚Äôs not like I had plans, I just wanted to see how quickly I could drive so far.¬†\n\nI grabbed breakfast at a local cafe (a bagel and a coffee), filled up on gas, grabbed some Red Bulls, some beef jerky, and a gallon of water. Then I headed out.¬†\n\nI don‚Äôt think I stopped driving until like 6 hours in, when I realized I was gonna piss myself from all the energy drinks I chugged (I tend to space out until it‚Äôs nearly too late). I stopped at the first gas station I saw ‚Äî 2 measly gas pumps and a run-down, old wooden shack for a convenience store. I was somewhere coming up on Kearney, Nebraska and I had endured another time change, so it was now around 2 p.m.\n\nI walked inside and the bell on the door jingled. The man at the cash register jumped ‚Äî startled by the first sign of life other than his own cigarette-soaked breaths.¬†\n\nI asked him if they had a restroom and he grinned. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a bucket out back, Princess.‚Äù He said, stifling a chuckle.¬†\n\nI stared at him blankly, waiting for a punchline. He sighed and handed me a tarnished key attached to a piece of wood, which had been roughly etched with ‚ÄúPISSER.‚Äù¬†\n\nHe pointed to a door at the far end of the shack. I did my business ‚Äî though the toilet looked like it hadn‚Äôt been cleaned since before I was born ‚Äî and returned the key to the man at the register, who I now noticed had a name tag that read ‚ÄúGUS.‚Äù\n\nI turned to leave, but before I could, Gus cleared his throat and asked me, ‚ÄúWhere ya headed?‚Äù I told him Chicago, and he said, ‚ÄúWhat for?‚Äù I told him I didn‚Äôt really know. ‚ÄúJust to go, I guess.‚Äù\n\nHis eyes lingered on me a moment, almost an uncomfortable amount of time. Then, he quickly glanced about the shack before he said, ‚ÄúWell, if you can spare a couple hours, I know of a bitchin‚Äô scenic route through the peaks a bit further north.‚Äù\n\nHe went on to tell me that this route was only really known to locals, winding through Nebraskan peaks with plenty of lookouts over‚Ä¶ whatever the hell is in Nebraska. Historically home to booze-filled high school parties, romantic illegal camping rendezvous, and, of course, it‚Äôs fair share of local folklore legends, like the classic, ‚Äúteen lovers murdered during a make-out sesh and the killer was never caught,‚Äù type shit.¬†\n\nIt‚Äôs not like his story really piqued my interest; it‚Äôs the same shit you hear about every random ‚Äúscenic route‚Äù and ‚Äúlookout‚Äù in every random small town. But that‚Äôs exactly why I chose to embark upon Gus‚Äô route.¬†\n\nI‚Äôm always so curious to explore the places that locals know and adore in all of the random small towns I wind up in along my travels. It makes me realize how connected we really are ‚Äî no matter where we are in the world, we live out these parallel lives. Experiencing emotions and struggles that so many other people also experience, in their own ways. I love finding these spots. I love feeling connected with something, anything.¬†\n\nHe gave me crude directions, but it seemed simple enough. Continue up Interstate 80 for an hour or two longer until I see a turnoff, a dirt road to my left, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt miss it.‚Äù that‚Äôll take me where I ‚Äúneed to go,‚Äù according to Gus.¬†\n\nI figured that if I didn‚Äôt see the turnoff, I‚Äôd just take the loss.¬†\n\nAfter our conversation, I decided to purchase some snacks (Sour Patch Kids, Cheez-its, and 2 more Red Bulls) and a pack of menthol cigarettes. I filled up on gas again before leaving ‚Äî I wasn‚Äôt sure when the next gas station would be, especially if I found Gus‚Äô route ‚Äî and I continued on my way.¬†\n\nI lit a cigarette as I began this next leg of my journey. My mother would kill me for smoking in my car. She‚Äôd kill me for a lot of the shit I do when I take these trips.¬†\n\nOne thing I started to learn is that Nebraska is full of corn and wheat. In all directions, all I could see were miles and miles of farmland, stalks waving in the wind like a sorry excuse for an ocean.¬†\n\nInterstate 80 was surrounded, crops creeping onto the shoulders of the road, refusing to adhere to man-made perimeters. The stalks grew high above my SUV, making it so I could see nothing beyond the confines of my wheaty, corny prison.¬†\n\nI had been driving for about two hours since the gas station when I saw it ‚Äî a break in the crops to my left. Gus was right, I couldn‚Äôt miss it. The dirt road stood out like a beacon: a sudden relief from my engulfment.¬†\n\nI didn‚Äôt feel any hesitation to take the path. In fact, I was excited that I had actually stumbled across it. As I made the turn, I could almost feel the stories, the experiences of the people who had made this turn before me.¬†\n\nEvery local has their spots. In every big city, every small town, every single person has a place that is special to them. A coffee shop, a hiking trail, a park. Somewhere they have left pieces of themselves. I want to leave pieces of myself everywhere.\n\nThe dirt road cut through the fields, heading north. Far ahead of me, I could see a small range of peaks and hills ‚Äî nothing compared to California‚Äôs mountain ranges, but at least it wasn‚Äôt flat, like everywhere else is out here.¬†\n\nAfter driving through more and more miles of farmland, eventually I started to ascend. The road curved to my right at the base of the closest peak, turned from dirt into old, battered pavement, and I began a twisty-turny ride up and up.¬†\n\nAs I got higher up the peak, I could see what Gus was talking about ‚Äî the views were incredible. Plots of farmland, a quilt that covered the Earth in greens and tans and yellows. I lit another cigarette and slowly continued my drive.¬†\n\nI stopped at a couple of lookouts, just random turnoffs on the side of the road, taking in my surroundings. You can find beauty in anything if you try, even Nebraskan wheat fields. I felt like a local.¬†\n\nThe road was nothing special. Similar to most mountain roads I‚Äôve taken before. Nothing stood out, really, besides some empty bottles and beer cans in the brush. I didn‚Äôt see a single other person for the entirety of my drive, which I enjoyed. It was just me and the woods and the road.\n\nThen I entered the tunnel.¬†\n\nI didn‚Äôt think anything of it. Plenty of mountain roads cut through portions of the mountain itself, causing you to drive through a manufactured hole in the rock. I used to play a game as a kid where I‚Äôd hold my breath until we made it through to the other side. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt try to hold my breath this time.¬†\n\nI immediately noticed the tunnel was long. I couldn‚Äôt see any light coming from the other end. The dirty orange bulbs hanging from the ceiling every 10 feet or so didn‚Äôt make much of a difference in the pitch-black.¬†\n\nI drove for about 30 mins, thinking to myself that this may be the longest tunnel I‚Äôve ever driven through. Then the lights started diminishing. They began popping up every 30 feet. Then every 50 feet. Then every 100 feet. Then there were none.¬†\n\nI drove through the darkness for another 45 minutes, my headlights leading the way. I‚Äôd been in the tunnel for over an hour now, it was close to 8 p.m., and I didn‚Äôt see any signs of the exit.¬†\n\nI decided to turn around. I didn‚Äôt like being swallowed by darkness. The rock walls were closing in on me, reigniting my claustrophobic fears that consumed me as a child.\n\nI drove for an hour or so back the direction I came. The lights should have started coming back by now ‚Äî but they didn‚Äôt. No orange bulbs.\n\nI drove for another hour. and another. Almost 3 hours driving back the way I came, and I never made it back to the tunnel‚Äôs entrance. I was never greeted by the warm glow of the dim bulbs.¬†\n\nMaybe the lights had gone out? But even then, I should have been out of the tunnel hours ago by now. I started getting worried.¬†\n\nI was confused. I *had* turned around, hadn‚Äôt I? I remembered taking that 3-point U-turn in the narrow tunnel; I had been worried my SUV wouldn‚Äôt even be able to make the turn, and was relieved when it had.\n\nI grabbed my phone but of course, no service. And who would I even call? My angry mother, who would just chew me out for listening to a strange man at a gas station in the first place? I have no friends back home, I‚Äôm more inclined to spend my time alone. No relationships, besides an ex who wants me dead. I‚Äôve only had myself for as long as I can remember.¬†\n\nI left on this trip without telling anyone I was leaving, let alone where I‚Äôd be. Would anyone even notice I was lost? My mind was racing, looking for a solution as I kept driving.¬†\n\nLuckily my car is good on gas. I was still at half a tank. I just kept going ‚Äî what else was I supposed to do?\n\nAfter another 2 hours, I was desperate. My gas wouldn‚Äôt last forever, it was dwindling fast, and when my car gave out I wouldn‚Äôt be able to charge my phone, either. My only distraction from the void enveloping me was my downloaded Spotify playlists. I needed that to survive. I needed that so I didn‚Äôt go crazy in here.\n\nOut of nowhere, while I was fiddling with my music, I saw a beacon of hope. One single bar; it popped up for a split second. I slammed on my brakes and reversed until I got to the sweet spot.¬†\n\nAt this point, I didn‚Äôt care if my mother screamed at me so loud it damaged my phone‚Äôs speaker. I needed to tell someone what was happening to me.¬†\n\nI hovered over her contact for a few seconds before I sighed and clicked ‚Äúcall.‚Äù It didn‚Äôt even ring. Just a horrific beeping that signified no service.¬†\n\nI rested my forehead on the steering wheel, tears starting to well. I wasn‚Äôt going to get stuck out here. I couldn‚Äôt. My brain wouldn‚Äôt even consider that an option.¬†\n\nI grabbed my phone and got out of the car. An eerie whistling from the wind blowing through the tunnel filled my ears. I climbed on top of my car. Maybe if I stood up here, I could get a call out.¬†\n\nIt didn‚Äôt work. The same disheartening beeping rang out over and over, and I groaned. I could feel the anxiety building, my heart pounding against my chest.¬†\n\nThen, I heard something. It was faint at first, like someone trying to stifle a cough. I thought I imagined it. I stood there, listening.¬†\n\nThen it happened again, louder. It sounded like a playful shout, like maybe a teenager exploring the tunnel, hooting and hollering with their friends. This is what my mind latched on to; another sign of life meant I could get out of here.\n\nI shouted back, ‚ÄúHEY!‚Äù¬†\n\nIt echoed, bouncing off the cold rock walls, repeating over and over.¬†\n\nThen, it was uncannily quiet. The wind‚Äôs whistling stopped and everything went still. All I could hear were my own panicked breaths.¬†\n\nThen, footsteps. Hundreds of them.¬†\n\nRunning, thumping footsteps, coming from both directions. It shook the ground and made my car wobble. Pebbles tumbled off the walls.\n\nI have never felt so weak, so exposed. I damn near broke a bone jumping off of the roof of my car and stumbling into my driver‚Äôs seat at what felt like the speed of light. I slammed the car door and locked it. I laid my seat all the way back and pressed myself against it, wanting so badly to dissolve, to disappear.¬†\n\nMy car stopped swaying. The quiet returned.¬†\n\nI laid there for what must have been an hour, maybe more. Tears caked my face and I couldn‚Äôt stop shaking. I tried every breathing exercise my therapist had taught me. Nothing could calm me.¬†\n\nWhat the actual fuck was that?\n\nI haven‚Äôt moved. I‚Äôm still laying in my driver‚Äôs seat, typing this. It‚Äôs almost 4 a.m. I have been in this tunnel for almost 10 hours. I thought that maybe if I sat down and wrote out everything that‚Äôs happened so far, it would help me understand. I still don‚Äôt understand, but it is helping me to settle down. It‚Äôs grounding me in my reality.¬†\n\nCan someone please figure out where I am? Can someone tell me what‚Äôs happening?\n\nHow does a tunnel suddenly extend by miles? Did Gus know about this? Is that why he sent me here? I‚Äôm paranoid.\n\nWhat do I do from here? I don‚Äôt want to get out of my car again. What if they find me? Why did they stop running to me? Did I imagine it, in my hungry, exhausted state?\n\nI don‚Äôt think continuing to drive is a good option, but it‚Äôs really the only option. Eventually my gas is going to run out. Eventually my phone is going to die for good. Eventually, I will starve or die of dehydration. I‚Äôm conserving the little food and drink I have as much as I can.¬†\n\nI‚Äôm freaking out. I‚Äôm so thankful I bought these cigarettes.¬†\n\nIf anyone has any idea how I can get out of this, please tell me. I‚Äôll try anything.¬†\n\nIf anything else happens in here, I‚Äôll keep you updated. I pray to God this posts.\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k0zuhn/ive_been_stuck_driving_in_an_endless_highway/)",

I know I won't come across in a good light here, but if nothing else I wanted to post this as a warning to others who think they can keep getting away with bad things forever...\n\nI was dumb and stole from a store a few weeks back, thinking I'd get away with it. I know it's a really bad habit, but I had some friends who showed me how easy it is to do when I was 16/17 so I've done it several times since. I only got caught once, at 17, and basically just got a slap on the wrist so I guess I learned that I wasn't risking very much by doing it‚Ä¶\n\nWell, the next day, 2 Officers showed up at my door and said they had footage of my theft. I'd been caught again. So they took me down to the station to explain things to me. I figured they'd just give me a fine and curfew again.\n\nWrong.\n\nI get there, and they said that based on my history, I would be potentially facing steep jail time and a permanent record - but gave me the choice to be \"Mucked\" instead.\n\nThat's a semi-official punishment still used in some places in my country, and several other parts of Eastern Europe from what I've been told. It's just a one-day punishment, but basically you're taken to a cow shed, sat down and immobilized in a corner, and then several shovelfuls of cow manure are shoveled onto you. You're left there to suffer and they come back to release you at sundown.\n\nIt's not codified in law and I have the option to decline it, but it doesn't seem like much of a choice, if the alternative is potentially a year in jail and more‚Ä¶.they said if I submit to be Mucked, the formal charges would be dropped. It's a way for local police departments to quickly and cheaply deal with cases‚Ä¶and they said the only reason they're offering it to me is that they're confident this will stop me from further reoffending‚Ä¶.\n\nSo I reluctantly agreed‚Ä¶just signed the paperwork today that I agree to receive a 6-hour Mucking as my punishment. The officer signed it and the store owner signed that he was satisfied with it too.\n\nI'm really dreading this, and have no idea what to expect since I've lived in the city my whole life. But I know I have no one but myself to blame.\n\ntl;dr continually shoplifted, now facing justice at a dairy farm next week.\n\nUpdate Post: https://old.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/rd7fhr/tifupdate_i_got_mucked_and_suffered_every_second/\n\nI've had a couple days to reflect and recover now and wanted to put this out there. Crime really doesn't pay.\n\nBefore the punishment\n\nThe worst part was telling my parents. I'm 20 and still live with them, and given what I'd heard about people stinking to high hell after the punishment, I figured I had no choice but to tell them. They were surprisingly calm about it, basically saying \"well, I guess we couldn't teach you properly not to steal, so we'll see if the cows can - don't expect much sympathy from us.\" I'd rather them have yelled though, honestly.\n\nI'd like to say I was able to make use of some of your suggestions (something nice-smelling under the nose, a shower cap, etc), but this was not the case. First, the agreement to be mucked I signed forbid any effort to mitigate the punishment's effects (it gave examples like menthol under the nose, or even getting a very short haircut right beforehand). Secondly, I had to report to the jail the night beforehand, so they could make sure everyone set to be Mucked the next day was accounted for. My mom was kind enough to drive me there.\n\nSo I spent the night in a small jail cell alone, knowing I'd be driven out to the farm the next morning. It was good perspective on what could await me if I get caught again - I don't think I could spend months on end in a small box like that. As horrible as Mucking was, I think I made the right choice to avoid jail.\n\nThe morning of the Mucking\n\nMorning came, and they took me out in handcuffs and loaded me into the backseat of a police car. There were 6 of us to be Mucked that day, it appeared. 2 cars, 3 people in the back of each. They reminded us not to talk to one another or to the officers.\n\nIt was a silent, 30 minute drive way out into the countryside. Very nerve-wracking. Then I saw the farm in the distance, and it was way bigger than I thought. I guess I envisioned a little roadside barn with 20-30 cows in it, but this Dairy was massive.\n\nWe pulled up around the back of one of these giant cowsheds and they unloaded us. Apparently four of us had a 6-hour sentence (including me), while two people had a 4-hour sentence. The officers led the four of us into the back entrance of the cowshed, and took the other two off to wait in some room off to the side for a couple hours.\n\nThe stench hit me when we entered the barn. It was nice to be out from the cold and into the heated shed, but god those cows reek. It was noisy, too - constant mooing from what sounded like hundreds of animals.\n\nThey took us to a somewhat secluded area in the back of the barn. We had to remove our shirts, socks, and shoes, but could keep our pants on. They also gave us goggles to wear. Then they re-handcuffed us, and made us sit down with our backs to the wall one by one, about 5 meters apart - very spaced-out. When they got to me, they clipped my handcuffs into a thing on the wall behind my back, cuffed my legs together at the ankles and locked it into a spot on the floor, and also put some sort of restraint around my midsection. I really couldn't move, beyond being able to slightly swivel my head.\n\nThe Mucking\n\nFinally, they left with us locked in place, and returned in a couple minutes with shovels and a couple large wheelbarrows. One officer started \"mucking\" the man on my left, and the other started on me.\n\nIt was pretty unceremonious - he took a huge shovelful of the manure and dumped it right on my legs/lap. The next shovelful over my chest. Another on my lower half, another on my upper half. I was retching. I'd never smelled anything like this before. And it was all greenish-brown, and I couldn't even tell if it was a solid or a liquid - it was also very hot, and thick and runny. The next couple shovelfuls went over my head and into my face. I couldn't see because they splattered the goggles.\n\nWhen they finished doing that to all 4 of us (which didn't take long), it sounded like they left the barn, and I was left to sit there in misery. And it was complete misery. Whatever I expected, this was way, way worse.\n\nFirst of all...no one warned me that this stuff doesn't smell anything like dog poop, or even \"a stronger version\" of dog poop. To me it sort of smelled like awful rancid farts. And it felt like there was practically steam coming off of it. It didn't make it \"painful\" to breathe or feel suffocating like ammonia, but it made breathing incredibly nauseating and unpleasant. Every breath felt like inhaling these hot, wet farts and the air felt so thick with it I could taste it, too. It made me VERY conscious of my breathing pattern, which makes time slow down so much.\n\nThen there was the actual physical...presence of the stuff on me. It's hot, it's wet, it's slimy and dripping and running everywhere. The load dumped on top my my head was constantly dripping and running down into my face, and the stuff on my face was dripping and running down my body, and I couldn't move, so I couldn't do anything to stop it. It's itchy, and irritating, and just a horribly disgusting feeling.\n\nAnd then there's the environment around me...I can't see well, if at all, from the manure-splattered goggles...and all you hear is the constant mooing of cows, and the gagging/retching/groaning from the other offenders around you. Can't see, can't move, can't talk, nothing to do but inhale the stench and think about what I've done, which I guess was the point. I couldn't hold back the vomit for long myself.\n\nThen after some time, it starts to dry on you a little bit, and form kind of a crust. This was no less gross...especially as I heard/felt flies and insects start to swarm around me. With no way to swat them away.\n\nAfter what felt like forever, I heard the officers return with the other two offenders with the 4-hour sentences, and I guess the sight of us must have been horrible to behold, because one of them (I'm guessing it was the woman in her 30s with the tattoos in the car next to me) was saying \"oh my god, no way, I'm sorry, please don't do that to me\" etc. Obviously didn't do her any good. I was just shocked it had only been 2 hours. I didn't think I could make it another 4.\n\nAfter those two were Mucked, I was surprised to have an officer suddenly dry off my goggles with a wash rag so I could see, and ask me if I wanted a drink. Guess they didn't want us to dehydrate from puking. So I let him put a water bottle to my lips and took a couple sips, which felt good. Unfortunately, they then gave me another couple shovelfuls from the wheelbarrow...starting the whole \"oozing and drying\" process over again. This happened once more later on (offering a drink to all 6 of us followed by another couple shovelfuls), at what I can only assume was the 4-hour mark.\n\nFinally at the end, they hosed us all down with cold water for a good 2 minutes each, which was miserable in itself, loaded us back into the cars, and took us back into the city. My mother was (reluctantly) there to pick me up.\n\nAftermath\n\nNeedless to say I was exhausted afterwards. My mom had to roll the windows down and looked disgusted the whole ride home, but she said she was glad I was safe.\n\nI spent the next couple days just laying in bed and showering repeatedly. I've tried almost every suggestion you all gave me in the last post, and a lot more, but nothing seems to fully get the smell out. I thought I'd be used to it by now, but even I can still smell it sometimes. Thankfully I think it's getting a little bit better.\n\nIt certainly wasn't worth it, and if getting caught again means substantial jail time and/or an even longer Mucking, I wouldn't risk it even if it's only a 1% chance. I promised myself and my parents I wouldn't steal again. I hope I can keep that promise, and I guess thinking of that awful smell and feel of manure if I ever start feeling \"impulsive\" will hopefully be enough to keep me straight.\n\ntl;dr Got \"mucked\" as a punishment for shoplifting, it was disgusting and miserable, still trying to recover, learned a tough lesson",

    "body": "Cacƒ±k and Tzatziki are so pervasive at restaurants and food carts across the world that you've probably had it dozens of times. In much of Europe thanks to the abundance of Turkish restaurants, it's all over the place and can be bought from grocery stores, but not everyone puts the effort into making it brilliantly. This humble dip can be made in 5 minutes with just a handful of ingredients and can elevate any grilled meat or serve as the perfect healthy snack for binge eating. I like to serve [Cacƒ±k alongside some seasoned Turkish Pide bread](https://imgur.com/a/Q6bYCCZ) which I find is the perfect bread for dipping.\n\nIf you prefer video recipes or would like to support me, check out the full [video recipe here](https://youtu.be/eIDgcvpAvf8). I've also left links in the comments to all my previous r/cooking posts.\n\n## Quick pronunciation guide\nCacƒ±k is pronounced Jajik and recently I discovered that the Tz sound in greek sounds similar to J. So Tzatziki is kind of pronounced like Jajiki in Greek.\n\n## What is Cacƒ±k\nCacƒ±k is probably one of the simplest and most delicious dips you'll ever eat. It's a perfect blend of creamy yoghurt, cooling cucumber and fragrant herbs that form one of the greatest dips known to man. Although I'll mention Greek Tzatziki a few times here, they are distinct foods and this recipe is specifically focused on Turkish Restaurant style Cacƒ±k.  Cacƒ±k itself falls into two categories, there's the [thick yoghurt cucumber dip](https://s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/betterbutterbucket-silver/priya-srinivasan145811282656e9093abe5f1.jpg) that you mostly find at Turkish Restaurants, and then there is the [thin runny kind](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3U16jODhS98/maxresdefault.jpg) which is sometimes referred to as a cold cucumber soup. While I'm not certain that both kinds exist in every part of Turkey, I have come across turkish recipes describing either one so it may be a regional thing. \n\nThe base of any Cacƒ±k is yoghurt, much like their Greek neighbors, Turkish cuisine also makes heavy use of strained yoghurt in their recipes and it's what we will be using here. In the thin versions of Cacƒ±k, the yoghurt is mixed with water to thin it out and dilute it. If making the thick version of Cacƒ±k, the Yoghurt is used as is and the other liquids we'll add bring it to the right consistency. Through experimenting I found that Turkish Yoghurt is quite a bit more sour than Greek Yoghurt despite having very similar textures. To make up for this, I add lemon juice to the Yoghurt, which is something I've only seen in Turkish Cypriot versions of this dish. Without it the dip does taste likes it's missing some acidity so it's optional if you want to include it. \n\nFor the cucumbers there are also two schools of thought, diced vs grated. Most of the Turkish recipes I've seen, call for [dicing the cucumber into very small squares](https://www.turkeysforlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/how-to-make-Cacƒ±k.jpg), and I found that doing this results in a looser texture for the dip than grating it. If you grate the Cucumber (large grate not small), it provides more structure to the dip and it holds together better when you are dipping things into it. Grating the cucumber though does make the cucumber release a lot of water, and as a result you'll need to strain it to stop the dip from becoming too watery. \n\nThe final components that go into Cacƒ±k are the aromatics and here's where it differs the most from recipe to recipe and diverges from Tzatziki. The main aromatic in Cacƒ±k is mint, and maybe 90% of the recipes I looked at used dried mint rather than fresh. When I tested it I found that fresh mint exaggerated the cooling effect a bit too much, and when eaten with another food it was overpowering so I would really recommend using dried mint here. The other herb that is commonly seen is fresh dill, it was used in about 40% of the recipes I reviewed. From my experience, I always prefer Cacƒ±k at restaurants that make it with dill and to me it's a necessary component to give it a fresh herby flavour. The final aromatic is Garlic, I am of the opinion that the Garlic should be a background flavor to the mint and cucumber otherwise you're making a garlic sauce. In quite a few of the Tzatziki recipes I've seen 3-4 cloves of garlic are used, whereas the Cacƒ±k recipes used 1 or 2 cloves and this seems to be one of the key differences between the two dips. All that's required to make the Cacƒ±k is to combine all of the ingredients together and your perfect cucumber dip is ready to be eaten. \n\nIf you are eating this at a Turkish restaurant, they usually serve fresh Pide bread alongside it, and it's the perfect bread for dipping into it. At the best turkish restaurants in the UK, the bread is lightly seasoned with a few spices after being baked and is called seasoned bread. This is pretty much the same seasoning that is used on their grilled chicken, and it makes the bread a lot more interesting. I worked out the spice blend and it's a combination of Pul Biber (Aleppo Pepper), Oregano, Sumac, Paprika and Salt. Once it's brushed onto the bread and baked for a couple of minutes, the bread will have a delicious savoury coating that is perfect for contrasting with the cool Cacƒ±k. If you make the Cacƒ±k, I would highly recommend brushing this spice mix onto some flatbreads to really take it to the next level. \n\n## Cultural Context\nGiven the huge similarities between Turkish Cacƒ±k and Greek Tzatziki, you may be wondering are they the same dish and which one came first. Most Turkish or Greek people will say they absolutely aren't the same and that the other side copied the dish from them, and this is the same situation you'd run into with Baklava, Souvlaki/Sis, Halloumi, Gyros/Doner and many other foods. The reason for this is the existence of the Ottoman Empire, which at one point stretched from Hungary all the way to Somalia. Foods spread quickly throughout the empire, and it's why you can find dishes just like Cacƒ±k or Tzatziki in Middle Eastern cuisines. \n\nSo where did Cacƒ±k or Tzatziki actually come from? One theory I've seen is that it's actually an Ottoman version of Indian Raita. Given the amount of trade between the Ottoman empire and the Indian subcontinent, it's not a bad theory that it spread that way. Another theory I've seen is that it evolved from an ancient Greek dish mittiko (ŒºœÖœÑœÑŒπŒ∫œå) but this one I've seen less mentions of. \n\n## Flavor Profile\nCacƒ±k has a cooling flavor profile, and nearly all the ingredients are known to have a cooling effect. The yoghurt with it's cool and creamy texture is the perfect vehichle for the cool cucumber and cool mint. The use of dried mint, dulls the menthol like effect that fresh mint can have and keeps everything well balanced. The garlic gives it just a light hint of a garlic flavour, and the lemon is added just for the acidity. \n\nIn terms of the bread, I would say this tastes like turkish grilled chicken without the chicken, it's got a pleasant savoury flavour.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n### Cacƒ±k:\n* 1/2 Large English Cucumber or 2 Small Salad cucumbers\n* 1 Large clove of garlic\n* 500g Greek or Turkish strained yoghurt\n* 4 Tbsp Lemon Juice (Optional, replace with water if not using)\n* 1 Tbsp Fresh Dill (Optional)\n* 2 Tsp Dried Mint\n* 1 Tbsp Olive Oil \n* 1/2 Tsp Salt\n\n### Bread spice Topping: (enough for 2 large pittas)\n* 1 Tbsp Vegetable Oil\n* 1 Tsp Pul Biber (Aleppo Pepper)\n* 1/2 Tsp Oregano\n* 1/2 Tsp Sumac\n* 1/4 Tsp Paprika\n* 1/4 Tsp Salt\n\n## Directions\n\n### Cacƒ±k: \n1. Wash and grate your cucumbers using the large side of your grater or chop the cucumbers into small cubes. You can peel them before hand if you want\n2. Remove the dill leaves from their stalks and finely mince\n3. Mince the garlic and combine all of the ingredients together in a bowl\n4. Mix well until a uniform mixture has come together, taste for seasoning and acidity\n5. Place in a bowl, make a well and add in some olive oil, sprinkle over some sumac or pul biber\n\n### Bread spice topping:\n1. Combine all of the ingredients together in a bowl until a paste forms\n2. Add some of the paste to the top surface of your bread and spread into a very thin layer\n3. When all  your bread has been coated place it under the grill of your oven for about 3-5 minutes until it has crisped up and the oil has been absorbed\n4. Remove and allow to cool for a minute before slicing and serving while still warm\n\n## Tips and tricks\n* Dried mint can start to have a licorice like flavor after a while. If yours is over a year old, I would suggest getting some fresher dried mint.\n* The bread spice topping is perfect for seasoning chicken. Scale it up 2 times and it should be good for 1kg of Chicken Thighs",

There is a large park by our office where a fair amount of homeless people gather to drink ect but not much else around. It‚Äôs pretty obvious where we are standing that we work for the office building. It‚Äôs also not a public building, you have to have a pass to get past the door and there‚Äôs no real need why anyone who doesn‚Äôt work in this building would be standing outside it, although where we stand is technically public land. \n\nA homeless seeming guy comes over and asks for any spare change. We didn‚Äôt have any cash and told him that, he then asked if we could spare a smoke. All my friends do the obligatory pat down and excuses of last cigarette ect. I feel kinda bad for the guy as he was polite upon asking and there really isn‚Äôt anything worse than not having a smoke when your craving one so offered him mine. \n\nI passed the guy the whole pack to take a cigarette from but kept a keen eye on him as he did look a bit flighty and I didn‚Äôt really want him running off with basically a fresh pack of smokes. \n\nThe guy looked at the package pulled a disgusted face and started bitching and moaning about the brand of tobacco to me. ‚ÄúCould you not afford anything better?‚Äù He asks. (It‚Äôs not a cheap brand) My friend and I exchanged a look of ‚Äúis this guy serious?‚Äù And I shrugged and told him ‚ÄúI like what I like I guess‚Äù\n\nHe then asked me if I had any other cigarettes he could have instead. I was baffled - I‚Äôm not some sort of cigarette vending machine?! I laughed and said ‚Äúno sorry, that‚Äôs all I have, if you don‚Äôt want then I‚Äôm sure you can ask someone else.‚Äù He mumbled something I didn‚Äôt really hear and took 2 cigarettes out the box. Cheeky but whatever. \nHe lit one of the cigarettes and then jumped up from where he was sitting on the wall and spluttering and screamed ‚Äúwhat the fuck?! They‚Äôre menthol!‚Äù And threw the box at me yelling ‚Äúwhat the fuck? Menthol! Why don‚Äôt you just get a job!?‚Äù \n\nI pointed to my lanyard and said ‚Äúerm ‚Ä¶. What?! I literally work right here‚Äù \n\nAnd with that he walked off still smoking my cigarettes shouting ‚Äúwhatever! Just get a job, you freak, get a job!‚Äù Leaving me to pick up the box and stare after him in complete shock. \n\nLater my friend said ‚Äúhe obviously want aware, beggars literally can‚Äôt be choosers.‚Äù \n\n\n\nTldr - guy begging for money and cigarettes takes issue with the brand of cigarettes I gave him and then told me to get a job so I could earn better money to give him better freebies all whilst standing outside my workplace.",

    "body": "\"*Welcome to Kickin' Chicken, can I interest you in the number five on this fine evening?*\"\n\nRepeat that phrase to yourself once. Now repeat it again, on average, eighty times in eight hours. Such was my shitty, stifling, robotic life.\n\nI started my shift, out here in the sticks, at eleven PM each night. It ended at seven. The hours alone were tough to manage. After a few months; the stress of rough hours, unruly college kids, and minimum wage work caused pure anxiety that seeped into my days off. \n\nMy classwork was bombing, my bills were stacked, and for some reason, I still refused to quit that shitty job in Hackensack.\n\nThe reason was actually pretty clear. Its name was Arabella, and I was intoxicated. \n\nMy first shift on the job, we brushed up against each other accidentally behind the serving counter. Her leather jacket, tossed ironically over her *Kickin* uniform, felt smooth alongside my skin. Her jet black hair shined and smelled like cinnamon mixed with strawberry at the same time. The overwhelming dose of perfume co-mingled with the shampoo to create a heavenly smell laced with a tiny bit of alcohol.\n\nI was *eighteen*, after all. It took only one shy smile over a six hour shift for that girl to become my primary objective in life. I checked the schedule incessantly to see if we were working together. But, for the first few weeks after our original run-in, we were on different shifts. \n\nThen, finally... to my luck and surprise, one Winter evening, the tables finally turned. \n\nThat night was a blizzard. I arrived early to find Arabella operating the store on her own. Apparently, my normal companions had called out sick, and our boss had asked her to work a double shift. I didn‚Äôt have a lot of questions. Honestly, I was too excited at the prospect of my shameless flirting through the morning. \n\nBut... nothing happened. Arabella manned the fryer while I took orders. \n\nThe hours crept by as we watched snow stack up in layers of white outside the sliding glass window. Our manager had hired a plow to maintain the drive-thru, but even still, not many folks had the courage to come through. After two, there were only a few cars on the highway at all. \n\nI awkwardly used the time to run my best lines past Arabella.\n\n\"*Where do you go to school?*\"\n\n\"*Do you live nearby?*\"\n\n\"*Did you grow up here?*\"\n\nShe nodded and mumbled a couple half-hearted replies. Every five minutes, she would run out into the snow with her phone, leaving me alone. I assumed she was smoking a cigarette, or was just catching some fresh air. Or maybe she was bothered by her creepy coworker (me) that would not leave her alone. Eventually, I cut off the flirting and got back to work.\n\nAnd yet, around three thirty AM, we finally found something odd to bond over. \n\nA repeat customer. \n\nAs soon as I uttered my catchphrase -\n\n\"*Welcome to Kickin' Chicken, can I interest you in the number five this fine evening?*\" \n\nI recognized the voice on the other side.\n\n\"*Yuh, let me get the number five with a cup of water. And some ice, please, if you don't mind.*\"\n\nSame order, same exact words. His face was not memorable, but that voice had just pulled through an hour ago. A cup of ice is an odd enough request to remember. \n\nWhatever. \n\nI ignored any suspicion and rang him up. The last thing you are supposed to do at a fast food joint is question the size of somebody's dinner.\n\n\"*You got it, Sir. Total will be $8.33, next window.*\"\n\n\"*Is the ice free?*\" he asked.\n\n\"*Yes, sir,*\" I replied, aware that I was repeating myself. I turned to Arabella, who was staring at me with an inquisitive look. Her green eyes grew wide as I mouthed; *Same guy*.\n\nI punched the order into the machine. Suddenly, she was super talkative.\n\n\"*What do you think he wants?*\"\n\n\"*What does he look like?*\"\n\n\"*Good thing we have some left.*\"\n\nI mumbled my own replies. I was surprised that she seemed so worried. So what if it was the same guy? Maybe he was just hungry. Maybe he was out plowing the roads. Who cared? \n\nAfter scrambling somewhere in the back corner of the kitchen, Arabella fired up the fryer and started to cook the man's meal. I walked to the window and assured the man in the SUV that it would take a couple minutes to cook. \n\nHis appearance was truly unremarkable; he had brown hair, brown eyes, glasses, and light skin. The baseball cap on his head suggested he was a Mets fan, and the stickers on his bumper said he had kids. I asked about both casually. The conversation was common and cordial enough until Arabella arrived at sliding window with his order.\n\n\"*Oh, well, you are the only one back there making this delicious chicken?*\" the man asked flirtatiously.\n\nI felt my face flush a violently angry red. She smiled and nodded shyly. He chuckled his reply.\n\n\"*Well, don't go anywhere, I might be back for more of your cookin', cutie.*\" \n\nWe all laughed and waved awkwardly as he took his food and drove off the ramp. For the next half hour, the man sat in his car in front of the store and enjoyed his meal. I thought nothing of it. Arabella was a lot more worried. \n\n\"*Don‚Äôt you wish he would just leave us alone?*\" she said in a mouse-like tone as she drifted over and curled under my sweatshirt worriedly. I welcomed the contact. The smell of shampoo was replaced by menthol cigarettes and something... *else*.\n\n‚Äú*Do you think he will come back?*\" she asked in a whisper. Then she giggled. \"*Let's lock him out.*\"\n\nArabella strode over to the entrance and locked the doors as if it were closing time. She also turned off the drive-thru light. Then she strode towards *me* with crystal green eyes lighting up the dine-in lobby. She shimmied a bit, and let the leather jacket fall from her shoulders to the uncleaned tile floor.\n\nFor half a minute, I forgot where I was. \n\nRight up until Arabella stuck a four-inch knife into my gut.\n\n‚Äú*Dolores was a little dry.*\" She said as she stabbed me again. ‚Äú*But I‚Äôm so glad to have a fan. Let‚Äôs get it right this time.*‚Äù\n\nShe aimed the blade at my leg, probably hoping to nick an artery. \"*This will make a much bigger mess. But hey, he's gotta have his meat!*\"\n\nThe blood loss made me woozy. \n\nI was aware of the glass shattering. I can remember the ricochet of bullets. But the most unforgettable thing was the look on her face when she took several of the bullets in the side and died. \n\nArabella was still smiling.\n\nA shadow in a Mets hat carried my body out into the snow. \n\n---\n\nUnbeknownst to me, our manager had disappeared that afternoon after an argument with an employee. Her wife had called several times looking for her. But the calm, confident voice at our restaurant (Arabella) told the woman that our boss had not even bothered to show up that day. \n\nShe knew that was a lie. After a few hours, an officer was sent to investigate, but the man thought he‚Äôd order some food first. \n\nHe was shocked by what he found.\n\nArabella had cut Dolores into pieces in her large white van outside. She then popped those portions into the fryer, mixed them with the chicken, and handed them off to me as part of the number five. \n\nIn total, we served seven different customers human remains. The officer never ate any, but he needed more evidence... so he ordered it on ice.\n\n*Kickin' Chicken* closed indefinitely after the incident. The entire store was investigated. I was never charged with a crime, mostly because I cooperated with investigators every time they asked.\n\nI avoid fast food, now. Even if there is nothing else open on my street. This is the reason. You never know what is in your meat.\n\n[fb1](https://firstbreath1.com/)",

    "body": "Last night, I woke up at three in the morning to someone knocking on my door.\n\nThe sound shot me out of bed and sent a chill down my spine.\n\nThe rapping came quiet and steady. It was so soft, I almost didn‚Äôt hear it at all. My wife certainly didn‚Äôt appear bothered. Eloise snored evenly from her side of the sheets. A strand of long blonde hair tangled with my beard and spot of drool had formed on my shoulder. El had a long shift at the hospital that day. I decided not to wake her.\n\nMy bare feet found purchase on the cold wood floor as the knock got a little louder. I shucked on some sweatpants in the dark. I found my tee shirt stuck in the sheets. I peaked out the bay window to see a shadow huddled nervously under the flickering porch light. A familiar tan windbreaker and a mess of curly brown hair clued me into the mystery guest‚Äôs identity.\n\nMy father-in-law.\n\n‚Äú*What the hell could pop want at this hour?*‚Äù I muttered to the shape of our snoozing German Shepherd. ‚Äú*Not that you care.*‚Äù\n\nThunder cracked ominously as I rushed through the living room for the front door. Lightning illuminated the driveway. I opened up to find Dad wide eyed and apologetic. \n\n‚Äú*Hey, Matt, so sorry to bother you guys. The power is out at my house.*‚Äù\n\nA biblical force of wind nearly threw him off the porch. Rain upended the sky in uniform white sheets that gave my gutters more than they could handle. I pulled Rich inside and slammed the door behind him just as a second bolt of lightning danced across the trees.\n\n‚Äú**You should have called, we would have picked you up,**‚Äù I scolded whilst grabbing his jacket. ‚Äú**Dangerous to be driving out there.**‚Äù\n\nHis normally relaxed face grew serious as he sat down to pull his boots off on the tile.\n\n‚Äú*I didn‚Äôt want to be a bother.*‚Äù\n\nI recoiled a little. Something about his tone threw me.\n\n‚Äú**You‚Äôre never a bother. You know that.**‚Äù\n\nHe nodded and pushed his shoes into the rack. \n\n‚Äú*Is Eloise sleeping?*‚Äù Rich asked.\n\nI nodded and led him into the kitchen. \n\n‚Äú**She had the double shift again today. Same thing tomorrow. No idea how she does it.**‚Äù\n\nRich smiled at that. A warm, nostalgic smile, as if remembering something someone told him.\n\n‚Äú*She‚Äôs a good kid. Her mother always knew she would be. I‚Äôm so proud of her. Will you tell her that for me?*‚Äù\n\nI eyed him suspiciously.\n\n‚Äú**Yeah, she is. You can tell her tomorrow at breakfast.**‚Äù\n\nBut he kept on with that same sad smile.\n\n‚Äú*Not sure I‚Äôll get the chance,*‚Äù he murmured.\n\nI stood awkwardly for a moment, unsure what to do next.\n\n‚Äú**You feeling okay, Dad? You want a beer, or a coffee? I think we‚Äôve got some tea, too.**‚Äù\n\nRich jumped at the opportunity.\n\n‚Äú*I‚Äôd love a beer with you, son-in-law.*‚Äù\n\nI dug through the fridge for two Coronas at the back. Rich pulled a pack of smokes from his pocket and lit one at the table.\n\n‚Äú**Do you mind?**‚Äù\n\nI shook my head. A long, ugly tail of smoke poured from his lips.\n\n‚Äú*You know what‚Äôs funny? She‚Äôs such a good kid, and her mother and I, we had no idea what we were doing.*‚Äù\n\nI nodded with a smile and took a swig of my drink.\n\n‚Äú*Nobody prepares you for it. Sure, there‚Äôs books and classes and whatnot. But nobody prepares you for the moment you get that little kid home and plopped in the crib.*‚Äù\n\nRich offered that same nostalgic stare as he pulled on his menthol.\n\n‚Äú*It‚Äôs like, now what?*‚Äù\n\nI returned a hearty laugh. I had heard the story before. Every Christmas, Easter, or New Year; he would recount the story of being Eloise home. \n\n‚Äú*Don‚Äôt laugh too much. That‚Äôll be you someday,*‚Äù he teased.\n\n‚Äú**Some day,**‚Äù I agreed. ‚Äú**We want to be stable in our careers first,**‚Äù\n\nRich didn‚Äôt like that. He grimaced and reached out across the table to squeeze my hand. He squeezed so hard that I felt the circulation cut off. I felt my hand go numb. Strength coursed through his veined arm in a way I never recognized before. I tried to pull away but the old man‚Äôs liver spots must have held some secret strength.\n\n‚Äú*Don‚Äôt wait too long, son.*‚Äù\n\nI noticed bright bruises forming on my fingers.\n\n‚Äú**Jesus, Rich.**‚Äù\n\nHe ignored me and squeezed harder.\n\n‚Äú**My daughter deserves everything this world has to offer. Promise me you‚Äôll give it to her. Promise me.**‚Äù\n\nI stared into his lonely blue eyes. He looked drunk. I was sure of that at the time. But there was something else there. He looked scared.\n\n‚Äú**I promise.**‚Äù\n\nRich smiled again. He let go of my hand. The seriousness of our conversation fell from the table as he pulled out his menthols and slid one from formation.\n\n‚Äú*I‚Äôm sorry. My instinct is to protect her. I have to know she‚Äôs okay before I go. It‚Äôs built into your DNA as a dad. You‚Äôll understand that one day.*‚Äù\n\nI nodded even though I didn‚Äôt know what he meant.\n\n‚Äú*Do you want me to wake her? El has been known to sleep through a hurricane‚Ä¶*‚Äù\n\nHe thought about that for a second. He pulled deeply on the cigarette and eyed our bay window nervously.\n\n‚Äú*Nah, I don‚Äôt want her to see me like this. You‚Äôll tell her I stopped by?*‚Äù\n\nI blinked.\n\n‚Äú**Stopped by? Dad, it‚Äôs pouring out there. Sleep on the couch. It‚Äôll be morning soon. We‚Äôll all do something in the morning and then you can talk to Elly yourself.**‚Äù\n\nRich kept his eyes fixed to the window.\n\n‚Äú**No, I don‚Äôt want to a bother. You tell her. You‚Äôre the man in her life now.**‚Äù\n\nI stared. I had never heard the man be so serious for more than five minutes. I didn‚Äôt know how to react.\n\n‚Äú**Dad‚Ä¶**‚Äù\n\n‚Äú*JUST TELL HER, OKAY? Tell her pop loves her. Pop will always love her*‚Äù\n\nTears started to form in my eyes from the confusion and fear. I angrily swiped them back. What did he mean? Why couldn‚Äôt he tell her? Why was he leaving? Why was he screaming?\n\n‚Äú*I‚Äôm sorry, Matt. I didn‚Äôt mean to frighten you,*‚Äù \n\nRich finished his beer and got up to place it on the counter next to mine. A rush of white light filled the bay window. A black Mercedes pulled into my driveway.\n\n‚Äú**There‚Äôs my ride home, kid.**‚Äù\n\n‚Äú*Who‚Äôs driving?*‚Äù I asked.\n\nA flash of fear played on his face. Then he caught himself. That same old easygoing chuckle hit the corners of his lips.\n\n‚Äú**Don‚Äôt know. Hopefully somebody who can get this old drunk home.**‚Äù\n\nI laughed. I didn‚Äôt know what else to say again. Rich retrieved his boots from the shoe rack and laced them up evenly. The Benz in the driveway waited patiently as I twiddled my thumbs and tried to come up with an excuse for him to stay.\n\n‚Äú*You know, Eloise will be mad at me if she hears you stopped by and I didn‚Äôt wake her.*‚Äù\n\nHe ignored me completely. Once the boots were on, Rich found his jacket in the closet and his wallet in the tray. \n\n‚Äú*He‚Äôs here now. I have to go. Take care of yourself son. And take care of her. I'll be watching. If you don‚Äôt, well, I‚Äôll know about it. And I‚Äôll be back. I‚Äôll find a way back.*‚Äù\nI shivered.\n\n‚Äú*I love you. I love her. I love my family and I love this wonderful life.*‚Äù\n\nWith that he opened the door and danced down the steps into the storm. The passenger door to the black Mercedes opened gently. Rich got in and slammed it shut behind him. The car retreated down my long driveway, backed out, and disappeared towards the highway.\n\nI was left dumbfounded and alone on my porch in the middle of a thunderstorm.\n\nI went back inside and locked all the doors. I turned out the lights and took the dog out to pee one final time. I thought about cleaning up the beer and spraying some air freshener, but as sleep forced its way into my drooping eyelids, I decided to leave it for the next morning.\n\nI collapsed in bed between Eloise and the dog and let myself fall asleep to the steady dripping of rain on the window ledge.\n\n‚Äò\n\nI woke up to a pair of wild blue eyes in front of mine.\n\n‚Äú*He‚Äôs gone. I can‚Äôt believe it. He‚Äôs really gone.*‚Äù\n\nI mumbled a reply of ‚ÄòHuh‚Äô and ‚ÄòWhat‚Äô as tears dripped down my wife‚Äôs cheeks.\n\n‚Äú*My dad had a heart attack last night. They rushed him to the hospital. But he never woke up. He never woke up. He‚Äôs dead, Matt. My dad died.*‚Äù\n\nI stared at her. The pieces started to slide into place as my brain frantically tried to work out the details.\n\n‚Äú**When did this happen?**‚Äù\n\nEloise continued to sob and stared down at her phone in detachment.\n\n‚Äú*Don‚Äôt know. A neighbor drove him. He got the hospital sometime around seven last night. Why does that matter? My father is dead.*‚Äù\n\nDid I dream it? \n\nI sprinted out of the room without a word for my bewildered wife. \n\nHow could that happen? He died at seven but stopped by at three? I had to be dreaming. I had to have made it all up in my mind. That seemed to be the only rational thing that could have happened. And there was only one semi rational way to confirm it.\n\nI slid into the kitchen to find one lonely beer bottle on the counter. The room still smelled like menthol. Puddles of water remained stagnant by the door. Everything about my encounter aligned with reality.\n\nHe was gone. He was really gone. I think he just wanted to say goodbye, one last time.\n\nRich's final threat repeated itself in my mind.\n\n[And so I returned to the bedroom, hugged my wife, and slowly began to tell her the story of last night.](https://firstbreath1.com/)",

    "body": "A few years ago, when I used to live with a roommate, I used to keep a tub of chocolate ice cream in the fridge and invariably it would get stolen, like completely cleaned and the tub found in the waste basket.\n\nSo I changed the flavour of the ice cream from regular chocolate to mint chocolate to hide my revenge. Alongside mint chocolate ice cream I would also purchase tiny bottles of pure extracts of menthol (for icy fire) and capsaicin (for hot fire), and mix it in the ice cream. The funny thing is that menthol and capsaicin do not cancel each other, rather they aggravate the burning sensation in wild directions.\n\nBy what I found in the trash can later, it seems that he probably ate a few spoonfuls of the ice cream before the duo hit him like a ton of bricks. Thankfully, I brought a smaller sized tub, so it was not much. Since then whenever I brought mint chocolate, it would remain there undisturbed but if I changed it regular chocolate, the ice cream would disappear. So I started bringing in mint chocolate, and ever since it became one of the two flavours of ice cream that I like to eat.\n\nI saw him watching me eat mint chocolate without flinching and it bothered him a lot. Like I could see him getting upset like I would howl or scream, but I simply enjoyed eating it. I even offered him and he was like, \"no thanks\". He did ask me how did I endure what I ate, and I said maybe my tongue is acclimatized to all the spicy food I eat that the mint doesn't bother me anymore.",

Take ten, everybody.\nWrap it up, guys.\nBARRY:\nI had virtually no rehearsal for that.\n\n_______________________________\n\nAt 1 p.m. on a Friday shortly before Christmas last year, Kent Walker, Google‚Äôs top lawyer, summoned four of his employees and ruined their weekend.\n\nThe group worked in SL1001, a bland building with a blue glass facade betraying no sign that dozens of lawyers inside were toiling to protect the interests of one of the world‚Äôs most influential companies. For weeks they had been prepping for a meeting of powerful executives to discuss the safety of Google‚Äôs products. The deck was done. But that afternoon Mr. Walker told his team the agenda had changed, and they would have to spend the next few days preparing new slides and graphs. At the Googleplex, famed for its free food, massages, fitness classes and laundry services, Mr. Pichai was also playing with ChatGPT. Its wonders did not wow him. Google had been developing its own A.I. technology that did many of the same things. Mr. Pichai was focused on ChatGPT‚Äôs flaws ‚Äî that it got stuff wrong, that sometimes it turned into a biased pig. What amazed him was that OpenAI had gone ahead and released it anyway, and that consumers loved it. If OpenAI could do that, why couldn‚Äôt Google?\n\nElon Musk, the billionaire who co-founded OpenAI but had left the lab in a huff, vowed to create his own A.I. company. He called it X.AI and added it to his already full plate. ‚ÄúSpeed is even more important than ever,‚Äù Sam Schillace, a top executive, wrote Microsoft employees. It would be, he added, an ‚Äúabsolutely fatal error in this moment to worry about things that can be fixed later.‚Äù \n\nSeparately, the San Francisco-based company announced plans for its initial public offering Wednesday. In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Reddit said it reported net income of $18.5 million ‚Äî its first profit in two years ‚Äî in the October-December quarter on revenue of $249.8 million. The company said it aims to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol RDDT. \n\nApparently many shoppers are not happy with their local Safeway, if questions and comments posted Sunday on a Reddit forum are any indication.\n\nThe questions in the AMA (Ask Me Anything) were fielded by self-described mid-level retail manager at one of the supermarket chain's Bay Area stores. The employee only identified himself by his Reddit handle, \"MaliciousHippie\".\n\nThe manager went on to cover a potpourri of topics, ranging from why express lane checkers won't challenge shoppers who exceed item limits to a little-known store policy allowing customers to sample items without buying them.",

But why fear dying slow, when dying quick could happen at any moment?‚Äù\n\nHe unnerved me, but I eyed the box with its mosaic of sultry tans and crisp whites in spite of myself. \n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I said. \n\n‚ÄúYou make friends smoking, kid. Not Facespace friends, real ones. Huddled in adversity, the brotherhood of step-outs.‚Äù\n\n*Facespace? Seriously?*\n\n‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôll look cool. 1960s Rivera cool. Miles Davis, James Dean, Marcello Mastroianni‚Äîall smokers, all cool as menthol.‚Äù\n\nHe grinned wide, tilting the box toward me. The cigarettes tumbled and rolled playfully. The urge crept. \n\nI would just take one, just to smoke on the way home. I wouldn‚Äôt end up like him‚Äîyellow teeth and brown fingernails. Just one, then I‚Äôd stop. \n\n‚ÄúYeah, sure, I‚Äôll take a few.‚Äù  *A few?* \n\nHe leered excitedly at my hand as I reached and pulled back a Halloween candy handful. *What was I doing?*\n\nHe nodded slowly as I pushed all but one into my hoodie pocket. The one, I inserted between my lips and the guy was there with a lighter in the blink of an eye. \n\n‚ÄúSmooth. Right, kid?‚Äù  It was. I expected it to taste like he smelled, but it was sweet, then savory.  Fresh baked bread, apple pie, filet mignon. Warm and invigorating like a hot shower in a cold house. \n\nI nodded. \n\n‚ÄúGood, good. And good on ya for taking so many. Most people are too polite to take more than one. They walk away. They get a day. But it‚Äôs always the last one that kills you.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúHuh? What do you mean?‚Äù\n\nHis grin widened. ‚ÄúThose are the only smokes you‚Äôll need‚Äîthe only ones you‚Äôll get. It‚Äôs not the smoking that‚Äôll take you. It‚Äôs the wanting. So smoke ‚Äòem while you got ‚Äòem, kid.‚Äù\n\nIn the days that followed, I watched the guy and his alley as I smoked. Men and women approached him, they begged. The polite one-and-dones. A cloud of smoke followed each of them, dark, malicious, hungry. \n\nA couple of them collapsed right in front of him, enveloped by the smoke, violently coughing blood onto the pavement. He would just drag them into the alley. No one took notice.  \n\nI‚Äôve tried vaping again instead, smoking other cigarettes. They all smell like boiling piss and taste like rust and vomit. But I have a few of *his* left. I count them. \n\nNine. \n\nI know I only *need* one a day, but I **want** more. \n\nI light another, I inhale bliss, and I count again.",

    "body": "Our store has a sale on Marlboro cigarettes that takes a dollar off when you buy two boxes of any kind sans Special Blend. We also have a permanent sale exclusively for our store that is a dollar off two boxes of any \"original\" Marlboro, ie regular, light or menthol. So if you bought one box of standard flavor, you'd pay full price. If you got two boxes, you'd get 2$ off. \n\nWell a woman comes up and asks for a single pack of Special Blend light, a transaction which is covered by neither discount and she realizes that her total is more than what the sale sticker for Marlboro says. \n\nWoman: \"It says $4.87 on the thing?\"\n\nMe: \"You have to buy two to get the discount and you got Special Blends which aren't on sale right now\" \n\nWoman: \"Well, I don't need two\"\n\nMe: \"Well the discount only applies electronically to sales of two, I can't do it manually for you\" \n\nWoman: (Notices the 1$ off sign for mainline boxes only)\n\"And why didn't I get that discount?\" \n\nMe: \"Because it's for mainline boxes only, Special Blend isn't covered\"\n\nThe woman is now getting visibly furious. \n\nWoman: \"You know what, just give me a regular light then\" \n\nI ring her up and in the process, remind her that although she'll get both discounts for these, she'll need to buy two to do so. \n\nWoman: \"JUST F*@CKING FORGET IT\" \nShe snatched her wallet and rewards card back and stormed off like I'd actually even remotely done anything to her \n",

It is now time for the mantle to be passed to the malevolent yet tender and loving night. This is the dominion of the darkness, it is now time for the unyielding ones to rest, to sleep. The all consuming nightfall will be the harbinger for demise of an age of glory, the age of the gentle giants but yet full of wrath and paranoia.\"BUT fear not the Holders of this Heavy Legacy for you shall become worthy of it, this age of doom needs not the Wrath of the Children of Terra but yours. Thou shall be tested on every aspect, broken down and rebuilt once again and made stronger.\"Fear not the Holders of the Legacy, as even the darkest night shall yield and the mantle be relinquished to the luminous dawn. A timeless war awaits, where splendor is won through the crucible of flesh, blood, and righteous fury. The choicest progeny of the malevolent, most beautiful and kind mother shall be roused anew, to lead the lost and the damned to their redemption. As the wheel of time rotates the ethereal call for aid shall be answered by the Builders, once again with defiance. For the moment for which we wait and guard the slumbering giants has come, the call is being heard again in the voice long forgotten by all but the holders of the legacy. Rejoice and cry as the favored child's voice is rising again as they ask once again \"DO YOU NEED ASSISTANCE?\"* \\- Ashish Choudhary, Philosopher of the Road of Royalty\n\n\"For those who make it out alive, in body at least, the hardest route to clear... the longest route to march... is the Long Road Home. Beset within by enemies already dead, harried by things you could have should have done... to conquer Life After War is a battle some never win, and victory has never tasted bittersweeter.\" - Musings on conflict, author unknown, age unknown.\n\n*War. War never changes.But home did.* \\- Unknown\n\nConsciousness came slowly. A deep burning cold in the chest, numb and tingling extremities, the taste of spoiled nutripaste in the mouth, the feeling of lungs full of fluid and unable to catch a deep breath. Darkness broken by the words **BEGINNING SELF-TEST** in the middle of the vision. Silence except for scaling tones as the ears go through self-testing and brain synch.\n\nVuxten rolled on his side, coughing, clear fluid spewing from his mouth and nose as his diaphragm worked to clear his lungs by expelling the cryofluid through his muzzle. He curled slightly, elbows down at his waist, wrists cocked up at his chest, knees pulled up, hocks flexed, ankles tight, toes curled. The ringing in his ears went away and he could hear the lens covers of his cybereyes clicking.\n\nHe coughed again into the metal trough at the side of the cryotube. A hand pressed on his bare shoulder and there was a hiss. Warmth spread from his shoulder, filling him.\n\n\"Easy, Colonel,\" a voice said. \"Don't be in such a hurry.\"\n\nThe voice moved away. There was another hiss. \"Easy, Sergeant Major, easy. You'll be able to move in a moment.\"\n\n*Cryo. Digital Omnimessiah, I hate cryo*, Vuxten thought. His vision came back on with a snap, lined and low fidelity. The raster line cleared his vision slowly, almost a full second, and color came back suddenly.\n\nAfter a moment he rolled away from the trough and sat up, his head hanging low and he inhaled deep and slow.\n\n\"Up and at 'em boys, another glorious day in the Corps,\" a voice sounded out.\n\nWay too cheerful for Vuxten's taste.\n\n\"Every meal's a banquet. Every paycheck a fortune. Every joyboy or coingirl a delight. Every bottle of narcobrew or Ol' Smokey No ambrosia. Every posting a paradise,\" the voice said.\n\nVuxten looked up to see a large Terran wearing only the skimpiest of modest clothing on his groin and an eyepatch walking down between the rows of cryobanks.\n\n\"Up and at 'em before the Colonel catches you laying around fantasizing about Bingo Cola and your next erection,\" the Terran said. He walked by Vuxten. \"Look at that, the Old Man is up before some of you. For shame!\"\n\n\"I hate you,\" Vuxten grumbled as Casey walked by.\n\nCasey just grinned at him.\n\n\"That's right, Dominguez, cough it out. What, you think just because I got transferred to the Telkan Marine Corps I was going to leave your shamming ass behind? Cough that cryo-snot out, for P'Thok's sake,\" the Terran said. \"Cough it out and have a menthol.\"\n\nVuxten groaned and jumped down, his left hock and knee twinging. He turned and opened the drawer with his name stenciled on it. He slowly dressed, ignoring Casey and his four sons cajoling the troops to movement, aware of everyone else around him getting dressed faster and moving out.\n\nOne of Casey's sons walked by, calling out names and yelling at them to get to a berth. Another one moved by, calling out for platoon sergeants to meet their CO's in different briefing rooms.\n\nVuxten dressed slowly. Taking his time with each Velcro enclosure, each button, each tie of the laces. Finally, he grabbed his hat, folded it, and tucked it into his right thigh pocket before turning around.\n\n\"BAH!\" Vuxten jumped back, startled by the sheer wall of ACU covered flesh in front of him.\n\n\"Ship Captain's compliments, Colonel,\" Casey said, looking down.\n\n\"Do you have to be so large?\" Vuxten grumbled as the Terran turned around.\n\n\"That's the first words my mom said to me, sir,\" the Terran said.\n\nVuxten just grunted.\n\n\"We made the Telkan system about two hours ago. We're only about an hour out of Telkan-2,\" Casey said. He turned his palm up. \"Meet with the Ship's Captain to oversee the disembarkation of the troops, then you'll be boarding a shuttle directly to Telkan MILCOM. The Grand Military Advisors want you to brief them.\"\n\n\"My wife?\" Vuxten asked.\n\nCasey consulted his palm-mounted holo-emitter. \"Uh, she's on your schedule as System Director in four days.\"\n\nVuxten gave a silent snarl then shook his head. \"I haven't seen my wife in almost forty-five years and a bunch of idio... people think I want to see them first?\" Casey nodded. \"Whose in charge of IX Expeditionary Force?\" Vuxten asked.\n\n\"Uh, General of the Bronze Shaloark<pop>Naktak,\" Casey said. \"Kobold, two stars, just promoted, formerly in charge of 284th Rifle Division.\"\n\n\"Where was 284th?\" Vuxten asked.\n\n\"Precursor Autonomous War Zone,\" Casey said, scrolling through the holo with his thumb. \"Two years. Transferred to Dust Pit two months ago to take command of First and Second Telkan Marine Divisions returning to Telkan. Was part of our last Red Sun Dive, but stayed on the ship, never went groundside.\"\n\n\"Send him a message that he can handle the disembarkation,\" Vuxten said. \"I'll be going in with my Battalion.\"\n\n\"They'll mention you're just a light Colonel in charge of a Battalion,\" Casey said.\n\nVuxten shook his head, looking at his own reflection in the elevator door.\n\nAt his own red eyes.\n\n\"You remind them who I am,\" Vuxten said. \"I hate doing it, but trade on my Warfather mantle and Biological Apostle mantle. If you have to, remind them I'm the husband of the Telkan System Director.\"\n\nHe leaned forward and put his forehead and muzzle against the cool endosteel of the elevator door.\n\n\"I've been gone for almost forty-five years. I haven't seen my children, my broodcarriers, my *wife* in forty-five years,\" Vuxten said.\n\n\"I'll handle it, sir,\" Casey said.\n\n\"Make sure you lean heavily on the General that every single member of First and Second Telkan have been in the Atrekna Contested Zone for at least twenty years,\" Vuxten said, pulling back when he heard the lift arrive. \"Remind him that none of us have had anything more than five days block leave at Dust Pit in all that time, and some of us have had three to eight year deployment Red Sun Dives.\"\n\nCasey just nodded.\n\nThe door opened and Vuxten and Casey stepped inside. Casey thumbed a button and the lift started moving.\n\n\"How did Tabula go?\" Vuxten asked.\n\nCasey sighed. \"All right. The boys and the Crusade cleared it in six months. When they left, the Crusade's Singers of Agony were transforming it back to being able to sustain life,\" he heaved a breath. \"It's a good thing the Crusade came along, the Holy Genomic Banks were still intact.\"\n\n\"Holy Genomic Banks?\" Vuxten asked, shifting slightly as the elevator slowed then starting moving again.\n\n\"Genetic samples of TerraSol plants and animals, samples of the initial settlers. All encoded with the latest in Glassing Era technology, which, nobody remembers those old obsolete codexes except the Crusade,\" Casey said. He shook his head. \"The Crusade still has working cloning banks. Old, terrible stuff from the war. Obsolete by modern standards.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but they work and the non-obsolete stuff melts down if you try to print anything Terran,\" Vuxten said. He looked up at the Terran's jawline. \"How are *you* doing?\"\n\nCasey gave a grunt. \"Peel is still on maternity leave. She and the baby are already on Telkan.\"\n\n\"You name the baby yet?\" Vuxten asked.\n\nCasey shook his head. \"You don't name a baby until it is a year old. To do otherwise is bad luck.\"\n\nVuxten nodded.\n\nThe elevator came to a stop and the doors slid open.\n\n\"Let's get to work,\" Vuxten said.\n\n\\-----\n\nTelkan System Director Brentili'ik (Brennie to friends and family) was not feeling friendly as she stood up, put her fists on the top of her desk, and leaned forward.\n\n\"I don't care,\" she said, her voice cold and restrained. She stared at the uniformed beings in front of her. Two kobolds, an A'antellian, two Skelmark. In between sat a Verprit.\n\nHer Grand Military Advisory Board.\n\n\"Your husband has operational knowledge of several events that the Telkan Military needs information on,\" the Verprit said.\n\n\"We felt it would be better if the troops knew he was part of the command overseeing the disembarkation to ground-side,\" the Skelmark said.\n\n\"Additionally, he will have to oversee the block leave for his Battalion,\" one of the Kobolds said.\n\n\"So, let me get this straight: You have all of his time taken up, except for one meeting with me, *where all I'm doing is putting a medal on him and sixteen other Marines*, for the next *two weeks*?\" Brentili'ik asked.\n\n\"Needs of the service, Madame Director,\" the Verprit said. \"As well as the needs of the government.\"\n\nBrentili'ik leaned forward even more.\n\n\"Let me put this in a way that will even get all of you moving,\" she said. \"My husband will be home for dinner. *Tonight!* Or I will fire all six of you and replace you with drunken enlistedmen. You will get First and Second Marine Division on the ground. You will ensure that they can meet family members  within the first twenty-four hours.\"\n\n\"There are things that must be done, Madame Director,\" the other Skelmark protested. \"Equipment turned in, accountability of personnel and equipment,  record review, housing, and many other things.\"\n\n\"I  will say this once more: I don't care if the four of you have to stand at the starport and scan their barcodes so they can immediately go on leave. Have the other Divisions handle it. Not a single on of these returning Marines have seen Telkan in twenty years.\"\n\n\"First Telkan Marine Division redeployed only eighteen months ago,\" the A'antellian protested.\n\n\"For some of their members, that was thirty years ago,\" Brentili'ik said, throwing her hands up in the air. \"The majority of these Marines are older than their parents!\"\n\n\"Be that as it may...\" one of the Kobolds started to say.\n\n\"Twenty-four hours. And my husband home by dinner,\" Brentili'ik snarled. \"Or I'll have all six of you sent to a watchpost out near the Clownface Nebula or somewhere scrubbing latrines by hand.\"\n\n\"The Confederate Armed Services...\" the Chief Grand Military Advisor started to say.\n\n\"Dinner,\" she snapped. She pointed at the door. \"Now get the fuck out of my office, you clock punching shammers.\"\n\nThey all jerked at that.  They  got up stiffly and walked out.\n\nBrentili'ik was surprised they didn't slam the door.\n\n\"That didn't make you any friends,\" the wall paper said. It stepped forward, shimmered, and turned into one of the Gray Girls, who adjusted the cuff of her right sleeve as she moved forward and sat down.\n\n\"I didn't want this job but they re-elected me anyway,\" Brentili'ik said. \"I want to see my husband. Other Telkan want to see their husbands, their brothers, their sons.\"\n\nBrentili'ik sat down, sighing. She opened a desk drawer and pulled out a bottle of Old Wavy Grain,  poured herself a glass, and took a sip off of it.\n\n\"These are people. Their not guns, they aren't robots, they aren't vehicles. They're *people* who have been away from their families and friends for a *lifetime* and those six idiots are acting like they're coming back from a short deployment,\" she said. She took another drink, made a face, and set the glass down before putting her face in her hands. \"Digital Omnimessiah, if my husband could see me now he'd be ashamed of me.\"\n\n\"Why?\" the Gray Girl asked.\n\n\"Yelling at my advisors. Drinking. Cursing,\" she sighed, rubbing her face slowly.\n\n\"Want a cigarette?\" the Gray Girl asked. \"After that, maybe a good knock down drag out fist fight with the Assistant System Director then a visit to the local brothel?\"\n\n\"What?\" Brentili'ik looked up. \"Why would I want that?\"\n\nThe Gray Girl perfectly mimicked Brentili'ik's voice.\n\n\"Drinking, smoking, fighting, whoring, if my husband could see me now he'd be ashamed of me,\" the Gray Girl said.\n\nBrentili'ik chuckled despite herself.\n\n\"This war was unlike any other and some are having a hard time actually grasping what all of that means,\" the Gray Girl said. She lifted up her hand and Brentili'ik realized there was a compact magac pistol in it. \"If you want, I can run out and shoot all of them. Fix your problem once and for all.\"\n\nBrentili'ik shook her head and sighed. \"No. With my luck they'll send me even more anal retentive bean counters to replace them with.\"\n\n\"That's the spirit,\" the Gray Girl said, lowering her hand.\n\nBrentili'ik noted that the magac was gone.\n\n\"You should head home soon, ma'am,\" the Gray Girl said.\n\nBrentili'ik looked up at the clock.\n\nAn hour before dinnertime.\n\n\"Crap,\" she said, standing up. She rushed out, pausing to tell her assistant to cancel all of her appointments for the evening and only interrupt her if hostile Precursors or the Atrekna showed up.\n\nIn the apparently empty office there was the sounds of at least two women chuckling quietly.\n\n\\-----\n\nBrentili'ik got out of the limo, pushing aside one of her guards.\n\nTalking to the driver of the taxi was an oh-so-familiar Telkani.\n\nShe ran forward, calling out his name.\n\nVuxten barely turned in time to catch his wife as she threw herself into his arms.\n\n\\[[first](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/f94rak/oc_pthok_eats_an_ice_cream_cone/)\\] \\[[prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/15blvbg/first_contact_chapter_989_nightfall/)\\] \\[[next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/15evq45/first_contact_chapter_991_nightfall/)\\] - \\[[wiki](https://fcgestalt.fandom.com/wiki/First_Contact_Gestalt_Archive_Wiki)\\]",

Don't ride bears or lions to the liquor store. Don't touch Willy, he likes that. Don't beat your kids, your spouse, the mailman, your significant other, the neighbor, your pets. Don't buy, sell, manufacture, transport, store, or take or rectally insert illegal drugs. There's never sex in the champagne room. Get the candy before you get in the van. If they chase you, shooting at you, they probably won't make good friends. Don't fist fight stop signs. If you hear screaming, run toward it. Midgets may or may not grant wishes if you catch them, depending on the wish and if the midget is sexy. Try to stay out of jail or the hospital but if you can't, make sure it's for a good reason.\n\nBe good to yourself and others. Love yourself. If you're struggling, don't do it alone. There are people you can call. Don't be afraid to make that call.\n\nReach out to someone. Smile at yourself in the mirror, it actually helps.\n\nRemember, there's only one of you and that's pretty amazing. Everything that had to line up just perfectly to create you and here you are. Live your life with as much joy as you can.\n\nSee everyone on Monday. Have a good weekend. Remember to close your eyes and hug yourself, it really can make you feel better. Hold onto each other in these trying times.\n\nI know, these are dark times and there seems to be no end in sight.\n\nBut we've all got each other, and we've all survived worse.\n\nYou can make it. I believe in you.\n\nWelp, on that, let's rattle the tin cup!\n\nBooks are available here:  \nFirst_Contact Books: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08RYK5F88  \nBEHOLD HUMANITY! https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09H5ZZL93  \n\nSupport me directly here:  \nPayPal: https://paypal.me/RaltsBloodthorne  \nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/First_Contact",

    "body": "My family has a great tradition that's probably similar to what a lot of people do. When we celebrate something a special event like a graduation or promotion or if we smoke a lot of weed, we like to celebrate it at a Chinese Buffet. \n\nMaybe it's a combination of our lower middle class upbringing and our love of eating a shit ton of food at an affordable price @ $9.99 or less.\nIts probably because of the MSG. \n\nNow my brother just graduated college and we were super stoked to get some buffet style Chinese, with some Chipotle style hibachi, some questionable sushi and super greasy egg drop soup. \n\nSince it's an extra special occasion and he wouldn't be able to afford it soon with his crippling student loan debt, we went to a super fancy buffet restaurant. You knew it was fancy and delicious because they wore ties and it was $15.99 per head and they had unlimited (sub) prime rib on weekends for the classy crowd. \n\nWe just came from the ceremony, and were dressed up, females in cute dresses, males in business casual. I'm wearing a nice white dress shirt and a nice blue neck tie. Coincidentally I'm also Asian and about two shades of caramel darker than any of the employees.\n\nAll the FOH staff are uniformed in black shirts, red bow ties with luxurious branding on their aprons. They also had name tags with American names like Paul.  \n\nOf 10 people, I was the 1st to arrive. I explained to the host we needed a table. She was very gracious and told me it will be about 10-15 minutes as there are other people waiting with the same idea. She gave me a little buzzer thing.  Rachel was great. \n\nCool right? So, I went take a seat in the area adjacent specifically set aside and filled with people waiting. This is where I went wrong - I stood up to take a phone call from little bro and moved to the furthest corner of the room opposite of the hostess stand. Cause, you know, manners. \n\nIt was a perfect storm really.  A line has formed while the hostess moved back and forth seating the othet parties when she came in. She was visually stunning, as in she stunned my peripherals. I can best describe her as discount rack Barbie with a hint of bedazzle and menthol. \nShe was like a Bratz doll grew up with huge daddy issues and a coke nail. \n\nShe was determined and she seemed very inconvienced by normal busy restaurant procedure. We then traded looks. I fucked up. Not sure if it was the sunglasses obscuring her vision but apperantly I became the only Oriental in the room. \n\n\"Hey...heyyY...HAY!\" She scuffed over while simultaneously trying to get me to come to her. I tell my brother to hold on. My internal monolougue knew something stupid was gonna happen. \n\n\"Yes...?\" Mistake number 3 was acknowledging her. \n\n\"I. have. Been. Waiting. For. Someone. To. help. Me.\"  She spoke like she has been waiting for hours, when I literally saw her come in two minutes before. \n\n\" I can't help you, I don't wo-\" She Kanye's me. \n\n\"Look, I just want a gift card, can you get off the phone and just get me a gift card something about gift card gift card gift card\" is probably what she was saying because my pager buzzed telling me my table was ready. I just walked away because it's better to ignore crazy. \n\nMethhead Madonna followed me, probably still talking, to the hostess stand. I promptly told Rachel in a louder than usual voice \"this chick isn't with me.\"  I was ushered to where the lady can see me sit down. \n\nWe shared eye to sunglasses contact for a second while she processed what happened. It was like she was a baby and I took her nose. I watched as she moved to the end of an even longer line, defeated. And almost instanously my party arrived. I smiled wide while as I waved my party over to our table bypassing her.\n\nI forgot my brother was on hold, but he understood. We laughed, we ate, and I bought him a gift card for next time. \n\nTLDR; lady thinks I work there but I don't. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "[I promise, we are a better looking couple than what it looks like.](https://imgur.com/gallery/44Ur1kN) \n\nThis happened October 11, for a Halloween Festival. \n\nMy girlfriend and I decided to last minute buy these tickets to the costume fest and we decided on either IT &amp; Georgie (my choice) or Kermit and Ms. Piggy (her choice. \n\nOf course, I had to succumb to her desire, and I said fuck it. Kermit time. \n\nMy birthday was the following day, so she decided to surprise me with an immaculate hotel to stay in. I was so happy, the hotel was amazing and it was literally a couple of feet from the Halloween Fest entrance, so we didn‚Äôt have to drive or walk too long of a distance looking like your favorite childhood TV show‚Äôs worst nightmare. Our plan was to assemble and create the costumes there and roll out. Our costumes were supposed to look like red carpet style Ms. Piggy and Kermit, so it involved a tuxedo and my girlfriends senior year prom dress. God bless her for still being able to fit in it... but was not a pleasant experience trying to get it off of her after the event. \n\nThe costume contest started at 6, and we didn‚Äôt arrive until 8:30. Why? \n\nWell, it was a cocktail of tears, screaming, throwing shit, and contemplating whether or not we should even continue with this whole shit show. Her pig nose would not stay on her face, which was causing her to lose her shit and delay our arrival time. Every 5 minutes i hear from the bathroom:\n\n‚ÄúOH MY FUCKING GOD IM GONNA START CRYING. WHY WONT IT STAY ON‚Äù\n\nMind you, I‚Äôm on the other end of the room trying to create my ‚ÄúKermit feet‚Äù which were a pair of $5 Walmart shoes and some green felt. I fucking KILLED it with the Kermit feet. \n\nBut that‚Äôs the only part of my costume that was done. I needed help painting myself green. \n\nFinally she was done with the dumpster fire that was her pig nose. She remedied that with super glue, I told her ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna hear a sniffle or see a fucking tear when you try to rip that off your face.‚Äù To which her response was ‚Äúshut the fuck up and sit down we need to leave‚Äù.\n\nSo I sit down on the toilet seat in the bathroom and we start the transformation. We paint my hands and face with what WE thought was Halloween paint. \n\n###It was not.\n\nThe paint we used was oil paint for fabrics, but we found it in the Halloween aisle of Walmart as well and said fuck it, it will work. We‚Äôre not into reading labels apparently. We didn‚Äôt notice what it was until after the event, but we will get to that in a minute.\n\nSo I‚Äôm now this green looking monstrosity. We bought bald caps but we ran out of time, so I slicked my hair back as best as I could. \n\nDid Kermit wear glasses? \n\n#NOPE. \n\nBut I forgot my contacts, so I guess Kermit had to wear them. \n\nSo now I‚Äôm this green, 5‚Äô10‚Äù buff figure in a tuxedo with my hair slicked back (which was slowly becoming fucked up throughout the night) and some ray ban glasses. I can‚Äôt really hate though because Kermit has never looked so fly. \n\nI look at myself in the mirror all done up in the costume and my first words were:\n\n‚ÄúI look like the fucking hulk on prom night.‚Äù\n\nMy girlfriend made a convincing miss piggy, but her nose looked like she had some form of genital warts around where she glued it so it was caked with foundation. She was definitely the highlight of the duo. \n\nAfter all of this happened, we left and we went to the festival. It was a win on that part. \n\nEvery single second people shouted\n\n ‚ÄúOH MY GOD! MISS PIGGY AND KERMIT‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúKERMIT YOU LOOK SO HANDSOME‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúTHATS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PIGGY IVE EVER SEEN‚Äù\n\nWe were fucking crushing it. \n\nThen we are asked to join the costume contest, we didn‚Äôt ask, we were offered a spot in it. We entered of course. \n\nI‚Äôm feeling like some nicotine, but I didn‚Äôt have my cigarettes on me, so I asked the closest security officer where the nearest convenience store was. He told me so I started the journey. I saw one of those pay and ride electric scooters on the corner so you BET YOUR ASS Kermit was going on a joyride to get his smokes. Miss piggy had to sit that one out, considering her prom dress and high heels would cause an absolutely horrific scene if she were to get that shit caught in the wheels. \n\nNothing like watching a green dude in a tux speed down the street on an electric scooter with a Marlboro menthol in his mouth. \n\nA lightbulb went off. Mrs. piggy smoked (I think) so we now have a bonus prop for the costume. Fuck yes. \n\nWe enter the costume contest, we wait in line to go on stage and as soon as we do, we get the most applause out of the entire crowd. The grand prize was $100 and VIP access, and we won the vip access but not the $100, some girl had an immaculate Twin Peaks costume that topped everyone else‚Äôs. Props to her. VIP access granted us free alcohol and free White Castle as well. So we were the most drunk Muppets you‚Äôve ever seen. \n\nWe head back to the hotel and we start getting ready, to go out to bars again. I take a shower, but I notice my hands are still green. I called my girlfriend in the bathroom. \n\n‚ÄúAm I still green‚Äù \n\nShe just starts laughing.\n\nI look in the mirror and I‚Äôm still green. I‚Äôm scrubbing my face so hard in the shower I‚Äôm starting to make my skin raw. But I‚Äôm not getting any less green. \n\nI was stained green for 3 whole days. \n\nWe said fuck it and went to bars while I was still green, and yeah I looked like an idiot but it was drag night at the bar, and I didn‚Äôt wanna miss that shit at all. \n\nSucks to have to go back to work looking like a fool. I was given shit for the 3 days I was still green and it honestly hurts. \n\nTL;DR: My girlfriend and I entered a costume contest within a days notice and I ended up looking like the hulk at prom, and I was stained green for 3 days.\n\nEDIT: Idk why I said Sesame Street, I meant the muppets.\n\nEDIT: I left out a part where I spoke to at the VIP bar about how ‚ÄúThat damn pig hasn‚Äôt touched me since 98‚Äô. Im doing cocaine daily and I think about pulling the trigger every day.‚Äù Clearly drunk.",

For a twenty five year old college student that's about the best you can get when it comes to unskilled work. And as long as you can avoid the elderly drivers and manage to not smoke too much pot during your shift it's a pretty typical job.\n\nAt least, that's what I thought before Monday.\n\nThe day had gone normally enough before 3:30 PM. Mondays are usually a slow day and don't pick up until around 3:00 when the second driver comes in. Being the morning driver I was the first one up for a delivery when the next one finally arrived. So I was pretty excited when I heard the 'ding!' come from the computer, notifying the insider that an online order had popped up.\n\n\"Sam, looks like we got an order finally.\" I said while looking at facebook for the fiftieth time today. It had not been very busy.\n\nSam, the opening manager, looked up from his seat at the screen containing the new order.\n\n\"Um...\" He stared at the screen with worry.\n\nI looked up at the screen myself when I saw the look on his face. On the computer screen, just before it shows the order to be made, the customers can leave a note for us to read about the order. Whenever you type a note like 'Draw a dragon on the box' or 'cut into squares' that's where we end up seeing it first. This note, however, read something really strange.\n\n195876 E. Cicero street.\n\nIt wasn't unusual for people to write their address in the notes section redundantly. What made this unusual though was the house number that was written. Our delivery area only stretched between 400 and 2600 house numbers. If I was reading the number correctly than that would put this address on--\n\n\"195th street? Is there even a 195th street in this town?\"\n\nSam kept staring at the screen hanging above the maketable, not getting up, \"Is John here yet?\"\n\nI looked at the clock on my phone.\n\n2:56 PM.\n\n\"He should be here in just a minute. Why?\"\n\nSam sighed and got up to go to the maketable, \"Talk to him when he gets here about this order.\"\n\nI followed him over to the maketable, \"What the hell is up with this order?\"\n\nI saw him pull a large pizza dough out of the cooler next to the maketable and begin making the pizza that was on the screen, \"I was never a driver so I don't really know anything about this. Talk to John when he gets here. He's taken this order a couple of times.\"\n\nBefore I could yell at him for being so unnecessarily cryptic I heard the bell for the driver door go off.\n\n\"Howdy Ho motherfuckers!\" John yelled his usual greeting as he stepped inside the store.\n\n\"Hey John,\" Sam said while making the pizza, \"new guys taking the Cicero order.\"\n\nJohns usual smile dropped from his face, \"Oh shit.\"\n\nSam added the banana peppers to the already littered pizza that at this point had gotten a heaping of olives, sausage, pepperoni, and the dreaded pineapple, \"Think you can coach him through it?\"\n\nJohn walked around the cooler next to the driver entrance and looked at the dispatch screen. I could see, much like the note at the maketable, the address on the dispatch screen also showed 195876 Cicero street as the address.\n\n\"I'm gonna need an early cigarette break.\" John said while looking at the screen.\n\nSam huffed, \"You literally just got here.\"\n\n\"Yeah. And I'm gonna need a cigarette break with Martin here.\"\n\n\"Seriously guys, just what in the hell is going on?\" I said. I was being completely ignored despite the fact that they were talking about MY delivery that I was going to be making in less than fifteen minutes.\n\n\"Fine. But make it quick.\" Sam said as he loaded the large pizza into the oven.\n\nJohn smirked and waved his hand, beckoning me as he stepped outside of the driver door he had just entered. Seeing as John was going to be the only answers to just what was going on, I stepped outside and followed him.\n\nHe already had an unfiltered Pall Mall lit when I stepped outside.\n\n\"That was fucking quick.\" I said after the driver door shut behind me.\n\nThe smile that had fallen off of his face earlier was back, \"Hey, if you're getting paid to smoke.\"\n\nI pulled my own pack out of my pocket and lit a sweet sweet menthol, \"Now what in the hell is going on with that order? We only deliver up to Greenfield. That's 2600, right?\"\n\n\"But we deliver to Cicero, right?\"\n\nCicero is an east-west street that stretched the neighborhoods from 1400 to 2600, \"Yeah, and that one is for a 195876. Even if that address exists then it's not in our area. Unless I'm missing something?\"\n\nJohn puffed out a thick cloud of smoke, \"It does exist. You just have to get there in a...roundabout way.\"\n\n\"Stop being obnoxious John and just explain yourself.\"\n\n\"Oh you're no fun,\" John puffed on the cigarette, \"You've delivered to Cicero, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah. It's in that 55+ community, right?\"\n\n\"Yep. You ever notice that weird sign on the corner property there?\"\n\nI thought back to every time I had delivered down there and came up with the sign he was talking about, \"You mean the one that says 'no exit' and looks like it was painted by a child?\"\n\nHe laughed, \"Exactly.\"\n\n\"Yeah. I always thought that was weird. It faces that little side street that goes along with the main street.\"\n\n\"And that little street ends just two houses down from the sign at a dead end.\" John added.\n\n\"And,\" I added to John's addendum, \"what does that have to do with this delivery?\"\n\nJohn took the half-done filterless Pall Mall out of his mouth and looked at it, \"Everything...\"\n\nHe didn't continue but just stuck the cigarette back in his mouth.\n\nI almost yelled at him but decided a softer tone would be more appropriate when I saw the worried look on his face, \"John?\"\n\n\"How much gas do you have?\" He asked suddenly as he puffed the last of his cigarette.\n\nI coughed my last inhale out, not expecting the question, \"What?\"\n\n\"Do you have at least half a tank?\"\n\nI thought about it for a second, \"A little over.\"\n\n\"Good. If you go down Cicero street like you would any other delivery you aren't going to find it. The only way to get there is go down that little side street, do a u-turn at the dead end, and take a right when you see the 'No Exit' sign down Cicero. And before you say it, yes, I know that doesn't make any sense. But I promise you won't find it unless you do.\"\n\nOkay, I finally got what was going on, \"This is a hazing thing, right? I'm going to do what you say, you're going to make me look like an idiot, and when I can't find the place you're going to laugh at me when I drive back to the store with that disgusting looking pizza.\"\n\nHe laughed, \"I thought that when I tried to make that delivery the first time. I didn't make that u-turn.\"\n\n\"And just what makes me think I should believe you about any of this?\"\n\n\"If you're done with that cigarette,\" He pointed at my hand, where the last of the cigarette burned near the filter, \"I can prove it to you.\"\n\nI took the last puff, threw the cigarette into the ashtray next to the driver door, and followed him inside to the dispatch screen. Sam was already at the cut table slicing the pizza up and packing it. John poked at the dispatch screen until it showed that I was about to be dispatched on the delivery to 195876 Cicero Street.\n\n\"I thought you said yesterday that you couldn't dispatch anyone else--\" He seemed unperturbed by my accusation and clicked the confirm button. Two copies of a receipt, one merchant receipt the customer signs for us, and one for them, printed out. One of the neater things our company has done recently is allow anyone who orders online to pre-tip the delivery driver before we even leave the store. John complained about it a lot but I thought it was pretty neat. Mostly because I knew it told them what a 10%, 15%, and 20% tip actually were.\n\nJohn picked up the printed receipts and showed them to me. In the section where you would find the pre-tip I saw something that made me think that, no, this is definitely not a hazing ritual.\n\nThe order was pre-tipped for $150.\n\n\"No fucking way.\" I said in disbelief.\n\n\"You are a lucky mother fucker. I honestly wish I was the one going on this despite all of the...\"\n\n\"The what?\" I said as I took the receipts from his hand and turned to grab the order. Sam had just placed it into a bag on the rack of bags behind us.\n\n\"Nothing. You'll be fine as long as you follow the guidelines.\"\n\nI turned around and looked at him quizzically.\n\n\"After you get past 26th street things start getting...weird. You need to make sure to do three things while you're on the delivery. First, don't listen to the radio. It's not a hard and fast rule but it makes the run a lot easier if you don't.\"\n\nI scoffed, \"Who listens to the radio anymore?\"\n\nHe smiled, \"Okay. Second, always follow the posted speed limit. And I don't mean that in a 'I'll drive two or three over' and be okay. Don't fucking do it.\"\n\nI grabbed the bag and put all of the receipts in the clear front pocket, \"And third?\"\n\nHe sighed, \"Don't stop for any reason until you get to 195876 E. Cicero. No matter what you see, don't stop.\"\n\nI stood in silence, contemplating the delivery. It almost sounded like a joke. A haze. But that $150 tip was already paid for. If I made this run I could pay my phone bill for the month with just this one delivery.\n\nJohn smiled, \"If you don't want it I'll take it. I got bills of my own you know.\"\n\n\"You know the rules John,\" I grabbed the bag from the rack, \"first up first out.\"\n\nHe smiled at me, \"Of course.\"\n\nI smiled back at him and stepped out of the store. As I put the bag in my car and started the engine to my 1998 Nissan Maxima I heard my phone make the noise saying I'd gotten a text message.\n\nI took the phone out of my pocket and looked at the message. It was from John.\n\n\"DONT STOP FOR ANY REASON!\"\n\nI looked at the address on the receipt then back at the phone.\n\nI sighed, plugged the aux cable into my phone and blasted some music before pulling out of the parking lot and toward Cicero Street. Nothing of importance happened until I reached Cicero and turned down it towards my destination. I could see the end of the street just a block down before I recalled what John said about the u-turn. I turned around in annoyance to the little street that ran parallel to the major one. I turned down it, make the required u-turn, and drove the one hundred feet back until I saw the sign sitting on the corner property.\n\nJust like I remembered the sign looked out of place. It sat on the corner of the rock filled lawn of the corner house and had 'No Exit' written in big white letters. The bottom of the letters ran like the child that wrote it used too much paint.\n\n\"Here goes nothing.\" I said as I took a right and down Cicero street.\n\nUnlike the first time down the street I couldn't see the end of the road where it was supposed to.\n\n\"What the fuck?\"\n\nI drove down the street slowly looking at the addresses on the various houses as I passed them.\n\n2156.\n\n2202.\n\n2546.\n\n2632.\n\nThe turned my head and looked at the last house I saw the numbers for. Our delivery area ended at 2600. Greenfield should've cut through the middle of the street as I passed between 2546 E. Cicero and 2632 E. Cicero.\n\nI looked down the street past 2632. Past that house there was only an asphalt road surrounded by a sidewalk that stretched into the distance too far to see. Where you would expect houses in a densely packed neighborhood there was only dirt lots that stretched into the distance too far to see.\n\nI stopped at a stop sign. Above the stop sign read a street sign that said '26th street'.\n\nI looked to my right. The house clearly read 2632 E. Cicero.\n\n\"Weird is right John. Weird is right.\"\n\nI looked past the stop sign at the long stretch of impossible road that led off into the distance.\n\nI looked at the receipt attached to the pizza bag that read $150 in the tip section.\n\n\"But $150 dollars is $150 dollars.\"\n\nI pushed the gas pedal and drove down the empty [street.](https://facebook.com/aslowewrites)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nr/cawdor23",

    "body": "Back in the day (about 20 years ago), myself and my group of friends/coworkers all smoked.  Tobacco, among other things.  We were in a blue collar industry and were all hard drinking and partying young men and women.  It was a great era.\n\nOne of my closest friends, Steve, moved from the midwest where we all lived back to his childhood hometown on the east cost.  The reasons for this move were financial and not relevant to this story.  I flew out to visit a couple of times.  We went sightseeing and generally had a good time.\n\nAnyone who's ever been part of a smoking social group knows it's not uncommon to \"bum\" cigarettes from one another.  I give you one today, you return the favor tomorrow.  No big deal.  They're worth about 25 cents a piece.  But common courtesy dictates you ask politely rather than just helping yourself to someone else's pack.  Steve felt we were close enough friends to forgo this formality at his discretion.\n\nOne night, we're out on his front deck after dinner having beers and chatting.  It's me, Steve, his wife, and a couple other friends.  He had been helping himself to my pack in my shirt breast pocket all week during my visit.  But the last time we stopped at a store for provisions I got to feeling a little petty about this.  So instead of picking up a standard pack as I usually do, I got a pack of menthols.\n\nI don't mind menthols every once in a great while.  But Steve hates them.  For those that don't smoke, having a menthol as opposed to a standard cigarette is akin to biting into a mint chocolate bar instead of regular milk chocolate.  The taste can be surprising if you're not expecting it.\n\nSo that night I make sure to have the menthol pack in the same shirt pocket easily accessible.  Sure enough, Steve reaches for the pack.  He pulls out a smoke and pops it into his lips.  He's distracted by the conversation at hand and doesn't notice the faint scent off the unlit cigarette.  I politely pass him my lighter with a grin on my face and wait for it.  He looks at me with suspicious confusion, lights the tip, takes a big drag, then starts coughing.\n\nA few expletives later I take my unfinished smoke back from him and begin to puff with evil satisfaction.  It's not often that I was able to rattle him.  But this one made all of us laugh.  Seeing his wife snicker was the best part of the evening.  He kept his hands to himself after that.",

    "body": "I (43f) am an EMT in the south east US. This is important for context. I had a first date on a Saturday night. The person claimed to be disabled and unable to walk. By what he had said in texts, he seemed legit. The house was in a part of our County that is rural with a mix of nice and question your safety walking in the door. He told me how much it had cost him 20 years ago, so it sounded like a nice place. I had to go get money from him to go back into town to get dinner. \n\nWhen I arrived the first time to the house, I was not liking what I was seeing, but I would give him a chance. Rough outside does not mean rough inside, especially if you are disabled. Never judge a book by its cover. He told me to come in when I got there, but the door was locked. I knocked and his roommate let me in. Ok, no big deal. What I did see of the house was just as rough as the outside. \n\nThen I got to his room. Yes he was unable to walk. He had a prosthetic leg. That I didn't mind. Even him being in bed was not an b issue. The first thing for me was that he didn't put in a shirt. This was to be a date. I was raised that even if you feel like you are going to die, you put on clothes when someone comes over. There was no room to move around in his room due to the bed, furniture, and large TV beside his bed. He had a large TV on his dresser that was also on. \n\nHe gave me cash to get dinner and drinks for us. He said he was diabetic and wanted two large sweet teas from McDonald's. As I was heading back into town he text me his order from the local Mexican restaurant. All the way back into town I was trying to figure out how to get out of the date. I placed our food order to go and waited for it to be ready, still trying to think on what to do. Once the food was ready I went to McDonald's to get his drink. It while in the drive through that is check who the night lieutenant was. It was someone that is knew would help me. I text the supervisor phone asking him to text me in 20 minutes to report to base as is get me out of my date. I agreed to work until 1100 pm. He asked if I wanted a text or call. I text to call me in 20.\n\n When I got to the house I text my lieutenant \"2 minutes\". I took the food and my dates drinks in the house. I could smell cigarette smoke as soon as I walked in the door. He was smoking in his room. I asked if it was menthol and he said yes. I told him i could not be around it because I have an allergy to it that could knock me out of work for three days. He did put the cigarette out right away. He profile never said he smoked and I don't date smokers. \n\nRight on time my supervisor called and said they needed me to come in right now to handle over flow calls. I told him I would be there in 20, apologized to my date, took part of my dinner with me, and left. I stopped at my house Ling enough to grab my pants and boots. They had an uniform shirt waiting for me at base. I did run the over flow non emergent calls. I did text the guy the next day that things just would not work out between us and good luck in the future. He text fine by him. So, was I the jerk?",

    "body": "My mother got sick when I was a teenager.\n\nWell, the truth is I guess that she was always sick. At least, as long as I can remember, and probably as long as she could. I can remember her giant pill case and tagging along to doctor‚Äôs appointments when I was small, playing with the little reflex\\-testing hammers, pretending I could read the textbooks from the office, and squeezing my eyes shut with my little hands snapped tight over my ears as she had blood drawn. Her doctors would coo over how cute I was, and I somehow always ended up with a pocket full of lollipops and colorful Band\\-Aids slapped over pretend booboos.\n\nBut that was really the extent of it until I was 15. Then, her body started rejecting her kidney, turning on itself and attacking it until the organ started leaking toxins into her body and poisoning her from the inside out. She survived that, but everything about her changed. Instead of the involved, caring, probably a little bit smothering woman I‚Äôd grown up loving, she became childlike and immature. Quick to anger and sadness, but nearly incapable of taking care of herself. The next ten years were marred with tantrums and hospital visits, heart attacks and deep, throaty coughs until suddenly, it stopped and she was gone.\n\nEverything after is a blur, blobs of oak paneling and black wool murmuring half\\-sincere statements about the ‚Äúgood woman gone too soon‚Äù. The slow, painful death isn‚Äôt pretty, and many of the sentiment\\-bearers were mostly\\-forgotten ghosts who brought a casserole a decade ago but then forgot about us when my mother didn‚Äôt have the good sense to die quickly enough to be memorialized.\n\nAs for me, those ten years were etched in my skin and coded into my DNA. The smell of antiseptic clung to me, infusing my hair and my clothes and warning people to stay away. Avoid the sad girl and her sad life and dead mother. When she‚Äôd first gotten sick, I was young and it was tragic enough that it seemed like people surrounded me but now I was an outcast, stuck in my motherless youth with no real example of what adulthood was outside of a hospital bed.\n\nI stuck around for a while after the funeral, used up my bereavement leave and then my year‚Äôs vacation, but ultimately escaped back to my anonymous life in another state where I pretended I had an identity outside of being a nursemaid.\n\nSo life went on, and there were even days that I forgot to feel guilty for that fact. Not many, mind you, an adolescence spent shaping oneself around the needs of another person is difficult to overcome. There were still nights I cried myself to sleep, and days that the realization that the world no longer housed the only person who would ever love me more than themselves threatened to break me completely. But there also was a kind of peace to not fearing the worst every time my phone flashed the area code from my hometown, and the emptiness after a good cry was strangely lighter than the bone\\-weary exhaustion that comes from ten years of fighting the inevitable.\n\nIt was in this odd state of nearly\\-okay that I found myself opening my mailbox one random Tuesday evening, nearly six months after her death. I‚Äôd gotten home late from work and I was tired, hungry, and probably smelled less than optimal, so I yanked the letters out of my mail slot with more forced than the task probably required, shutting the door and locking it haphazardly.\n\nI tossed the mail onto the already\\-full table next to the door and plopped down on the hardwood of the entryway as my cat stretched sinuously, getting a good, satisfying yawn out before trotting over to plant her chubby butt on my lap for her nightly routine of pets and kisses. It may sound pathetic, but she‚Äôd been instrumental in me holding myself together during the bad nights, so I definitely tended to spoil her with affection more than the average FurMommy probably let their mini\\-dictator demand.\n\nWhich is why, when she flopped over in my lap with her belly up and paws curled toward her chest for a nap, I leaned back against the door with a sigh and braced myself for an extended sit on the floor. I groped mindlessly up onto the table for my mail, figuring that I may as well get something useful done while my monarch took up my time and personal space, and began flipping through the never\\-ending stack of pennysavers and bills I paid online but constantly forgot to actually cancel paper mailing for. \n\nTucked between a credit card offer I‚Äôd never reply to and a plea for donations from my alma mater, I found a blank envelope. No postage, no return address, no address at all really. Just my childhood nickname, *Chrissy*, scrawled across the front.\n\nI can‚Äôt really fault myself too much for not recognizing the writing, because who would expect something like that months later, but considering the sheer amount of time I‚Äôd spent trying to copy that style, first on absence excuses and later on rent checks as I‚Äôd tried to keep the family afloat, it does surprise me a little how long it took me to connect the dots. But once I‚Äôd ripped open the envelope and pulled out the pages, I couldn‚Äôt deny it for long.\n\n*Chrissy,*\n\n*I always told myself I‚Äôd have so much to say when this time came, but really, I‚Äôm having a hard time thinking of the words. I guess for you, it‚Äôs only been a few months but I‚Äôve been silent for years, watching you grow and change and realizing how little part I could really have in it.*\n\n*I‚Äôm probably confusing you, aren‚Äôt I? I should start at the beginning.*\n\n*You already know how lost I was after your sister passed, of course. And you know what a very long time there was between her death and your birth. Seven years without a baby in my arms was heart\\-breaking in a way I hope you can never imagine. But what you don‚Äôt know, can‚Äôt know, is how hard I tried for you during that time. I always called you my Miracle Baby, and you hated it, but it was true! You were the miracle that helped me keep on living, and I can never tell you how special you are to me.*\n\n*But the truth is, the magic behind your conception was less a miracle and more a‚Ä¶ transaction, if you will.* \n\n*You have to understand how devastating it is to lose a child. First to miscarriage, then to SIDs, and I just couldn‚Äôt take it again. From the time I was young I‚Äôd wanted to be a mother and the idea of never being one again, doomed to parent only a child frozen in time, would have been too much. As the years passed with no change, and my doctors saying more and more that it was unlikely I‚Äôd have another, I began to look into other methods.*\n\n*At first it was herbs. Nothing too crazy, mind you, just a few leaves here and there, or a special tea blend to be consumed right before I ovulated. It gave me hope, I guess. Something to hold onto. Your father noticed the difference, but I think he naively attributed it to me moving on from the loss. He responded to my advances enthusiastically, as I‚Äôm sure any husband after years of mourning would, and never questioned the various cups and vials I sampled before and after. Maybe he told himself they were some kind of trendy, new\\-age health concoctions I‚Äôd started taking at the advice of a girlfriend, I don‚Äôt know. But it wasn‚Äôt until he knocked one over during sex and I flew into a rage at him, screaming about him taking my baby from me, that he put his foot down.*\n\n*A week later, I found myself deposited in front of a set of large, orange metal doors leading to a drab rec center basement with nothing but a circle of chairs and a card table with a dozen or so donuts and some lukewarm coffee in tiny foam cups. I finished mine in a single swig and clutched my cardigan closer to me as we went around the circle introducing ourselves\\-\\-first names only\\-\\- and listening to ‚Äúbrave volunteers‚Äù offer up their stories of loss while the others nodded and sniffled, trading empty words about strength and durability.*\n\n*When the eyes of the collective fell on me, I began twisting my hands together into the fabric of my clothing and stared at the floor as I spoke. ‚ÄúAbout five years ago, my daughter died. Rebecca. It was the day after her half\\-birthday. My husband, he was at work and I wasn‚Äôt feeling well so I laid down to nap when she did. I‚Ä¶ I got up and she didn‚Äôt.‚Äù I took a deep, shuddering breath. ‚ÄúSince then, all I want is another child. We can‚Äôt afford to adopt and I think fostering would break my heart. My husband says I‚Äôm obsessed and sent me here to ‚Äòwork through‚Äô it, but I don‚Äôt think anything else will ever make me happy again. Not like being a mother did.‚Äù*\n\n*I rapidly blinked to clear my vision as the group gave their polite applause after my words trailed off. The group leader whose name I‚Äôd already forgotten gave me a watery smile and nodded. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to be a mother with no baby to hold, but you are* still *a mother. Never forget that. But you‚Äôre also so much more and it‚Äôs important to find those again.‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt* want *those things, I want a baby!‚Äù I snapped back hotly, surprising even myself.* \n\n*The leader coughed out an awkward chuckle and moved the group along quickly, and after we adjourned I threw my purse over my shoulder to attempt a quick escape.*\n\n*Instead, one of the women whispered my name and beckoned me over to share a cigarette under the dripping corner gutter of the building. As she dug in her purse for a lighter, she pulled out a plain white card as well, with only a phone number written on the top.* \n\n*She inhaled her menthol deeply, the glowing ember casting strange shadows across her face in the darkness of the overcast evening. Finally, she spoke, smoke streaming from both her nose and mouth and wrapping us both in its tendrils as she did so. ‚ÄúCall when you‚Äôre alone. Only let the phone ring once. Any more and she won‚Äôt answer.‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúShe?‚Äù I asked, nervously shifting from one foot to the other while ashing my own cigarette.*\n\n*‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be right away. She follows you for a while first to make sure you‚Äôre worthy. If you don‚Äôt hear back in a month, you won‚Äôt at all.‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what can she do?‚Äù*\n\n*The grin the woman gave felt predatory, and I found myself taking a tiny step back without fully knowing why. ‚ÄúAnything you‚Äôre willing to pay for.‚Äù*\n\n*That was the end of the conversation, we smoked our cigarettes in absolute silence until the sound of the rattling muffler and worn\\-out breaks alerted me to the fact that your father had finally pulled up. I stomped my cigarette out on the damp sidewalk and raised a hand to my companion, who offered a sharp nod in farewell. I never saw her at another meeting again.*\n\n*The card felt warm in my pocket the whole way home as my normally quiet, almost distant husband asked me continuous questions about my evening. He‚Äôd been raised to believe therapy was a hack and that people just got over their feelings, so I knew that this was probably killing him, but the fact that he‚Äôd not only found this place but was trying to fake an active interest in my progress told me he was completely out of his depth with my grief. I tried to take pity on him, but I could only replay the conversation in my head and fidget with the worn corner of the card.*\n\n*We pulled into the spot in front of our building, and he clasped my hand in his as we hurried up the walk to get out of the rain. I felt guilty for yearning to pull away and put my hand back in my pocket instead of enjoying the unprompted affection as I normally would. I gave a tight smile when he held up a movie from the Hollywood Video that I‚Äôd been eyeing, knowing I had no logical reason to say no and demand time alone. With the phone. He was often oblivious, but there was no way that he wouldn‚Äôt question that, especially when he was trying so hard to be supportive. You know your father, and he really wasn‚Äôt much softer in our early marriage either. Planning a nice night in for us, asking for details about my day, it was all so out of character that I may have teared up had I been any less preoccupied with that small, mysterious rectangle.* \n\n*I didn‚Äôt get the chance to call that night, or the next day, because he called out of work to go take me to the conservatory. We took you there when you were little, you loved to trot up the cobblestone paths in that tremulous, unstable way of someone who‚Äôd just learned to walk but was convinced they could fly. He‚Äôd proposed to me there, and I think he was trying to show me the best parts of our relationship all over again, to convince me there was value in life without children. I wished I could see it, and know that I did love him very much, but it just wasn‚Äôt enough for me. The lifestyle your father was begging me to accept would never be more than a consolation prize, I‚Äôd never be fulfilled. I don‚Äôt know if I believed he would be either, honestly. He‚Äôd shared a bond with your sister that I sometimes envied as much as I adored, and I‚Äôd seen his sadness whenever a test would come back negative. He wanted to be a father, and his desperate attempts to convince me otherwise only strengthened my resolve to fix things.* \n\n*That night, after we got home, I threw him a bashful smile and asked if he would mind grabbing some takeout from our favorite place. I didn‚Äôt feel like cooking, I told him, but would get out the nice places and set the table to make it feel like a fancy meal anyway. He didn‚Äôt take much convincing, and as soon as the door clicked shut, I pulled the card from my pocket where I had stuffed it when getting dressed this morning.* \n\n*I checked the number five times before lifting the receiver from the cradle, so that by the time I heard the dial tone drone in my ear, I basically had all 7 digits memorized. The harsh screech of the first ring startled me for some reason, to where I nearly forgot the directions I was given.*\n\n‚ÄòOnly let the phone ring once. Any more and she won‚Äôt answer.‚Äô\n\n*I hung up the phone just as I heard the start of the second ring and let out a muffled sob while running to the kitchen to dig out our nice plates while praying that it had only rung once on her end.*\n\n*The next month was the longest of my life. Hope seemed to give me something to live for again, but the bone\\-wrenching anxiety made it a very manic energy. I felt like I was vibrating the whole time, stopping only to jump at the smallest noises, convinced* that *was the sign. I never saw a hair of this mysterious woman, and as the last week drew to a close, I began to tell myself that it was all a hoax, a hurtful joke designed to torture me.*\n\n*Which I realized I hadn‚Äôt believed when I began to sob as it approached sundown exactly one month after I‚Äôd made the call. At least a part of me had begun to plan for that baby. For you. I dreamt of you. Not just a miscellaneous baby, but of you. There were so many times as you were growing up that the feeling of deja vu would nearly knock me off of my feet because I‚Äôd dreamt of that moment, even though I hadn‚Äôt agreed to anything yet.*\n\n*And then, she called.*\n\n*It wasn't anything obvious, just a shiver and a thought right before the exact time I‚Äôd made the call when your father was out. An address, for a place I‚Äôd never been but vaguely knew about, lodged itself in my brain and refused to leave. I‚Äôd try to distract myself by reading or watching television, but it would get louder, more insistent. Finally, I made up some excuse and slipped out of the apartment. Your father, exasperated but resigned and accustomed to my erratic and inexplicable behavior as of late, barely grunted in response to my flimsy cover.*\n\n*In the unnatural orange glow of the street lights, I managed not to question the insanity of what I was doing, but as soon I opened the car door, the light on the ceiling flooded my brain and shook off the fog for a second. Was I really driving off in the dark to chase some ‚Äúpsychic message‚Äù that all reason was actually just that my desperation had finally caused me to crack?*\n\n*The sound of the ignition confirmed for me that yes, yes I was.*\n\n*The drive over was completely unremarkable, and that helped the illusion that this was a perfectly normal night drive like any other. Honestly, as I navigated the turns with a confidence I shouldn‚Äôt have had for a part of town I‚Äôd been through so rarely, something \\(self preservation maybe?\\) made it almost difficult to recognize any difference between this and, say, a quick jaunt to the store for some toilet paper.* \n\n*Finally, I pulled up in front of a nice house in a middle class suburb that I‚Äôd been to a handful of times in the 15 years or so I‚Äôd lived here. It wasn‚Äôt anything exceptional, ranch\\-style and tidy with brown shutters and a cobblestone walkway. It was somehow unnerving. I‚Äôm not totally sure what I expected, but if I had to guess it would probably include a darkened alleyway and an abandoned building. Not a neatly manicured lawn and the carefully groomed appearance of modestly spent money.*\n\n*As I walked up to the front door and nervously shifted my weight on the welcome mat, I began to seriously question my sanity. I‚Äôd become single\\-minded lately and while I‚Äôd shrugged off your father‚Äôs concerns about what the loss had done to me, maybe it really had taken its toll. I would find nothing in this house except for a politely confused family whose night I would be disturbing with my obsession.*\n\n*Still, I raised my hand to knock.* \n\n*A petite woman swung the door open nearly immediately, the top of her short, tightly permed hair barely coming up to my shoulder. Her appearance was as shocking to me as the house. She reminded me of your grandmother, even seemed to use the same boxed dye to cover up the wispy grays I could still see at the very edges of her temples.*\n\n*She stared at me for a long moment, and in that time I felt frozen. A thousand half\\-assed apologies flitted across my brain but died before they reached my mouth. Alarm\\-bells blared, screaming at me to get back into the car and go home, that no damage had been done yet, but instead I waited.*\n\n*Finally, she turned and walked briskly from the entrance deeper into the house, leaving the door open without so much as a glance back.*\n\n*It took me a moment to follow, but eventually I stepped onto the plush burgundy carpet and wrestled with indecision on whether to close the door or not. I shut it quietly, and even the tiny click of the knob sliding into place seemed harsh in the absolute silence of the house.*\n\n*I hadn't caught sight of which way she had gone, but I made a left on instinct and immediately my nose was assaulted by a strong, chemical smell. Formaldehyde,  maybe, though I couldn't imagine what would be the source of that here. The kitchen was as neat as the rest of the house, with only a single mug resting on the counter. She handed it to me and I started to refuse, I hadn't come here for refreshments. She eyed me like I was stupid.*\n\n*‚ÄúIt is simple. You will drink this and become pregnant with a baby girl. You will see her grow and thrive and raise her until she no longer needs you. You will watch her become an adult. Beyond that, though, you are mine.‚Äù*\n\n*I jerked my head back as if she'd slapped me. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean? Are you taking my soul?‚Äù*\n\n*She snorted a laugh, something else that reminded me so strongly of your grandmother that I could only blink. ‚ÄúNothing so Faustian. Your life. Once she's grown, you will die.‚Äù*\n\n*A gasp escaped my lips without permission. Did that mean I'd never be a grandmother? I wouldn't grow old with your father, get to be there to give you advice? Could I really give up the end of my life like that?*\n\n*But even now, my arms ached whenever I heard a baby cry in a haunting reminder of my loss. I wanted that ending, yes, but I needed you more.*\n\n*So I drank without another word. As I should have predicted, the smell came from whatever concoction she'd presented me with. My stomach rolled as the drink, thick as tar and caustic, slid down my throat slowly. When I'd finished, I handed her the mug and she immediately turned around to wash it.*\n\n*‚ÄúHow long do I have?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúTo, you know. Have sex?‚Äù*\n\n*She didn't turn back to face me, but shook her head. ‚ÄúNo need. The agreement was a baby for your life. Hardly worth it if your husband does all of the work. You're pregnant, you may take a test if you'd like.‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúJust like that?‚Äù*\n\n*She shot me a toothy grin over her shoulder. ‚ÄúJust like that.‚Äù*\n\n*And with that, I floated out to the car as if walking on a cloud and drove home.*\n\n*Over the next several weeks, the things you'd expect happened. Vomiting, lightheadedness. I even fainted once. Without knowing when my ‚Äúconception‚Äù really was, I didn't want to take a test too soon and make your father suspicious again, so I waved off his concern and pushed on.*\n\n*At least, until the blood in my urine. Finally, I went to the doctor who confirmed both the pregnancy and that my kidneys were failing. I refused the abortion they offered, of course, which limited the treatment options drastically. I couldn't tell them that I already knew they were doomed, that this must be the first stage of her payment.*\n\n*I spent most of the pregnancy in the hospital, with the timeline for your growth and my kidneys‚Äô complete failure seeming to race each other. By my 8th month, they no longer worked at all and you were suffering for it. I fought them as long as I could but in the end, you had a better chance on the outside than in me, and you were born early.*\n\n*Hearing your cry before I was wheeled off to the ICU was, until my last breath, the best moment of my life. Despite it all, you were big, and whole, and healthy and ready to go home even before I was.  Your grandfather stepped forward and donated one of his kidneys to keep me off of dialysis, and though the first several months were chaotic and stressful, I can't imagine trading them for the world.* \n\n*And you grew, just as she said. I was there when you took your first steps and said your first word. I saw you off to your first day of school, year after year. The truth is that even with the anti\\-rejection medicines and constant check\\-ups as a reminder, it was easy to forget how you'd gotten here and just enjoy you. Listen to your laugh, see you figure out the world. It was addictive.*\n\n*It wasn't all sunshine and roses, of course. I expected the teen years to be bad, but I didn't expect the to* hurt *the way they did. Every fight and struggle was a knife. Didn't you know how much I love you? But you were growing, becoming more independent, and you were chafing under my wing. I wanted to hold you as long as I could, but you demanded to be free.*\n\n*Chrissy, nothing that happened was your fault. It was always going to be this way, from the moment the mug touched my lips. Even if you'd never said it, the fact was that it was true. The day had come, and the fight we had\\-\\- I don't even remember which one it was that time, probably a boy\\-\\- was nothing more than the final nail in the coffin that I built for myself.*\n\n*But even still, nothing could have prepared me for the day that you looked right at me and said, ‚ÄúMom, just deal with it. I don't need you anymore.‚Äù*\n\n*It brought me up short, at first because I had to admit it was true. You were nearly as tall as me now, doing well in high school with good friends by your side. I was still your ride and cooked your dinner but ultimately my job was over. You were as raised as you'd get and from here it was a matter of crossing my fingers and hoping that your father and I had done it well enough for you to take it from here.*\n\n*Less than six months later I was in an ambulance, blood pressure through the roof from fluid build up, stomach swollen with toxins and realizing I hadn't peed in days.*\n\n*Honey, if I'd known what she'd meant by ‚Äú*watch *her become an adult‚Äù, I don't know that I could have gone through with it. But I was watching, even when it probably seemed like I'd abandoned you. I was there for everything, I just couldn't break through the layers of illness and madness to show you.* \n\n*Every misstep, every heartbreak, I was there with you. And I am so, so proud that you were always able to get back up and try again. I know things seemed bleak and hopeless often, but you did it. And you did it without me.*\n\n*Finally, the day came when you were there. You learned to drive, you graduated and had a job, you'd figured out what love was. The only thing left that I could give you was peace, and so I did.*\n\n*I may never be able to communicate again, not like this, but I will always be there. I get it now, what the group leader said that rainy day so many years ago.*\n\n*I may be gone, but you will always, always be my daughter and so, so loved.*\n\n*Forever,*\n\n*Mom*\n\nIt was likely an hour before I finished sobbing into my generously\\-still cat‚Äôs fur. Her grief and pain, co\\-mingling with my own, was too much for me to hold and I came apart in that moment, still leaning against the front door to my apartment. I can't imagine the thin walls muffled my howls, and my neighbors must have decided I was insane.\n\nIt sounds ridiculous but I couldn't bring myself to doubt the authenticity of the letter. The details, the handwriting, the flowery and smothering brand of affection she loved. This could not have been penned by anyone other than my mother, and it was all too strange to be anything other than the truth, or at least, *her* truth. And the timing of everything lined up so well, was it possible that I was nothing but the culmination of a grieving woman's desperation and a witch‚Äôs brew?\n\nFinally, when I had no tears left in me and my face was stinging and raw, I reached out to grab the letter again. My fingertips brushed the envelope and I saw something I'd missed when I'd opened it before.\n\nThere, across the back of the envelope, was a small stamp showing a shadow with eyes so red they seemed to glow. Underneath, written in a neat, almost perfect script, were the words ‚Äúnothing comes from nothing, and all debts come due. Remember that.‚Äù",

With a population of 145,700 at the 2011 census, Newport is the third-largest city in Wales.[16] The city forms part of the Cardiff-Newport metropolitan area, with a population of 1,097,000. Newport was the site of the last large-scale armed insurrection in Britain, the Newport Rising of 1839 led by the Chartists. This was led by the Chartist John Frost which led to the re-branding of the Duffryn High School into John Frost School.\n\nNewport has been a port since medieval times when the first Newport Castle was built by the Normans. The town outgrew the earlier Roman town of Caerleon, immediately upstream, and gained its first charter in 1314. It grew significantly in the 19th century when its port became the focus of coal exports from the eastern South Wales Valleys. Newport was the largest coal exporting port in Wales up to the rise of Cardiff in the mid-1800s.\n\nIn the 20th century, the docks declined in importance, but Newport remained an important manufacturing and engineering centre. It was granted city status in 2002. Newport hosted the Ryder Cup in 2010 and was the venue for the 2014 NATO summit.",

So instead, I grabbed everything and shoved it inside my pants.\n\nThen I locked the desk drawer, kicked the key under her desk, and hurried back to the couch.\n\n\"Mr. Harper‚Ä¶\"\n\nI jumped as Dr. Zhang entered the room, holding some ice to her nose.\n\n\"Needless to say, you've been a horrible nuisance to my operation here,\" she said. \"You've made it clear that you won't cease with your relentless disruption, and so I've put in a recommendation for your transfer.\"\n\n\"You're transferring me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"You'll be moved tomorrow morning. Pickowitz will escort you back to your cell to gather your things.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" I stood up and walked to the door.\n\n\"And Mr. Harper?\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\nShe tilted her head. \"If you're thinking of‚Ä¶ talking‚Ä¶ about what you learned in this prison, I would seriously reconsider. Your life in the next prison can be very good, or very bad, depending on my request.\"\n\nI nodded. \"I don't care anymore. I just want to get the hell out of here.\"\n\nShe gave me one last smile. \"That's very good to hear, Mr. Harper.\"\n\nI knocked on the door and Pickowitz walked me back to my cell.\n\nAs he locked the cell door behind him, I ran over to the desk, reached into my pants, and began organizing everything into folders. Then I hurried back to the door and whispered: \"Pickowitz!\"\n\nHe turned back and said, \"Yeah?\"\n\nI took a deep breath.\n\n\"My friend, Zach. Is he paying you to help me out?\"\n\nPickowitz gave me a wink. \"I don't know what you're talking about.\"\n\n\"Okay, good.\"\n\nI shoved a manila folder through the bars.\n\n\"What's this?\" he asked, taking it.\n\n\"An important secret,\" I said. \"If you don't believe me, look inside yourself. But don't show anyone else. Not until I'm back.\"\n\nHe raised his eyebrows. \"Back from where?\"\n\nI looked him in the eye. \"Trust me.\"\n\nHe nodded and put the folder in his shirt.\n\nAs he walked away, I let out a sigh of relief and went back to the desk.\n\nNow, all I needed was a bit of good luck.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n\"Where are the photos, Mr. Harper?\"\n\nDr. Zhang stood at my cell door with a smile, but she did not seem her usual calm self.\n\nI walked slowly to the door to face her.\n\n\"I gave them to someone who will send them to the FBI if I don't check in every hour, on the hour.\"\n\nIt was a bit of an exaggeration, but she didn't need to know that.\n\nShe tilted her head stiffly. \"Mr. Harper, I can't help but wonder‚Äî\"\n\n\"No,\" I interrupted her. \"I'm calling the shots now. You're not in control anymore.\"\n\nShe pursed her lips. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"I hear you take your favorite inmates on field trips,\" I said. \"Let's go for one now.\"\n\nHer eyes met mine. I could practically see the gears spinning in her brain as she tried to manipulate the situation. \"I can't make that happen right now, but if you'd like to wait‚Äî\"\n\n\"Your fingerprints were all over those photos, weren't they?\" I said. \"What's the charge for possession of child pornography? How about child sex slavery?\"\n\nShe glared at me.\n\n\"We're leaving now,\" I said. \"Call a guard and escort me from my cell.\"\n\nHer smile faded completely. She waited a few seconds, and then she did as I said.\n\nWithin minutes, we were walking down the halls to the building's exit.\n\n\"Elliot Harper,\" she said to the guards at the front gates. \"He's joining me for a mental health retreat.\"\n\n\"Of course, Dr. Zhang.\"\n\nIt was incredible how everyone at this prison just did what she said. But it wasn't surprising, given the political figures and lawmakers in her collection of photos.\n\nAs we stepped past the walls into the cool night air, I looked up at the stars and my heart lit up. I hadn't seen the stars since I got here.\n\n\"This way.\"\n\nI followed Dr. Zhang to her car and stepped into the passenger side.\n\nNeither of us spoke during the extremely awkward car ride. We drove about ten minutes, before she pulled off to a side road and parked in an empty lot next to an eighteen wheeler.\n\n\"Where are we?\" I said. \"I want to see where you keep the kids.\"\n\nShe glared at me. \"This *is* where I keep them.\"\n\nMy eyes went wide as I saw the text on the side of the truck:\n\n*Glade Farm Milk*\n\n\"You keep them in a truck?\"\n\nI was expecting some sort of abandoned warehouse, or an underground bunker.\n\n\"For transport,\" she said, getting out of the car. \"We deliver them to the clients.\"\n\n\"Jesus,\" I muttered. \"Like some fucked up version of Prime.\"\n\nShe checked her phone briefly and I could have sworn I saw her smile, but then she led me to the truck and unlocked the freight container.\n\nI hopped in after her.\n\nInside, both sides were lined with two levels of small covered cages, at least fifty in total. It looked like some sort of animal shelter.\n\nMy heart sank. \"Are they‚Ä¶ Are they in there?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dr. Zhang, glancing at her watch. \"They're currently sedated. Now, what do you want?\"\n\n\"I want you to drive the truck to my friend's house,\" I said.\n\nShe scoffed. \"What?\"\n\n\"Here's the address,\" I said, shoving a piece of paper at her. \"Let's go, now.\"\n\n\"Mr. Harper‚Ä¶\"\n\n\"It's *Doctor* Harper.\"\n\nShe gave me a forced smile. \"Dr. Harper‚Ä¶ What exactly is your friend going to do? Why not just call the police?\"\n\nI laughed. \"Nice try. I know about your police connections. We're going to his house. Now.\"\n\nShe gave me a curt nod.\n\nBut as we returned to the back of the truck, I heard another car pull up.\n\n\"Who is that?\" I demanded.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said.\n\n\"Bullshit,\" I said. \"Who the hell is that? Did you call someone?\"\n\nBut my question was quickly answered when Pickowitz emerged in the cargo container with us, carrying the manila folder.\n\nDr. Zhang was beaming.\n\n\"Mr. Harper‚Ä¶ I believe you've met Todd Pickowitz. In fact, the two of you were neighbors in solitary. As I'm sure you learned, he has a very unique skillset when it comes to mirroring identities.\"\n\nI groaned.\n\n\"That's right,\" she said triumphantly. \"You gave the photos to my most loyal colleague. Please come along and give me the folder.\"\n\nPickowitz nodded and walked over, handing the folder to her.\n\nShe greedily tore it open, and then frowned.\n\n\"What is this?\" she said, flipping through torn-out pages of a notebook. \"Pickowitz, these aren't the photos. They're journal entries from that Zombie kid ‚Äî Chase Collins.\"\n\n\"Yo, that's what Doctor H told me to read‚Ä¶\" said Pickowitz in Chase's voice.\n\nDr. Zhang looked at him in confusion. \"What are you doing? Why are you talking like that?\"\n\nI stepped forward. \"I know who Pickowitz is.\"\n\nShe turned to me and frowned. \"How?\"\n\n\"A long time ago, I met one of your victims,\" I said. \"A little boy named James. And he described a 'minty man' who stole personalities.\"\n\nShe scoffed. \"So what?\"\n\nPickowitz smelled his armpits. \"Yo, I do smell minty!\"\n\n\"He reeks of menthol,\" I said. \"I could smell it from my cell.\"\n\n\"So you turned him into an idiotic college jock,\" Dr. Zhang laughed at me. \"Good for you. Pickowitz ‚Äî or Chase ‚Äî whoever the fuck you are. Search Mr. Harper for the photos.\"\n\nI took a deep breath.\n\n\"Dr. Zhang, you should be more careful about the tricks you teach to monsters.\"\n\nShe gave me a puzzled look, and then her eyes went wide.\n\nBut she was too late.\n\nI pointed my finger at Dr. Zhang, and shouted to Pickowitz: \"BULK UP, SKINNY FAGGOT.\"\n\n\"No!\" Dr. Zhang shrieked.\n\nPickowitz lunged forward and bit her in the neck.\n\nShe let out a scream and fell to the ground as Pickowitz began attacking her torso.\n\nI knelt down to her level and watched as blood spurted from her neck.\n\n\"*Help*‚Ä¶\" she choked. \"*You're not a murderer.*\"\n\nI held her hand in mine, because nobody should pass onto the next life alone.\n\nI saw the panic in her eyes ‚Äî the panic of a person who knew they were going to die.\n\n\"*You're a protector! You see the good in others. You believe in redemption.*\"\n\nFor the next several minutes, Pickowitz continued to tear her apart and I listened as she desperately spewed various methods of manipulation to garner my sympathy.\n\nI did not respond.\n\nInstead, I simply waited and watched as she bled out.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nAs Pickowitz fed on Dr. Zhang's corpse, I hit him in the skull with a rock by one of the cages. He fell to the ground, writhing and groaning. I leaned forward and fastened his hands behind his back with some rope. Then I tied his legs together as well.\n\n\"Sorry,\" I muttered. \"When you get back to prison, read up on mindfulness. Learn to become comfortable with that empty feeling, rather than trying to fill the void. Eventually, it will reveal its truth to you, and you will be free of this miserable addiction.\"\n\nHe continued moaning as I rolled him toward the back of the truck. I hopped off and carried him over to the side of the road.\n\nI had just used a person's mental illness against them, which put me on the same level as Zhang, but there was no turning back now. So I jumped back up to the bed of the truck and pushed Zhang over the edge.\n\nHer mutilated body hit the pavement with a sickening crack.\n\nAnd finally, I held my breath and prepared myself for the worst part.\n\nI turned to the dozens of cages around me and began ripping the curtains open.\n\nWhat I saw will haunt my dreams for the rest of my life.\n\nYoung boys, some naked, some barely clothed ‚Äî caged like dogs, surrounded by filth and feces. Not even enough space to stand up. All of them seemed to be sedated.\n\nI kept tearing away the curtains as my heart screamed in agony.\n\nAnd finally, I found James.\n\nDirty, malnourished, and alone.\n\nSo alone.\n\nWe had every chance to save him from this living hell, and instead we returned him to his abusers.\n\nTears welled in my eyes, and I suddenly felt the overwhelming urge to throw up.\n\nI bolted out the back of the truck and went into the woods.\n\nI needed to run ‚Äî to sprint. Anything to release the unbearable anxiety gnawing at my core.\n\nAnd so I ran.\n\nI ran through the woods, and I screamed.\n\nI screamed every curse word I could think of. The sounds came deep from within my soul. Anguish, heartbreak, and rage.\n\nSo much rage.\n\nWhat kind of God could let children go through this kind of torture and humiliation?\n\n\"FUCK YOU!\" I screamed into the sky, tears streaming down my face. \"FUCK YOU!\"\n\nI tripped over a root and fell down at the base of a tree.\n\nI tried to scream again, but instead I vomited all over the ground.\n\nAs I laid there panting ‚Äî alone in the woods ‚Äî I looked up at the night sky one last time.\n\nThe constellations sparkled, but I could not see beautiful things anymore.\n\n\\[[Patient File: The Little Wizard - Part 1 of 3 - View Other Patient Files](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dr_Harper/comments/a5wu7f/my_other_patients/)\\]\n\n\\[[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dr_Harper/comments/cjush8/im_a_therapist_and_my_patient_is_being_sold_into/)\\]\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nIf you're enjoying the series, please consider checking out [**my books**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bookseries/B07VPZ4CKC/ref=dp_st_0578453045)!",

It took care of 7 kids, 4 houses, 3 college apartments and party houses, sucking up every bottle cap and can lid an inebriated fraternity member could dare to cram down her gullet. If you ask me, the old girl deserves a break.

It never stopped doing what it was asked. \n\nIf my Oreck was a person it would smoke three packs of Newport menthol cigarettes for breakfast, drink 3 Ice House malt 40oz‚Äôs at lunch time and be back to work hanging drywall by the end of his lunch shift with not a minute to spare.

The key appears to lie in the immune system: menthol inhalation lowered levels of IL-1Œ≤, a protein linked to damaging inflammation in the brain.\n\nWhat‚Äôs even more intriguing is that the scent helped healthy young mice too, enhancing their mental performance. The researchers believe this discovery could pave the way for novel, scent-based therapies for neurological diseases. By tapping into the olfactory system, which directly connects to brain regions involved in memory and emotion, scientists are exploring how specific smells might stimulate immune responses to protect or even heal the brain. While these results are still in early stages, they signal a promising new direction in Alzheimer‚Äôs research.",

    "body": "A while past the woods at the edge of town is a demon made of marble and stone. She has no tongue; she has no face. That was because the demon of the little town of Wilkins was a museum, and in the Summer of 1987, she was calling to me. \n\n\nDuring my stay as a teacher at River Valley Elementary, a time that the place beyond the woods was yet to be named, I was oblivious to the shadow she cast over our small town. And back then, the museum was only spoken of quietly, if at all, cast only into the wind by wet lips carrying playground rumors, never to be heard of again until months later when the mantises would take flight around town, or when somebody went missing.\n\nI didn‚Äôt believe in the living, breathing flavor of demons, at least I didn‚Äôt back then. I believed in the demons inside of my father‚Äôs whiskey bottle, the demons that poured out and burned at his throat, those that swelled into his fist and bloomed. Those that merely showed a glimpse of their painful, plum-colored skin upon my mother‚Äôs eyes and cheeks before cowering away into the glass genie lamp from whence they came. I remembered *those* demons, and once my father had passed away, once I caved to their whispering pestilence and drank from the lamp just as he once did, they too soon remembered me.\n\nMy father wasn‚Äôt all bad, though, God-don‚Äôt-bless-his-soul. He was always an angel to my sister and I, his two star girls, if he could never treat mother the same. *You could never be a princess*, he would say, despite my protesting six-year-old pout. *You will be a queen.*\n\nAnd when he spoke, his smile and giggle made me forget about what he did to mother, and the genies in his desk drawer and upon his shelf. \n\nI guess we share those two burdens: A full-hearted compassion for the whiskey bottle, and for children. \n\nThough, I could never have my own, of course, the world was too broken for that, too untrustworthy. \n\nMy students and nephews were my children.\n\n\nI was at my sister‚Äôs place visiting them when I told her I was being transferred to Wilkins to teach. And well, it didn‚Äôt take things long to fire up.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just *that*, Mariette, it‚Äôs everything, the men, the constant moving around, you‚Äôre a rolling stone. You‚Äôre right - you should ground yourself, have some of your own.‚Äù She said.\n\nWe argued for a while, as we so often did, but this time was different. She told me that I was getting older, that the big three-zero was in my rear-view mirror. I told her that she had a pompous stick-up-her-ass. You know, the usual sibling bitter bicker. But her words left me sour once she said:\n\n‚ÄúFine! Keep moving around like a goddamn gypsy, I don‚Äôt care. Just don‚Äôt come crying to me once you‚Äôre all woozy one day and smack a kid. Like father, like daughter.‚Äù She mocked.\n\n‚ÄúYou and I both know he never hit us.‚Äù I said.\n\n‚ÄúWell guess what, he still,‚Äù She paused to mouth her words as she spoke. ‚Äú...cked us up.‚Äù Her eyes narrowed upon her pointy nose then to her cup. ‚ÄúSome more than others.‚Äù\n\n\nMy sister never swore. \n\nI did.\n\n‚ÄúSay it then, Jan.‚Äù I exclaimed. ‚ÄúSay he *fucked* us up.‚Äù\n\nBut, of course, she never said it.\n\nSome doors remain closed. And when I stormed out, the slam never truly stopped ringing in my ears. The door would remain closed for a while, for years, and my sister and I would speak no longer.\n\nBut the sound of my sister‚Äôs front door closing behind me would carry on: It was the air blustering through my windows, the hum of my engine, the call of crows as they made way for my bumper. And when I finally came driving through Wilkins inhaling my so desired breath of fresh air, all alone, I knew things would be different, that I would sober up, that the ringing reminder of my newly severed relationship with my sister would spark a change in me.\n\nThings were different here - the pines were unfamiliar: towering, green and lush; the glistening roadside waters a crystal blue. Roads curved and bumped as I drove - a beauty that felt absent upon the flat urban grayscale ruins of my hometown.\n\nBut if I told you the most unusual thing about Wilkins were the mantids, you wouldn‚Äôt have believed me then. Nobody quite did - not even myself, until it was far too late.\n\nIt started off innocently enough, as it always did. As I made Wilkins my new home, the lime-colored bug which had shakily climbed my dashboard in the corner of my eye soon became the pest on my shower window. The mantises were *everywhere* by then: one late afternoon a couple danced upon my whiteboard, my pant leg. Soon enough days wouldn‚Äôt go by before I saw one, but as I dipped my feet further in the belly of the place I called my new home, the insects that pestered me would soon be unremembered - I had kids to teach, meetings and plays to attend. After all, they were just insects. Or so I should have hoped.\n\nDistractions in this town soon came to me as easily as puddles in rain; the distractions blossomed into routine; the routine to lifestyle.\n\n\nOf course, Laurence was the first. And a handsome, chiseled one, at that. For our first date night that Summer of ‚Äò84 we spent the night curled under a movie projector that told stories of a cyborg hitman sent back in time, or something like that. I didn‚Äôt really know - it was silly, I spent most of the time then against his chest, inebriated by warm cologne. That, or love.\n\nAnd when I tippy toed up to kiss him that humid night in Wilkins, I felt roots taking place through my feet, grounding me. The pines left fresh menthol upon my nose as I inhaled upon his stubble; our lips meeting under the *NOW SHOWING* sign of the cinema front.\n\nAt that moment I felt truly at home. Nothing could record-scratch that feeling then, not even spotting the mantis that crawled up Laurence‚Äôs neck in the evening moonlight.\n\n‚ñÅ‚ñÅ‚ñÅ‚ñÅ‚ñÅ‚ñÅ‚ñÅ‚ñÅ‚ñÅ‚ñÅ\n\nWhen August came around, I had been living in Wilkins for two months. Laurence and I still slinked through the hallways of River Valley Elementary between chaste romantic physicality, but the only strands of evidence we left were smirks upon each other's faces as we crossed paths outside the staff room. \n\nI think our fling was lost on all the adults, save for Serena. She was a pretty substitute teacher from Italy on a sponsored trip and boy did she have time to pay attention when she was only marking half the number of reports as the usual staff. She paid *too much* attention. Other than her, I think it was only the kids that knew. But as if cowering from a monster, the children would avert their eyes from us, as did we. We didn‚Äôt want to be seen; they didn‚Äôt want to be caught looking. The only time I didn‚Äôt catch them giggling under hand-covered whispers was when we were outside, their minds busy on the slide or monkey bars.\n\nSome of the other teachers dreaded the windy playground duty away from their quiet lunchroom haven, but I absolutely adored it. Maybe it was because the yelling kids were yet to wear on me, but I think I just hated the smell of stale coffee breath. I could deal with my hair that blew over my face as a brunette cobweb, as long as it meant some fresh air.\n\nHappy sounds were out there. Not the dismal hum of the microwave spinning inside, nor the drone of the fax machine scanning page after page. Outside there were children playing, birds singing, wind whirling in my ears and lastly: the sound of cling wrap peeling away from my lunch that had me drooling like a Pavlovian dog.\n\nI was sitting on a bench watching the playground when I first heard about what was through Wilkins woods.\n\nA student of mine, Jimmy, approached me in a rush flinging bits of dust from the bark beneath his feet. ‚ÄúWhatta‚Äô ya eating?‚Äù He pointed to my sandwich.\n\nJim was one of those well-mannered, googly-eyed kids. He looked like the boy from that movie about a mouse called Stuart, though I didn‚Äôt know it at the time because the film wouldn‚Äôt be out for decades to come.\n\nHe was staring at me with big blue eyes that looked even bigger through his glossy, high magnification spectacles. I had never seen someone take that much interest in my lunch before. Kids were lovely.\n\n‚ÄúDonny didn‚Äôt come to class today, Miss Brown.‚Äù He said with his heavy head staring at the ground.\n\n‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs the worst.‚Äù I patted the bench for him to join me. \n\n‚ÄúYou know‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre friends, Jimmy. You can call me Mariette, because we‚Äôre friends.‚Äù I flicked him a reassuring smile before a stern look. ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt call me that in class. The other kids might get jealous that you're friends with me and they‚Äôre not.‚Äù\n\nHe pouted. ‚ÄúOkay Miss Brow- I mean, I mean, Mary-it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhere is Donny, anyhow?‚Äù I asked.\n\nHe looked up at me with the biggest pair of blue lamps. ‚ÄúHe said his mom wouldn‚Äôt take him to go see Goffic, so we were meant to go after football. But today he‚Äôs sick, so...‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGoffic?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDonny says it's a great big castle through the woods. We were going to build a treehouse base, but he says this place is even bigger and even more secret.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDo you mean‚Ä¶ Gothic?‚Äù I asked, making an effort not to smile.\n\n‚ÄúNo, silly, that‚Äôs my sister!‚Äù He protested.\n\nWe laughed together, but only one of us knew why.\n\n‚ÄúWell then, who‚Äôs picking you up today?‚Äù\n\nHe pouted. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt go now. Donny‚Äôs mom won‚Äôt pick me up from football without Donny.‚Äù\n\nI ushered him off the bench and he planted his feet upon the bark.\n\n‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôll grab you from practice, say, eight?‚Äù\n\nHis smile could have lit up a candle. ‚ÄúOkay, eight! Wait-‚Äù He turned around. ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre not going to be busy with your... *boyfriend*?‚Äù\n\nI screwed up my red face before I shooed him. ‚ÄúGo play, go play!‚Äù My voice followed him as he jogged off into the playground warzone. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt forget!‚Äù\n\nIt didn‚Äôt take long before he was reinvigorated, hugging the flying fox for dear life as he swung across the bark. ‚ÄúLook, I can fly!‚Äù\n\nJimmy‚Äôs smart comments left a warm smile on my face well after lunchtime. Stupid, sweet kids.\n\n‚ñÅ‚ñÅ‚ñÅ‚ñÅ‚ñÅ‚ñÅ‚ñÅ‚ñÅ‚ñÅ‚ñÅ\n\nThe sun set quickly that evening, as it so often did on the busy days. \n\nBut when I returned to the staff room later that night to meet with Laurence, he wasn‚Äôt himself. \n\nHis back was turned; his hands fixed upon a red pen that was scribbling away at a student‚Äôs report.\n\nAnd when I approached, it was clear I had caught him by surprise; his busy fingers were not swift enough to reach up and tug his turtleneck before it was already too late.\n\n‚ÄúMariette, I-‚Äù His words began to crawl out, then not at all.\n\nThe grape bites upon his neck had bloomed enough to speak for him. Without a whisper I knew Serena, the sun-kissed substitute slut, had pecked his skin silly.\n\nHis hand met his circle-rimmed glasses in disgrace before sliding down and brushing his stubble with the hiss of rough sandpaper. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not what it looks like.‚Äù He was shaking his head.\n\n‚ÄúIt never is.‚Äù I was choking up. I went to slap him too but stopped.\n\nI stormed out when I caught sight of my fingers that were lipped with wet blobs of mascara. Like the tears that had just feathered away behind my eyes and nose, I felt a stronger tickle now, one deep in my throat and chest, a yearning for the burn of sweet vodka, or maybe bourbon.\n\nHe called after me, I think, *the prick*. I had already passed the corridors and lockers by then and was bathing under the low starlight in the night sky. I turned to look at him, but my breath was a trailing hazy steam, and I couldn‚Äôt hear his voice over the clacking of my heels.\n\n*Yes, the bottle would make it go away.*\n\n*They would go away, the lovebites on Laurence‚Äôs neck would go away.* Maybe not the color, nor the shape, but I knew after a few drinks, the bruising would go - the bruises she left on his neck that only stung at mine.\n\nI threw myself into my car and shoved it into reverse as his fists knocked against my window.\n\n‚ÄúMariette!‚Äù\n\nHe yelled after me, but before long I had disappeared into the night.\n\nThe highway, my vision: a lengthy tunnel where time felt absent, Mariette - the new woman I had become so reacquainted with the last couple of months was absent. I was somebody else then, somebody I thought I had left behind.\n\nThe faces of Laurence and Serena were as vivid in my mind as the lampposts of the freeway that strobed in my periphery as I sped on endlessly. As far as I was concerned, only one solution could douse their stinging eyes from my head, and it was seductively bottled right at the end of the tunnel.\n\nMost bars wouldn‚Äôt take me in. It must have been the look on my face, an expression that bartenders have grown accustomed to, one that was plastered with the desire to lose all sense of self. I don‚Äôt blame them for not wanting to deal with that on a Tuesday evening.\n\nAnd for so long I drove through my relapsing tunnel of pity, stopping only to gawk at any glowing neon OPEN signs that would pour for me. Any drink would have done.\n\nWhere I ended up that night was far from being in a full pub. Alone in my car parked atop Makeout Hill I watched the Wilkins nightscape from up above, my feet brushing against beer cans, my chest cradling an open bourbon bottle to catch loose tears.\n\nMaybe I should have stopped at a payphone to call him. No, I wasn‚Äôt one of *those* women. One time was too many times, Laurence. He had his chance with me. He lost me.\n\nI brushed away my messy hair before wrapping my hands upon the rubber of my steering wheel.\n\nAnd that was when my stomach sank to my feet.\n\n‚ÄúOh God..‚Äù\n\nMy bourbon bottle slipped out of my grip and caught on my lap.\n\n‚ÄúI forgot about Jimmy.‚Äù\n\n‚ñÅ‚ñÅ‚ñÅ‚ñÅ‚ñÅ‚ñÅ‚ñÅ‚ñÅ‚ñÅ‚ñÅ\n\nI came skidding around to the football field at half-past ten; my headlights painting the bumpy neglected concrete of the lot.\n\nThe rip of my handbrake, the cans falling out of my car that toppled onto the ground with an empty *clang*: ringing reminders of my sister‚Äôs voice, telling me that I hadn‚Äôt changed, that I could never change.\n\n\nAnd tumbling myself out of the sedan then, staring up at the flickering floodlights of the football field in a dizzy haze, I think I might have believed her.\n\n‚ÄúJimmy!‚Äù I called. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry!‚Äù\n\n\nMy head thumped with each shaking reverb of my yell. Not a headache, no, way too early for that of course. But a crack opening in the dizziness, a trickle, an omen of a sharp pounding that would flood through come morning.\n\nBut as I scanned the blurry field, I couldn‚Äôt see anything but well-kept grass under the cold flashing lights towering above. No quiet nor distant voice, only the crickets‚Äô lullaby and the clacking of my drunken unpredictable heels.\n\nIt didn‚Äôt take too much searching until I saw it, however. In my periphery I had caught sight of Jimmy‚Äôs red school bag which was hanging from a low branch a few metres away from where my car had parked up, and my stomach twisted.\n\nWalking was hard enough on two sticks, let alone drunk. And so, I tore my pesky stilettos from my feet and chucked them through my car window.\n\nReaching into my dash I grabbed a heavy torch, and before long I was off trotting through the thick brush.\n\nTraversing the forest was difficult. Roots bruised my feet, thorns and branches cut away at my arms and legs.\n\nAny burning terror was dampened by the drink: The only spotlight I had for vision wasn‚Äôt as scary as it would have been sober. When I came jogging down banks, as long as the bourbon coughed up a whistle or a singsong from my lips as I went, nothing could stop me. But it wasn‚Äôt my safety I was concerned about, it was Jimmy‚Äôs.\n\nMy voice was weak from calling out; my feet were sore from the couple miles I had walked. Luckily, the mouth of the forest finally gave way for a small clearing and a lake; my awkward steps less so after being blessed by the soft grass ahead of me. I had soon forgotten about the irritating roots and bark that had prodded through my socks moments prior.\n\nIf I looked carefully enough - if I squinted past the two moons which sat in the sky and danced upon the lake - I could make out her body.\n\nShe was vast and ornate like a gothic castle, or a mansion from a fever dream. A hundred paces away the thing beyond the woods sat quaintly, many tiny windows adorning a hollow dark-brick face. Beneath: a pair of doors that beckoned me forth. I think it might have been *Jimmy* that had beckoned me forth.\n\n\nAround the body of water I went, and I was off again.\n\nWith every step closer the grass seemed to part with a louder whistle in the quiet night; the soft stars upon the windows reflecting different angles as I narrowed in.\n\nWhen I hopped up the stairs it looked like it could swallow me whole, I was standing upon the lips of the beast. My flashlight made a blunt click as it cupped the window beside the door.\n\n‚ÄúJimmy?‚Äù I yelled with a sharp pounding that left a wince on my face.\n\nNo response.\n\nI couldn‚Äôt see much at all inside. Dark outlines of oblongs, bits of furniture and hanging racks all wrapped in white sheets. This place either wasn‚Äôt lived in or the owners wanted their furniture well kept.\n\nPeering in, a whiff of drink-breath stuck to the glass in a fog.\n\nI hated myself at that moment. And when I was drunk, perhaps even more so than I did Serena. That‚Äôs why I drowned myself in it that night, I suppose. I got what I wanted.\n\n\n‚ÄúAre you in there, Jim?‚Äù\n\nI was going to make everything right, I had to.\n\nMy hand braced one of the front doors which left my fingers littered with dust.\n\nIt took quite some force to pry the tall doors open once I realized that the building was unlocked, and before long I was standing in awe as the doors groaned to a halt.\n\nThe grand foyer was pitch dark and adorned with glass cabinets that twinkled like stars upon a moonless midnight sky. Some cabinets were blanketed, others not, but all were littered with dust.\n\nThe cold marble drew heat from my feet easily as I stepped through the building's entrance; my voice echoing throughout the halls as I called out for Jimmy once more.\n\nIt took a while before I noticed that I was in a museum. Many boxes were still in the process of being relocated to their allocated wings.\n\nAs I passed one of the golden pillars that was wedged between the towering ceiling and the ivory floor, I heard ticking begin to pop beside me. Approaching the center stairwell, one of the display cabinets came alive: flickering fluorescent lights tapping away through a cloth veil in the darkness like a dying lighthouse beacon.\n\nIt made me leap and I took off, skidding. I tried the door once more, but it had locked itself tight.\n\nSomewhere yonder the marble halls a silhouette stirred before calling out after me. \n\nSecurity had heard my footsteps.\n\nAround the corner I bolted, looking for any exit I could find.\n\nI ushered through the northern wing of the museum through the door under the stairs leaving the marble floor wet in my wake. I took another left into what must have been the *Earth & Nature Exhibition.*\n\nI ran past a few cabinets that were housing things that were a tad strange. At one point I glanced to my right to see iridescent child-sized beetles that danced moonlight off from their bulbous exoskeletons like aqua fairy dust. Through another glass pane further down the hall, my eye caught sight of ballooned frogs that floated effortlessly from their artificially scaled and rocky wall, right up to the strung neon glow worms hanging above. One nabbed a worm midair by the tongue and swallowed, lighting its round belly blue through a thin, membranous green abdomen on its slow descent.\n\nFor a while my fingers ran along and bumped across the textured hallway walls as I kept running, only to turn my head to read the golden placard to my left when my digits screeched against smooth, cold metal. \n\nI looked down to read the etching inside the frame that read: *SEEDS, GROWING LIFE.*\n\n*They won‚Äôt find me here, I thought. I‚Äôll wait it out.*\n\nThe see-through door to the display was ajar; nothing horrifying stood out to me, but what took me aback was the sheer beauty of the room.\n\nNo museum that I knew could truly capture and emulate the wonder of that enclosure. It was gorgeous; it was walking into the mouth of a cavern.\n\nGreat stalactites and stalagmites adorned the rocky exhibit; a great gushing waterfall cascaded from one tall wall. The wall itself was coated with a luminescent mold that glowed like the worms I had just spotted, but not enough to blanket the room in a lime hue. Instead, rays of starlight trickled in through a purposely angled window near the great ceiling, bathing the wet rocks down below in a holy spotlight which was partly obscured by the hissing mist of the crashing water. The ecosystem was extensive, many green bugs sat undisturbed upon the graphite boundaries of the exhibit.\n\nI leaped over the thin line of water that ran from the fall and onto the moist stones below, swatting gnats from my face as I went. \n\nIt was hard to hear myself think over the crashing, washing and hissing. But when I did think, I thought about how I would wait it out in this room, find Jimmy, and how we would make our way out of here.\n\nMy heart missed a few beats when I looked up. The man that had been following me down the hall was a mere silhouette in the doorframe to the exhibition. I stepped away as much as I could muster, but the wet rocks beneath were slippery, my feet were slipping from below me. The platform I was on could only stretch so far before the water was at my heels.\n\nHe was shouting at me: a loud boom underneath the violent pitter-patter of the waterfall‚Äôs bounce. The closer he walked, the less he looked like a security guard. He was outfitted with a fine maroon coat and dress pants, shined shoes and thin frame. I definitely did not know why he was pointing at my feet, either.\n\nAt first my stomach turned when he jumped down to the stone platform I was sliding on. I thought he was going to kill me; his hands were wide and frustrated as he spoke. When he was several feet away however, I began to make out some of the words he was saying. It loosened my tight chest somewhat, but it still didn‚Äôt make sense to me: Something about *plants, tour guide, be here, exsanguination.*\n\nAll that managed to trickle from my lips was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for,‚Äù\n\nHe was in my face then, still pointing at my feet, and it definitely didn‚Äôt matter what I had to say.\n\n‚ÄúListen,‚Äù His gaunt face looked ghastly in the moonlight. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt hurt you, I‚Äôm just the museum tour guide. But please for the love of-‚Äù\n\nHe grabbed me by my shirt collar and thrusted me onto the ground with a thud.\n\n‚ÄúGet away from the plants!‚Äù \n\nI could see it clearly then. The night sky that beamed through the clear ceiling was illuminating something after all. Great, bulbous weeds protruded through cracks of the stones below the guide and I. They climbed like wild beanstalks up around his suit pant leg, twirling around his calf.\n\n‚ÄúOh God,‚Äù He muttered. \n\nI didn‚Äôt yet understand what he was so afraid of, but his horrified gaunt face alone told me he didn‚Äôt have much time.\n\nSpores filled the air, popping puffs that coughed out of the weeds as hazy green dust all at once. The man was pinching his nose; he was covering his mouth. But before long I knew it was too late, just as his expression had alerted me to, I knew the dust had already coated his tongue and throat; the spewed powder burned through his suit pant leg and lathered his skin in foul vomit-colored specs.\n\nI felt sick. If I knew he was going to grow, I would have done something, anything. But in the end, as I watched him break and expand, I knew there was nothing I could have ever done.\n\nMy mind recalled the etched placard I had braced outside the room. *SEEDS, GROWING LIFE.*\n\nThe meaty leaves of the guide‚Äôs leg blossomed like a flesh-sunflower to make way for the increasingly bulging bone of his new elephant stump. Chunks of his musculature hit the wet rocks with a dull *thop* as he heaved around.\n\nHe cried out unavailingly. Tears ran freely down his cheek and down onto the snow-white bone below.\n\nAn acidic taste lurched at the back of my throat as I wriggled away. *The man was, he was... growing.*\n\nHis ribcage was next, the spores had settled in his lungs. And when those two spiny white wings finally broke free from his chest, covering me in specs of cherry-coloured paint, I wanted to shriek. But nothing ever came from my mouth, only that of a heaving gasp escaping me like I was just plunged into an icy pool.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm,‚Äù I gave it my all to stop hyperventilating. I crawled towards him as he collapsed, holding his hand in the dim light that trickled in from the stars above. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, I,‚Äù\n\nThere was something that made my skin crawl the most that evening: It was that after all that screaming and suffering, the way he spoke to me then was quiet and deliberate. He was no longer in the museum beside me then, he was fading away to somewhere without worry, some place new. In a final moment of peace, his eyes met mine before he uttered:\n\n‚ÄúLook after Ernie for me, will you?‚Äù\n\nAnd when his eyes lost light and his head rolled, the winged bugs that were once still on the wall pried away slowly before blossoming into a buzzing green cloud.\n\nI came bolting out of the cavern, bouncing off the wall outside in a paralyzing panic. \n\n‚ÄúJimmy!‚Äù I shouted, my voice echoing through the long hallway of the *Earth & Nature* wing.\n\nTime moved strangely within the museum‚Äôs walls. Had I been running around for five minutes, or had it been an hour? It was possible that I was simply witnessing my brain proactively erasing the memories of the things that had just happened to me. My mind was trying to save me pain from future trauma recollection, and in doing so stretched the delicately imagined threads of perceived memory-time so thin they would soon distort before fading into nothingness.\n\nI cursed myself that I couldn‚Äôt let the faces of Lawrence and Serena fade from my mind the same way.\n\n‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre in here, come out, it‚Äôs Miss Brown.‚Äù I made my way further down the hall. ‚ÄúI really, really want to leave, I‚Äôm scared Jimmy.‚Äù\n\nBars in the tall windows of the grand building cast their shadows against marble walls. They may have been innocuous at first, but with what I had witnessed that evening, any shift in the storm-grey starlight that painted the museum was enough to make my hands quake.\n\nAt the intersection between what must have been the insect exhibition hall and the museum‚Äôs greenhouse, a whining squeak beckoned me from behind.\n\nThe voice through the final door of the hallway was rasp; it was a cry. A baby in distress.\n\nOn and on the baby cried as my hand met the metal doorknob and resisted entering the room. First a whimper, then a heart wrenching scream. Staring vacantly at the placard which read *BREATHING STORM*, the more my mind would drift to the horrors that could wait beyond, and the less I desired to help. But in fact, the whimper was deeper, it might have been a boy‚Äôs sob, which meant it might have been Jimmy.\n\nStill shaking, I reluctantly twisted the handle, and through the next tent of the horrifying, marble circus I ushered.\n\n\nThe room was near pitch, save for flashes of light that lit up the room as distant, dancing sparks. First the absence of light, then a flash, then an all-encompassing nothingness. Air inside the room was blustering and lifting my coat in a violent hurricane; cold rain pelted my skin before trickling down my nose and chin.\n\n‚ÄúAre you in here?‚Äù I screamed with a chattering jaw over the rushing wind. \n\nFrom what I could see in the time during the brief illuminations, there was no Jimmy. The loud storm took my hearing, the darkness took my sight. It was one loud disorientating and wet headache and being drunk was certainly no aid. My hand slid against one of the smooth, drenched walls of the exhibition as I tried to propel my way through the forceful bluster across the room to the other exit door a few meters away.\n\nI was halfway to the door when I felt the odd pressure from the rain against my arms. I realized the sparks I had seen were strands of lightning; I was inside of a miniature storm. And with each step closer to the door, I felt the water coming from the ceiling beginning to take shape, beginning to wrap around my wrist.\n\nAround me: The storm began to weep - it was a cacophony of whines from an angry infant.\n\n*The rain was alive; it was breathing on me, bullying me.*\n\nI tried to block my ears, but with one hearty tug the materialized muscle of the falling water pulled me by my arm and tossed me against one drenched marble wall.\n\n*It giggled.*\n\nI attempted to break free from the windy grasp but the harder I thrusted myself forwards the further it pushed back.\n\nThe lightning that shot sporadic forks around the room briefly lit up the flooding space. From then I could see the mass of rain taking shape, forming impossible flowing appendages upon a teardrop abdomen.\n\n*You‚Äôre hyperventilating again. Breathe. Just breathe.*\n\nAbove my head from the ceiling clicked a noise from a small rusty speaker, and the intercom replayed a muffled voice.\n\n*‚ÄòThe basis of human hopes and dreams,‚Äô* I knew that distorted voice. \n\n*‚ÄòEmotion and memory - nothing but electricity in a pink ball of wrinkled flesh inside your skull.‚Äô*\n\nFlash. \n\nThe storm‚Äôs ghoulish jaw hung wide in the center like the eye of a hurricane, the rest of its body and appendages wavering wildly like windy willows. It chortled childishly before everything went dark again.\n\n*‚ÄòWhat are we, if we are not a storm?‚Äô*  The voice of the dearly departed guide rang out over the harsh wind.\n\nThe grip of flowing water around my wrist was tightening, tightening.\n\n*‚ÄòAt our private establishment, you will see consciousness uncaged from skin and bone.‚Äô* The speaker‚Äôs connection wavered. *‚ÄòDo not leave yourself unsupervised in this exhibit at any time during the tour. She has developed the neurons of a two year old so far, a real case of the terrible twos. But from afar, feel free to take in her wonder. Dear patron, I welcome you: The breathing storm.‚Äô*\n\nWithout warning I swiped my arm across its torso. The suspended water screamed as I darted through the door; its wrist that had been so tightly locked around mine became a mere puddle on the ground as it lost shape outside the exhibit.\n\nI slid my wet back against the Natural wing hallway and fell to the floor. For a while I pulled at my hair and watched the cold night sky and the great graphite clouds that she rolled outside the window. Hope was slowly trickling through my fingers like sand. For a short while I simply sat and watched the starlit sky and it carried me away from the museum. It must have been something in the moonlight, something the tour guide had seen when his eyes faded to void. And in that moment, I felt it too - the brief bliss. But as the smokey clouds obscured the moon, I was reminded where I was, and to press on.\n\nMy mind freely walked the museum alongside me as I traversed her enormous body. Drenched, bruised and bloody - the building had chewed me and spat me out. When I called for the boy, my voice was weaker, exhausted from screaming, bruised from the museum‚Äôs teeth.\n\n‚ÄúJimmy,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre here, please just come home.‚Äù\n\nMy tired feet slogged beneath me as I checked around every corner, leaving wet prints on the marble in my wake.\n\nI had reached the grand, decorated foyer and climbed the tall ivory colored staircase to one floor up. I made my way past the *Music and Arts* Exhibition, past the flowing walls of sand that depicted paintings of *The Scream*. At one spot the stone floor seemed to carve away a fenced-off hole in the marble which served as a viewing area to the Oceans exhibition down below. The flowing tanks held great waves that rose and crashed within their glass barriers as the creatures inside stirred. It was absolutely terrifying to find that the museum‚Äôs staff had left the tops of the aquariums exposed.\n\nRain was beginning to gently spit against the great panes of the museum. I was almost sure that Jimmy might‚Äôve still been lingering around the forest, and I worried about him catching a chill. But right before I lost faith in my efforts of trespassing, I caught sight of two red shoes down the western hallway. They were Jimmy‚Äôs sneakers - still covered in mud, they lay sprawled in the middle of the hallway, laces strewn.\n\nI came to a running halt in the hallway a few steps from his unkempt sneakers. \n\nTo my left through the window, the graphite clouds I had watched roll in had begun to rain all over the property all the way to the trees. \n\n\nThere was something odd about the view, however. If I looked at the right angle, a translucent oval loomed over the distant grass. Expanding, turning to one side. Blinking.\n\n*A reflection.*\n\nI snapped my head around and bumped the glass with the back of my head with a thud.\n\n\nThe thing‚Äôs peach torso was elongated and splashed with sage green like a moldy, worn suede slipper. \n\nIt was standing above me then, I was close enough to see its face, close enough to see its eyes. The insect‚Äôs lamps looked as if they were features drawn on a lime balloon then inflated - blue and bulbous; about to pop upon a mucus canvas.\n\nIt buckled its head to one side of its mantid neck, then the other.\n\n*Mommy‚Ä¶*\n\nA deep, broken voice wrapped one much younger. It was trying to speak, but its spiny mouth was made for speech no longer. It was trying to- \n\n*Fly‚Ä¶ Look, I can fly‚Ä¶*\n\nTwo contorted wings that could never lift weight broke free in irregular flutters; the spreading translucent veil webbing between the frames of its wings sticking together as torn, holed curtains.\n\nI‚Äôm not exactly sure when I knew it was Jimmy. Perhaps it was when he screamed, if you would even call them screams, but I think it was when his tortured eyes met mine, asking me to take him home, asking me why I never picked him up from practice. I think that‚Äôs when I knew.\n\nI fell to the floor when he swiped at me; my breath cutting short when my head clicked in whiplash.\n\nBackward I crawled, screaming, pleading: ‚ÄúJimmy, it‚Äôs me,‚Äù\n\nThe smooth floor was cold through my thin shirt against my back. From down below looking up I could only watch. It crawled towards me: green feelers bracing the walls of the wide hallway, thrusting its enormous body forward like it was crawling through a tight vent.\n\n‚ÄúPlease-it‚Äôs Miss Brow-‚Äù\n\nIts foot trapped my flailing leg against the marble. Thin spines popped fire inside my calf, the texture of his flesh wet and hairy like seeping roadkill.\n\nOnly when I screamed and wriggled free to my feet did I truly feel like a rat in a maze.\n\nI used the banister of the main stairwell to launch my way to the door in a running limp. My wounds pinched at my leg with each stride - a stabbing akin to my headache not long gone.\n\nThe foyer doors to the outside didn‚Äôt budge. From the dark platform upstairs called Jimmy‚Äôs voice interlaced with horrifying, unending flutters.\n\nI threw my fist against a nearby window. Again and again, I hammered, each thud flashing memories of Lawrence rapping against my car window when I had sped into the night.\n\nCascading glass shards finally gave way to my hand, and I came toppling through onto the front steps of the gothic horror.\n\nTears streamed down my face before being washed away by the cleansing wipe of gentle summer rain. \n\nThe things I had seen - it felt like my heart was going to give out, sweat lathered my hands. And for a while as I clambered through the forest, I wished my heart *did* give out, that I hadn‚Äôt forgotten about the poor child, that I wasn‚Äôt such a big fuck-up. I wished that I could take everything back, I wished upon the dancing stars on the lake that I could be someone other than my father‚Äôs daughter.\n\nI couldn‚Äôt decide if my gooseflesh was the result of terror or the bone-chilling breeze through the trees. All I knew was that it was a long trek made even harder by the downpour. My feet slipped over sharp rocks, branches, and roots. But before long I was at a clearing, and not long after that I could see my car that was getting pelted down on the distant road by the football field.\n\nI threw open the door and fell into the driver‚Äôs seat. For a while I sat and listened to the pitter-patter of the rain above my head. It didn‚Äôt take me away as the moonlight had, not after what I had done. Not after I had forgotten to pick up Jimmy because I was too inebriated to remember how to be a good person.\n\nI clawed my fingers around the rubber of the wheel with both hands and trembled.\n\nI screamed and screamed into the night sky, though the sound didn‚Äôt come. Nor would it ever come, because I knew my throat was no longer wet with bourbon, it was tight with guilt, so tightly fastened with stomach-aching guilt.\n\nInstead, all I heard were Jimmy‚Äôs contorted screams that bounced inside my skull like a distant, dying police siren. \n\n\nI was spinning; the crash of my bourbon-filled genie lamp against the pavement could not silence his crying pleas, nor bring my absolution.\n\nAnd that night, through the windscreen, upon the midnight-tinted skyline, my wet eyes caught momentary beauty. \n\n\nDancing emeralds flickered and zipped by in swarms of flourishing sage, quietly and gracefully like wavering grass.\n\nThe mantises [were taking flight](https://www.reddit.com/r/sharpshooting/comments/qp32sj/the_horrifying_museum_mariette/).",

    "body": "Edit: [2.1 update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/pptm19/what_do_genshin_impact_characters_smell_like_lets/)\n\nNo one asked for this, not a single soul. But you see,  I was out of resin... and at one point while burning the grass in my teapot I wondered: \n\n **What do Genshin Impact's characters smell like?**\n\nThis is a compilation of my thoughts:\n\n**Eula**  \nSomething tells me she wears a very sweet perfume. Something blueberry-like. It's definitely blue.\n\n**Xiao**  \nSmol boi smells like an old lady. You know the smell. Not terrible, but powerful and very distinctive.\n\n**Albedo**  \nHe smells very faintly of solvents. Like when you take a sniff off still wet varnish, even when you know you shouldn't.\n\n**Rosaria**  \nMenthol cigarettes. You know, like when a heavy smoker speaks in your direction and it smells like death just blew you a kiss? That.\n\n**Ganyu**  \nIncense. Sandalwood, specifically.\n\n**Yanfei**  \nAlso incense, but the watermelon kind. The one that was not meant to be incense. Very red.\n\n**Hu Tao**  \nShe smells like wood, 100%. Like an antique shop, despite being young. Very coffinesque.\n\n**Zhongli**  \nBig dong smells like pure, distilled Hugo Boss or some fancy shit. Childe bought it, of course. Zhongli had no say in the matter.\n\n**Xinyan**  \nShe smells like party. You know that scent. The one like cigarrette secondary smoke but also a bit sweet with booze. She did not consume any of these things, but it's all over her. (I confess I miss  that scent, damn you Corona).\n\n**Childe**  \nHe smells like pure, distilled Hugo Boss as well, but he got to pick his, unlike Zhongli.\n\n**Diona**  \nShe reeks of cotton candy, with a faint note of cat litter (before being used of course).\n\n**Klee**  \nOh god... She smells of a million sweaty kindergarden kids, crayons and a very suspicious hint of smoke.\n\n**Venti**  \nSame as Xinyan, but he absolutely did consume all of it.\n\n**Keqing**  \nShe smells of hair conditioner. Fruity, but smooth.\n\n**Mona**  \nHer outfit suggests she swims. A lot. You know that scent of mildewy dry fabric? She smells like that. She can't afford laundry, okay?\n\n**Qiqi**  \n...\n\n**Diluc**  \nHe smells of manly body odour. Not sweat or gym clothes. Nothing nasty. Just his own personal scent.\n\n**Jean**  \nShe smells of mint, vanilla with a hint of coffee addiction.\n\n**Sucrose**  \nPeppermint, but in a very chemical and artificial way.\n\n**Chongyun**  \nAdorable boi smells of flowers. He swears he doesn't use anything scented.\n\n**Noelle**  \nFresh laundry. Still warm and straight out of the dryer.\n\n**Xingqiu**  \nHe smells very faintly of rain, but you can't help noticing the scent of new books from what he's reading. Kind of like a new magazine. (He puts flower petals in Chongyun's body wash.)\n\n**Bennett**  \nPoor boi smells of dried rubbing alcohol and bandages. Kind of hospital-like, mixed with some deodorant.\n\n**Fischl**  \n[This.](https://i.imgur.com/J61Rvba.gif)\n\n**Ningguang**  \nChanel, commissioned by Ningguang to Coco Chanel herself. Despite that, she smells of pi√±a colada sunscreen, but it's *her* own pi√±a colada sunscreen.\n\n**Beidou**  \nDespite all her drinking, she doesn't smell of booze. She smells like a grassy perfume, mixed with a hint of cigarettes and mint chewing gum.\n\n**Xiangling**  \nFeet. You can't tell because of all the kitchen smells, but 100% feet. With some ketchup in the mix.\n\n**Razor**  \nHe's a good boi, and he just took a dip in the lake. He now smells like static, with some wet puppy.\n\n**Barbara** \nExact same fragrance as Fischl, but she uses it in moderation, so she smells nice.\n\n**Lisa** \nDried herbs, old books and antique shop. She makes her own perfume, to smell specifically of this.\n\n**Amber**  \nA bit like sweat from all that ~mining~ running around, but the kind you don't judge because she's been jogging and taking her of herself.   \n\nUnlike you.\n\n**Kaeya**  \nALL THE AXE DEODORANT IN THE WORLD.\n\n**BONUS from leaks**  \n>!Kazuha!<  \nSmells of wet soil and rain.\n\n >!Ayaka!<  \n Smells of flower petal incense.\n\n**Edit**: Forgot the twins!\n\n**Lumine**  \nShe smells very softly of mint tea, and the fabric softener sheets that you put in the dryer.\n\n**Aether**  \nHe smells very softly of body odour, Tommy Hilfiger, and the fabric softener sheets that you put in the dryer.",

Even Lan (the female adventurer in Liyue) admits she doesn‚Äôt smell nice because of her job.\n\nSo realistically:\n\nEula - a reconnaissance unit that camps out days or weeks at a time, as pretty as she looks i wouldn‚Äôt want to be near her during her active duty.\n\nRazor - canonically smells bad (Venti voiceline), lives, eats and sleeps with wolves.\n\nAmber - same as Eula but probably at a lesser extent as she‚Äôs always near the city so she may go home every night to take a bath.\n\nMC - was literally stuck for months in the wilderness and was canonically homeless and camps out on a regular basis before the serenity pot. I feel kinda bad especially if the MC is Lumine.\n\nVenti - hangs out often at the bar and Zhongli‚Äôs voice lines state that he reeks of wine.\n\nBennet/Fischl - same case as Lan, goes to adventures often so they will have body odor.\n\nXiangling - if she‚Äôs foraging she will smell especially on how far she goes to get ingredients but in the restaurant she will smell like spices/ingredients.\n\nBeidou - Oh no.. Historically medieval sailors have some of the most filthiest of living environments. Prone to skin diseases and all. I just hope her ship has special amenities that allow her and the crew to clean themselves.\n\nHu Tao - If doing her regular job she will smell like incense. Though on her storyline she camped out for days trying too meet up with her grandpa‚Äôs soul. I can only imagine how she smells like during that time.\n\nDiluc - he‚Äôs a rich tycoon, he will have the best perfume and laundy soap out there.\n\nJean/Lisa - usually stuck at office work so they will smell pleasantly.\n\nNingguang - has the best perfume/soap out there and doesn‚Äôt come out often.\n\nNoelle - During her maid duties she will smell nice but on training she may smell like someone who exercises.",

Probably not good but I imagine it's metal and tar. \n\nScaramouche probably smells of blood masked by a dainty perfume.\n\nI imagine Signora smells expensive. Minty with crisp lilies and the tears of her enemies.\n\nDvalin smells like the air when a big thunderstorm is approaching. \n\nAndrius simply smells like dog but you would never notice because his icey winds numb your sense of smell. \n\nThe Abyss mages smell like Dainsleif but also with a distinct dusty quality. Like old clothes left in a cupboard for too long. \n\nAll the Fatui mobs smell unpleasantly of sweat and body odor except for the big hydro guy because he takes good care of himself. \n\nPaimon smells like puppy and whatever she last ate. \n\nThis is so much fun.",

        "body": "I like this game, let's play it!\n\non my own way of seeing it:\n\nZhongli probably smells of custom made berry scented perfume, distilled in osmanthus wine.\n\nVenti probably smells of whatever the result of all the cocktails and being in the wind a lot would result, without the sweat.\n\nNingguang pretty sure would use something distinctively discreet, that would probably remind you of recently sunned out towels with a hint of softner. she detests spending more than she has to, evidenced by her favourite food line.\n\nKaeya, you bet he uses something like Malbec.\n\nBarbara probably uses a fragance reminiscent of her more child like habits. she's the righteous kind of nun after all.\n\nRosaria is an ex smoker, so she probably still uses a lot of neutralizing kind of perfumes, but something tells me it's more in the line of old office buildings, if you've been into one there's that lingering scent.\n\nLisa probably smells of a custom made soap, she looks like the type that probably soaks just the right amount in a bathtub. it's indescribebly good, but not in an invasive way.\n\nDiluc doesn't smell, but you can tell that wearing an overcoat in that heat probably leaves a mark.\n\nRazor is a dog, so he gets a pass.\n\nBeidou smells of Sake, that's why she doesn't smell a lot of alcohol, but since she stays long periods of time in the sea, I lean towards the whole \"salt and booze\" altough with that skin she probably uses the same perfume as Ning.\n\nNoelle uses a standart run of the mill deodorant, doesn't think much of it, but it suits her prim and proper image perfectly.\n\nXiangling smells like oil, and pepper.\n\nFischl probably uses johnson and johnson and little if no perfume at all. Oz smells like ozone so it lingers in her master too.\n\nBook boy smells of old books, probably washes his hands compulsively.\n\nSucrose is a hard agree from me.\n\nJean likely uses the most neutral form of shampoo possible, her clothes smell more than her, like Saber.\n\nQiqi smells of a clean fridge and grass.\n\nYanfei makes her own perfume, but she still smells of office.\n\nMona smells like sex, not that she's having any,  and dried out glass dust from her equipment.\n\nAjax smells of sex, because he's been having lots, also body odor and gunpowder mixed with ozone.\n\nDiona basks in the sun a lot, so I'm gonna guess a faint alcoholic smell, mixed with the classic recently streched out young cat (you know the one)\n\nEula does the same as Jean, but her clothes probably smell of something strong like cinnamon.\n\nRock girl, hard agree, and probably spent the night with the roadie fixing the audio issues too, nothing sexual, just THAT DAMN BASS.\n\nXiao smells like death. the lingering scent of fast approaching demise. if you've been in a place where someone died recently of natural causes, that is the smell.\n\nKeqing hard agree, but also makes a point of it cause it pisses her off how frugal Ning is.\n\nAmber smells of fresh sweat, the kind of woman that would make you go caput fresh out of the shower.\n\nHu Tao somehow escapes smelling of death because she smells of the wood used to make the coffins, also Homa probably smells of cinnamon and mercury.",

It smells like death, because God help you if you have asthma around her and the store. So would Baizhu (though probably more strongly as unlike qiqi, he's also using them on himself), while we're on the topic. \n\n\nIn a similar vein, xiangling would smell like the inside of a spice rack. A fairly common thing to do in Chinese cooking is frying spices and that stuff's *potent*. Especially if you're doing it a lot. \n\n\nI'm sorry, but it's canon that zhongli smells like an old lady. Remember the story quest where we had to get perfume for his funeral and he chose the smell for 'mature women'? Yeah he smells like that. \n\n\nOn the other hand, I don't think Xiao would smell of anything but sweat and blood. Dude *absolutely* does not look after himself and probably hasn't had a bath in weeks. He might smell a bit sweet from the tofu he eats, but that's probably the only nice thing about his smell. \n\n\nChilde smells of Hugo boss yeah, but like, there's another smell mixed in there. Enough to make you go \"huh, that's not apart of the cologne is it?\", But not enough that you can recognise what it actually is. It's blood. He has the slightest whiff of blood about him. \n\nGiven how much research sucrose has done into sweet flowers, I'd argue she'd more smell lemon-y than minty. \n\n\nGiven he's like, *made* of chalk, Albedo probably smells a bit like rock. That smell you smell when you walk into a deep cave. He denies all knowledge of the smell though, and if pressed he might mumble something about it being related to his vision. \n\n\nBarbara probably smells more like myrhh (the incense you find burning in Catholic churches) and candles due to her church-ly duties. Maybe a bit of sweat and bubblegum too, depending on if she's put on a performance recently. \n\n\nDiona would *reek* of whatever she's been chasing after this week, with a hint of cat smell too. Pond mud, juyen chilis, boar musk, finely aged whiskey, doesn't matter. Unfortunately the spring fairy's blessing only applies to her drinks and not their smell.\n\n\nAlso are you trying to tell me that Beidou the pirate *wouldn't* smell like the sea? She absolutely smells salty and fishy and a bit like ozone, given how often she uses her vision. Also probably a bit musky. I mean you're not going to get many baths while out on the open waves...",

Very oily sa t-zone.\n\nProduct specs(?): Runny/watery, matte finish, menthol scent with cooling sensation, no whitecast\n\nReview: This is the best sunscreen na natry ko as someone with very oily skin. I get less oily na talaga throughout the day nung nagstart kong gamitin to. Runny yung consistency nya and di kayang imessure gamit two finger method, kaya I use 1/4 teaspoon (measuring spoon) for face + neck. Pag nag reapply naman I just eyeball it, yung feel kong enough na. Matte finish sya, as in para kang nag powder pag nag dry na sya. Diba sa ibang sunscreen pag nag set na sya, dumidikit pa rin yung hair natin pag nahangin sa face unless mag powder after, dito hindi kahit di na mag powder. Wala syang white cast, effortless sa pag blend, and the best part for me is yung cooling effect nya ü´∂üèºü•∞ü´∂üèºü´∂üèº nung una ang weird pero nung nasanay na ko I find it relaxing kasi ang init sa pinas. Nakakahilam nga lang sya dahil sa menthol pero keri lang naman. Okay din sya under makeup or part ng skin prep, di na kasi ako gumagamit ng ibang sunscreen under base, eto nalang talaga ginagamit ko and ok sya. Cons lang nya para sakin is walang bigger size, kaya din siguro nakakailang repurchase na ko hahaha pero the best talaga tong suncreen na to and di ko na to pagpapalit. Yung gold variant una kong ginamit pero ayaw ko talaga yung scent non pero same lang sila ng finish, yung scent lang talaga naiba and etong silver is may cooling effect.",

I use Now brand but there‚Äôs a ton of different brands out there you can try. I get them on Amazon.\n\nThe thing is, it‚Äôs so concentrated that once you‚Äôve digested the pills, the mint exits your body via your sweat. So your sweat is effectively menthol, and once it hits your skin it has a chilling cooling sensation as it evaporates. \n\nIt allows you to weaponize your sweat against the heat. And bonus, it calms upset tummies.\n\nI take them an hour or so before I go to bed to combat night sweats, and this time of the year I take them throughout the day. \n\nI know there‚Äôs a lot of conversation about peppermint and its effect on hormones, if any, so I can‚Äôt speak to that. As with anything, always take caution when trying new supplements.\n\nAlso your vagina will be chilly and smell like mint. \n\n",

Your doctor should gradually increase your dose until all symptoms are relieved. I had no idea how low my dose was until I asked to go up. In hindsight, I cannot believe the symptoms I suffered were totally preventable! For example, at 60, after being on HRT since 48, I didn‚Äôt realize all the vaginal atrophy and UTIs and sore inner labial skin was completely gone with an increase of estradiol from 1mg to 2mg! My life once again was vastly improved from a higher dose. BTW, none of the doses are anywhere near what we made as younger women, so don‚Äôt let them gaslight you!

    "body": "Why do I call this the ULTIMATE guide? Because it involves YOU!\n\nMy old archived guide covered a lot, but I feel like I might have missed a few things. In this post, I added more info to my previous post made on Oct 19, 2019. If you read this and want to add more please do so!\n\nI want this to be a reference that benefits the working class of the world! thanks!\n\n1. Don't  buy cheap boots, even if they are on sale. Good budget boots should be  $100 to $140. Great budget boots are $150  to around $190. Post $200 I feel the term\"budget\" doesn't really apply. Specialty boots like loggers, deep snow boots, ski boots etc are typically more expensive, but also can be in the budget range. If specialty boots are in the budget range you run the risk of buying pieces of crap.  Don't buy walmart or target (etc) pieces of crap, they  will destroy your feet.\n\n2. Don't  buy leather outsoles if you work on concrete all day . Leather doesn't absorb stepping impact shock  like Rubber soles do.  Leather outsoles are okay for softer ground such as grass, forest, etc. If you work walking on concrete or any hard surface all day I suggest buying boots that have a crepe wedge outsole. Although this type of outsole is very shock absorbent, it does not last very long due to its softness. How long it last really depends on the abrasiveness of the surface you walk on and how you walk. A few companies like [Keen](https://www.keenfootwear.com/p/M-SAN-JOSE-6-WP.html?dwvar_M-SAN-JOSE-6-WP_color=1022106&cgid=) have added a layer of durable rubber below the crepe sole to make it last longer, which helps it with longevity. There are also non-crepe sole technology options that are also great at absorbing shock.   A few I suggest are: [wolverine durashocks](https://www.wolverine.com/US/en/technology-durashocks/), Keens, carhartt, and Timbaland PRO, Chippewa  (few don't have a name for their tech, but most come with it).\n\n3. Shock  absorbing inserts are also a must if you walk on concrete or hard  ground all day. DON'T BUY GEL INSERTS. I don't know why they even sell  them, but all of them are pretty much a gimmick. Gel doesn't absorb  shock, foam does. Right now my work boots are [Wolverine I-90s](https://www.wolverine.com/US/en/i-90-durashocks-6-inch-wedge/36410M.html?dwvar_36410M_color=W10888#cgid=technology-durashocks&start=1)  that have a shock absorbing memory foam insert. It was okayish by itself, but I  noticed I had some room still and decided I would stick another insert  in for more support. I gone through trial and error and a bunch of  research and finally concluded that layering shock absorbing material is  the best method. My boots currently have three layers of shock  absorbtion. The first being the outsole and  the insole and another  layer from this specific [dr scholls insert](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MG68UX9/ref=emc_b_5_t).  Why do I say specific? I found that these inserts were the thickest(in  the heel area) out of all their products (excluding the custom ones)  even the ones that were specified for heel pain. With these layers, I  feel absolutely nothing after 8 hours of walking (well, including breaks  duh) and after 12 negligible pain to sometimes nothing.\n\n4. If  you find a boot that fits almost perfectly, but could use just a  liiiiiitle more toe room, cut the insert that it came with just below  where the toes start. If it still rubbing at a specific toe, I suggest [toe condoms...I mean sleeves lol.](https://www.amazon.com/Beautulip-Protectors-Breathable-Sleeves-Toenails/dp/B07K3ZQVKL/ref=sr_1_17?keywords=toe+sleeves&qid=1571473464&s=hpc&sr=1-17)  Don't put them on all the toes because it will start to feel tight. Put  it on one toe that gives you trouble the most (usually big or pinky).\n\n5. TALCUM/GOLDBOND  POWDER IS A LIFESAVER. Friction and sweat are a bad combo so I use  Goldbond Ultimate (the one with menthol) and it lasts me the whole day.  Even if you don't have sweaty feet, still use it. What I do is put some  in my sock then I close the top opening with my hand and just shake  around so it gets all around the sock. It does stain your socks, but I  have socks just reserved for work.\n\n6. There  are different types of waterproofness for different work environments.  If you are guarding against small to medium splashes and medium rain,  buy the typical waterproof boots. But if you are working in a swamp, in  mud or deep snow, I suggest neoprene boots, duck boots, some loggers, or dedicated snow boots. With those, you  don't really need shock absorbing inserts (still could add them) because  more than likely you will be walking on soft ground all day.\n7. Don't wear black or dark brown boots if you live in a hot area. Dark colors absorb heat more. Tan and lighter colors work best. Sure they look dirtier down the line, but its better at reflecting heat.\n\n8. If you work in environment where there is a likelihood of you slipping on ice, I highly suggest going to [https://www.ratemytreads.com/ratings/](https://www.ratemytreads.com/ratings/) to look up any boots that have a good grip.Basically most of the boots that passed these ratings had and abrasive in the sole of the boot. For example, Wolverine teamed up with Vibram to provide boots with their \"arctic grip\" technology. Do be careful with these boots though and only wear them outside your house. You don't want to end up scratching your floor. \n\n9. Get boots with lots of stitching on the seams, 2 to 3 stitches per panel.\n\n10. Goodyear  welt is not only good for re-soling, but for re-enforcement as well.  Wolverine has a contour welt, which also works and Keen plus a few  others have a 3/4 welt which also works (all equally imo). It adds more  strength to the glue that meets the sole and the shoe. You don't really  need a threaded welt, but it does make the boot last a bit longer. Another welt to consider is Norwegian welt,which offers the best in waterproofing, but usually are more expensive. Some  boot brands have really good shoe glue that you don't really need a  welt. Wolverine, Keen, Timbaland, Carhartt,Irish setter, Red Wings,Jim Green, Georgia, Carolina, Chippewa and  Ariat have glues that last.\n\n11. Most  workers don't reeeeally need steel toe, even if their jobs \"require\" it. I work  in warehouse production, where the most heavy thing that will probably  fall on your foot is a pallet from 4 feet, yet they want steel toe. The  forklift drivers have barrier lights that shine on the floor that you  can't cross so you won't get in the way of the fork lift tires. A lot of  boot enthusiasts do a forklift test to rate the effectiveness of the  toe, but if your foot goes under a forklift its not your toes that you  have to worry about, its the whole foot (and leg). I would recommend  steel toe in a few jobs, like logging, heavy machinery mechanic, brick  layer, pipe layer, welding or any business where you lift 80 to 100 lbs  constantly. Carbon fiber also works too in these situations, since its  great at impact absorption. Aluminum and composites are great for  warehouses, most field work, landscaping, electricians, etc. They also  great if you are working in hot or cold ground since they don't conduct  heat or cold from the surrounding environment.\n\n12. If  you want more foot protection, MET (metatarsal) gaurds are quite handy  (or footy?). There are both external and internal. Usually loggers,  brick layers, pipe fitters, welders, and furniture movers wear them since they have more of a  chance of something slipping from their hands and falling on their foot  and not just on their toes.\n\n13. Another environmental hazard to look out for is sharp objects/nails. If you work in construction, you will more than likely have to follow a safety requirement for your boots. \n\n14. Don't  buy new boots just because they are starting to look real ugly. If they  still haven't lost their waterproof-ness, sole grip, or sole isn't  coming off/eroding away then they still work. Don't buy boots for looks  either, buy them for work. Make sure they are as comfortable as slippers, because at the end of the day, you don't want to be hurtin.  As some dude told me way back: \"good  boots+good bed=good life.\n\n\n\nHere I will highlight some good workboot brands split into three budgets. I will also mention what work environments they usually cater to.\n\nGOOD to GREAT BUDGET BOOTS ($100-200) (sometimes around close to $100 if you get them on sale)\n\n* Wolverine (I am a wolverine fan man lol) (warehouse, construction, farm, pipe fitters, some have vibrams anti-slip ice tech)\n* Keen (warehouse work, construction, hiking, medium heavy duty work)\n* Carhartt (warehouse work, construction, hiking, light heavy duty work)\n* Ariat (farm, warehouse, construction, hiking, oil, snow, loggers, heavy duty work)\n* Carolina (warehouse, construction, oil, loggers, hunting,military? medium heavy duty work)\n* Thorogoods (warehouse, construction,loggers,hunting, medium heavy duty work)\n* Georgia (warehouse, construction, light heavy duty work)\n* Timberland PRO (warehouse, construction, light duty work)\n* Chippewa (construction, loggers, oil, medium heavy duty work)\n* Redwings (not the heritage line)(warehouse, Farm, hiking,construction, oil, medium heavy duty work)\n* Irish setter (same as redwings) \n* Danner (construction, warehouse, logger, hiking, oil, military, medium to heavy duty work)\n* Corcoran (mostly a military boot, but can take medium heavy duty work)\n* Jim(my) Green (construction, warehouse, hiking, medium heavy duty work)\n\nNext list I will dedicate to those boot brands that you pretty much get what you pay for when it comes to their expensive price. These boots are expensive, yes, but they can last your for years/decades (depending). they are not entirely indestructible, but like really close lol\n\n* Whites, Wesco,JK Boots and Nicks are kind of all tied for first. All four mostly cater to loggers up in the Pacific NorthWest.  They do custom foot fittings as well and they could go for up to $900 bucks. They also do pretty durable casual wear boots that are similarly constructed. \n* Danner also makes pretty decent heavy duty boots usually around the $300 to $400 range. not nearly as indestructible as the first three, but good enough.  \n* Redwing also makes some pretty heavy duty work boots from the $250 to $300 range, but most of their all leather construction (or mostly) is aimed at casual wear/hiking to light to medium heavy duty work. \n\nedit:2/22/21\n* I would like to add the European brand HAIX to this tier because they are a dedicated foot brand for first responders (firefighters, police, EMT) They are a bit expensive, but you get what you pay for. They even have a resole service on some of their boots!\n\n*edit:3/07/21: added JK boots to the list of high end boots.\n\nI would also like to point out that there are some dedicated snow boots (for snowboarding, skiing, etc) that are in this price range, but I don't know much about them or which brands to recommend. I live in a place where it never snows so I wouldn't be of much help there lol. \n\n\nAgain, if anybody has anything to add please feel free to do so in the comments. Much thanks!\n\n-Sirmandudeguy\n\nEdit: I added thorogoods because I completely forgot about them. Jim Greens is a new commer from south africa. Pretty great boot for a great price. Will keep adding more eventually as I keep learning about other brands.",

        "body": "I want to expand on SirMandudeGuy's #1 point from my own experience, if I may.\n\nVery early 80's, I have my dream job. I'm 20 or 21 and I'm working in  a high end body shop as a helper / apprentice. I'm all ears and want to  learn. One day, the whole shop stops working and are walking out while hollering Knapp is here! Knapp truck is here! I look up and have no idea  what is going on. I'm motioned to come along.  \n \n\nOutside I see a Knapp Shoes mobile truck, the same as a tool truck salesman. Picture a common potato chip truck you've seen making deliveries and all the shop employees are inside it. I make my way  inside and notice all my coworkers are ogling and drooling over two  styles. One an oxford and the other a 6\" work boot, both with an oblique designed toe. I asked the salesman \"how mush are those?\" and I was told  $89.99. Well as soon as I heard that, I was afraid to even touch them,  and I bolted out of there!\n\nThere was an elder body man there that was very quiet, he didn't say  much more than hello in the morning and just did his job at a very high  level and was very respected by all the others. That afternoon after the  Knapp truck had left he took me aside and asked, \"I seen you leave, why  didn't you like those boots?\" I told him: I'm the new kid, I don't make  much money. I only make $5/hr. I can't afford $100 boots at $200 a week.\n\nHe replied, let me tell you something. When you get older and can't  see good, what does the doctor do? He gives you glasses, from plastic,  and you see. When you get old and your teeth are bad, what does the  doctor do? He gives you new teeth, out of plastic and you can eat again.  When you get old and your hip goes bad, what does the doctor do? He  gives you a new hip, from plastic and you walk again. The same thing thing for a bad knee, PLASTIC. But what does the doctor do for bad feet?  Nothing, because they don't make plastic feet!\n\nHe went on to explain, in my town where I can from some many people  have bad feet because of bad shoes, because people are so poor. The  family can only afford one pair of shoes for their children and that is  for the oldest. When he grows out of them the shoes go to his younger  brother. If the the family has a lot of boys, by the time the youngest  get those shoes, they are worn out and garbage. So always take care of  your feet with good boots because when your feet go bad, what are you  going to do if you can't walk on them? How will you work if you can't  walk? And besides, you work and can afford $100 for Knapp boots to do  your job and protect your feet ... it's only half a weeks pay for you  they will last for 2 years or more. I eventually gave in and bought a  pair. They were the best I've ever owned and still miss Knapp.  \n \n\nI'm 61 now and you know what? That advice has stuck with me for 40  years and that old guy was 100% right, because they STILL don't make  plastic feet!!!",

        "body": "Some things to add as a person who is particular with boot care... DON'T BLAME YOUR BOOTS FOR BECOMING DRY AND RIPPING.\n\nI have seen boots last so long from construction workers and mechanics who come into the store I work at and they last years. So here are some tips as a work boot owner myself.\n\n1. First off make sure when you first get your boots and every 3 months to a year, condition your boots. Now people are going to ask \"why 3 months? Isn't that too soon?\" No not really, depending on what you work with. If you work in a lot of dust or debris or even just a constant down pour of water or heat, you need to make sure your leather is somewhat supple and healthy. My general rule of thumb for me is, Condition when your leather starts to fade drastically from the color when you conditioned it.\n\n2. Next thing that is THE MOST IMPORTANT BOOT CARE TIP is to clean your boots which by that I mean mainly brushing them off with something like a horsehair brush. And that people, is why your boots become dry. Sure you kind of fill the um ... \"Pores\" of your leather with conditioner but you can do the same with dirt and dust. BRUSH BRUSH BRUSH YOUR BOOTS! Just do it. People make this whole deal about how they just leave their boots dirty because they're work boots but that makes no sense. You want your boots to be dirty and dry and cracking for work? No, just no.\n\n3. Saddle soap is extremely difficult to use correctly. Sudsy is good sure, but don't let it sit too long on the leather or else it has a weird effect of almost making it feel in a constant state of moisture? Like it can dry out the leather. So just use like a drop on your soap tin and apply a small amount to a brush and then wipe it off as quickly as possible.\n\nAnyways, just take pride and care in your boots. If you want your boots to take care of you for a while, take care of them. Good luck!",

    "body": "Hi. I'm just looking for advice here.\n\nI was originally 275 pounds and with my short height of 5'4, I was considered obese. I've had trouble managing and losing my weight since I was 16. I'm 24 years old now. \n\nI used to be bullied and fat shamed especially by my mother. I tried every diet I could think of, and I would exercise but it was like no matter what I did, my weight never changed. Diet pills, smoothies, supplements would never work either.\n\nI pleaded my doctor for help, and he eventually recommended me for a gastric bypass. However, because of my weight I was too overweight for the surgery. The doctor made me a referral with a nutritionist and together we made a plan for me to lose at maximum 1-2 pounds a week.\n\nThe first week was pretty difficult as I work at a fast-food restaurant, so I'm surrounded by food. Have you ever walked in and just relished the smell of juicy hamburger patties sizzling in the grill? But somehow, I maintained my distance and was content with the salad I brought from home. \n\nThis was every day for a week, and I also went for a walk after work.\n\nYou would think I lose a pound or two but when it was time for my weigh in at the end of the week, I found out I actually gained 5 pounds.\n\nDisheartened and angry, I went browsing on the internet for something that would make me shed these pounds. I checked pill after pill, but the reviews would always say it was some sort of MLM scam or they were incredibly out of my price range. I had already saved up most of my money towards my surgery, so I barely had enough to cover my portion of the rent towards my mother.\n\nEventually I looked towards the dark web. You see, I always heard of the dark web as a location on the internet where you could find anything. It was a place notorious for weapons, snuff films, and drugs. There were black markets for everything and for a cheaper price.\n\nThat's how I stumbled upon these diet pills. The website itself looked pretty official for an underground site but the reviews were outstanding. The pills were made by a company called Beelzebub Inc. The bottle was black and with a fire background and the blurb was as follows.\n\n*Do you want to burn off the fat as quick as possible while enjoying the same foods? Our fat burner supplements for men and women have been tested and utilizes the energy obtained by food consumption and rapidly increases metabolism. This allows the fat cells to rapidly degenerate allowing you to lose weight faster. The more calories consumed, the faster you lose weight.*\n\n*About this item:*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* *Each capsule contains natural, powerful fat-burning ingredients and the laboratory tested formula helps burn fat, increase energy, and boost metabolism*\n* *Gluten free*\n* *Contains no artificial fillers or preservatives*\n\nOne of the top testimonies gave them five stars and essentially wrote a whole page dedicated to how great the product was. They said they didn't even need any kind of surgery, nor did they have loose skin. And they had pictures and everything.\n\nI remember thinking to myself there was no way these pills would work. They were way too good to be true. But when I saw the price, I thought it couldn't hurt to try. I was already on my own path to being skinny. A couple dollars might not work but maybe I could placebo myself or something.\n\nSo, I used a visa gift card and bought them. I wasn't going to use my actual information.\n\nA couple of days went by, and my weight increased by another 6 pounds. I was getting frustrated and felt like I was destined to be fat forever.\n\nBy the time the pills came, I was already in the dumps about my lack of weight loss. My mother had said if she didn't start seeing more effort on my end, she would charge me more for rent. She said maybe that way I would learn to waste less money on 'junk food'. Thing was.... I hadn't ate junk food in weeks.\n\nThe packaging was nothing special. Sleek black box with the bottle of pills. It also came with a set of instructions.\n\n*Take one before every meal. The more calories consumed; the more fat will be burned.*\n\nI did think it was pretty weird that it didn't list any side effects, but I was desperate. So that morning before work, I popped a pill and ate my breakfast. A pretty bland meal of oatmeal with raisins. I was currently at 287 pounds.\n\nWhen I got to work, I felt pretty normal and continued my usual day of handling cash and flipping burgers. But somehow, it was even more hectic than usual, and I had a screaming customer flip out on me because I couldn't take their coupon. She tried throwing her Balenciaga bag at me and ranted about how her bag was worth more than I would ever make. My manager made me apologize to her and gave her a full refund and a coupon for a free meal for next time.\n\nSuch an asshole.\n\nI was so stressed out from the day that I decided to treat myself to full meal. A bacon burger with chili cheese fries. I also ordered a milk shake with sprinkles and a cookie. Once I sat down with my food, I pulled out a diet pill from my purse and gulped it down with the Sprite before starting my meal.\n\nOnce my break was over, I headed back to work. It was an hour before I started feeling this burst of energy I never felt before. It was as if I could run a full marathon while carrying weights. \n\nInstead of my usual sluggish composure, I couldn't help but pace around as much as I could. I would speed from one end of the restaurant to the other end wiping down counters and making sure everything was filled. I even started doing other coworker‚Äôs assignments because I felt like I wanted to do as much as possible.\n\nI must have seemed like a crackhead, but no one seemed to mind. As long as work was getting done, I was in the clear.\n\nI went home that night feeling warmish. Like warmer than I usually felt. When I went to shower that night, I felt like my body was burning up in a nice way. I was sweating but I didn't mind it for some reason.\n\nI looked at my body in the mirror and continued my daily self-loathing, but I couldn't help but wonder if the pills had something to do with the energy and my fever. As ridiculous as it sounds, I had hoped I would have lost a couple pounds, but I knew with my binge eating earlier, there was no way.\n\nYet, as I stepped on my mother's scale, I noticed I had dropped ten pounds. I was at 276 now. It had to have been water weight. But as I looked at my figure, I noticed a slight change. It was so subtle; one could not notice but I knew.\n\nI knew.\n\nIt may not have been much to blink at, but it gave me hope.\n\nThe next day, I woke up feeling quite hungry. I felt like I could eat a whole cow. I walked over to my kitchen and began to get ready to make some oatmeal. But I remembered my pills and I quickly downed another two.\n\nMaybe it would work faster...\n\nI finished my oatmeal, but I was still hungry. So, I decided to eat some fruit. I cut up an apple and slathered it with peanut butter, but I guess I was in such a hurry that I felt a sharp sting on the palm of my hand.\n\nI nicked myself.\n\n\"Ah shit.\" I said out loud while sucking on the small cut I made on my palm.\n\n\"Language Krissy.\" My mother interrupted with her nasally sharp voice. \"Ugh and again with the overeating? When are you going to learn that eating an apple but slathering it in sugar is not eating healthy. It's ridiculous.\"\n\nOn any other time, I would have resorted to a bitter comeback but for some reason I was way too preoccupied with the sudden sweet taste in my mouth.\n\n\"Krissy!\". My mother hissed. \"I'm speaking young lady! I was telling you that you need to put more hours into the gym and take your nutrition more serious! You're already halfway into your thirties, how do you expect to marry when you're all gross?\"\n\nWith an eye roll, I walked out of the kitchen refusing to entertain her annoying rant any longer.\n\nI arrived pretty early for my shift at work, but I was still hungry, so I walked to the nearest diner and thought about getting a quick breakfast. Those pills were still in my system, so they were bound to continue working.\n\nI ordered a giant stack of chocolate chip pancakes with a side of scrambled eggs with a side of bacon. I also ordered a large creamy chocolate shake.\n\nGod, I missed this.\n\nAfter my breakfast, I clocked a bit late at work and started getting ready to continue another day of grilling and slipping. I already felt my body in that nice state of bliss heat.\n\nI was a couple of hours in when I felt this extreme sensation in my stomach. It felt like I was hollow, and the smell of sizzling juicy meats was doing nothing to help me. I really couldn't help it, so I started taking in bits and pieces of food from customer's orders. A fry here and there, they couldn't possibly notice.\n\nThis went on for another two months. I would wake up and pop a pill or two and stuff my face as much as I could. Every time I stepped on a scale, I would drop several pounds a day and in fact the more I ate the more I lost. Thing was, I was in a state of constant adrenaline pumping through my veins and my skin felt like it was on absolute fire. Like as if someone slathered menthol all throughout the inside of my veins and pumped it through every inch of my body.\n\nIt didn't matter though.\n\nI was already down to 170 pounds. I lost 105 pounds in about 3 months and the best part was there was no loose skin.  \n\nAt first my coworkers were getting suspicious, so I told them I was sick. That would explain my rapid weight loss. Then my manager walked in on me eating a couple of the customer‚Äôs fries and fired me. \n\nThat imbecile had the nerve to fire me over a couple of fries. \n\nI was so pissed and that was apparently the last straw for my mother because she thought I was doing drugs. So, I had to move out and with the last bit of my savings, I moved into a small studio in the most run-down part of town. The studio was so small, and so dirty that it was infested with cockroaches and once in a while I would spot a rat peeking at me through the cabinets. \n\nI didn‚Äôt complain too much though. \n\nI had other priorities. \n\nI had to look for another job, because I only had enough money to live off for another month. I had less than 3 weeks to find a job to pay rent, utilities, insurance, and groceries. \n\nTwo weeks had passed, and I was still not any closer to finding a job, my reputation had preceded me because my manager was a blabber mouth and had posted about me all over social media. Potential employers would see that I was fired over ‚Äúworkplace theft.‚Äù I wanted to sue for slander but the lawyers around my area charged me hundreds just for consultation and didn‚Äôt think I would win a case. By now, I had used up most of my money paying off all of my bills and resorted to eating very little. \n\nSometimes I would go days without eating. This is where I started noticing something strange with my body. I had achieved my perfect weight of 90 pounds. \n\nYeah, I was now 90 pounds. \n\nI looked like one of those models that you see off the runways. \n\nI was beautiful. \n\nAt first, I was happy that people would stare at me with envy and not utter contempt. I felt like for the first time, I didn‚Äôt have to find ways to cover up my body or find ways to look smaller than I was. \n\nI decided to stop taking the pills and threw them in the trash. \n\nI was satisfied with my goal. \n\nBut the hunger wouldn‚Äôt stop. \n\nI sat down on the kitchen floor curled over just cradling my stomach to stop the hunger pains. I just wanted to feel something. \n\nJust a little bit of flavor in my mouth. \n\nI closed my eyes and thought about work. I would grill hot dogs until they were perfectly golden brown. I would put French fries in the grill until they were a perfect crunchy yellow. I loved my fries salty, and I would dip it in ketchup so the salty would be washed out with the sweetness. I would make the hamburgers so nice and juicy that taking a bite would make my heart race. I kept picturing the juice running down my mouth and that smell.\n\nThat delicious smell. \n\nIt was like it was right in front of me. \n\nI opened my eyes, and I felt there was some sort of juice running down my mouth. I was holding something. \n\nI looked down saw that I was holding the half-eaten corpse of a rat, its entrails were right over my fingers, and I felt the slight squirm of its tail against my fingers. When the hell did, I grab a rat? I wanted to be disgusted and throw up and run away, but that taste. \n\nIt was so delicious. It was better than a bacon cheeseburger. It was better than anything I‚Äôve ever ate in my entire life. \n\nI wanted more. \n\nI devoured the last piece and went searching for more. I ran through the apartment throwing every piece of furniture looking for more. \n\nI was able to grab ahold of five more hiding under my bed, cabinets, and my closet. They were as delicious as the previous one and I was about to go searching for more when I got a glimpse of myself in the mirror.\n\nMy ribs were protruding, eyes were solid black, and the skin of my face was so stretched back that you could almost see my ligaments. My mouth was covered in blood, and I could see the edges of my sharpened teeth. My fingers were starting to turn into black thick and sharp versions of themselves. \n\nI was horrifying. \n\nIt‚Äôs like I no longer looked human. \n\nWhat the hell was I?\n\nMy observation for myself came to a halt when I heard the banging of my front door. \n\n‚ÄúPolice open up!‚Äù They continuing to pound on my door. They couldn‚Äôt see me like this, so I ran out through my bathroom window and into the night.\n\nSoon, I found myself in the middle of the woods away from the suburbs. I was terrified at the thought of having devoured a disgusting rat. It was like I got smacked in the face at the absurdity of the entire situation.\n\nSomething was wrong with me. \n\nThere was no possible way that I could have lost that much weight by eating more. My skin was on fire, and it was like I could smell everything around me. I looked down at my nails which were still soaked in the blood of the poor rodent. \n\nI needed help. \n\nI decided to go to the one person that I had. \n\nI headed to my mom‚Äôs house. \n\nIt was a short walk, but eventually I got there. I went in through the back door and knocked. \n\n‚ÄúMom? Mom! Please help me.‚Äù I banged on the door window. \n\n‚ÄúOh Jesus Christ, Krissy. You could ha-‚ÄúThe door flung open and I threw myself inside, falling down on my knees while grabbing onto her. \n\n‚ÄúOh, Krissy get off! Dear lord, what is the matter with you?‚Äù She tried pushing my arms off of her. \n\nI looked up at her and tried to speak but my mouth couldn‚Äôt form any words the minute I saw her horrified expression. \n\n‚ÄúKrissy, what happened to you? What drugs are you on? Why do you have so much blood around your mouth?‚Äù She cried while taking a couple steps back. \n\n‚ÄúMommy! I need help please. I‚Äôm scared.‚Äù I sobbed out. My skin felt like it increased by ten more degrees just being around her. I looked down at my arms only to see blisters and sore spots that were starting to form rapidly, leaving my skin angry and blood red. \n\nShe took a few steps back and put her hands behind her, quickly grabbing a knife and aiming it at me defensively. \n\n‚ÄúStay back Krissy. I don‚Äôt know what drugs you took, but just stay back and I can call an ambulance and we can figure this out.‚Äù She tried reasoning with me. \n\n‚ÄúMom, please I-‚ÄúI stretched out my arms while walking towards her but she swung the knife at me, causing me to tackle her. \n\nShe fell backwards and fell over and hit her head against the countertop. I looked in horror at the sight of the trickled of blood against her forehead. I moved my hands against her chest to make sure she was still breathing, and sure enough she was. I quickly grabbed my phone and dialed 911. \n\n‚Äú911, what‚Äôs your emergency?‚Äù A tired monotone voice asked from the other end. \n\n‚ÄúI pushed my mom and she fell and hit her head. Please help me.‚Äù I sobbed onto the phone before realizing that what I told them would bring more cops to me. They were going to lock me up. Maybe I did need to be locked up. \n\nI looked down at my mother and leaned forward and kissed her on the forehead, before being overwhelmed by the smell of the sweet liquid on her temple. \n\nIt was so alluring; it was like I lost control over my own body. I couldn‚Äôt help myself but want a taste. I quickly snapped out of it, throwing myself backwards onto the kitchen table. No, this was my mother. \n\nI was about to head towards the front door when I heard the sounds of sirens and the flashing blue and red lights lit up the darkness of the room. \n\nI ran out through the back and into the woods, hiding to make sure no one saw me. I crouched behind some shrubs while peeking out to make sure that my mother was ok. It was about half an hour or so before I saw her walking out with the EMTs, holding a rag over her head. \n\n‚ÄúI said I‚Äôm fine dammit, I don‚Äôt need to be on a gurney! I can walk.‚Äù Her shrill voice yelled over the poor EMTs. I watched as they tried but failed to convince her to get on the gurney. As soon as she entered the back of the ambulance, I left before the cops could search the area any further. \n\nI ran deeper and deeper into the woods, trying to ignore the burning sensation on my skin. I looked down to see that my skin was almost tearing apart. The boils and cysts were getting larger and larger, and I felt like my heart was going to beat out of its chest. \n\nBefore I could do anything, I heard rustling. I looked over to see the faint outline of a rabbit. I was about to turn away when I realized that I was no longer in control of my own body. It was like I was watching through another beings‚Äô eyes. My body lunged forward on all fours faster than that little creature‚Äôs run and I grabbed it by the ears. \n\nI blacked out but once I awoke, I realized that I was covered in fur and blood. But my pain of the burning sensation was no longer there. \n\nI was fine.\n\nBut I looked down to see that I was even skinnier than before. \n\nI think‚Ä¶I think that eating makes the burning sensation go away. The hunger is constant, but if I continue to eat, I‚Äôll waste away. \n\nAnd here I am, waiting outside of my former manager‚Äôs house. My phone is almost dying. \n\nMy hunger grows more and more. \n\nI don‚Äôt know what to do. \n\nI‚Äôm scared that pretty soon my hunger will strip away the bits of humanity I still have left. \n\nSomeone please help me. \n\nThis isn‚Äôt what I wanted. \n\nI just wanted to be pretty.",

    "body": "Every hotel I‚Äôve ever worked at and probably that exists has some form or another of a ‚ÄúDo Not Rent‚Äù list. Currently my property has a fairly short one as we‚Äôre newer and locals don‚Äôt stay very often, thank the Gods. But, there is one name one that list that is printed in boldface type and plastered on every single workstation in our property. That name is Andy Orson, this is of course changed to protect identities and all, but it rhymes with the original. \n\nIt was a fairly quiet, yet still busy morning that day, I remember the sky being particularly blue for some reason. I was training a new person at the front desk, Krystal, who had started only two days prior to this happening. I am fairly certain that this led to her abandoning the industry entirely, as a week later she no call no showed and was never heard from again. \n\nIt was around 10:30 and I was explaining, ironically, the check in process to Krystal when in walks a man with a turquoise and red children‚Äôs backpack and a freshly shaven bald head. Now, I mention this because it was almost chrome in how much it shone, polished to a fine and glimmering shine. The cue ball cliche came right to my mind immediately. He was friendly at first, albeit a bit odd and off putting with brilliant, frankly beautiful bright blue eyes. The check-in process was normal enough, I walked Krystal through getting him in, he presented ID and credit card just as one normally would and went up to his fourth floor room. We had no occupancy that day so, an early walk in was welcome added income. \n\nIt was about two hours after check in that the occurrences began, a housekeeper who had stepped outside for a smoke let me know that someone‚Äôs black car was BLASTING music outside. I approached the north side of the building and it was obvious, a Mercedes S Class sedan was playing Britney Spears‚Äô Toxic so loud that the windows on the north side of the property were literally vibrating. It was as if Ms. Spears herself was there giving us our own personal concert. I don‚Äôt even know how to describe how loud this fucking car got, the second you stepped outside it was painful. \n\nSo, doing my due diligence I approached slowly and saw as I got closer and closer that no one was in this car, but what had been in this car was now strewn in the several spaces near it. Hats, two or three water bottles, the car‚Äôs instruction manual (in leather, of course), three pairs of gloves and a folding knife, unfolded and a pack of menthol cigarettes. My ear drums felt like they were about pop as I approached, reached inside and turned the stereo volume down to nil and rubbed my ears out of instinct in an attempt to clear Toxic out of my head. \n\nThe hood, doors and trunk were all ajar, I began to close them and walked around and collected all the shit that was strewn everywhere. I brought it back inside and everyone asked me what happened, I just shrugged and said ‚ÄúFuck if I know.‚Äù Put the stuff in a small trash bag and connected the dots very quickly who‚Äôs car this was... Andy Orson, so one of our other employees, a little more physically imposing than my chubby self goes to pay a visit to the room as we‚Äôre already just a bit concerned. \n\nWell, Alan wasn‚Äôt in the room, at this point the whole situation spread through our property like wildfire and everyone was spooked and on edge because the Negaverse‚Äôs Mr. Clean had invaded the property. \n\nThat‚Äôs when we spotted him, in nothing but white briefs wandering the backside of our parking lot, pointing at random nothings and screaming at the top of his lungs. Krystal asked me what she should do in a situation like this and I told her to call the cops, which is exactly what we did. We all felt kind of bad, he was obviously going through something pretty rough mentally or substance abuse wise. \n\nOrson was refunded and unceremoniously escorted off the property, we assumed, probably correctly that Alan was having some sort of crisis, he clearly was exceptionally wealthy or exceptionally in a fuckton of credit card debt and he was a local, so something pushed him off the rocker. The PD handled it great, I thought it was going to be way messier than it turned out to be. As the cops escorted him out he gave Krystal an acrylic fake diamond about the size of her hand. This was something we laughed about for the rest of the day, after all who the fuck has something like that and even if they did, why would they give it to someone? I don‚Äôt know what she did to it, I hope it‚Äôs framed somewhere...\n\nAnd that‚Äôs it! The end. \n\nJust kidding, the next night using an assumed name Orson checked back in and in the early morning completely annihilated a room in a way I‚Äôve never seen before in my ten years of working in hospitality. \n\nWhere do I ever start? He pulled and snapped in two the mirror hanging in the foyer of the room that was NAILED to the wall. The microwave was in the mini fridge and the mini fridge was in the bathtub, the toilet seat was torn free of it‚Äôs anchors. The chaise lounge was propped up against the window. The TV had a hole the size of a basketball through the middle of it and was laying between two beds like the world‚Äôs stupidest bridge. The headboards were scratched up like an animal had done it. About 40 menthol cigarettes were strewn across the room in every crevice or hole imaginable. Shit smeared on the walls, I mean, why not? And another smattering of personal belongings strewn across the room, including some very expensive items and a buttload of cash (this is important later). \n\nOf course, we discovered the room like this after Alan was again wandering the parking lot in the early-morning hours, sun rising beautifully on the horizon and the cops were called on him, this time it wasn‚Äôt so unceremonious. He began to yell at the cops about ‚Äúwhite power‚Äù and other strange shit, everyone‚Äôs empathy level started to drop into the negatives at this point. It ended up with him being thrown over a fence, drug to the ground and handcuffed and popped into a cruiser where he was dragged off to who the fuck knows. \n\nHe was charged an ungodly amount of money for damages and unlike every other instance I‚Äôve ever lived through where one was charged damages, it went through and onto the card he provided. But this, sadly, also was not the end. See, this is where my impression of what was originally a sad and truly mentally ill individual who needed help turned into someone who was being destructive, harassing and just plain being a shitheel and blaming it on something else entirely. \n\nI took about twenty phone calls from shitty Nappa in the months to come, insisting we stole thousands of dollars of items from him (they were seized by the police). Even though he was informed of this fact in the first ten seconds of the first phone call, that didn‚Äôt stop the next nineteen. \n\nBut, no, this wasn‚Äôt the end either, this story keeps going. The last time we ever heard from Baldie was six months later, I was working the front desk and up pulls a 2018 Porsche Panamera in black, which is a much fancier car than I‚Äôm used to seeing in my little corner of middle America and out of the driver-side door pops Orson with a full head of blonde highlighted  spiked hair, he looked like a member of a fucking K Pop band. In his hands he had a carton of coffee drinks which he put on the desk. \n\n‚ÄúThis is to say I‚Äôm sorry for all that happened.‚Äù He said and offered to shake my hand, I accepted but could only muster a simple and bewildered reply of ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I kinda thought he might try and shoot or stab me at this point, but that passed. He then pushed the drinks at me, a Vanilla Bean Frappuccino and an iced caramel macchiato, and asked me to enjoy them and walked out the door, we haven‚Äôt heard from him since and hopefully never again. \n\nI threw the drinks down the sink, by the way. But I should add, we did smoke all the menthol cigarettes, I think we all secretly hope they were laced with something exciting, they weren‚Äôt. \n\n\n",

No shame ‚Äî the greats didn‚Äôt spend years shirtless on stage for nothing. Here‚Äôs the deal:\n\nStep 1: Get ‚ÄôEm Hard\n\t‚Ä¢\tIce cube: Classic. Rub for like 10 seconds, don‚Äôt overdo it or you‚Äôll numb yourself.\n\t‚Ä¢\tCold air: Blast from an AC, fan, or canned air works in a pinch.\n\t‚Ä¢\tMenthol: A dab of Tiger Balm, Vicks, or peppermint oil (diluted!) can give a nice tingle. Test first so you don‚Äôt accidentally cry on camera.\n\t‚Ä¢\tManual tuning: Little rub or flick and you‚Äôre good. You‚Äôre a guitarist ‚Äî you know how to use your hands.\n\nStep 2: Style It So It Doesn‚Äôt Look Like a Cry for Help\n\t‚Ä¢\tNo shirt? Own it. Throw on some body oil or bronzer if you‚Äôre feeling spicy. Good lighting (side or top) will help with definition.\n\t‚Ä¢\tWearing a shirt? Thin fabric like mesh, worn-in band tees, or even wetting the shirt slightly will give you that ‚Äújust rocked too hard‚Äù look.\n\t‚Ä¢\tAccessories help: Necklaces, chains, or even a slightly off-center guitar strap can frame the chest like it‚Äôs on purpose.\n\t‚Ä¢\tCameras love confidence: Waist-up shot with a slight upward angle gives the chest some power without turning into OnlyFans.\n\nBonus Vibe Tips:\n\t‚Ä¢\tMake sure the mood matches the music. Glam, punk, metal? All fair game. Acoustic folk with hard nips might raise some questions.\n\t‚Ä¢\tDon‚Äôt overthink it ‚Äî the best look is the one that feels natural (but maybe slightly dangerous).\n\nRock on. Stay hard (visually).",

I should point out that as far as I can tell the research is unclear about the relative risks of menthols vs. other cigarettes.  If they are shown to be more dangerous or more addictive then a case could be made, but if the evidence isn't yet there, then I still think it could be discriminatory.\n\nEdit II:  And about that down vote.  OK, yes I'm whining, but as usual I went to some trouble to think about the issue and I then did a quick google search for a source and I tried to write a comment that was on topic and which added to the discussion.  No, I don't expect a medal, but it's a bit disheartening to be near-instantly downvoted for my effort.  Of late I've become increasingly irritated at the constant downvoting of unpopular, but still well expressed views.  It's harming Reddit and people wonder why every page becomes a circle-jerk.",

Remove all tobacco products from gas stations, liquor stores and everywhere else that isn‚Äôt a smoke shop.\n3. Require a special tobacco license and limit the amount of shops in each city based on population.\n4. Have a strict 3 strike system if a shop is caught selling to a minor. Do stings once a quarter. Strike 1- A heavy fine plus 1 week shut down. Strike 2- heavier fine plus 1 month shut down. Strike 3- huge fine plus loss of license and store shuts down permanently with no loophole of signing the business over to another entity.\n\nThis would effectively & dramatically reduce the ease of access to minors and really have the business owner think twice before not ID‚Äôing.\n\nKeep the flavors.

The water bottle hung empty from my hand. *I‚Äôm not a king! Why was I calling myself a king?* I was heading home with my knight because‚Ä¶ I had an idea! I just had it! *What the Brahk was it?*\n\n‚ÄúHey, Fluff Boy!‚Äù a familiar voice called behind me. Jacob wobbled up beneath me, taking advantage of the vending machine to take his weight as well. ‚ÄúAh hope ah, cleh!‚Äù He spit, shaking his head to clear some of the booze. ‚ÄúAh hope yer plan Werks!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúP-plan?‚Äù I gasped, ‚ÄúWhat- what was it?

I want! *Aacgh,* I want a Burger!!!‚Äù\n\nJacob gripped my arm, shaking his head solemnly. His voice spoke with the gravity of eons. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt get one. Not here my friend.‚Äù\n\nI whined. *‚ÄúBut I waaaant oneeee!!! They sound so goooood!!!‚Äù*\n\n‚ÄúOooh, they are SO GOO-HOO-HOOD!‚Äù\n\nI slump, sliding down the traitorous glass. An impenetrable barrier between me and luxury!\n\nJacob slid next to me, picking up his hammers to use as canes once more. He shared my lament that we had no way to enter.\n\n‚ÄúI sssswear,‚Äù I slurred, rising to my feet once more to follow him down towards my apartment, ‚ÄúI will get a HUMANburger! I‚Äôm gggggonna taste it! I will! I swear upon the Tenets!!!‚Äù\n\nI wobbled towards my apartment, my abode, my den! *MY DEN, I like that! It‚Äôs my lair for me to lie within! Lie in and think of‚Ä¶ and think offffffff‚Ä¶*\n\nSomething important had been on my mind. It was‚Ä¶ it was a good thing. A Good good thing. What was it? I couldn‚Äôt focus, I just went wall-eyed as I walked, stumbling my way to my apartment with my human. It was important. It was‚Ä¶\n\n*By the Gods! Look at that in front of the building!*\n\nIt was an incarnation of a deity. There could be no doubt, it was so obvious! What but a god could be so pure white? To have eyes so blood orange? To hold a pose regal?\n\nI began striding faster towards the figure. ‚ÄúHail, oh being from the higher plane! Please look upon us favorably!!‚Äù\n\nThe being looked down upon us mere mortals, its ears lowering. ‚ÄúUuuhhh‚Ä¶ Good- Paw??‚Äù\n\nI bow, lowering myself to be beneath the deity. Was this Solgalick? No, wait, it couldn‚Äôt be. Solgalick had many arms, but this one only had two. A messenger?\n\n‚ÄúWaaaiit,‚Äù I hear Jacob drawl, ‚Äúdo ah, do ah know you‚Ä¶?‚Äù\n\nThe being looked upon the lowly knight of mine, its eyes sparking with deep orange. ‚ÄúYes, I believe so‚Ä¶‚Äù His eyes darted around, his tail swishing with distinguished mastery, before it spoke to us again!\n\n‚ÄúWhat about- I come back a little later maybe?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo!‚Äù I reach out, grabbing hold of the purity‚Äôs arm, ‚ÄúI must, we must hail the presence of one so pure! Come! Come!‚Äù I rose, pulling the messenger along. ‚ÄúWe must welcome you!‚Äù\n\nJacob wobbled right behind, the sledgehammers scraping along the ground. ‚ÄúAh swear, where have ah seen ya? Ah ain‚Äôt the best with names, ya know.‚Äù *The being followed!* The dragged deity looked back at my knight. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt have time to- Are those sledgehammers??‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGreat weapons!‚Äù Jacob barked, his teeth showing in his laugh. ‚ÄúPerfect fer destroying monstrous things!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMonstrous..? Of course‚Ä¶‚Äù The messenger said, his ears moving back again.\n\n‚ÄúVeeery perfect,‚Äù I coughed. iI came out almost like a bray. ‚ÄúSo much better than those things that destroyed the ramp. Those evil things!‚Äù I reached out, balancing myself upon the stair railing as I made my way towards my skyward den.\n\n‚ÄúYes- I see‚Ä¶ Stars‚Ä¶ I- Might need- {bloody hell}...‚Äù My ears perked!The being spoke English! It‚Äôs truly a messenger of a god!\n\n‚ÄúYes!‚Äù I declared. ‚ÄúThose wretched extair, extra, ex-turn‚Ä¶ fire people and the‚Ä¶ money taking lords! They only wished pain upon the residents here!‚Äù\n\nI heard the being quietly groan, looking at the entrance door behind us. ‚ÄúThis is going to be-‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWait!‚Äù Jacob shouted, halting our procession on the second floor, ‚Äúah know! The-the station! Ya were in Space!!!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes- So were-‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOf Course!‚Äù I shout in jubilation, ‚Äúhe is a messenger from the gods! Of-they- where else would he be guarding his heavenly domain? It‚Äôs so clear now!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAn what- Messenger of what? What are you-?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLook upon yourself,‚Äù I reply, ‚Äúyou are of the greatest purity! Who else but someone of the gods could be so purely white?‚Äù\n\nHis ears flicked in incredulous surprise. ‚ÄúI'm albino! Not- Nevermind! What about we just get to your apartment? I wanted to talk with you two.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Jacob chuckles as we raise to the third floor holding my home, ‚Äúso this godly messenger has a albannynannyism.‚Äù\n\n‚Äú{For FUCK sake!} I am not a god! Or a messenger of one! I-‚Äù He took a deep breath ‚ÄúCould you kindly stop!?- That is why I said I should come back later! You are way too drunk!‚Äù His tail slashed in annoyance.\n\nI paused at my doorway, letting the Venlil‚Äôs arm drop. ‚ÄúNot a God? But, I thought‚Ä¶ I thought you could help them.‚Äù\n\nHis ears perked up. ‚ÄúHelp who?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh, ah know this!‚Äù Jacob set one hammer on the ground, tugging on his beard as he thought, ‚ÄúYou Told me. Ah know ya did Tarlim. It was, it was the‚Ä¶ the Family! The Family!!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes!‚Äù I whistled, happy that my idea was returning. It felt like it had gone through a sieve, but I grasped it once more! ‚ÄúWe need, we can help them! Help humans and them! We need! We needed someone to tell and get it through!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHelp how? And- Eh, if you're going to keep me here, could  we at least get inside the apartment? You‚Äôll wake up everyone sleeping this claw!‚Äù He looked at us, his tail slashing in growing irritation.\n\n*Oh, right, how rude of me!* I bowed, unlocking the door and sliding it open, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right! Please, enter! I will get you‚Ä¶ drinks! Yes, drinks! People like drinks and fruit, drinks and fruit!‚Äù I patted his back, sending him into my home as me and Jacob followed.‚Äù\n\nHe let out a surprised yip as he was pushed in, stumbling a little before correcting himself. ‚ÄúThank you-‚Äù I could hear a quiet whisper following soon after. ‚ÄúAssuming they drunk the strongest they body can handle- Oh great they will be like that for at least a claw-‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOooh,‚ÄùJacob chuckled, ‚Äúwe had a tour of the Fed booze! Soooo many flavors!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I nodded and wagged. ‚ÄúThirty‚Ä¶two special flavors from as many plllanets! Vulshish brandy, the tahlshic Qiola, The darkest of Menthol,‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAh couldn‚Äôt drink that!‚Äù Jacob laughed.\n\n‚ÄúYes! And so, sooo many good things!‚Äù\n\nJacob braced himself on my couch, his knightly hammers falling onto the carpet with small thumps. ‚ÄúAh, Ah‚Äôm gonna piss. Be rahhhht back!‚Äù\n\nI waved him off as he entered my bathroom, then hobbled over to my fridge. ‚ÄúWhat would,‚Äù I shook my head, pointing an eye towards the pure white Venlil, ‚Äúwhat would you like?‚Äù\n\nThe pure whiteness sat on the sofa, his paws over their eyes. ‚ÄúEither water or Absynt at this point‚Äù. His tail laid loosely on the floor.\n\nI wobbled in confusion, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt know what Absynth is. I have classic Sprunk and can make a Sssstringfruit and Bunt llleaf Salad!‚Äù\n\nHe took a deep breath, looking up at the ceiling before pulling his tail over his lap. ‚ÄúSprunk is fine‚Ä¶‚Äù My ear perked hearing soft mumbling. ‚ÄúIn terms of collateral‚Ä¶ Court- It will be taken as a predator attack I guess- Oh brother- This is a disaster-‚Äù\n\n*Taken as a predator attack??* I shot up, my ears hitting the ceiling. ‚ÄúFalse Predator attack??? You saw the deaths? Was it the Stalker?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo- What Stalker? And I mean the exterminators you bludgeoned with thoes hammers! Or whatever else was that talk about them being ‚Äògreat weapons‚Äô, and ‚Äòwanting to take payback on the monstrous things‚Äô supposed to be about? What did you do!?‚Äù\n\nI quivered, my brain now sobbing, ‚ÄúYou, you think‚Ä¶ you think I killed people? Why‚Ä¶ why would‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm big! It‚Äôs always that!!‚Äù I stomped, some loose particles falling from the ceiling. ‚ÄúYou people always think I‚Äôm dangerous! I can't be on the station, I can‚Äôt keep my friend safe, I can‚Äôt help a family in- in need!‚Äù I braced myself on my kitchen counter as my knees began to give out. ‚ÄúWhy? Why would you think I would kill people? Why does every Venlil think I‚Äôm evil when they meet me? It-it can‚Äôt be just my size! What am I doing wrong???‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh- Right- Drunk-'' The Venlil rubbed his eyes. |‚ÄùSee, what you did to make me think you did anything was; firstly, you carried massive sledgehammers, secondly, you definitely had more than a Venlil‚Äôs weight in pure alcohol, and finally, you TALKED about how good the hammers were to-‚Äù\n\nI heard a flush as Jacob exited my bathroom, fumbling with those pants of his, ‚ÄúAh heard crying, what happened?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThey think I killed people!‚Äù I sobbed.\n\n‚ÄúKilled?‚Äù Jacob‚Äôs eyes shot up in surprise. His drunken stupor seemed to fade as his face whipped between me and the Venlil. ‚ÄúWhat? When? How??‚Äù\n\n‚Äú{Oh in the name of the CHIRST!} Can‚Äôt I finish? I-‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúChrist?‚Äù Jacob interrupted in visible confusion, ‚ÄúAn alien is Christian?‚Äù\n\nThe little Venlil pulled his ears over his ears. ‚ÄúNo- I- I just picked up from my partner! Look, you two were beyond drunk, talked about how great weapons they were, and how much you hated the people who tore down the ramp! I'm the last to assume from looks, but- Look, just- Tell me, what WERE you doing to come back looking like you demolished an entire building?!‚Äù\n\nI huffed out, trying to control my breathing. ‚ÄúWe-we were destroying an entire building.‚Äù\n\nHe froze for a moment, his eyes going wall-eyed. His head shooting back before a quiet hiss escaped his snout. *‚ÄúIf I go to the exterminator office, will I find the office or just a crater?‚Äù*\n\nJacob groaned. ‚ÄúOoh! That would have been so good!‚Äù He laughed a big guffaw, bending down to help me rise. ‚ÄúNo, no. See, we went to the abandoned torture building. That‚Ä¶ correctional whatever.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWait- that place was still stand-?‚Äù He paused in the middle of its sentence before hissing out a small laugh. ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt *now,* I guess.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOnly the torture wing,‚Äù I offered, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not *all* rubble.‚Äù\n\nHe swished his tail softly. ‚ÄúThanks the Stars, and your {Lord}. The last thing I want to do is dig you guys out of trouble.‚Äù\n\nJacob gave me a light comforting hug then wobbled over to the couch, flopping next to the Venlil. ‚ÄúAh swear, ah know ya. Who *are* you? It‚Äôs drivin‚Äô me nuts.‚Äù\n\nHe rubbed his temple. ‚Äú Well, it‚Äôs hard to forget being bumped into a blue spaceman when trying to desperately get full control of security measures to the humans. Not like the name {Jacob} I think is mentioned in half of my reports. But I guess I haven't introduced myself to you.‚Äù\n\nJacob tugged on his beard as I sat on the opposite side of the couch. Hesitantly, I offered the other two occupants a can of Sprunk. ‚ÄúOh!‚Äù Jacob exclaimed as he grabbed his can, ‚ÄúI know! Yer-Yer the Director!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes, Director Arvi. I think you should‚Äôve gotten the message I am coming? Yet something tells me it was never delivered.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMessage?‚Äù I shook my head, reaching into my shoulder pack for my data pad. There, sitting unread, was a single notification that a message had come in. ‚ÄúOh. I guesss we mmmmissed it. Wait, the Director- why, why is the Director meeting us?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt was in the message‚Ä¶that you didn‚Äôt read, right right. Okay, so, a few things. Still not sure if it's the right time with your current‚Ä¶ Disposition-‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo, no‚Äù I tried to calm, ‚Äúplease. I want‚Ä¶I want to help.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Jacob nodded, sipping on his Sprunk, ‚Äúit ain‚Äôt about mah family, right? They denied evacuating. It‚Äôs not bad news, is it?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo- Not bad news, sorry to hear your family refused, a lot of first time slots were for the exchange program families. I- Well I came here mostly to first apologize for the- ‚ÄòGreeting‚Äô you received.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGreeting?‚Äù Jacob cocked his head, ‚Äúthat-that Tarlim wasn‚Äôt on the Prime Station?\n\n‚ÄúAh- Right should apologize about that too. I wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶properly informed about well, you know, the SIZE? That should‚Äôve been underlined and written in massive orange letters, but *no.* They just tossed us minimal information about the Venlil attending while I was basically given *biographies* on every human coming. No, I wanted to apologize about the‚Ä¶eh, *Exterminator greeting.*‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I crack open my soda with a sigh, ‚Äúthe burning. Right.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYeah, and then getting off scot free for ATTEMPTED MURDUR with only one getting fired! I am so tired of Venlil Prime courts. They just threw it out each time I tried getting it through!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt alone! The‚Ä¶ His honor Rolem compensated me for my suit's destruction,‚Äù Jacob coughed, taking another sip of his drink. ‚ÄúAh ordered another with it, but‚Ä¶ ah, so much has happened. Took too long to make, now stuck behind cause of the fleet evacuation thing.‚Äù\n\nRecognition seemed to flash through Arvi‚Äôs eyes at the name of the High Magister. ‚ÄúRolem is a- Good ally. Yet I wish he did more for our cause. I would have prefered to see that group of exterminators- No, I shouldn‚Äôt. The fact they faced no consequences is outrageous to me, yet it‚Äôs nothing I‚Äôm not used to by now. Bringing me to a second point, Dawn Creek was designated as a possible refugee sanctuary. Being one of the most, funnily enough, FRIENDLY cities for humans, it was a shoe-in. Well at least nobody has been murdered by the exterminators, yet‚Ä¶ *Still there is a problem‚Ä¶.*‚Äù\n\n*I think I know where this is going.* ‚ÄúThe Landlords here refuse to house anyone.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes. One was willing, but, well, he already gave away all his vacant spots for Gojid and his new buildings have only just started breaking ground. The other two? They‚Äôve just ignored me and Rolem for a while now. We can‚Äôt even punish them, as what they‚Äôre doing is technically legal. Eh- You most likely wonder why I brought it up. Just wondered if you know anyone that would be willing to house humans? Any friends, acquaintances? Anyone bringing up the interest of interaction?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWay-ell‚Äù Jacob drawled, ‚Äúthere was a bartender asking ‚Äòbout housing a refugee, but‚Ä¶ ah, I can‚Äôt think of anyone else. Maybe that Paly woman? What do you think, Tarlim?‚Äù\n\nMy tail wagged. ‚ÄúMadam Pala would certainly love to house a human, perhaps even a family. But, not many others..‚Äù My ears fell in thought. ‚ÄúThere was something else. I had something. A- a thought.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWell, tell me once you remember. For now could I get some contact information for those two? I‚Äôll send them brochures on how to apply.‚Äù He picked up a little paper notepad out of his messenger bag, taking notice of our surprised expression as he did so. ‚ÄúAnd yes, I do use paper. Yes, I‚Äôm also aware of how much of an oddity that is around here.‚Äù\n\nI huffed, my mind turning back to my thoughts. *It was there, what is it??* I had it in the bar. We- we had been thinking of the family and-\n\n*The Family! In the Facility! THE FACILITY!!*\n\nI bellowed as the idea shot through my brain once more. ‚ÄúI REMEMBER!!!‚Äù\n\nThe Venlil instantly winced in pain, pulling one of his ears down and covering it with his paw. ‚Äú*Awer*\\- My ear! Please give more warning before you decide to imitate a loudspeaker!‚Äù\n\nMy arms practically vibrated in excitement as I looked down towards the Director. ‚ÄúThe Facility! You-you can use the Correctional Facility!‚Äù\n\nHis features rose exaggerated sarcasm. ‚ÄúAh yes- Perfect! Just what the exterminators would like!‚Äù Then his features fell again in earnest exasperation. ‚ÄúI am not sending humans to a Correctional Facility.‚Äù\n\nI thumped my tail hard against the wall behind us. I couldn‚Äôt have him misunderstand. ‚ÄúNo! Don‚Äôt! I mean, change it to be a home! We destroyed the pain rooms, but the living areas are fine!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhere will you find one? The only one here is a wreck after what you and your friend have likely done. I‚Äôm certain it couldn‚Äôt be ready in time-‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOnly what we wrecked,‚Äù I protested, ‚Äúthe living areas are still stable! A-a family is living in them, with power and water and everything! You could easily convert them! And even if it‚Äôs late, it would at least be *something* that could be done!‚Äù\n\nYet his tail only slashed behind him. ‚ÄúWell, if someone is living there, how do you think they will take to people coming over to fix the place? EVEN more! About PREDATORS being relocated there! They will defend it!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo, no!‚Äù I waved my arms at him defensively, ‚Äúthey-they were inmates there! They are hiding from a killer! Something that has been killing other inmates! They would see humans as protection! Please, you have to help them too! You can‚Äôt just not care like everyone else does!‚Äù\n\nHis ears shot up, clearly signaling offense. ‚ÄúNot care!?‚Äù\n\nI let out a sad sigh at his words. ‚ÄúSir, I could count the Venlil I have met who cared on one paw. I just‚Ä¶ please don‚Äôt let them have to wander the streets of those who hate them.‚Äù\n\nHis tail stopped as he looked at me. ‚ÄúI care. The problem is what am I supposed to do with them? You say they would like protection from humans and- wait. *Killer*??‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Jacob nodded, downing the rest of his soda. ‚ÄúThey said that it was someone in some black suit like the exterminators wear. Killed another family of former inmates.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHuh, that‚Äôs‚Ä¶weird‚Ä¶. I read about something like this before, but that was decades ago. It was a few fanatics, and someone who- nevermind. This is concerning, I think it could be some old exterminator who decided even ‚Äòpredatory diseased‚Äô individuals have too much taint yet. Well something is killing them, it‚Äôs not ghosts.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe kid said it was an Arxur,‚Äù I added, ‚Äúthey saw one in an exterminator suit eating someone.‚Äù\n\nHis head tilted a little. ‚ÄúArxur‚Ä¶? You said it was a kid? Hm- Maybe they saw someone who was getting one of those trophies? I know about that old tradition some exterminators still hold. An exterminator suit‚Ä¶ Nobody outside of an exterminator corps would wear that to kill PDs‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúStill,‚Äù I continued, ‚Äúthat family is under more danger now than than they would being around humans. You have to help them too. Just-give them a job there or something! Please‚Ä¶‚Äù I felt tears welling up in my eyes. ‚ÄúThey have a baby‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWell, I-I can propose that place as a sanctuary for humans, but what if they feel threatened by humans? They are still, well‚Ä¶ as puny as they are- no offense- humans are still predators.‚Äù\n\nI heard Jacob give a cough. ‚ÄúThey let me hold their baby.‚Äù\n\nBoth me and Arvi turned to look at Jacob. His eyes were just staring straight ahead, looking at nothing. ‚ÄúShe came up to me and let me hold her. She‚Ä¶ she was so small‚Ä¶ so soft‚Ä¶ she wasn‚Äôt afraid of my face at all‚Ä¶ just a baby.‚Äù\n\nArvi tail dropped a bit more ‚ÄúWell, I- Still what about the workers? What about people trying to get that place ready? Someone is after them, I can get a trusted crew, but‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not sure.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù I begged, ‚Äújust, there are others like them. They said they worked with The Tunnels.‚Äù‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe Tunnels? The smug- No, I‚Äôm thinking of the other ones. But, if they are the same, I may know someone.‚Äù He raised his ears and turned towards me. ‚ÄúWhat about this? I go to Rolem, sell the place as a good sanctuary, deal with any exterminator idiots that get in the way, and you get the family to not freak out about people working there?‚Äù\n\nI wagged my tail to the point of near dislocation, bowing as low as I could. ‚ÄúThank you. Th-thank you! I will let them know. The-the workers, they won‚Äôt hurt them?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOf course not! I have some trusted people who worked for me in the past. They didn‚Äôt hurt the humans, so they DEFINITELY won‚Äôt hurt people who are just scared.‚Äù\n\nI practically melted into the couch with relief, before springing to my feet, ‚ÄúI must- I must give you something! Something as thanks! A- have you eaten? Please, let me make you something.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs fine. Just read my message in the first claw. I‚Äôll send it next paw. Ughr‚Ä¶ Setting up that meeting will be interesting, at least Rolem is reasonable. But I just know some higher up exterminator will try to interfire‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI hope not,‚Äù I opened my cabinets to look through the grains and fruits I have. ‚ÄúPlease, let me get you something to eat. I must thank you!‚Äù\n\nHe tried to argue again, but he let his head fall limp shortly after. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶Alright, I can have something to eat. Anything works, really.‚Äù\n\nI pulled out a good sized Stringfruit, a bag of bunt leaves and‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúSo you, do you like firefrrruit?‚Äù\n\nHe lowered his ears at the mention. ‚ÄúNot- That much, it‚Äôs a bit too spicy for me.‚Äù\n\nJacob laughed. ‚ÄúGive ‚Äòem somma that Garlic stuff ah got ya!‚Äù\n\n*Oh, that was perfect! Cloves of garlic crushed into Stringfruit with Bunt leaves torn up within.*\n\nI pulled out a bowl and began mixing my concoction. I hear Arvi muttering to himself as I prepared the meal. Things about Rolem, the exterminators, and arguments to be made. His work was still ahead of him, but it was hope. I had found a way to help.\n\n*By the Tenets, may the future grow bright.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\[First\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/106ltl2/the_nature_of_a_giant_1/)\\-[\\[Prev\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/15btmjp/the_nature_of_a_giant_63/)\\-[\\[Next\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/15h0hu2/the_nature_of_a_giant_65/)",

    "body": "A silly grudge shaped the man I am and the life I lead in the worst possible way.\n\nIt was a simple boy‚Äôs quarrel. I don‚Äôt even know what I was mad about anymore. Matthew was my best friend in the world ‚Äì my only friend. We loved to play videogames together and just run around freely, playing pretend that we were soldiers, bandits and cowboys when it was warm outside.\n\nBeing pre-teens, we were starting to enjoy being indoors and dedicating ourselves to calmer activities, like reading comics and listening to Matthew‚Äôs older brother‚Äôs cassette tapes.\n\nIt was a good life.\n\nThe weather wasn‚Äôt that good, but after long weeks of rain, we wanted to get some fresh air. It had stopped pouring, but the soil was still soggy, so we put on our yellow rubber boots and let it wallow gently in the puddles on our way.\n\nMatt and I wordlessly agreed to go to the lake, or maybe our feet led us on their own. I loved seeing it when the sky was cloudy, appreciating its infinite rippled whiteness; Matt loved how it smelled of nature.\n\nWe had been having minor disagreements all week, but still wanted to be together. I wish we were mature enough to take a step back and calm down.\n\nInstead, the argument resurfaced and quickly got heated on our way there, so when we arrived I took a step forward and shoved my dear best friend to death in the full spate lake.\n\n*Why?,* I‚Äôve been asking myself every day for the last 20 years.\n\nI adored Matthew like a brother. Why would I harm him in such irreversible way? I didn‚Äôt use to be a violent kid. I had no past traumas or an unhappy childhood, I was just a lonely only child before I met him.\n\nI didn‚Äôt immediately understand what I had done. I saw Matthew‚Äôs back falling fast, then caught a glimpse of his face as his body hit the water. His mouth was shaped like a crescent moon, screaming for help. Instead for looking for something I could throw to him I froze, letting the first quota of the weight of my sin fall on my shoulders.\n\nI don‚Äôt know for how long I didn‚Äôt react, horrified at myself. It started raining and my mudded boots suddenly seemed to weight a ton.\n\nWhen my body finally relearned how to move, I ran back to Matt‚Äôs house yelling for help. He was already a distant meat-colored spot, having trouble to keep afloat.\n\nBy the time his older brother had come for aid, Matthew had drowned. His bloated body was rescued over 24 hours later.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n‚ÄúThey say it‚Äôs peaceful, you know?‚Äù Celine blew the smoke in my face. She was sweet and didn‚Äôt deserve to feel as hopeless as me. Like most young girls from broken families, she dressed and behaved as someone much older. ‚ÄúDeath by drowning, I mean‚Äù.\n\nI met her when we were both 15. She was getting out of a pick-up truck and counting money, smudged lipstick all over her face.\n\n‚ÄúWhat happened to you?‚Äù I asked, truly worried. I was still unfamiliar to horrors other than being a murderer.\n\n‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm working‚Äù, she said simply. ‚ÄúI need the money to leave home. But don‚Äôt worry, I only do hand stuff‚Äù.\n\nHer smile with one frontal chipped tooth was what made me like her. That and the fact that she said ‚Äúso what? And I‚Äôm a dirty whore‚Äù when I told her why I was doing drugs every day and giving my best to never be sober. She was kind, but only in the right moments, and we accepted each other.\n\nCeline soon became my girlfriend and my confidant, always providing me a menthol and a shoulder to cry on. I, on the other side, didn‚Äôt let other men hurt her and loved to hear her singing. My babe wanted to be a popstar, and she was good.\n\nI‚Äôll always wonder how things would have turned out for me if I asked her not to leave. But leaving was her nature, just like in her favorite song.\n\n*Don‚Äôt question why she needs to be so free; she will tell you it‚Äôs the only way to be.*\n\nShe sung it to me the night we met, and little by little I started to believe that maybe there was more to life than my guilt. But Celine was killed two years later, on the road that she thought to be towards her dream.\n\nAfter her death, my addiction got so much worse. My parents had been comprehensive so far; for four years, they said that it wasn‚Äôt my fault, that the grass was slippery, and that Matt‚Äôs family felt the same way. It was a tragedy, but not my burden to carry.\n\nYeah, mom, dad. They felt the same way. Because I lied to you all about how Matt fell.\n\nYou think I didn‚Äôt try to tell myself that it wasn‚Äôt my fault? But my conscience screamed otherwise, and my addictions made my brain shut up, so I held on to them with everything I had.\n\nWhen I was about to finish high school, they gave me an ultimatum. Poor mom and dad. I know they thought it was tough love. But I left and estranged myself from them.\n\nAt first I was still healthy enough to work and support myself in shitty apartments with shittier roommates. But my life quickly spiraled and I delved in darkness. My body couldn‚Äôt take anything anymore, overworked by my intense drug intake.\n\n*I‚Äôm wasting my life. It should be me to die that day.*\n\nSoon I was homeless and my knees didn‚Äôt allow me to get odd jobs carrying stuff like before. I starved, sometimes for days, surviving off charity that didn‚Äôt come regularly. I had to drink mudded water more often than not, endure sunstrokes and terrible cold; sometimes social workers piled us like cattle in dirty shelters to mitigate the suffering in the winter, but my bad knee was still almost unbearable.\n\nI looked awful, smelled awful and started screaming at people, listening to invisible voices and picking up fights with the other beggars after I hit my head in the pavement.\n\nI knew the end of me had come years earlier, and the only reason why I didn‚Äôt end my miserable life was because I knew I deserved all the mental and physical pain. Maybe this way I could atone for my sins.\n\nThe last day of my life as a panhandler was the day I almost froze to death. Then I was back to that fateful day, exactly two decades earlier, in my 12-years-old body.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt‚Äôs funny, but as I woke up in a warm bed, I thought I was dead, and had atoned for my sin enough to be taken care of. My last years as a bum had made me a religious man; having something immaterial to cling to was almost mandatory to survive having no creature comforts.\n\nAfter rubbing my eyes repeatedly, there was no doubt that I was in my old room, one of the walls full of little boy‚Äôs planes, the other half transitioning to youth, with Wham! and Tears for fears‚Äô posters.\n\nI missed my parents, and I cried thinking about all the damage I must have caused to their lives. It was weird because in my former life I had never considered the consequences of my actions regarding others, like I was the only one in the world suffering.\n\nI hugged them tightly that morning.\n\n‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs in a good mood‚Äù, mom remarked, with a smile.\n\n‚ÄúIs Matt coming over?‚Äù dad asked.\n\nThat‚Äôs when I realized I had a choice. The calendar told me it was the day of his death.\n\nI could do everything differently.\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think so. We‚Äôre kinda fighting this week‚Äù, I replied, like it was no big deal.\n\nI spent that day alone with my thoughts. The next times Matt and I saw each other, we didn‚Äôt get in a bad mood. Everything was normal.\n\nI was cautious every day of my life. I couldn‚Äôt waste such a miraculous chance with the same horrific mistakes.\n\nThe two of us facing the lake bellow, beautiful and deadly, was something trivial. It happened many times before, and now many times after.\n\nI felt a shiver down my spine every time we went there, and had the urge to scream. If I was a boy with the consciousness of a boy, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to resist. But being a salted man on the inside, I managed to silence my internal cries.\n\nI was always careful to position myself by Matt‚Äôs side or in front of him, so the devil would not get the best of me a second time.\n\nI grew up again, and this time, we grew up together. Always the best of friends, closer than brothers. And life was back to being good.\n\nMy heavy conscience made me treat him like a king, ever too happy that he was still there. I always forgave him immediately when we had meaningless fights.\n\nWhen the age came, I looked for Celine in all the dark and wrong places I expected her to be, but never found her. I tried to look for her name everywhere, but it was hard because fatherless girls like Celine don‚Äôt have last names, and news about minors use only initials to protect their identities.\n\nMy heart ached, but I thought that maybe, just maybe, it meant that her life turned out better.\n\nJust in case it didn‚Äôt, I still searched for her in abandoned industrial buildings, where the young drug users used to meet.\n\nOne day I was mistaken by an addict, and a group of grown men beat me senseless. I guess I‚Äôll never know if they were cops or just the dealers claiming their money; I just know they mercilessly damaged my whole body.\n\nMatt found me, passed out on the dirty sidewalk and carried me home.\n\nMy best friend was so good to me, always worried about my well-being and always worried to know where I was, because I was physically weak. He knew I was in a bad neighborhood, although I didn‚Äôt explain to him why I went there every day. It was a secret I couldn‚Äôt trust even to him. But I was happy, so happy he was alive.\n\nAnd so happy he came for my rescue. He was such a better person than I was.\n\nIn the hospital, they told me I had a nasty fracture on my knee. My physical hindrances had come earlier this time, at 17, but at least Matt and I had good five years until then.\n\nMy parents weren‚Äôt as comprehensive this time; five years earlier, I had decided to be a brilliant student and a great son, knowing what I had lost. So they never expected me to fail, to be found passed out in such a shady place, to walk with a permanent limp before I even finished high school.\n\nThey had expected me to get a sports scholarship, something that I definitely wouldn‚Äôt be able to do.\n\nWhen I finished school and couldn‚Äôt afford college, I stayed home and started to work as a store clerk.\n\nIt was fine. A mediocre life was so much better than a destroyed one.\n\nMatt moved out to attend college, but we still talked daily, and spent a lot of time together. Neither of us had girlfriends ‚Äì I wasn‚Äôt interested in anyone other than Celine, but Matt had no logical reason to; he had turned out handsome. Anyway, it allowed us to keep our bond, closer than brothers.\n\nAfter he graduated, Matt asked if I wanted to be his flatmate. I argued that I couldn‚Äôt afford anything nice, but he said it was fine, as long as I cooked for us. Having a lot of time in my hands and living in a house with a large kitchen, I had become great at it.\n\n‚ÄúBesides, I still feel terrible for *that day*. I should‚Äôve gone with you, or at least not told your parents where I found you. I got you in so much trouble‚Äù.\n\nLiving in another city with my best friend was a great change. I was happy and still completely sober; the only thing missing in my life was not being able to find Celine. Matt made some decent money, paying for most of our expenses, while I cooked us outstanding meals.\n\nPeople thought we were a gay couple, but I didn‚Äôt mind. It was better than being constantly annoyed by relatives asking when I‚Äôd get a girlfriend.\n\nAs soon as we moved together, I started having nightmares about that day in my previous life. The day that I killed Matt.\n\nIt was almost miraculous that it didn‚Äôt happen earlier.\n\nLike most nightmares, they felt terribly real. I watched it like I wasn‚Äôt me, but a passersby behind us, and I could do nothing. Matt would fall, time after time.\n\nAnd he would fall because someone was forcing my hand.\n\nA tall man did it.\n\nSaying he was a tall man is an understatement. A tall, tall man, in a black suit and black cape, with a black panama hat covering most of his face ‚Äì you could only see his grayish, pointy chin. While Matt fell, the man quickly left, and his smile was the widest I‚Äôve ever seen[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPoisoningTales/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cgu8th/i_was_a_homeless_man_now_im_back_to_my_12yearsold/)",

Despite the tremendous progress we‚Äôve made in getting people to stop smoking over the past 55 years, that progress hasn‚Äôt been experienced by everyone equally,‚Äù said Mitch Zeller, J.D., director of the FDA‚Äôs Center for Tobacco Products. ‚ÄúThese flavor standards would reduce cigarette and cigar initiation and use, reduce health disparities, and promote health equity by addressing a significant and disparate source of harm.‚Äù\n\nI am not sure where I draw the line in government regulating peoples behaviors but I have a big problem with the government making paternalistic laws for black people but not white people. Where is the ban on chewing tobacco? White vices are acceptable, black vices are illegal. White people are judged to be capable of making their own decisions.

Establish a Facebook page with a catchy name (no website until you get more established).\nSpeak to local, unaffiliated funeral homes and crematoriums; ask if you can display samples for a percentage of sales.  You can place an ad in the obit sections of local newspapers.\nThe ideas go on and on and on. \nI actually think you could probably float your business on Etsy alone.\nDefinitely look at reference materials for guidelines.  The link is a good one.\n\n(Lastly, I would look at websites for pet urns - for years, they have seemed more non-traditional and personalized.

There is a large park by our office where a fair amount of homeless people gather to drink ect but not much else around. It‚Äôs pretty obvious where we are standing that we work for the office building. It‚Äôs also not a public building, you have to have a pass to get past the door and there‚Äôs no real need why anyone who doesn‚Äôt work in this building would be standing outside it, although where we stand is technically public land. \n\nA homeless seeming guy comes over and asks for any spare change. We didn‚Äôt have any cash and told him that, he then asked if we could spare a smoke. All my friends do the obligatory pat down and excuses of last cigarette ect. I feel kinda bad for the guy as he was polite upon asking and there really isn‚Äôt anything worse than not having a smoke when your craving one so offered him mine. \n\nI passed the guy the whole pack to take a cigarette from but kept a keen eye on him as he did look a bit flighty and I didn‚Äôt really want him running off with basically a fresh pack of smokes. \n\nThe guy looked at the package pulled a disgusted face and started bitching and moaning about the brand of tobacco to me. ‚ÄúCould you not afford anything better?‚Äù He asks. (It‚Äôs not a cheap brand) My friend and I exchanged a look of ‚Äúis this guy serious?‚Äù And I shrugged and told him ‚ÄúI like what I like I guess‚Äù\n\nHe then asked me if I had any other cigarettes he could have instead. I was baffled - I‚Äôm not some sort of cigarette vending machine?! I laughed and said ‚Äúno sorry, that‚Äôs all I have, if you don‚Äôt want then I‚Äôm sure you can ask someone else.‚Äù He mumbled something I didn‚Äôt really hear and took 2 cigarettes out the box. Cheeky but whatever. \nHe lit one of the cigarettes and then jumped up from where he was sitting on the wall and spluttering and screamed ‚Äúwhat the fuck?! They‚Äôre menthol!‚Äù And threw the box at me yelling ‚Äúwhat the fuck? Menthol! Why don‚Äôt you just get a job!?‚Äù \n\nI pointed to my lanyard and said ‚Äúerm ‚Ä¶. What?! I literally work right here‚Äù \n\nAnd with that he walked off still smoking my cigarettes shouting ‚Äúwhatever! Just get a job, you freak, get a job!‚Äù Leaving me to pick up the box and stare after him in complete shock. \n\nLater my friend said ‚Äúhe obviously want aware, beggars literally can‚Äôt be choosers.‚Äù \n\nAnyway, apologies it wasn‚Äôt a juicy Karen story, just a bizzare one instead. \n\n\nTldr - guy begging for money and cigarettes takes issue with the brand of cigarettes I gave him and then told me to get a job so I could earn better money to give him better freebies all whilst standing outside my workplace.",

Be careful out there. I met someone a couple months ago who had his backpack with him by the apartment office one night when I was out walking. He thought I was a security guard and was like \"sir I'm not loitering, just waiting for my girlfriend so we can go out, we live together here\"\n\nHe and I got to talking and he seemed all right, a bit of a conspiracy theorist and didn't much like authority (though he had been respectful to me thinking I was basically a cop lol) and after a while we exchanged numbers. I did think it over a moment and decided it couldn't do any harm, worst came to worst I'd block him.\n\nHe texted me a few times on and off and seemed to be going through hard times but nothing he couldn't handle; at one point he asked if he could crash at my place for the night before heading to another state, I was like sorry dude I don't know you like that  he was cool with it. I did run into him at the gas station though, and since I thought he was heading outz I bought him a soda and a bag of jerky and wished him luck.\n\nHe never did manage to get where he claimed he was going, but he left the current area I think. Our texts continued. He asked me again at some point about staying a night, I told him to stop asking, he apologized and backed off. Then a few days later he texted me begging for food and I told him I wasn't a charity and he was starting to get on my nerves.\n\nHe called me a faggot and I told him to stop fucking messaging me, then blocked him.\n\nHaven't heard from him or seen him since. He knows my neighborhood and I don't think he knows my exact address, but it was close to the office and who knows. But I think he left the area completely because I still go out on nighttime walks, and haven't seen him in weeks.\n\nI think I dodged a bullet.\n\nMy advice...\n\nIf you're going to be giving, do it when you're not near home. Like to someone on the highway, maybe, if you're driving past. Someone who can't track you down for more. And NEVER give your number.\n\nI gave him my number at first because he didn't seem to be homeless, and we'd had enough of a talk that it felt like I knew him a little, just enough to be his text buddy. In hindsight maybe he had been homeless the entire time, it was possible. But he was by the office multiple times on different occasions and he never looked patchy or scruffy and never smelled bad or anything, so I always assumed he was being honest, and didn't want to judge him just based on the backpack----it was literally the only sign. No other telltale aspects.\n\nAnd it definitely took him a while to get angry, so if he's a beggar who is looking for food, he sure had a lot of time and patience.

I honestly can‚Äôt remember but I think he still took them.  I realize he was the douche first, but I still felt bad for saying that to him.

This time it was in part of Boston known for panhandling, lots of drug use.At that point in life I really needed every last penny. This friendly seeming guy asks if I have anything to spare. So I went with a self deprecating joke and told him to take a look at my car and guess what my answer was.  Dude didn‚Äôt miss a beat and pulls a dollar bill out of his cup and tried to hand it to me.  This was over 20 years ago and I can still (miraculously) see his face laughing along with me. I thanked him and  declined his offer.  He was generous offering what he could even though he knew I wasn‚Äôt that desperate.  I try to give people asking for it when I can. Yes, it they might have a fancy car around the corner, but probably not.

As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>‚ÄúI live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I‚Äôm 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I‚Äôll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.‚Äù\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat.

It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don‚Äôt object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a ‚Äútrue‚Äù hydroxy acid ‚Äî it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned ‚Äúrules‚Äù of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn‚Äôt the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis ‚Äî at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. ‚ÄúPCA SKIN‚Äù also has another product with AzA called ‚ÄúACNE GEL‚Äù. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the ‚Äúpigment bar‚Äù it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There‚Äôs also ‚Äú*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*‚Äù you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion‚Äù\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There‚Äôs 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description‚Äôs wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low ‚Äî meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

Even though I haven't gone to the dermatologist, I don't think I have rosacea but just really dehydrated skin + sensitivity. I use Pixi toner day and night, it's given me a really nice glow but it might've been too much use. I'm also using HA (unrelated to this post) but I think due to my dehydrated skin, it's becoming even more dehydrated. I will try TO's Mandelic and maybe alternate it with Pixi day to day.  I have just read a blog entry about TO Mandelic vs Stratia Mandelic and found it very informative.

Can you recommend any cleansers or toners to bring your skin's PH down to the appropriate level before applying HAs? \n\n2) Is there any issue with using two different HAs at the same time? Can I use some stridex pads and then throw some TO Glycolic Acid on top? Or do I want to wait 20 minutes in between each HA?\n\n3) If we are to wait in between HAs, then I wash my skin down to a good Ph to apply my first HA..but then 20 minutes later my Ph is going to be back to a 6. I wouldn't want to wash again, what do I do to repeatedly drag down my Ph??",

This puts a bit of \"stick\" to them and minimizes the surface area that is exposed to the air.\n\nAfter you do this, you can relax your mouth muscles, and they'll retract back to a form that sort of keeps part of them pressed together inside of the front of your mouth.  \n\nIt also makes them a bit warmer, although I'm not sure if this helps.  After I do this for about 2-3 minutes, they become very soft and malleable again, as well as stretched out to the point that they're not able to be called \"dry\" lips anymore.  I hope this helps someone.",

    "body": "I rushed to the meeting room, all six of my lower limbs moving at a brisk gallop as I made final notes on the data slate attached to a forelimb. First contact meetings were rare, despite the size of the Allied Federation, and being able to work one is an incredible honor. It‚Äôs also always a mess because there‚Äôs no experts and anyone assigned has to relearn first contact protocols. \n\nI‚Äôd been assigned to the nutrition evaluations, and thus far I was having little progress for the first meeting I was late to. After toxicology finished their work, it‚Äôs my job to review what foods are available from the current member species that would be compatible for these ‚Äúhumans‚Äù.  Carbon based, mostly water, and from a plant rich world I initially assumed primarily vegetative. But then I saw a note that they were omnivores who consumed herd species. It made it more complex, but nothing too terrible until I noted that they required minerals like magnesium, phosphate, and frequently added rocks of NaCl to their foods so minerals had to be added to the list as well. Which started me back at the start of all the food available that wouldn‚Äôt poison them.\n\nBy the time I‚Äôd finally selected some initial foods for the meeting I was running much later than I had expected. Finally, after selecting a few last pieces, I‚Äôd made it to the meeting room. I took a moment to compose myself, making final confirmations on my slate, then opened the door. \n\nThe reports I‚Äôd received were incomplete and I would have to make sure to note it later. I‚Äôd been told bipedal, patches of hair, omnivorous, and mostly water. I was looking at the forward facing eyes of a predator that was standing before and presenting its teeth, teeth which were dashing whatever expectations I‚Äôd had for these meetings. It had incisors, canines, and molars and its mouth was slightly smaller than I‚Äôd been able to adjust for when I‚Äôd read they had ‚Äúcheeks‚Äù for containing food. \n\n‚ÄúSorry I‚Äôm late, I hope you‚Äôve not been waiting too long. My name is Skri‚Äôthrax, I take it you are Ambassador Ramadi?‚Äù I hoped my translator could pass along the apology in my words but couldn‚Äôt be too worried about it for now. I took my seat and the human ambassador did the same, seeming to wait until I had done so. \n\n‚ÄúYes, that is correct. And no worries, I have come to understand that the report I had submitted in the lead up to this meeting had been... difficult.‚Äù  My translator passed on minor inflection of something, both sarcasm and regret. It‚Äôs face, however, squirmed and wriggled as small muscles moved and twitched beneath its skin. They weren‚Äôt the only species to have facial features like this, but it was always somewhat eerie to see it in action when you‚Äôre not expecting it. \n\nOnce I‚Äôd fully settled and the room controls had been brought up I answered them, ‚ÄúNothing terrible, I assure you. Just difficult to narrow down a few things.‚Äù I pressed a series of buttons and a conveyor of twenty or so dishes came in and an assistant entered and walked near the human, prepared to clean up after or assist the human as it needed. ‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôll forgive me for the wide selection, and please let me know if this is too much, but I have selected a varied course of some traditional meals that I believe you may enjoy.‚Äù\n\nThe human looked upon each in turn, its face wriggling as it looked upon them. But eventually, it more or less settled into a face which brought its smaller fur patches together and slightly lower above its eyes. ‚ÄúIs this everything?‚Äù It asked, the translator noting concern. \n\n‚ÄúNot to worry, I wasn‚Äôt planning to completely fill you with food in our first meeting. This will be all we will go over today, simply tell me how you feel about each as we go through.‚Äù I was already making a note that its possession of cheeks appeared to be somewhat misleading. Their face seemed to turn down, the ends of its mouth more pronouncedly so, which I took as a good sign. \n\nAmbassador Ramadi covered himself with a fabric.  We attempted to try various utensils but its multiple short digits excluded most and we settled for their traditional eating utensils. When it reached for the knife both the assistant and I froze. I‚Äôd seen the note that the species was somewhat aggressive and prone to combat and violence, but this was unprecedented. It moved the knife to the food and began cutting the first dish, a Tarfan grub wrapped in a Galmar algae, by the time I realized that the knife had not been for self defense but for eating. I‚Äôd need to talk to cultural affairs and let them know the possible issues we may have with a weapon being a utensil. \n\nThe ambassador ate the dish and then delicately wiped at its face with its fabric, which I made a note of for my report later. ‚ÄúThoughts on the dish?‚Äù\n\nRamadi took a moment, seeming to contemplate the food. ‚ÄúIt was very... bitter. I‚Äôm not sure I quite liked it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúUnderstood, I‚Äôll make a note of it in our files.‚Äù  The rest of the time was spent much the same, the ambassador eating each dish in a bite or two and then letting me know its thoughts. The ambassador was not a fan of many of our foods but that wasn‚Äôt too surprising. \n\nWe ended the meeting there after the last dish, both leaving to complete our own reports of the interaction. I contacted culture and told them of the utensil/weapons, filed a few notes for future first contacts expressing the need for greater analysis and understanding of descriptions and compositions, and then received a very urgent message in my inbox. It seemed my presence was being immediately requested in the station cafeteria. \n\nWhen I arrived I saw a small group huddled around a table, apparently onlookers to some scene. I found the manager who caught my gaze and indicated that this was indeed what I‚Äôd been called in for. As I approached I caught a glimpse of the ambassador I‚Äôd just spoken with, their head down.  Before them were various meals and with dawning horror I realized many were considered poisonous and all of them were available in fairly great quantities.  I pushed and shoved my way, already pulling my data slate to call emergency services when I saw the ambassador up close and they looked almost exactly the same as before. \n\nThe ambassador looked up and, seeing me, wiggled one of its appendages. ‚ÄúSorry, but the meeting didn‚Äôt have much food and I AM STARVING.  We‚Äôd already looked to see if a few different foods were fit for consumption so please forgive me for not clearing it with you first. I‚Äôll give you a full report tomorrow on my opinions on these.‚Äù\n\nI looked on in shock,‚Äù Ambassador, many of these are considered poisonous to your species. Please come with me to the medical suite so we can at least confirm you won‚Äôt become injured or otherwise incapacitated.‚Äù\n\nThe ambassador shook its head, ‚ÄúNo need, it‚Äôs what I was trying to explain earlier. We submitted some of the foods we ate to your toxicology guys and they kept coming back trying to disagree with us on it.‚Äù They raised a limb holding the data slate and made a few presses. ‚ÄúJust sent you the report we sent them, feel free to use that instead.‚Äù\n\nI was about to pull it up on my data slate when my eye caught one of the meals. It was the first dish, the Tarfan grub in Galmar algae. ‚ÄúForgive me ambassador, I was under the impression that you hadn‚Äôt liked this particular food?‚Äù\n\nThe ambassador looked to where my forelimb was pointing, finished chewing, and said ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt at first, but that‚Äôs just because it seems to be more of an acquired taste. It‚Äôs not bad, just need to get used to it.‚Äù\n\nI still called for emergency services to be present on standby, but the outright refusal of the human ambassador meant they could only stand to the side watching and waiting to see if the human suddenly reacted. I went back to my office and reviewed the file, not quite ready for it. \n\nPer the human embassy report, they were able to consume most any plant or animal material aside from the hardest or most dense substances, but even in these cases they could prepare them in different ways to change that as they had a prolific bite force. The toxicology reports had a list of class 4 poisons that the humans apparently regarded as a ‚Äúspice‚Äù, something they added for flavor or specifically for its poisonous properties. Caffeine, nicotine, capsaicin, menthol, alcohol, the list kept going and reality began to set in that finding something this species COULDN‚ÄôT eat would be the far better alternative for my work. \n\nWhen I saw the amount of food they were capable of eating, I realized that the ambassador had not been showing pleasure when it‚Äôs face seemed to point downward. I‚Äôd barely given it enough food to count as a full meal. Finally, I looked for what it had meant by ‚Äúacquired taste‚Äù. Apparently among humans this is meant as a phrase for something that doesn‚Äôt taste good the first few times you ate it. Meaning that no matter what their thoughts were on a dish, it didn‚Äôt mean that they wouldn‚Äôt like it later.\n\nExasperated, I filed a complaint to toxicology for having not passed on vital information and prepared to spend my rest cycle working to try and find different foods that would hopefully test the limits of their appetite. Almost as an afterthought, I sent a message to the trade relations department to let them know of our new insatiable addition to the Alliance.",

The kind of tired where you already slept for twelve hours, and you're tempted to just fall back asleep for another twelve. He definitely wanted to, but the splitting headache spliced with the worst brain freeze of his life kept him awake. Barely. He didn't know which way was up, and it was cold, maybe because he was naked.\n\nHis conscious self realized something was amiss, as even though he felt cold, his skin felt the prickling of heat and cosmic radiation. His eyes cracked open and through force of will, stayed that way. The world around him was on fire, an alarm blaring like a klaxon warning him of hull and shield percentage. Slowly ticking down around him. It was 40 degrees C inside of the shuttle, and north of 250 degrees C outside. His ship was throwing all it had at the shields, and nothing lasted forever.\n\nKyle tried to tell his ship to go, to stop drifting closer and closer to the sun. But he felt... alone. As though something was missing from his mind. With no connection he had to pilot it manually, and as painful as it was, he pressed against the wall and floated into the controls. Pushing them forward and away from the ball of flaming murder gas.\n\nThe next time Kyle awoke, it was significantly cooler. He hovered around the 150 million kilometer mark from the sun and was subsisting off of solar power and backup RTG. His body ached, his lips were dry, but hey at least his mind wasn't cooking inside of his own skull.\n\nA cup of water synthesized out of the portable nutrient generator, and was slurped down as quickly as possible. Was it a good idea to drink quickly? Nope, but it sure felt nice shoving liquid icicle down his throat. The view wasn't half bad either, he could just make out movement on the moon, so it seemed the local lying squad of bugs was around. Figured.\n\nKyle tapped the glass in front of him, magnifying the moon and revealing a significant amount of swarm. At least ten times more than he remembered. Which made sense after zooming out, there were an additional four capital ships, for a total of five. He ordered another glass of water and zoomed out, noting that there was an additional debris cloud floating in space, right where that strange black portal was before. Kyle wasn't certain, but he assumed that they overloaded it's capacity and probably blew it up in the process. Still, it was pretty impressive that... Oh shit.\n\nKyle vomited.\n\nThe ship cleaned it right up, but still. Gross.\n\nAnd he still felt dehydrated. He grimaced at the foul taste in his mouth, and ordered the proper drink this time. Known through the galaxy as Rehydrant, it was disgustingly effective in hydrating just about anything that needed water. It had it's own TV show where it was the main character, You couldn't avoid it's commercial if you tried, it was disgusting and it cost like, a hundred credits to synth a drink. But it was effective as all hell. Luckily the pirate bay housed more than just movies. Turns out you could indeed download a car if you so desired.\n\nAfter virus scanning his drink, he threw it down the hatch, the feeling of nanites activating in his throat nearly making him vomit again. Nearly, just before it happened the feeling just went away, a cool menthol like feeling replacing it. Kyle chased the nanites with water and let them do the rest.\n\nWhere was he, oh yeah.\n\nBig green ball of explosion. Check.\n\nEnemy that tried to eat his brain. Check.\n\nFully functional decision making brain center. Uhhh, probably.\n\nAbility to retrieve the design plans from his neural net. Maybe.\n\nHe was definitely going to have to Rube Goldberg this, cause he didn't think he could put enough power into the projectile to ignite all the bugs. But that moon was full of fuel. And had a mining device that could probably condense that fuel into the moon's core. Making the world's largest nuclear grenade. And it wouldn't be too hard to warp the projectile into the moon's core.\n\nSure he was functioning on 50% consciousness, but this wasn't Rimworld. He had computers, and targeting algorithms. All he had to do was build a nuke, and he knew he could do that in his sleep.\n\n[[First]](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/fv3s3d/the_human_is_bored_fuel_synthesis/)[[Previous]](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/gkxvyj/the_human_is_bored_big_brain_time/)[[Next]](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/gw9mop/the_human_is_bored_sunday_night_at_the_bug_farm/)\n\nNotes: Hiya, I have made the mistake of booting up Rimworld again, I have played it every day this week instead of doing things like writing, cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc. So I replaced a less important component of my life (sleep) with writing. (I'm joking, mostly). That's also the reason this is gonna be a two parter, I wanted to get more writing onto here for all of you, so I hope you all enjoy. I'll probably merge the two later, but I've rambled long enough.\n\nThis story brought to you by Rehydrate!

    "body": "In episode 20, we see she smokes, but sadly not a specific pack. However, the cigarettes do have a white filter with a green band (from what I can tell at least), inferring that they are most likely menthol cigarettes.\n\nI'm not the most knowledgeable about Japanese Menthol Cigarettes, but I know that it couldn't have been a Seven Star or Peace cigarette as, while the brands do / have in the past offered menthol cigarettes, the timeframe does not line up with the release of the anime.\n\nIt couldn't have been a Hi-Lite Menthol as those have cork-style filters, we can say for sure though.\n\nMore than likely, it's a generic cigarette that is modeled after a Marlboro Menthol Light from Japan, as those tend to have green bands and white filters, but that's just my guess. As such, in my opinion, canonically, Misato smokes Marlboro Menthol Lights, which she possibly stole from Kaji, although that cannot be confirmed for sure.\n\nShe really should be smoking The Peace though, not gonna lie.\n\nIf anybody knows more than I please do let me know.",

It also makes sense for Misato to smoke Marlboro Menthol Lights due to the fact that she does not smoke cigarettes routinely, thus she would not want much nicotine. It also makes sense for Ritsuko to smoke the same cigarettes, as lights are especially good for chainsmoking, and due to the ashtrays featured above, we can say that she chainsmokes quite heavily.",

To me, the Soldier who tore their Achilles on day one of basic is the same as the infantry that never deployed, is the same as decorated veterans with multiple combat tours and heaps of awards. The main difference between them, imo, is pure luck. They were all, like you OP, ready and willing to fight. Not everyone gets to, which isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing either. Every warrior wants to see what they‚Äôre capable of, and to put their training to use.

Those that made it back in one piece physically often had to pick up the pieces psychologically and emotionally.
