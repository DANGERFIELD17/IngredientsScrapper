    "body": "**Background**  \n\nIn August my favorite shampoo, Hask Argan Oil Repairing Shampoo, got reformulated with ingredients I'm allergic to, so I decided it was high time to try out some AB shampoos.  One of the things I really liked about the Hask shampoo was that it cleansed thoroughly but gently, so I knew I wanted a shampoo that shared some (if not all) of the same surfactants as they can make a huge difference in the harshness of the shampoo.  I also wanted a sulfate/silicone free shampoo that had a few oils like the Hask shampoo as well.  After many nights scouring cosdna for ingredients lists, I settled on Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo.  \n\n**Product Claims/Ingredients**  \n\nMoist Diane's [website](http://www.moist-diane.jp/en/products/extra-damage.html) claims the purpose of this line is to \"restore extremely damaged hair ends and roughness\", as well as repairing hair damage when heat is applied due to the line's unique \"nano repair matrix\".  I don't heat treat my hair, nor is it permed, bleached, etc so I wasn't really drawn in by these claims. \n\nMy main draw was the [ingredients list](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_63e4326873.html):\n\n>Water, **Olefin (C14-16) sodium sulphonate**, **Cocamidopropyl betaine**, **Cocamidomethyl MEA**, Cocoyl glutamic acid TEA, Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed keratin, PEG-7 glyceryl cocoate, Myristamine oxide, Sodium cocoamphoacetate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Gamma-docosalactone, Quaternium-18, Quaternium-33, **Cholesterol**, **Ceramide EOP**, **Ceramide NG**, **Ceramide NP**, **Ceramide AG**, **Ceramide AP**, Propylene glycol, Hydrolyzed keratin, **Argania spinosa kernel oil**, Mango seed oil, Theobroma grandiflorum seed butter, Prune seed extract, Carapa guaianensis seed oil, Sclerocarya birrea seed oil, **Baobab seed oil**, Opuntia Ficus-Indica seed oil, Steardimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed keratin, Pouteria sapota seed oil, Keratin, Isostearoyl hydrolyzed keratin, Alanine, Hydroxyproline, Sodium-PCA, Cetearamidoethyl diethonium hydrolyzed rice protein, **Sodium Hyaluronate**, Hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate, **Hydrolyzed hyaluronate**, **Hydrolyzed honey protein**, Malus domestica fruit cell culture extract, Argania spinosa sprout cell extract, Rhododendron ferrugineum leaf cell culture extract, **Collagen**, Hydrolyzed conchiolin, Bis-ethoxydiglycol cyclohexane 1,4-dicarboxylate, Propanediol, Dipropylene glycol, Butylene glycol, Isomalt, Polyquaternium-10, Isononyl isononanoate, Soybean sterols, Sodium chloride, Xanthan gum, Lecithin, Behentrimonium chloride, Glycerin, Citric acid, **Lactic acid**, Tocopherol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Aroma, Caramel \n\nBold indicates ingredients that my face likes or surfactants that are the same (or very similar) to the Hask shampoo.  Wow.  Five ceramides plus cholesterol, some nice oils (including baobab!!!), and some HA and collagen thrown in?  Yeah.  I like it.  \n\n**Performance**\n\nThis shampoo is a dream.  It lathers richly, which feels great, and it also has a mild fragrance (generic bubble bath scent) that is noticeable while using it but fades very quickly.  It comes in a large pump bottle, which is genius for shampoo and so much easier than fiddling with a squeeze tube.\n\nI have a naturally oily scalp that needs daily washing.  My scalp gets flaky if I use a shampoo that's too harsh, or if it gets super dry in the winter.  I've had no problems with flakiness since starting this shampoo and my scalp overall feels more hydrated and strong.  My hair also feels stronger and is glossier than it has been in a while.  I used to use Hask's argan oil hair mask 2-3x weekly, but I haven't felt the need to do so since starting this shampoo. \n\nI've also used this as a body wash since I ran out a month ago and thought why not share the goodness of this shampoo with all of my body skin. My skin is hydrated and appreciates the extra pampering.  \n\nFor curiosity's sake, I tested the pH with my aquarium drop test kit.  It's a narrow range test kit so it only shows 6.0 to 7.5, with anything below or above those values showing as a 6 or 7.5 respectively.  However, I'm not going to use anything above a 6.5 so it works for my purposes.  Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo comes in at a 6.0 or below, which is awesome so I'm considering testing it on my face because YOLO.\n\n**Verdict**\n\nI have been using this shampoo daily since September and I will continue using it for my hair and body until they reformulate it or discontinue it. **HG**\n\n**Where to find it**\n\nI bought mine off Amazon prime for $15, although it's no longer available on Prime.  You can also find it and the refill pouches for a similar price on Ebay or Amazon Japan. Edit: and Dokodemo",

Perhaps the extra shine wasn’t for me but since I had such a bad experience with it I don’t even want to try the others. \n\nEdit: I have fine Asian hair which is non treated.

I’m excited to try it as a hydrating toner. \n\nMulti-Quench feels great on the skin, I’m a sucker for glycerin and it has a nice texture. \n\nMilk Peel has a nice light texture, and is very mildly hydrating. \n\nI will update you all once I finish the bottles. \n\n____________\nMulti Acid Milk Peel: \n\n-Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Olivate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, C13-14 Isoalkane, C11-12 Isoalkane, Phytic Acid, Malic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Lactic Acid, Lipase, Protease, Squalane, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, C15-23 Alkane, Hydroxyacetophenone, Phenoxyethanol, Tricaprylin, Glyceryl Oleate, Ethylhexyl Polyhydroxystearate, Tetradecane, C13-14 Alkane, Decyl Glucoside, Maltodextrin, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sclerotium Gum, Polyglyceryl-4 Oleate, Carrageenan, Silica.\n\nHalf & Half Fluid Moisturizer: \n\n-Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Propanediol, Isopropyl Myristate, Ethylhexyl Olivate, Squalane, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Ceramide NP, Ceramide AS, Ceramide NS, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide AP, Hexapeptide-11, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Triolein, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Glyceryl Oleate, Undecane, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glyceryl Dioleate, Caprylyl Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Tridecane, Betaine, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Citric Acid, Sodium Phytate, Sodium PCA, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Lactate, PCA, Sodium Benzoate, Serine, Alanine, Palmitic Acid, Glycine, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Butylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glutamic Acid, Lysine HCl, Threonine, Arginine, Proline, Tocopherol, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20.\n\nMulti Quench Plumping Hydration Serum:\n\n-Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Polyglutamic Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ectoin, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Fruit Extract, Erythritol, Phenoxyethanol, Propanediol, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tocopherol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide.\n\n\n",

I say this all the time, too, because I know people get so suspicious of comments on Reddit and people being paid plants or something, but I’m absolutely not affiliated with them at all! LOL Shit, I wish they supplied me with products! \n\nAnyway, Half & Half is my new favorite thing!! I’m really loving it. I do run oily, so I can use it alone during the day and be good. Or, I layer it under a heavier moisturizer at night just to amp up hydration and moisture. \n\nThe Multi Acid Milk Peel is interesting as well. I haven’t used it as frequently yet, since I just finished a procedure, so I’ve been pretty gentle and boring lately. But I do like it for a nice exfoliator. \n\nMulti-Quench I’ve been using for awhile and it’s great as well. But I think I love Half & Half better!

I bought a bottle of it cuz I was out of my Ordinary Glycolic Acid that I use on my body and also my Dr Dennis Gross Peel Pads for my face (was waiting for their sale to restock my big box. Been using these for a couple years). Now I’ve been using the Prequel on my face and body since January and plan on sticking with it. My skin looks and feels incredible. More hydrating than the DDG pads but still leaves that beautiful glow, pores are looking good, and my skin just looks nice and bouncy. AND it hasn’t irritated my rosacea (I also use Tret every other night). And for my body- no reappearance of KP on my legs or backs of arms, no booty acne, no ingrown hairs on my bikini line or underarms, knees and elbows are super soft, all of my skin texture in general is smooth af. And as long as it’s not crazy hot out, I can skip deodorant as long as I pat a bit of it under my arms. It’s light years better than the Ordinary acid\n\nAnd I was thinking about picking up these other two products.

So I thought maybe the scar stick could be an interesting thing to try. It’s amazing. I do feel like it’s been helping even if just to be an extra occlusive layer. But I feel like my marionette lines have faded a little bit with consistent use. Sometimes I even use it as an occlusive layer over my lip balm. Idk it’s a really interesting multi stick. I could see it being a cool makeup primer.",

    "body": "Hey there! So I have extremely damaged hair that is breaking off every time I brush it (got a straight perm when my hair was bleached). In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I’ve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or “glucoside”.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or “methosulfate” (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application. (Volatile just means they evaporate quickly):\n\n-Cyclomethicone\n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n##Easy to remove silicones:\nThese condition the hair, provide UV protection, and wash out with sulfate free surfactants:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate)\n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n##Resilient silicones:\nThese silicones can be removed with a sulfate AND some sulfate-free surfactants:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n##Cationic ingredients List:\n(Anti-static ingredients)\nThese ingredients usually end in “-imonium chloride”. These are in basically every conditioner to reduce static in hair:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate (this is NOT a sulfate, it’s an anti-static)\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n#Sulfates:\n\n##Mild Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are best used to remove volatile and easy to remove silicones. They can only remove resilient silicones with multiple washes, unless paired with many different sulfate free surfactants (a shampoo that has 3-4 or these in their ingredients list):\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n-Sodium Cocoate\n\n-Potassium Cocoate\n\n##Sulfate free surfactants that can remove resilient silicones:\n\nThese can remove resilient silicones, but not on their own, so usually a shampoo will use a combination of 2-3 of these:\n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate\n\n##High Strength Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are technically sulfate free, but they are **just** as thoroughly cleansing as sulfates, so they can still strip hair dye. Best used for removing resilient silicones\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n##Sulfates that remove resilient silicones:\n\nStrong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Do not use if you have colored hair, as it will fade your color\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n#Understanding Protein in Hair:\n\nHair is made of protein, proteins are made of amino acids and peptides. Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt’s best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the “feeling” of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this “protein overload” is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

sizes.\n\n##The above information about protein and sulfates was found on Science-y Hair Blog!\n\n#Ingredients for Scalp Health:\n\n##Aloe Vera Gel:\n\nAloe is a great natural scalp soother and also helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it’s wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

I use 2 drops each for each cheek and 1 for my forehead and thats more than enough. The serum absorbs fairly quickly so there’s no sticky feeling afterwards.\n\n***Fragrance***: no fragrance\n\n***Experience and thoughts in detail***: This is my first review on this sub and the only reason I was motivated to write it is because this is genuinely the first product I’ve used after years of skin care that *actually* feels like a Holy Grail product. I was slightly suspicious of Plum as a brand, thinking that its another Mamaearth type company which relies too heavily on marketing. But after reading some reviews in the comments here I decided to give it a shot after getting a good deal for it on Foxy.\n\nI bought the product to mainly combat 3 issues: large pores, dull skin, and closed comedones. Within just 2 uses, there was a noticeable difference in all three aspects. My pores were much less visible, my skin was brighter, and closed comedones also became less prominent (although the effect on them was more muted as compared to brightness and pores).\n\nSeeing these results, I started using the serum every single day in the AM, and it genuinely feels like the serum has been repairing my face because a lot of minor issues that plagued me felt like they were being slowly and gradually fixed. Razor bumps, CCs, fine lines, all were less visible, my skin felt smoother, it really felt like an all-round improvement.\n\nOne thing I specifically wanted to test about the product was how my skin looks on days that I DON’T use the product. I don’t want to use things that are only effective so long as you keep using them. I feel like a genuinely good product should be improving your skin organically and that those effects should not be dependent on you constantly using the product to maintain the look. So I took small breaks where I wouldn’t use the serum for 1 or 2 days. This may be too short of a break, but in those 1-2 days I didn’t find myself looking in the mirror and thinking “I wish I’d worn the serum today”. My skin looked just fine even without it, which made me even happier with the product.\n\nAfter using it almost every day for the past 5 weeks (the first week I went slightly slow), I’m still left with a little more than half of the bottle, so it should comfortably last me for another 5-7 weeks. I was lucky to get the whole bottle for 390, which seems like a great price in hindsight for a serum that has helped so drastically improve my skin.\n\n***Holy Grail/Will Re-Purchase/Will Not Repurchase/Holy Fail Status***: Any guesses? It’s absolutely an HG product for me, although I’m now considering trying Plum’s 10% Niacinamide serum next",

    "body": "Hi all!  \n\n\nI am back with another skin conditions post. This one is on perioral dermatitis.   \n\n\nAdmittedly, when I began researching this, I knew zilch about PD except that it was acne-like breakouts around the mouth,  and as I began to research it, it seems that there isn't a whole lot that is known about it. Fortunately, it is a highly treatable condition that seems to overlap to a degree with rosacea (earning it the earlier name  of \"steroid rosacea\") and even seborrheic dermatitis.  \n\n\n**As always, please feel free to correct or inform me of anything wrong, and also feel free to post/discuss what helps your PD.**\n\n# What is Perioral Dermatitis\n\nPerioral dermatitis (PD) is a chronic, recurrant inflammatory disease that most commonly occurs in the perioral region of the face (the area around the mouth). It can also affect the area around the nose, and in roughly 20&#37; of cases, it can manifest around the eyes (though it goes by another name if around the eyes: peri-orificial dermatitis).   \n\n\nIt afflicts around 1&#37; of the population of the United States, particularly those with fair skin, and predominately occurs in women between 18-45, with 20s and 30s having peak incidence.   \n\n\nIt presents as small, red, tender, sometimes itchy bumps that can flake and burn. While commonly mistaken for acne, it is distinct from acne in that it only presents in specific locations, spares the small area around the lips, and lacks pustules (whiteheads).\n\n# Causes of Perioral Dermatitis\n\nThe causes of perioral dermatitis are unclear. It is a relatively \"young\" disease that was only first described as a distinct condition in 1964. It is first and foremost an inflammatory condition, and is aggravated by ingredients and habits that can create inflammation either in the skin or in the body. \n\nWhile I was researching PD, the one constant that showed up again and again is that it is aggravated by corticosteroid use -- both topical and inhaled. To specify, that means not just creams like kenalog, triamcinolone, and over-the-counter hydrocortisone, but also asthma inhalers (including Advair, Flovent, and ProAir aka Albuterol) and nasal allergy mists like Beconase, Flonase, Nasonex, Omnaris, and Veramyst. \n\nLess commonly, but still a factor to consider are hormones, where monthly shifts can put the condition into overdrive. More frustrating is that oral contraceptives can worsen PD in some. \n\nOther causes can be fluoridated toothpaste, high SPF value sunscreens¹, sunscreens with the filters zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, the ingredient \"isopropyl myristate,\" improperly removing makeup or sleeping in makeup, occlusive ointments (Vaseline, Aquaphor, and oils, for example), heavy creams with occlusive ingredients, and cold creams (wipe-off cleansing creams that leave a residue, like Pond's). In one case, a woman's favorite lip balm (containing the ingredient propyl gallate) caused her PD.⁶\n\n# Treatment\n\nPD can look like many other conditions, such as acne, angular cheilitis, rosacea, or seborrheic dermatitis, and requires treatment of a professional due to the inflammatory nature of the condition. \n\nThe most important thing for anyone suffering from PD is to discontinue steroid use - whether cold-turkey or weened off with the management of a healthcare professional. While topical steroids can seem to improve the condition, they frequently create a rebound effect, which can make the condition worse. \n\nOnce steroids are removed, the skin will get worse before getting better. This is the toughest part of PD for most people. Topical antibiotics or topical immunosuppresants (such as Pimecrolimus or Elidel) are frequently prescribed due to their tremendously  helpful anti-inflammatory effects on PD, and azelaic acid can prove useful in some cases. In very severe cases, oral antibiotics can be prescribed in addition to topicals. \n\nWhile healing from PD, the skin should not be cleansed with any cleanser, and makeup and skincare products should be avoided completely until the condition resolves. And no matter how tempting, PD should never be scrubbed, as this worsens the inflammation. \n\nOnce treated, it is encouraged to use liquid or gel sunscreens as well as soap-free cleansers that do not dry out the skin, as TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) is significant in people who suffer from PD.\n\n# Long-Term Care\n\nSome people have PD once in their lives, while others may combat it on and off for several years. If you fall into the latter, it is important to try to avoid triggers that can cause the condition to reoccur (particularly steroid use). That means cleansing your skin each day with gentle cleansers, always removing makeup (removing it with a wipe does *NOT* count - you need to cleanse it away thoroughly with an oil cleanser that rinses cleanly), and using light products, particularly around the areas typically affected. \n\nPrescriptions like azelaic acid and over-the-counter .1&#37; adapalene (Differin)² may  also help to manage the condition in the long-term. \n\nI've put together a list below of some cleansers and moisturizers that are recommended for people suffering from PD.

        "body": "I’ve been diagnosed with Peri-orbital Dermatitis by my dermatologist. I’ve had it for at least 10 years. Peri-orbital means it presents around my eyes, nose and mouth. My worst flare ups cover all three areas, my most frequent flare ups present just around my nostrils. \n\nYes, you’re correct that causes are basically unknown. Successful treatments can vary wildly. \n\n(personally, I’m convinced it has a fungal element, specially related to candida imbalance. That’s just my opinion. I have used OTC topicalS and been prescribed anti-fungal topicals and pills, none of that worked. I believe it is related to gut microbiome health. Our skin is a direct reflection of what’s going on intrinsically in our bodies) \n\nI want chime in here about Zinc Oxide. You mention it as a possible cause. I want others out here to know that high concentration Zinc Oxide Cream is the ONLY thing that stops my flare ups. So if you have PD, I recommend patch testing a high ZO cream on one or two of the papules and see if it helps you. Incidentally, I’ve found recently that micronized ZO particles actually work faster for my than larger particles. So I stopped using Desitin Max strength and started using Neutrogena Sheer Zinc for face with 22% ZO. It stops my flare ups completely in a matter of a day or so, versus 4+ days with the Desitin. \n\nI’ll list below everything I’ve tried in case it’s helpful. The other product I find helpful is daily probiotic pills containing Lactobacillus Acidophilus. I get less flare ups when I take daily probiotics. \n\nDIDN’T WORK: \nAntibacterial Rx creams, I believe I had both Erythromycin and Dapsone. OTC antifungal creams, clotrimazole, miconazole and terbinafine. I also had an oral Rx for Lamisil, it was generic and I can’t recall the generic name. OTC topical steroids, hydrocortisone. Violet extract. Cutting out SLS from from my toothpaste and hair products. (I never cleansed with SLS, always either soap or oil) Changing my diet to an acne safe diet. Getting sun. Staying out of sun. Sulphur washes. Leaving it alone.",

I had no idea what perioral dermatitis was and assumed all this redness was broken capillaries from a Clarisonic. \n\nIt wasn’t until I went to a dermatologist and asked her about it that she said it looked like perioral dermatitis. I was prescribed Finacea and in one month the results have been astounding. Redness has significantly reduced and no closed comedones or inflamed pimples anywhere. Again mine wasn’t severe but for anyone who has it I think azelaic acid is a great choice. \n\nI should point out I never use steroids, I’m 30F and I think this was due to over moisturizing after over exfoliating. I also think the occlusive nature of aquaphor made it much worse. My routine now consists of nothing but cleanser, moisturizer and Finacea. Drastic change from what I was doing before. \n\nThank you for taking the time to post this very informative breakdown of perioral dermatitis.",

        "body": "Very nice!!! Have you had a chance to use it yet? I make a similar conditioner except I use silicones. I made a version without it and used a small percentage of butters which wasn't the best for my hair but it was amazing for my mom, who has shorter wavy hair. She usually has an issue with her hair having too much body, so it made her hair more manageable and left it with a really nice polished look. I thought she had used some hot tools. For my hair and my daughters it was a little too much weight where my hair ended up too straight. I have wavy hair with curls at the ends, that I finally love. Most of my life I hated how poofy my hair was and I wanted it straight and sleek. Now I am the opposite and like my hair when it dries on its own, especially when I have little ringlets at the ends. The shorter my hair is the more curls I have, but I have a lot of hair and the weight will pull the curls out. \n\nTry pouring the oil into the water phase, I think it might be the issue, you shouldn't have to go over 20 minutes of heating and holding. I usually give it 10 minutes to make sure they are both at the same temperature and everything is melted. \n\nDo you have an immersion or a high shear mixer like the mini one that LC has? I slowly pour the oil phase in with the mini pro for high shear in the water. After the initial mixing I switch over to an immersion blender because my mini mixer isn't long enough once the emulsion starts fluffy up. \n\nI made a conditioner last week and had my back door open and the heat at 63, and that was a mistake because when I was pouring the oil phase it started to solidify in the beaker. I tried putting it back in the hot water bath while still mixing the two phases and of course because there wasn't much in the oil beaker it wanted to float, so I was trying to hold it still with my glass stirring rod. I was really wishing for more arms in the moment. It wasn't much that solidified but now I know not to have it so cold in the house.\n\nAdd the honeyquat in the cool down phase because it's heat sensitive and it can make your conditioner smell. I usually add hydrolyzed proteins in the cool down phase because I thought they were heat sensitive. Susan from swift crafty monkey adds them in the cool down phase, but I recently was on chemist's corner and Perry stated that heat cannot hurt hydrolyzed proteins because they are already broken down. I am going to do a little more research on it. Whenever I see them say something different I do some digging because I trust both of them when it comes to formulating.\n\nI know that botanicals should be added to the cool down phase because they can chemically degrade. But I am not positive if aloe is heat sensitive or not.",

        "body": "Looks great!\n\nI'd leave out the honeyquat, as it is completely overshadowed by the BTMS. I'd reduce or remove the panthenol, because it is expensive again right now.  5% hydrolyzed protein is a lot, but it is fine if you like it. You could lower the cetyl to 2% and add a bit more of one of the liquid oils. Or try it without the liquid oils. Or without the extra cetyl alcohol. Lots of things to try if you aren't quite happy with it.\n\nA few thoughts on process, because using the right amount of preservative has been covered. I don't use that one, but you should keep it at 0.5% (or whatever the supplier recommends). \n\nAre you using a non-contact thermometer or a regular digital dip in? Are you measuring the temp of the water bath or the phase itself? What are you heating it in that takes such a long time? Either way, heat it a bit higher, not longer. There's nothing to be gained by heating longer as BTMS-50 is fine once you get it above 70C. It's fine at 80. Or even up to 90 (not ideal but it was fine). 65 C is too low. BTMS-50 is not too picky about using hotter water phase, but a cooler one can cause problems.\n\nWith the chunks, were you using a water phase that was at least 70 C? Are any of your water phase powder ingredients not dissolved all the way? Is your water phase clear before you put the two phases tgether? \n\nBy hand mixer, I'm assuming it is not an immersion blender. With 7% BTMS and 3.5% cetyl alcohol, that would not be a pumpable product if you used an immersion blender. It is kind of funny when I give someone a light lotion and later they thank me for the body butter.\n\nIf your arms or neck or back hurt from holding the mixer, get an immersion blender. Any immersion blender will do. I have a cheap one as well as a very nice one. They both make emulsions. (If it is full length plastic, do not use it to mix in fragrances. The smell might never go away, and it will be one you hate.)\n\nCold water bath works way better and faster than just stirring. If you're using a heavy glass bowl, it will take forever to cool down since the glass has to cool down too. In that case, stirring can't cool it any faster than just leaving it sitting. I don't advise putting hot glass into a cold water bath though. I changed to using steel because I am impatient, and I like things that won't break from thermal or impact stress. (Heating cycles will weaken glass and one day it will break. Mason jars are tempting, but they will eventually betray you. I'm also clumsy.)\n\nThe bubbles might be from pouring warm. Just leave the lid off until it is fully cooled down.",

    "body": "Hello! I received a sample of the **strawberry milkshake shampoo bar from Athame and Alchemy** for free after a discussion with the owner when they saw my comment indicating curiosity about the product and a lack of reviews. I wanted to provide a review since I had been curious to see if there had been any out there when the new one had been released last time around. In other relavent information, I have only tried the waxes from Athame and Alchemy from last year's gift exchange (thank you! I'm an exceptionally big fan of #PSL but loved everything).\n\n**Hair deets:** a couple inches short of waist length, coarse and porous, prone to frizz in higher humidity, mix of waves and curls\n\n**Typical hair routine:** wash every 2-4 days, depending on how dirty it is. Shampoo to the scalp, rinse out elsewhere. Conditioner from the bottom up, tiny bit on the top. \n\n**Experience with solid shampoo:** Tried four other brands. The only terrible one was Lush before the most recent reformulation. Absolutely dried out my hair and left it brittle and stiff. Been using my preferred brand for nearly a year now. \n\n**Other notes:** This was a free sample sent to me after I mentioned that I would be willing to try it other than the shipping cost to Canada (no one's fault!). It did come via lettermail successfully, but did not stay intact. I decided to crush it more evenly then firmly press it into a round mold. It has mostly stayed intact since. This may have changed the foaming and delivery experience. \n\n**On arrival:**\n\n- Strawberry milk scented, slightly candied a bit of juicy tartness. Not overwhelming through the packaging, could smell several inches away dry\n- Arrived crushed and powdered. Pushed into mold and got mostly cohesive product. Just under 1 tbsp of product after reforming it. \n\n**First use:**\n\n- Wet, similar scent throw\n- Surprising amount of lather (possibly due to water saturation in air pockets from press though)\n- Silky touch to the foam that built quickly in my hands (preferred for me), also easy to apply straight to hair in along length motion, but did not try to rub due to press \n- First try, washed out with normal amount of foam, but only in targeted location\n- Second go immediately after, continued to add more foam until entire top of head felt silky with foam. Rinse out very easy, felt hair was almost stripped/clarified, but not dried out (felt similarly when first time using solid shampoo, likely overwashed, oops)\n- Shampoo scent does not have strong throw after shower, though scent is more milky\n\n**Round two:**\n\n- less foamy (now normal level), still quickly foamed, rubbed a bit into hair after initial foam layer\n- slightly sour scent? \n- no lingering scent, not stripping, left glossy hair when only conditioned lower half\n\n**Rounds three - five:**\n\n- consistent with round two. \n- Still have around 3-4 uses left if it's not too small. Significantly more than what is advertised, but I would get about 10 normal uses out of it. \n- Hair feels nice and cleaned, but requires a touch up on the third day consistently. Feels like a faint residue sticks around as a hydrating layer. \n\n**Value:** good independent of the price. Very good considering the price of competitors (not including those that claim soap = shampoo that aren't pH balanced), especially as you can purchase a larger form to cut down on shipping frequency. Currently priced at 13.75/large ones.\n\n**Ingredients:** Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Rice Starch, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Rice Bran Oil, Fragrance, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Citric Acid, Germall Plus (different for the Rosemary option)\n\n**Scent:** Ripe Strawberries, Buttercream Frosting, Vanilla Ice Cream, Caramel, Spun Sugar\n\n**More notes:** My partner also used the shampoo bar once and confirmed it smelled like strawberry milk. It looks as if there are still a few more uses left. Just from eyeballing it, it looks as if the sample size is around 2/3 of the usual sample size rounds from other brands, but I could have compressed it more due to it being crushed in transit. I also forgot entirely it was strawberry *milkshake* sceented. While I can see it, my mind definitely jumps to strawberry milk first. **Overall it's a very hydrating product that feels like it leaves a thin film on the hair. Overuse can turn it into a more stripping product if that's needed. The scent is light, but present, and washes out. I did not find that my hair colour faded exceptionally fast with its use. The texture of the foam was silky and on the low foam side initially, but it was easy to build up. I did feel like I had to wash my hair slightly more freqently than with other shampoo options. Value wise, if I could stock up and not get bored for two years, I would consider purchasing these even with the horrific shipping costs. The sample size is an excellent option to just give it a go if you use shampoo at the same rate as I do (usually double the number of uses listed).**\n\nFeel free to ask more questions! I've just copied over the notes I had on what stood out to me at the time.\n\nEdit: come to think of it, that slight filmy feel I get...I wonder if it reduces frizz? I haven't noticed any more during the test runs at least. Edit 2: I've actually tried four brands! One was so mediocre and drying that I wiped it out from my memory.",

        "body": "Yes, I just got the rice milk soap from Athame and Alchemy and have so far had a similar experience! First off, it smells *really* good to me. I used a ton on the first try--really lathered it up in there--partly because it smells to good and partly because the foam does indeed feel so silky and lovely in my hair. When I rinsed, my hair felt a bit squeaky clean (not usually the goal for this curly head, but nice when I want to clarify a bit or need a deeper clean than usual) but also not super dehydrated/angry/rough like my hair can be with shampoo. Using it a bit more moderately, I like it a lot! The rest of my hair care routine needs some tweaking, so it's hard for me to say just on the basis of hair results, but the experience of using this bar is really lovey. Thank you for your in depth review!",

I personally have not come to a conclusion on reactions from long term exposure to fragrance, whether citrus extracts increase photosensitivity, and the effectiveness of formulas with lots of plant extracts like here. When I saw how much phenoxyethanol the Imperial Bird's Nest contains I was immediately turned off. \n\nApple polyphenol seems low in irritants and Aloe is high in sodium hyaluronate.\n\nMBD is a very established mask brand in Taiwan. They started in 2003, but they have only released masks so far. There have been many other brands that have made it in and out of Taiwan since then, like Naruko for those looking for targeted treatments and White Essence with lotions more advanced than Hada Labo. \n\nThere are many other sheet masks ranges in Taiwan, and they have to be good enough to retain market share against market leader MBD. I haven't looked at any of them. I'm looking at trying [this](http://www.watsons.com.sg/Product-Categories/Skin/Face-mask-%26-eye-mask/Renewal-%26-Antioxidant-Moisturising-Facial-Mask/p/BP_96522) mask from a damn drugstore housebrand.",

    "body": "Once again, tagged as a mod post so my account doesn't get any points. This is just reference for you guys! :)\n\nMost hair needs some amount of protein, especially damaged(sun, wind, heat, bleach, etc) hair. Normal hair, or protein sensitive hair does not need large doses of protein all the time. If your hair feels stiff, frizzy, and dry, then your hair might be getting to much protein.  \n\nFor some fine/damaged curlies, protein will make your curls spring to life like never before!! Careful- It can be addicting and turn into a case of \"too much of a good thing\".  Don't worry- if you go overboard on protein treatments, you can just do a good deep conditioning treatment to help counteract the protein overload. :)  So if you have damaged hair that needs protein, how often should you do it?  If it's an INTENSE level of protein, once a week. If it's a conditioner that has some protein in it, every other day or even every day(if it's low enough on the ingredient list) will be fine.  This is why hair porosity is important: Low porosities probably do not need any protein, normal could use some protein, but high porosity LOVES protein. :)\n\nOKAY. Here's the list of commonly used proteins.  Looked for the actual word \"protein\", \"keratin\" or for the word \"hydrolyzed\" to indicate a protein in most cases.\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed casein\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed collagen\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed hair keratin\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed keratin\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed rice protein\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed silk\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed soy protein\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed wheat protein\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl silk amino acids\n\n* Cocoyl hydrolyzed collagen\n\n* Cocoyl hydrolyzed keratin\n\n* Hydrolyzed keratin\n\n* Hydrolyzed oat flour\n\n* Hydrolyzed silk\n\n* Hydrolyzed silk protein\n\n* Hydrolyzed soy protein\n\n* Hydrolyzed wheat protein\n\n* Hydrolyzed wheat protein\n\n* Keratin\n\n* Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed collagen\n\n* TEA-cocoyl hydrolyzed collagen\n\n* TEA-cocoyl hydrolyzed soy protein",

    "body": "**Personal Info:**\n\nI live in nothern europe, so currently cold, windy and dry Climate. My Skintype is sahara desert dry, prone to closed comedones plus some light hormonal acne. Sadly im also super prone to hyperpigmentation. My main Goals are barrier health, hydration, acne & Hyperpigmentation management and getting rid of the damn stubborn CC\\`s... I also follow a kinda skincycling routine wich includes a non AB Retinal product.\n\nIn **Bold** will be the product name + how long i have been using it\n\nin *italic* will be the ingredients i liked\n\n\n\n**Axis-Y Sunday morning cleanser: (using for a month now)** *green tea extract, centella extract, allatonin*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Coco-Betaine, Butylene Glycol, Potassium Cocoate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Benzoate, Polyquaternium-67, Xylitylglucoside, Citric Acid, Anhydroxylitol, Propanediol, Xylitol, Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Glucose, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Disodium EDTA, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Agrimonia Eupatoria Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Dipropylene Glycol, Allantoin, Perilla Frutescens Leaf Extract, Saponaria Officinalis Extract, Sodium Acetate, Pentylene Glycol, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Kigelia Africana Fruit Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Natto Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxycinnamic Acid, Rutin\n\nTexture:\n\na balmy texture, foams up to a dense and soft foam\n\nExpirience:\n\nI picked this up because I wanted to change from my old clenaser to something that felt like it had a bit more cleansing power, yet was not stripping. As far as i can tell it seems to accomplish that. It foams up nicely, cleans well and doesent seem to strip my Skin. After washing it off it feels almost as if there is a slight layer on my Skin, but i dont mind it/ think that it contributes to the non stripping?\n\n(4/5)\n\n**Cosrx Propolis Toner: (about a month 1/2 of use)** *propolis, honey extract, panthenol*\n\nIngredients:\n\nPropolis Extract, Honey Extract, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Cassia Obtusifolia Seed Extract, Panthenol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride\n\nTexture:\n\na waterlike texture, thats just a bit thicker\n\nExpirience:\n\nTo be honest im not overly impressed... its a nice hydrating toner for sure but i didnt notice anything outstanding that would have me choose it again. But it gets a pluspoint for being reasonably priced so i migth pick it up again to reach free shipping...\n\n(3/5)\n\n**Holika Holika Aloe Waterproof Sungel (3 Months of use)** *Aloe*\n\nIngredients:\n\nAqua, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Niacinamide, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Caprylyl Methicone, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hippophae Rhamnoides Fruit Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Extract, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Juice, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Pentylene Glycol, Behenyl Alcohol, Poly C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Decyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, T-butyl Alcohol, Tocopherol, Ascorbic Acid, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Ceramide Np, Phytosphingosine, Parfum\n\nTexture:\n\na thin cream Texture, not runny but almost there\n\nExpirience:\n\nIt comes in quite a big size for a Sunscreen, you can find 80 - 100 ml Tubes online for around 15-17 Euros! Wich honestly was the sole reason why i bougth it xD i figured my skin would be fine with the Ingredients and i just hate tiny sunscreens! And well... that was exactly what it is like, its decently moisturizing and doesnt irritate my Skin. But if you have sensitive Skin be careful, it does have Fragrance, smells kinda like very artificial Aloe. You can smell it but only upon first apllication, it doesnt linger. I have been using 1 bottle for 3 months and still have enough for another month at min. so a win!\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n**Purito Dermide Cica Barrier Sleeping Mask: (3 months of use)** *Squalane, Centella Extract, Jojoba oil, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Ceramide*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract(250,000Ppm), Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Squalane, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Butylene Glycol, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Panthenol, Ceramide NP(3,000Ppm), Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyacetophenone, Sodium Carbomer, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract\n\nTexture:\n\nA thick Cream, feels quite emmolient\n\nExpirience:\n\nI love, love, loe this! Its the first moisturizer that i found that feels like it actually does its job well on my Skin. As a nigthtime moisturizer it keeps my Skin hydrated all through the Night and has my wake up nicely glowy. I love to use this when my Skin is irritated, it really soothes it quickly. Always have this on my Shelf, you would have to pry it out of my dead cold hands, to seperate me from it. One Bottle last me about 2 months.\n\nHG!\n\n(5/5)\n\n**Mary & May Blackberry Cream Essence: (4 months of use)** *Jojoba oil, ceramides, lotus water, centella*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Nymphaea Caerulea Flower Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit Extract, 1,2-hexanediol, Methlypropanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Hydrolyzed Gardenia Florida Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Trilaureth-4 Phoshate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Pvm/Ma Copolymer, Cyanocobalamin, Ceramide Np, Maltodextrin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol\n\nTexture:\n\nthin, watery but creamy? (just realized i suck at describing textures haha)\n\nExpirience:\n\nA really nice hydrating and moisturizing Toner, feels like a great balance of the two. Acts nicely as a layer with other Skincare because it absorbs really well. I like it, a bottle lasts me about 2 months.\n\n(4/5)\n\n**Abib Quick Sunstick Protection Bar: ( 3 months of use)** *Aloe, Centella, Ceramides*\n\nIngredients:\n\nOctyldodecanol, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Dibutyl Ethylhexanoyl Glutamide, Dibutyl Lauroyl Glutamide, Diisostearyl Malate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dextrin Palmitate, Octocrylene, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Saccharide Isomerate, Maltodextrin, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethyl Hexanediol, Ceramide NP, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol\n\nTexture:\n\nA translucent stick, glides on smooth, feels a bit occlusive on skin\n\nExpirience:\n\nNicely moisturizing Sunstick, feels good on my Skin and well... does its Job xD I really like the curved shape of it, it relly helps with the application. I just use it for reapplication of my sunscreen, but also sometimes when my Skin gets really dry during the day ( tho its not the best for that)\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n**Numbuzin No.2 Protein 43% creamy Serum: ( 4 months of use)** *Oat protein, Ceramides, cholesterol, fatty acids, ferments, Rice protein*\n\nIngredients:\n\nAvena Sativa Protein Extract, Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Poly C6-14 Olefin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Erythritol, Limnanthes Alba Seed Oil, Sodium Chloride, Allantoin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Adenosine, Dextrin, Theobroma Cacao Extract, Pantolactone, Ceramide NP, Cholesterol, Palmitic Acid, Oryza Sativa Seed Protein Extract, Stearic Acid, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Lactobacillus Ferment, Glycine Soja Protein, Hydrolyzed Lupine Protein, Glucose, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Sweet Almond Protein, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Myristic Acid, Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Arachidic Acid, Lauric Acid, Sodium Succinate, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance\n\nTexture:\n\nVery thick serum, really is creamy like the name says\n\nExpirience:\n\nSooo repairing and soothing, does wonders for my barrier. It really helps keep my Skin moisturized and helps keep my transepidermal waterloss in check. Love it so much! HG!\n\n(5/5)\n\n**Purito Aha Bha Refreshing Solution: (1 month of use)** *Glycolic acid, Salcylic Acid*\n\nIngredients:\n\nSalix Alba (Willow) Bark Water, Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid (7%), Tromethamine, Water, Salicylic Acid(2%), 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Citrate, Arginine, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid(0.28%), Hydroxyacetophenone, Pentylene Glycol, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Disodium EDTA\n\nTexture:\n\nlike water, it put 2-3 drops on a thin cotton pad and swipe over my Face with it\n\nExpirience:\n\nSince it has only been a month i cannot say too much about how it has worked (and i feel its hard to tell what effects on my skin is retinal and whats from this product) but my comedones are reducing in size and developing into breakouts. But the effects of these ingredients are well studied in these concentrations so i would say its save to say it works. Its my first time using glycolic acid and i can say it packs a punch for sure! So be careful, its intense, so far im using it once a week on my exfoliation day and i dont think ill be moving up.... Might also be the fact that its a combo product, but i have been using salcylic acid and mandelic acid in combo before, and that felt less sensitizing. So im attributing that factor to the 7 percent glycolic acid, since it is the smallest molecule size of all Aha\\`s.\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow lets move to quick first impressions of a few products i just started trying, wich i have seperated from the review portion because i just havent been using them long enough to really speak about the effects on my Skin: (these will also be shorter impressions with less info)\n\n\n\n**Neo:labs liquid enhancer Pycogenol:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Propanediol, Hydrogenated Poly C6-14 Olefin, 1.2-Hexanediol, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Saccharum Officinarum Extract, Jojoba Esters, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Salvia Sclarea Oil, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa Root Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Theobroma Cacao Seed Extract, Melaleuca Altemifolia Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, C18-36 Acid Triglyceride, Coprylyl Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, C12-18 Acid Triglyceride, Squalene, Sodium Polyacrylate, Tromethamine, Albatreus Contuena Extract, Paimitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Phytasteryl Macadamiate, Citric Acid, Phytosterol, Dextrin, Tocopherol, Butylene Glycol, 4-Terpineol, Pentylene Glycol, Octonediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\nExpirience:\n\nBougth this because of the tea tree extract, oil and 4- terpineol for the antimicrobial and antiinflammatory benefits , plus it also promised balancing the water-oil contend of the skin. So far i have been using it for a week and it feels nicely moisturizing, but i cannot say if it has helped with my breakouts. Smells strongly like tea tree, wich i dont mind.\n\n**Isntree Spotsaver Mugwort Ampoule:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nArtemisia Princeps Extract, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Erythritol, Betaine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Piper Methysticum Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Panthenol, Propanediol, Beta-Glucan, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Allantoin, Carbomer, Tromethamine, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\nExpirience:\n\nThis i got because i heard amazing things about mugwort and it was on a 50 % Sale, so i got it for a steal! So far i like the simple ingredient list an it seems soothing and hydrating.\n\n**RNW Der.Ceramide Cream:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Ceramide NP, Panthenol, Caprylyl Methicone, Glycerin, C12-16 Alcohols, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Ceramide NS, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Ceramide AS, Ceramide AP, Oligopeptide-1, Ceramide EOP, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Betaine, Arginine, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Carbomer, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Arachidyl Glucoside, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Stearic Acid, Adenosine, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium EDTA\n\nExpirience:\n\nIm really intriged by this brand an was debating between this and the Ceramide serum, but got this Cream. At first i was intimitaded by the essential oils and the strong smell it has (herbal, but to my nose very pleasant) so i patchtested it on my cheek. The Patchtests went fine and i have been using it on my whole face for 4 days now and i must say im impressed.\n\nIf you have oily skin i feel you could hate it but for my dry skin... the texture is amazing. Its a THIIICK cream, like an ointment, very balmy. Upon apllication it feels nice to spread it and it sinks in so well for the thick texture. The cream surprisingly dries down velvety and leaving a protective shield over the Skin. I also love that it has 3 % Panthenol, 3% ceramides and cholesterol and fatty acids.... so perfect ingrdients for skin barrier repair! Really a potential HG...\n\n\n\n",

At first, its was wonderful, felt super nice in my hair and for the first time in my life, my frizziness was gone just after using the shampoo and conditioner.\n\nI thought I'd found a shampoo that was perfect for my hair finally, but just recently, it hasn't been so great. For the first 2 weeks, all my frizziness was completely gone, but it seems it comes back more and more with each wash, and I've been getting little tiny flakes of either dandruff or product buildup. I always make sure to scrub my scalp with the pads of my fingers and work the lather down, and the conditioner absorbs so well  into my strands that there's barely anything to wash out after waiting a couple minutes. On top of that, my hair has been getting greasy on my second day, which never happened on any shampoo I've ever used (Suave, Tresseme, RegisDesignline, Big & Sexy, Paul Mitchell). I don't use any heat products or any other kinds of products to set my hair, so I don't think that it's because of damage or product buildup, unless it's somehow the shampoo itself. \n\nI'm really at a loss at this point and not sure if I should try a different line within Shea moisture, to give this one a bit more time, or to try a different brand.\n\n\n**Shea Moisture Mafuka Honey Shampoo**\n\nWater (Aqua), Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Glycol Stearate, Glycerin (Vegetable), Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Panthenol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter*, Fragrance (Essential Oil Blend), Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Trichilia Emetica Seed Butter, Ficus Carica (Fig) Extract, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Stearamide AMP, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Tocopherol, Honey\n\n\n**Shea Moisture Mafuka Honey Conditioner**\n\nWater (Aqua), Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyropermum Parkii (Shea) Butter *, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Trichliav Emetica Seed Butter, Behentrimonium Chloride, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Cellulose, Glycerin (Vegetable), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Ether, Honey, Fragrance (Essential Oil Blend) Tocopherol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG Propyl Silanrtriol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ficus (Fig) Extract",

It smelled SO lovely and it had been recommended to me by my sister who has defined ringlets so I thought I'd give it a go. I have 2c hair and oh man this stuff was a disaster for me. The top of my scalp was always so so waxy. Yes, I do mean waxy, not greasy. It had turned the hair on the top of my scalp into a straight (no longer wavy) waxy mess. I was full of dandruff, my head was also itchy (which made the dandruff even worse, and god I mean it was *insane* how itchy I was!!!) so I figured I should use more shampoo and really get it sudsing to wash it out. It made my situation worse. I was not using any product in my hair and going to work on the daily so it was always in a bun and I let it air dry almost every night, I was treating it right so I couldn't understand wtf was happening. \nAbout that time I decided I needed a hair cut and apologized in advance to the hair stylist and told her my woes (I'd never seen her before) and once I told her I was using this line of shampoo and conditioner she told me immediately to stop using it. The shampoo I had been using was full of too many oils and I wasn't clarifying my hair in any way. I was kinda drowning my hair in oil. The conditioner didn't really help much either. \nI haven't used their products since cause I was so upset from what it did to me. I know I used a different shampoo but there's something about this line that could never groove with my hair. I stole a pump from my sister's styling cream and it gave me a headache all day from the scent and my hair didn't take to it, either. \nI tossed my bottles in the end. You could try another one of their products that may actually wash your hair better and you can avoid all the dandruff but my experience has been bad with this line.",

This is a good thing when your scalp and hair need it- this is a bad thing when you don't. Some people have a hair/skin type and climate to need it regularly. A lot of people do not.\n\nIf your hair is well repaired and not truly prone to going dry in hours- stop using it. Hold it back as a conditioning treatment on a as needed basis only.\n\nI alternate between other brands of hair stuff, followed by a clarifying wash to get out silicones, then a week of only Shea moisture. As soon as my non-Shea conditioner can't keep up, i rotate back through.\n\nI work in a very dry warehouse and it does affect my hair but not badly enough to damage faster than Shea moisture can repair it.",

It is clearing up my redness/uneven skintone and PIH - my skin looks almost as clear as when I was 13, before I started tanning heavily in the summer (I'm 22). Previously I was using the no7 protect and perfect daycreams, because they had spf15 in and 5 star UVA protection. In comparison to this suncream though, they barely did anything to noticeably improve my skin. \n\nAs far as application goes, I find it moisturising but not too greasy (haven't had any trouble with it breaking me out).

A lot of the recommended conditioners have all these ingredients of the petal fresh, this brand is really cheap and accessible to me too. Where did it go wrong?    \n\n\nQuestion 2 : the products recommendations page recommended tresemme naturals conditioner but It was discontinued and I read reviews that says it has to be used as a leave in and not a rinse conditioner.

I am not super acne prone but do get clogging and whiteheads and the occasional inflamed pimple from irritation or overly comedogenic products. At first glance I don’t see anything super concerning about the ingredients but I’m not as well versed as many of you so I might be missing something!",

I just ordered the foaming oil cleanser during Sephora's spring sale so I'm eager to see how that one works out as well.\n\nThe only thing that annoys me about the brand is I think up until a year or so ago, they were sold in drugstores for a fraction of the price. Now that they're in Sephora, they've really driven up the price considerably. So I'm just mildly annoyed I didn't find them sooner.",

I lucked in to some very awesome products when I started doing CG, and for the first time in my life I fell in love with my hair. However, finding my \"holy grail\" so early meant I never really experimented or tried things.  Now my products have been discontinued one by one, leaving me scrambling for similar replacements, and it's just not working. On paper, It looks like I pick the right things, but my hair is so sad now. It's just lackluster. Limp, kind of flat, feels dry no matter what I've tried. My curls are just wavy now. Nothing else has changed  as far as the style, dye, or routine.\n \nI don't mind paying  for pricey products that work, but I don't even know where to start at this point and I don't want to keep paying tons of money for more products that aren't doing anything for me.

        "body": "No one can answer this for you because it really depends on your hair. For example, I cannot use any protein-containing products on my hair, but other people need lots of it.\n\nOne way to figure it out is to wrap a single strand of your hair around your fingers and pull. Healthy, well-balanced hair will stretch a bit and then bounce back to its original shape when you let go. If the hair snaps easily with very little stretching, you're good for protein but you need more moisture. If the hair stretches a lot before snapping or does not bounce back into shape, you're good for moisture but you need more protein. This isn't an exact science because again everyone's hair is so different, so yours might just naturally be more or less stretchy even when healthy, but it can give you an idea.\n\nYou could also just try the keratin conditioner and see how your hair reacts. If it becomes stronger and healthier, great, keep using it; if it becomes more tangly, that could mean too much protein so just cut back again.",

        "body": "I totally agree that each person is different.  You can actually NEVER use a single product with protein and still have strong, shiny, soft hair.  Some people are protein intolerant, meaning they cannot use ANY hair product that contains any protein, whether animal protein or vegetable.  Others are protein “sensitive” which means they CAN use it but only very little, so rarely.\n\nAnd products vary widely in the amount of protein in their formulas.  The higher “protein” appears in the ingredient list, the greater the percentage of protein in the product.  If protein appears at the bottom of the ingredient list, then there’s very little in it.\n\nDrugstore brands are notorious for adding protein to every hair product, even hairspray.  And styling products, in general, are not exempt from containing protein…so basically EVERY single hair product, from shampoo all the way to stylers, can contain various amount of it.\n\nProtein overload is a real thing.  And one of the major symptoms is severe dryness.  Too much protein can also make hair brittle and that means that major breakage is down the road.  Brittle hair breaks if you blink.  You can have very dry hair but not protein overload.  You can have protein overload but there will always be major dryness.  If you “catch” the situation early enough, you can stop using protein so very dry hair doesn’t become brittle and start to break.\n\nHair needs hydration, even virgin hair and especially if hair has undergone ANY chemical processing, whether it’s color (no matter the formula of color), perms, straightening or relaxers.  And hair can lose major moisture from heat styling too.  And hair that has been fried by heat will be super dry and can become brittle from that alone, protein sensitivity or intolerance notwithstanding.\n\nSo how do you know whether or not you have protein “overload”?  Whether it’s a sensitivity or intolerance, the symptoms will be the same, very very dry hair that may or may not (yet) be breaking off (split ends are the beginning btw).  If you’ve tried numerous treatments but nothing has helped, this is a major indicator.  If those “treatments” have contained protein, that’s just making a bad situation worse.\n\nThe first step is to take an inventory of every single hair product in your routine, and all products you may not be using right now but have used recently, like in the last month or 6 weeks.  Check every single label for protein, no matter where in the ingredients protein might be listed.  Sometimes “keratin” isn’t listed as “keratin protein” but it is protein as is collagen.  But other than these, each list should specify the type of protein.  But it really doesn’t matter.  Make two piles: one for products that have protein and one pile for those that don’t.\n\nIf the protein pile is larger OR contains products you use MORE often (even though the actual number of products is smaller) AND your hair is extremely dry, breaking and/or has not responded to the treatments you’ve tried, then you’ve likely got some type of protein issue.   All hair “treatments” are temporary btw.  So when I say “hair has not responded” I’m talking about ZERO improvement right after said treatment.  If your hair is equally dry or DRIER after a treatment, then yes, it’s very likely you have an issue with protein.\n\nProtein is extremely stubborn.  According to my next door neighbor who is a cosmetic chemist, it attaches itself both to the inner cortex AND to the outer layer (cuticle).  So “fixing” the protein problem isn’t gonna happen overnight.  It takes a while for the protein to “wear off” so to speak.  It could take a month, it could take a week, it really depends on YOUR hair and how it responds.  First, there is NO downside to NOT using protein.  Nothing bad is gonna happen to your hair.  Like I said at the beginning, you can go your entire existence without ever using protein and still have strong, soft, shiny hair.  That’s just a fact.  Hair IS protein..it’s made up of keratin, but it’s response to protein is an individual thing.  Some people can use a crap load of protein and never have to think about it while others have to read labels like a crazy person because they just cannot tolerate ANY protein whatsoever.\n\nSo the first step is switching to a very moisturizing protein free shampoo and very moisturizing protein free conditioner.  Again, how quickly hair responds varies because not only is everybody’s hair different but how frequently hair is washed also varies.  So this is the very first step.  Along with this, you need to SUPER hydrate the hair and a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner cannot do it alone.  Jojoba is the oil that’s closest to the body’s natural sebum/lipids (oils) so not only is it an excellent hydrator but it also helps restore/maintain the scalp’s lipid barrier, which is the body’s first line of defense against external aggressors like dirt, bacteria and pollution as it is for ALL skin.  So there’s that.\n\nYou would use jojoba as you would any oil for a hot oil treatment and that’s on CLEAN DRY (meaning not wet) hair.  Oil and water do not mix so if hair is the least bit damp, the oil is not going to penetrate.  So hair must be 100% dry including the roots.  Warm the oil in the microwave for about 30 seconds.  You want it warm but not too hot to touch.  If your hair is long, dip the ends directly into the oil and work it up (applying more as needed) though the mid lengths to about 1 inch from the roots.  If you have issues with a dry scalp or have ANY flakes or itching, apply the oil to the scalp.  Both symptoms are indicators that the lipid barrier on the scalp has somehow been disrupted or even destroyed.  (This can happen if using harsh shampoo and/or washing too often.). Nothing beats jojoba for treating scalp issues….nothing.  And jojoba is affordable just be sure you get 100% jojoba, as in NO other ingredients.  I buy mine at Trader Joe’s but as long as it’s pure jojoba, you’re good.\n\nOnce you’ve finished applying the jojoba, leave it in overnight.  Put a towel on your pillow.  You don’t want hair dripping in oil but you do want to ensure every single strand has been saturated.  And if you apply the jojoba a few hours before bed, your hair will probably have absorbed most of it anyway.  In the morning, you might find there’s no residue.  That your hair was so thirsty it’s absorbed every last trace.  If it does feel like there’s some oil remaining, you CAN cowash (conditioner only) or use your protein free sulfate free shampoo but only a TINY amount and only on the scalp.  Work only the suds through to the ends and then rinse.  It’s up to you whether or not to use conditioner.\n\nIf you do a jojoba treatment once a week and then use a protein free deep conditioner overnight (yes, overnight again) once a week as well, you’ll see that your hair becomes more hydrated, which means more pliable and softer and shinier. That said, if your hair is damaged from color, perming, straightening, relaxers or frequent heat styling, it does reach a point of no return.  That means it’s become so fried that no treatment can do anything.  You cannot repair split ends, they will continue to split, up and up and up, theoretically all the way to the roots.  The only remedy for split ends, it to cut those sucker OFF.  Only that stops the splitting.\n\nI’m gonna stop here and if you have questions or want some specific product recommendations, lmk.  I do have excellent protein free products I can suggest but I have severe arthritis in my hands and I’ve had enough for today, sry.  You can also dm me if you prefer.",

        "body": "If you’re still experiencing scalp issues, my best advice is to see a dermatologist and here’s why: it’s highly unlikely that a shampoo could so severely affect the scalp.  A shampoo is a rinse off product. It does not penetrate the skin on the scalp. It doesn’t have that capability. The protein in the shampoo doesn’t penetrate the hair much either.  And if this was years ago, then the hair affected hair has long since grown out.  Shampoos and conditioner are TOPICAL in the sense that they don’t penetrate to the cortex of the hair and they certainly don’t penetrate the skin barrier.  So please see a doctor if you are experiencing scalp issues. It could be an allergic reaction to something in your diet or an indicator of a more serious condition.",

    "body": "Hi everyone,\nI've had long time to experiment with my hair. I am very confused to what to do with it.\n\nI believe my hair is type 2a wavy hair. It's hard to say because when its short you would think i have straight hair, but there are slight waves, now that it is longer and layered.\n\nIn humid summer days, my hair frizzes and poofs up like a cottonball. I found that using a conditioner or product with protein helped.\n\nSo hair seems to be a few issues, with the protein my hair has more volume, but its still super volumized unless I put in mousse.\n\nThe strands seem to look more straight or curly depending on how much I sweat (the more sweat, the more wavy it looks). I tried using salt sprays with mixed results. It does make my hair more wavy+volume but I don't like the scrunchiness of it. \n\nSo here is the issue. My hair gets greasy real quick, I found that using oil containing conditioners make my hair limp. Recently, I tried the Pantene Ice Shine conditioner by mistake. This conditioner is oil-free but contains dimethicone. On the first night, I loved that it made my hair more voluminous and the curls in the waves were pronounced. However, on my second day of washing my hair with only the Ice Shine conditioner (no shampoo), the silicone in it straightened out my hair and weighed it down, making it flat.\n\nSO after this I used the Ice Shine shampoo, which contains sulfates and betaines and other substances that I'm sure stripped my hair of the silicone, and I'm back to just using protein stuff.\n\nSo now I'm unsure what to do. So far the only thing I do with my hair is use a refresher spray that replaces my conditioner (I don't condition because I find anythign with oil makes it limp due to grease). My refresher spray contains:\n\n * hydrolyzed rice protein\n * aloe\n * hydrolyzed corn protein\n * hydrolyzed wheat starch\n * hydrolyzed wheat protein\n * keratin amino acids (I mixed in)\n * silk amino acids (I mixed in)\n * a bunch of hydrating plant extracts (oil-free)\n * glycerin\n\nThis spray helps give me volume and makes my hair not frizzy in humid weather, but my waves are not defined. I am looking for a way to make my waves more pronounced without having to wash it everyday. \n\nI like the idea of salt spray, but so far I have mixed results, and I'm looking for alternatives. I am also avoiding heat methods, not because I'm against it, but rather I'm looking for types of ingredients and products that might enhance my waves first.\n\n\nwhat I know about my hair so far:\n\n * possibly type 2a , fine density hair, each strand itself is thin\n * can appear slightly wavy or straight\n * volume is flat if I don't use protein\n * greases very easily\n * oil containing conditioners are too heavy+oily, and makes my hair flat\n * oil-free and silicone contaning conditioners worked for the first night, but second night it weighed it down and made it limp.\n * frizzes without protein in humid summer\n * in general volume is difficult to get at the top/crown of my head. it is flat there most\n * I generally avoid sulfate shampoos unless i used silicone products like that Ice Shine Conditioner with dimethicone.\n * sometimes I don't bother shampooing and just use protein-free conditioner, because I find it makes no difference, but I rather not remove proteins from my hair, so I just wash in a conditioner that is free of protein. I spray with my refresher spray so im sure i get enough protein from there. \n \n\n\nany tips?",

It won't hurt your hair at all because it doesn't open your cuticle, like permanent and demi-permanent color processing does. [Here's info from labmuffin on different types of hair color that goes into more detail.](https://labmuffin.com/how-does-hair-dye-work/)\n\nLunar Tides' description is right that it's non-damaging — the ingredients indicate an intensive conditioner + color. That's it! So there's no need to wait to color or to use a second conditioner right before or after you apply the color. If you want deeper conditioning (and more intense color) just leave the Lunar Tides color on longer. (Careful though, the color can get pretty intense.)\n\nThe only thing to consider in terms of your hair's condition when applying the color is that you need to make sure you're applying it evenly, so lots of color coats ALL your hair, otherwise, you can get a patchy results. Lunar Tides' instructions will tell you to start with towel dried hair (so, slightly wet) and that helps with even application. You can also start with slightly wetter hair and leave the color on longer (I did this last time, it was fine).",

If your hair has mixed amount of damage (like roots are healthy but ends are fried) it might be a good idea to do a conditioning treatment first so that your hair all soaks up the dye evenly. It won't hurt your hair to skip this, but it might make the color turn out a bit better.",

    "body": "**Background**\n\nI live in an area with very hard water (Minneapolis), and it’s definitely been tough on my hair. I had done the Malibu C hard water treatment packets in the past, and found them helpful. My tap water pH is 9 (!!!!! yes, nine!) and contains an average of 3.5 – 4.0ppm of chlorine (not sure how that stacks up).\n\n I have caucasian 2a wavy-ish hair that is very fine and splits easily and is very prone to frizz if I don’t use the right products. It's virgin but damages easily. I almost never blow dry it, and flat iron it occasionally - 1x a week at most. Despite being fine textured, it can take wayyy more product than you would expect. \n\n^(Extra: I was previously using the Cantu shampoo and conditioner, doing a CGM-ish routine, but have decided to switch it up my hair care this year. I think the shampoo caused buildup over time, despite me not using silicones, because I did a single wash with Malibu clarifying shampoo and swimmers treatment and holy hell did it make my hair so much lighter and bouncier! So I’ve decided to stop the CGM and look for a better routine for my hair. (That means anything goes as far as ingredients.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Problem**\n\nI got the Malibu C Hard Water Wellness Shampoo & Conditioner, thinking it would be the answer to all my life’s problems. I desperately wanted them to work for me, but I'm starting to realize that they are a total bust. :(\n\n**I’ve used them for 1.5 months and I wash my hair 1-2x a week. As soon as I started using them, my hair became *noticeably more frizzy*, and over time it seems to be getting worse, not better.** My hair hasn’t been this frizzy since I had a stint living in a very humid island climate. The conditioner also doesn’t feel particularly conditioning to me.\n\nAt this point I’m kind of at a loss on what to do, since I don’t have a go-to shampoo/conditioner to go back to. I’m trying to figure out what the problem is so that I know what direction to go in with my next product. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Theories**\n\nI also tried HealthySexyHair Moisturizing Conditioner for one use, and that didn’t help the frizz. It was about the same. I see they both have glycerin prominently on the list. Could that be it? Another hypothesis I have is the shampoo may be too harsh on my hair, even though it’s supposed to be “protective” according to the manufacturer, and the conditioner isn’t ~~moisturizing~~ conditioning enough to combat the harshness. The pH of the Malibu C shampoo is supposedly 6.0-6.8, but I got that info from an Amazon review and can’t verify (it cited the manufacturer’s website but I can’t find it). (Not sure that shampoo pH matters relative to my tap water anyway...). Malibu C claims their shampoo is not harsh, very gentle, and can be used daily. According to the site, the purpose of the shampoo is to prevent minerals from attaching to your hair, as opposed to removing them. So I honestly can’t tell if the shampoo is harsh, or the conditioner just sucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** I’m trying to figure out what it is about these products that made my hair suddenly frizzy, so I can figure out what to avoid and/or look for in a replacement.

    "body": "Hi! I need some help with my skincare routine, as I've come to the realization that my skin barrier has been compromised for a long time now.\n\n\nA little backstory: \n      I started getting acne when I was about 12. My face was full of big red pimples, so I went to a dermatologist and he prescribed me a gel (Mask Acne Gel) which had multiple ingredients in it (polyvinyl a, tretinoin and glycolic acid), but he didn't tell me to use a moisturizer or a sunscreen along with it, so I didn't (for a few years). The gel didn't really help, so I stopped using it. \n      I eventually bought a benzoyl peroxide gel from acne.org, which helped a lot but irritated the heck out of my skin, so I stopped using that as well. \n      I then went to another dermatologist who prescribed me Duac (benzoyl peroxide + clindamycin) to use every night and Skinoren (20% azelaic acid) every morning. Those two dried out my skin a lot, but they cleared it up completely. I had to stop the treatment earlier than planned because of my mom though. My skin remained clear for a few weeks, but then my acne started coming back (not as severe as before though). \n      I went to the last dermatologist a few months ago, who prescribed me a lotion called Acne Out, which didn't help at all. It left me with very irritated, red and flaky skin, it was peeling really badly and was super oily.\n\nSince then I've mainly been focusing on hydrating my skin. I've cut out all actives from my routine, but I feel like it still needs more hydration. I want to restore my skin barrier completely, so I can (very slowly and carefully) incorporate a retinol into my routine, as I'm dealing with some closed comedones and PIE at the moment, but nothing severe anymore.\n\n\nMy routine at the moment is:\n\nAM: splash my face with water\nThe Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA\nAvene Hydrance Legere SPF 30 OR Bioderma Photoderm Max Aquafluide SPF 50+ (I suspect this one's been breaking me out a little though)\n\nPM: Garnier micellar water (only when I have makeup/sunscreen on)\nLa Roche Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Facial Cleanser\nThe Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA\nRosehip oil sometimes (I suspect it's contributing to my closed comedones)\n\nI made a list of products I could incorporate in my routine (my skin is very sensitive and clog prone, i'm okay with fragrance tho!), but any recommendations are welcome. The list is:\n\n1. Geek & Gorgeous Liquid Hydration Toner \n(Ingredients: Water, Panthenol, Peg/Ppg/Polybutylene Glycol-8/5/3 Glycerin, Sodium PCA, Diglycerin, Urea, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Sorbitol, Lysine, PCA, Allantoin, Lactic Acid, Tocopherol, Citric Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol)\n\n2. Sebamed Extreme Dry Skin Relief Face Cream 5% Urea \n(Ingredients: Aqua, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Urea, Glycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Panthenol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid, Bisabolol, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Carbomer, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate)\n\n3. Bioderma Hydrabio Serum \n(Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Xylitol, Sodium Polyacrylate, Mannitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract, Niacinamide, Pyrus Malus (apple) Fruit Extract, Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Trideceth-6, Peg/ppg-18/18 Dimethicone, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hexyldecanol, Caprylic/capric Triglyceride, Disodium Edta, Chlorphenesin, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance)\n\n4. Avene Hydrance Aqua Gel \n(Ingredients: Avène Thermal Spring Water, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-hexanediol, Dimethicone, Isocetyle Stearoyl Stearate, Triethylhexanoin, Caprylic/capric Triglyceride, Betaine, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyglyceryl010 Myristate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, BHT, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohols, Carbomer, Citric Acid, Cucurbita Pepo (pumpkin Seed Oil) Seed Oil, Fragrance, Phytosterols, Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Dextran Sulfate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Squalane, Tocopheryl Glucoside, Water)\n\nWhich products do you guys think are worth it and could help restore my moisture barrier? I'm open to any other recommendations and thank you so much for taking the time to read this!",

I recommend Glossier Super Pure because it contains 5% Niacinamide with 8 other humectants. \n\nGel based moisturizers containing  emollients and occlusives for damaged barrier are a MUST!\n\nAs someone with your skin type these are my favorites and 100% non comedogenic.\n\nSerum: Glossier Super Pure (5% niacinamide + Zinc filled with Honeysuckle extracts for additional hydration) \n\nMist: LRP Toleriane Ultra 8 (contains 8 humectants that I spray before I moisturize) 0% fragrance/ alcohol \n\nMoisturizer: Clinique Moisture Surge 72hr auto-replenishing hydrator \n\nLRP Cicaplast Gel B5 (similar to the baume without the Shea Butter in a gel vehicle) My skin finds Shea Butter comedogenic.\n\n***I'm in the US so I had to purchase to LRP mist and B5 gel on Paypal since they are only available in Canada.

It is color treated (because I have some greys) and I rarely use heat to style. The one upside it that is tends to be very soft (except when I pick the wrong product and dry it out). \n\nI am getting so turned around and confused with all the hair care advice I read. I am currently using [HairStory](https://www.hairstory.com/products/new-wash/) and it is going alright, but that s\\*&t is expensive. I made the mistake of using a leave-in that came in an Ipsy bag ( [FoxyBae Magic Daily Leave In Hair Mask - 12-in-1](https://www.foxybae.com/products/12-in-1-magic-daily-leave-in-hair-mask)). It was good the first time I used it but now my hair is feeling a bit grubby (so I guess I need to use a clarifying shampoo). I like to wash my hair ever other day, but on day two I always have to wear it in a ponytail. I'm tired of fighting it every day and spending a fortune on stuff that never seems to work. \n\nI have tried CG method, untold products for decades, products for curly hair, products for wavy hair, products for fine hair...). If I don't wash my hair frequently my scalp itches, so I have never managed more than three days. It takes my hair a long time to air dry, so I hate washing it because I have to go to work with wet hair or sleep with wet hair. \n\nI just want my hair to be moisture/protein balanced and not weighed down. I don't like complicated hair routines and prefer to use little or no product outside of shampoo and conditioner. I occasionally use [L'anza Bounce Up Spray](https://www.ulta.com/healing-oil-bounce-up-spray?productId=xlsImpprod18041073) and that seems to be magic. I have [Olaplex](https://olaplex.com/) 3 and it worked great the first time and has had diminishing returns since. I also have Olaplex 6 and it feels heavy in my hair. \n\nI tried that hair in water test and it never sunk despite leaving it in the cup for over an hour; however, I hear that this test may not be that helpful. Again, I get conflicting information. \n\nI am currently eyeing the [Verb Ghost line](https://www.verbproducts.com/products/smooth-shine-duo?variant=32294608240729). Ingredients below.

If so how are they? I may have to narrow it down to using just one of them so I was wondering which may be the best of the two. I use their sunscreen and love that it has niacinaminde in it, it helps with my redness. But I'd like to switch to one of their less greasy sunscreens but none of the others had niacinamide. So I figured if I had a moisturizer with niacinamide then I could change sunscreens. Here are the moisturizer's ingredients:\n\nElta MD AM therapy facial moisturizer: \nPurified Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ethylhexyl Isononanoate, Niacinamide, Lauryl PEG-9 Polymethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Dimethicone, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Sodium Chloride, Piptadenia Colubrina Peel Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycerin, Allantoin, Caffeine, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Dimethicone/PEG-10/15 Crosspolymer, Butylene Glycol,\nPhenoxyethanol, Capryloyl Glycine, Undecylenoyl Glycine, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide.\n\nElta MD PM therapy:\nPurified Water, Ethylhexyl Isononanoate, Niacinamide, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyl Dimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, 1, 3-Bis (N-2-(Hydroxyethyl) Palmitoylamino) -2- Hydroxy Propane, C-10-30 Cholesterol/Lanosterol Esters, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycereth-26, Linoleic Acid, Cetearyl Glucoside, Thioctic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Hydrolyzed Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum, Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum, Butylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Bisulfite, Sodium Hydroxide.\n\n\nUPDATE: I tried the PM therapy tonight and after about an hour my cheeks were burning like crazy! No redness, no apparent allergic reaction, just burning like the dickens. It was almost like I had a chemical burn. Washed it off and burn began to fade. May wait a couple days and try the AM therapy but scared I will have the same reaction. Sad because it has so many great ingredients and their sunscreen has worked great for me. \n\nUPDATE 2: The AM is my new HG moisturizer. In love!",

I used to use this twice a month but I probably hadn't in about a year.\n\nI decided to do one this afternoon and on step 3, which is the 25% Vitamin C application in step 2 *(Cyclopentasiloxane, Ascorbic Acid, Ethylhexyl Hydroxystearate,  Polysilicone-11, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Dimethicone,  Parfum/Fragrance, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Propylene Carbonate, Mica,  Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491), Limonene, Linalool)* plus a melting cleanser on top *( Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond)  Oil, Sucrose Laurate, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Tocopheryl  Acetate, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose,  Xanthan Gum, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Seed  Oil, Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Seed Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil,  Prunus Cerasus (Bitter Cherry) Seed Oil, Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate,  Annatto (CI 75120), Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Limonene)* that you're supposed to keep on for 15-20 minutes then remove.  On step 3, I forgot to set my timer and when I realized it, I set it for 10 minutes, so it's possible I actually left it on for 20, even 25 minutes. I realized that I should have set it for less but shrugged at the time.  I was not at all thinking about the strength of the Vit C and that it could have a bad effect.\n\nAnyway, when I rinsed I was red and stinging a little, and I followed it up with Indie Lee CO-Q toner (with aloe, chamomile, and HA), Power of Three serum (with green tea and resveratrol), and a SkinMedica Rejuvinative Moisturizer (which I realize in retrospect was a bad choice).\n\nBut the redness and irritation did not got away, and actually got worse. My chin and forehead have a blotchy rash and I developed a dime-sized reddish brown spot on my cheek that was not there before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/904br2v339z41.jpg?width=1932&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8af2d0cec46ebf16e7dd795964ff8a4abfe209d4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/75yup1v339z41.jpg?width=1932&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cbb85512c8714b9d87bcacafb1a449f2ab7df56\n\nI don't know if this reaction happened because:\n\n\\-the product has gone bad\n\n\\-I let it stay on too long\n\n\\-I've been using retinol/acids more regularly and so had a reaction that I don't normally have.\n\nMy skincare routine has not changed, except that I'm doing is a lot more diligently than I have in the past (quarantine), but it's:\n\nAM:\n\nCleanser: Neutrogena\n\nSkinceuticals CE Ferulic\n\nNIOD Hyraulonic\n\nMurad Nutrient Charged Water Gel\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPM:\n\nalternating nights: Dr. Gross Extra Strength Alpha Beta Peel, Skinceuticals .5 Retinol\n\nShark Sauce on Retinol nights, Replenix Power of Three serum on acid nights\n\nDr. Brandt Hydro Biotic Sleeping mask on retinol nights, Dr. Jart Ceramidin cream on acid nights.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny ideas of what happened? And then, what do I do to fix it and get back to normal?\n\nFrom searching here about chemical burns, I have applied Jurlique Skin Balancing oil ( Rose Hip, Safflower, Macadamia and Avocado Oils) and Aquafor, and both felt good on my skin--no stinging.  Anything else I should do? Calming products (with green tea, chamomile) and a basic moisturizer like Dr. Jart Ceramidin cream make my skin sting (I washed my face and tried applying Dr. Jart but that too was inflammatory).\n\nAny other suggestions or feedback is appreciated!",

Considering how many actives you have in your routine, the treatment you did was probably enough to push your barrier function into completely broken territory. If it were me, I would remove all actives for 2 weeks minimum. You need to get that barrier back and get your skin healing before it’s pushed too far. I’m also really not liking the ingredients listed in that face oil you mentioned- it’s got some stuff that’s not great for healthy skin, let alone compromised skin. I would get something with balm in the name, the aquaphor is fine too, and stick to only hydrating products until this has completely cleared, otherwise you’re likely to flare it back up again. Also, unless you’re a complete oil slick in the morning, stick to rinsing with warm water and use a toner. Washing once a day is fine unless you’re an absolute dirty grease ball in the morning!",

Other than scent they are about the same.\n\nI'm currently using the Healing variety, because it comes in a fragrance free version and I don't much like scenty lotions. If you want to avoid the exfoliation, this one is for you as it has very little urea.\n\nOne thing to note is that they contain silicones, so they can ball up a bit if you rub the area after it's dry.",

I've been having acne and problem skin since 12-13 years old (oh, my! thats 10 years now!) and wanted to get som help. \nI was recommended this really expensive skincare from the brand \"Elixir Cosmeceuticals\" (Norwegian brand produced in US), and it was soon expensive, my wallet could absolutely not do the buying they recommended me...

Anti-aging serum that also helps even out redness    \n3. A BHA treatment (salcyclic acid is a BHA)    \n4. SPF moisturizer    \n5. Sulfur-based acne treatment\n\nOf the CosRX products listed in your description, these would be the Korean alternatives:    \n1. CosRX Good Morning Cleanser    \n2. CosRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence    \n3. CosRX One Step Pimple Clear Pad     \n4. Why you have no sunscreen girl. CosRX Hyaluronic Acid Intense Cream only because it's the one true moisturizer on your list. Maybe you could get away with using the Honey Overnight Mask, too.    \n5. CosRX doesn't have any sulfur based products so you probably will have to buy an alternative product that has sulfur as its active ingredient.\n\nPlease remember to patch-test new products, especially because you're prone to breakouts. Cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen are the top 3 crucial products in any skincare routine so you need to put any product that fits this description top on your testing list.\n\nBest of luck!",

I go to a plastic surgeon's office for extractions and they do the same thing lol. \n\nanyways, it looks like you have 2 non-oil cleansers? see if you can switch one out (abexchange!) for an oil cleanser. Most results i saw when developing a routine came from that but YMMV so do patch test/try samples first. A lot of my acne cleared up from oil cleansing alone.\n\nMy skin type is just. odd. but on oily days i stick to using just an emulsion+mask/sleeping pack before sleeping with toner in the morning. \n\nStart out slow. IMO the 2 most important steps are cleansing+sunscreen so make those your priority. Incorporate whatever toner+moisturizer that works best with your skin into your routine. Once you start using them regularly THEN you could slowly introduce your actives (BHA, AHA, etc).\n\nI made the mistake of introducing way too much of an active too fast (vit c in my case) and my moisture barrier was so screwed that i couldnt put on ANY lotion or cream without my skin burning so be careful and be persistent! sidebar has some nice easy to follow graphics about developing a routine. You seem to have a lot of multiples of products (lots of toners and cleansers) so try to stick to whatever one calms down your skin the most. like i said before, if they're lightly used, switching them out might be useful.\n\nAnd of course, drink tons of water!! good luck :)",

Also a way to introduce some actives even if they aren't fully functional to your skin. \n\n**Exfoliator:**\n\n* BHA Blackhead - \n\n**Moisturizes:**\n\n* Hyaluronic acid cream is a cream -  soothing cream, hydrating cream\n* Honey sleeping pack - occlusive, moisturizer\n\n**Note:** You may or not need both creams. You have a hyluronic essence not need to use both in the same routine, but you can.  I'd dry just the honey first and see if you want to add the other.\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThese are a lot of products.   All good and all simple and focused on specific ingredients. You have many in the same category. You might sell some or test which, you like better. Some you may want to keep in the fidge as you test the others.  \n\nYou need a sunscreen - Biore watery essence or milk is popular, has alcohol and is chemical. the milk has some zinc though.  There are many other options.  I'd get an oil cleanser - Banilla Clean it Zero, Kose Softymo, Innisfree Apple Jucy. sGet a basic routine going of:oil cleanser, low Ph cleanser essence and honey sleep pack.  Then I'd introduce the BHA slowly.  Then after you have been on BHA for a month you could test other essences adn cleansers.\n\n\n\nEdited for format and typo.",

I’ve seen from several sources that ingredients rich in electrolytes can cause emulsions to thin. Where can I learn more about this stuff? Is there data available for different ingredients’ electrolyte compatibility, or is it more of a formula-specific thing that takes trial and error? Thanks for the help! \n\nFor reference, here’s my recipe:\nWater phase: \nDistilled water 71% (51% and 20% aloe for the variation)\nHydrolyzed rice protein 1% \nOil phase: \nJojoba oil 10% \nMango butter 10%\nEmulsifying wax NF 5%\nCetyl alcohol 2%\nCool down phase:\nFragrance 0.5%\nLiquid Germall Plus 0.5% ",

        "body": "Stabilization of emulsions, colloids, dispersions, and suspensions is basically an entire career field even before getting into specific ingredients and formulations - you'll hear it described as colloidal domain by physical chemistry people such as myself or as soft matter physics by the physics crowd and a little more in Europe too. \n\nAdding electrolytes/ions/salts can have both thickening (surfactant liquid crystal systems) or thinning effects. Thinning can happen because of charge shielding and electric double layer collapse where particles and droplets repel each other (causing it to be thick/stable) with help from the emulsifier but then the salt cancels that and the droplets don't repel each other as strongly and so the mixture gets thinner. Electrolytes can also interfere with long chain interactions such as with polymeric thickeners and hydrocolloids.\n\nMaybe start with searching for ways to stabilize an emulsion or specifically how to stabilize a lotion. Looks for terms like electrostatic stabilization, steric stabilization, electro- steric stabilization, anionic, cationic, non-ionic emulsifiers, personal care thickeners, carbomer (synthetic) and hydrocolloid (natural) thickeners. \n\nBalancing a formula in a way that you like can take lots of trial and error and sometimes it's as much about the mixing and prep process as much as it is the ingredients. \n\nIt's a fun thing to study and experiment around with - good luck!\n\nEdited to add:\nu/tokemura Your comment below suggesting to try xanthan is a good choice, especially in a formula with Aloe. Xanthan can be slippery and stringy but Aloe already brings these qualities so they end up complimenting each other. Maybe start at 0.5% and increase or decrease to get the thickness you want.\n\nThe xanthan may clump and form fisheye defects if added directly to the water phase. To help avoid this you may try making a slurry by mixing the xanthan with 1-4% glycerine and then mixing the slurry into the water phase. If the glycerine is giving too much humectancy or skin tackiness then you could try adding the xanthan powder into the oil phase to help disperse it without the glycerine but may need more mixing to move the xanthan into the water phase and allow for complete hydration. \n\nSide note: the high quality xanthan gums and other hydrocolloids from CP Kelco are still available and in production even after Tate and Lyle bought CP Kelco last year. You can get them direct from Tate and Lyle (request by email) or go through a distributor like Lubrizol, Azelis, or IMCD. Unfortunately, many of the smaller distributors only sell commodity hydrocolloids that don't thicken as well and are unpredictable about how much they will thicken the formula. I would suggest trying these cosmetic grade xanthans: Keltrol CG, Keltrol CG-T (transparent), or Keltrol CG-SFT (less stringy).",

        "body": "> Is there data available for different ingredients’ electrolyte compatibility, or is it more of a formula-specific thing that takes trial and error?\n\nGood question – it's really both, though it's good to start armed with as much info as possible before you start experimenting. Always grab any product literature you can find from the manufacturer. Where relevant, it should include information about electrolyte tolerance. Another good starting point is to search Google Books for an ingredient name (in quotes) and electrolyte, and see what comes up in cosmetic science books.\n\nHowever, even with the best information, it's not always possible to predict exactly what will happen in a formula, since there are many variables. This is where experimenting comes in. It's good practice to experiment by just changing one variable at a time, and noting what differences you observe. \n\nEmulsifying wax NF is pretty electrolyte-tolerant, so it may just be a matter of increasing the amount of it, or of the thickeners, if the electrolyte load is high. Adding a water-phase thickener/stabiliser (like a small amount of xanthan gum) might help, and is usually a good idea anyway.\n\nDid you test the pH of each version? If they're different, it might be interesting to see the result if you adjust one to match the pH of the other.\n\nFragrances can also have an unpredictable effect on the viscosity or stability of emulsions. I understand you only changed one variable here, replacing some water with aloe juice, but fragrances can sometimes tip something over the edge. It could be an interesting experiment to make both versions without fragrance and see if the difference in viscosity is as pronounced. \n\nA note of caution on this topic: always verify info from DIY blogs, etc. with reliable sources before taking any of it at face value. I've seen some quite poor info on electrolyte tolerance in those sources.",

In my skin care i focus on hydration, getting that smooth silk texture (glass skin) and eliminating pimples. I don’t mind some high end products but i don’t want it to cost a fortune either.  I will attach to this post an graphic of my night and day skin care products. The yellow cream in my morning routine is an polish brand cream with niacinamide and vitamin C.B3 if you don’t know it i will write the ingredients list below. I was thinking of getting some serum in my night routine and using it after the snail essence and changing the yellow cream to rhode glazing milk what do you think about that and do you have some other suggestions please let me know. ☺️.                                           the ingredients list:                          \n\nAqua (Water), Octyldodecanol, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Propylene Glycol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Niacinamide, Calcium Pantothenate, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Pyridoxine HCl, Maltodextrin, Sodium Starch Octenylsuccinate, Silica, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Parfum (Fragrance), Linalool, Geraniol, Limonene, Sodium Hydroxide.",

You could also add a gentle exfoliant to use occasionally.\n\nMake sure to introduce new products one at a time, and be patient, consistency matters more than quantity. Knowing your skin type can also really help you choose the right products.\n\nYou don’t need to go high-end. A lot of the time (if not always), you're just paying for the brand. Skincare is trendy right now, and many luxury products are honestly just marketing.

        "body": "There's no one right way to do no-poo!  This sub welcomes anyone who doesn't use standard shampoo to wash your hair.  Using a co-wash as your only / main cleanser would be considered co-washing, which some people would consider under the Low-poo category, which includes using shampoos with gentle cleansers (usually infrequently), and in your case, a commercial conditioner with gentle cleansers.\n\nGenerally the important thing if you're going to use a commercial product is to make sure it doesn't have strong cleansers or conditioning agents that are likely to build up in a way that they can't easily be removed without using shampoo.  In that sense, it is aligned with the Curly Girl Method (CG).  In the side colum there's a link to a Low-Poo ingredient checker, which you can use to see if the product is CGM compatible and compatible for use as your only hair washing product as well.  \n\nI don't see anything majorly concerning in this, but you may experience some buildup over time.  My favorite way to remove buildup periodically is a bentonite clay hair mask, but if you're not completely opposed to shampoo, you could try using a shampoo and dilute it at first to see if it helps even in its diluted form; if that doesn't work, you can try diluting it at a lower ratio or using it at full strength.  My second favorite option for removing buildup is the Kinky Curly Come Clean shampoo, which is a gentle clarifying shampoo.",

Looking at the ingredients, it doesn't seem like it should be able to protect your hair from flat ironing. But I messaged Shea Moisture's support team and they assured me that the spray can protect against flat ironing, and still works when sprayed on damp hair that's allowed to air dry. \n\nHere are the ingredients for reference: \n\nWater, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter*, Glyceryl Stearate, Maltodextrin/VP Copolymer, Glycerin (Vegetable), Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Coconut Alkanes, Glyceryl Caprylate, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Annona Cherimola Fruit Extract, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Tocopherol, Althaea Officinalis Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Zea Mays Starch, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Fruit Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Fragrance (Essential Oil Blend), Glyceryl Undecylenate.\n\nHas anyone used any of Shea Moisture's heat protectant products? If so, did you feel like the spray did a good job protecting your hair from heat? I flat iron, so I'm a little worried that this spray still wouldn't do the job (Shea Moisture was vague with what level of protection is provided - they couldn't name a specific degree of heat). I plan to use the spray on my hair when it's damp and then use a flat iron many hours later after my hair has fully dried. \n\nI've also been trying out Eva NYC's Mane Magic 10-in-1 Primer spray. Because two out of the first three ingredients (Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, Decamethylcyclopcntasiloxane, Trimethylsiloxysilicate) are siloxanes though, which are apparently evaporative, I've heard that this spray is only protective when it's sprayed on hair shortly before using heat styling tools. I contacted Eva NYC about this and they were also vague, telling me they can only guarantee protection when the spray is used on hair right before using heat styling tools. I'm not a fan of using this spray on my dry hair because it usually leaves it feeling greasy. I've been looking at other options, but finding something that's cruelty free (non negotiable), fairly cheap (non negotiable), and cg-friendly (not a non negotiable, but would be preferable) is pretty difficult...

It has 1 silicone (dimethicone) and I think it has 5 different proteins (keratin amino acids, keratin, hydrolyzed keratin, hydrolyzed collagen, cocoyl hydrolyzed keratin) and is moisturizing\n\n\\- Apply Hask Biotin Boost Thickening Conditioner and wash it out after a few minutes. It has 3 silicones (dimethicone, dimethiconol, cyclopentasiloxane) and 1 protein (hydrolyzed collagen) and is moisturizing\n\n\\- Apply a little bit of Chi Silk Infusion Serum on wet hair as a heat protectant. It has 2 silicones (cyclopentasiloxane, dimethiconol) and 4 proteins (hydrolyzed corn protein, hydrolyzed soy protein, hydrolyzed wheat protein, hydrolyzed silk)\n\n\\- Apply sweet almond oil on ends daily for silky looking hair\n\nHere are my questions:\n\n1. Am I moisturizing my hair enough?\n\nMy hair always feels dry unless I use a leave in conditioner and oil when it's wet. I can't add water to my hair after straightening it because it'll go curly. I'm thinking of switching the Garnier and Shea Moisture conditioners with the Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Masque because it has more humectants but it only has 1 protein (hydrolyzed rice protein). What do you think of this switch? Is there a better way to make sure my hair stays moisturized?\n\n2. Am I using too many silicones?\n\nI can only use a little bit of the heat protectant because I used a normal amount last time and the hair stylist at the salon said I had to wash it out and she stripped all of the silicones from my hair, so I want to make sure that I'm using enough silicones other than just the heat protectant. I'm thinking of using 2 conditioners because I prefer the ingredients in the first one but it doesn't have enough silicones. I prefer my hair to be flat when it's straight but I don't want it to look greasy and weighed down, so is using 1 conditioner enough? If so, which conditioner is the better choice? I'll use sweet almond oil on my ends to reduce frizz after straightening my hair because it doesn't have any silicones and tolerates heat well (I'll have to go over my hair with a flat iron for a minute each morning)\n\n3. Am I using enough protein?\n\nIt looks like I listed a lot of protein, but is this truly enough? I'm getting my hair done at the salon where they'll blow dry my hair straight then go over the pieces they couldn't get with a flat iron and I can't control the heat. I can't really use low heat at home either because it takes much longer than it would if I used 200 degrees celcius in my experience\n\nMy goal is to have hair that looks silky and healthy and to retain length. I'm not very interested in retaining my curl pattern because I know it's almost impossible when I'm using this much heat\n\nThank you for reading through this long post and I would greatly appreciate any feedback on my current plan :)",

Keratin and other proteins in excess start to have the opposite effect that you want if used too often, and too many different kinds are layered. Have you tried only doing protein masks and using protein shampoo/conditioner every couple weeks, or whenever your hair feels like it needs a pick me up? I don’t have the same hair type, but I do know that protein overload with hair is very real and a lot of times people don’t realize it is an issue\nI wish you the best of luck with your hair journey!!

    "body": "Have you ever pondered the reasons behind your baby's soft and priceless skin? A parent's greatest priority is to keep their child's skin soft, smooth, and healthy. Parents are continuously looking for safe and efficient baby care products to nourish and safeguard their child's sensitive skin. Hydrolyzed rice protein is one substance that has been gaining popularity and praise for its outstanding advantages. This marvel of nature provides a variety of advantages that can improve the health of your baby's skin and hair. What is hydrolyzed rice protein, precisely, and why is it so important for your baby's skincare routine?\n\nLet's investigate this wonder element and how it can transform the way you take care of your infant.\n\nWhat is rice protein hydrolyzed?\n\nRice is the source of the potent natural substance hydrolyzed rice protein. Rice protein is hydrolyzed to create smaller molecules that are easier for the skin and hair to absorb and use. The outcome is a nutrient-rich, bioavailable substance that, when added to skincare and hair care products, offers a number of advantages.\n\nHydrolyzed rice protein is essential for skin and hair care\n\nHydrolyzed rice protein has gained popularity in the skincare and hair care industries due to its many advantages. Natural humectants like this one attract moisture from the air and trap it into the skin or hair. It makes sure that the tender skin on your newborn stays hydrated and supple. Additionally, the amino acids in hydrolyzed rice protein help to maintain the skin's natural barrier function, protecting it from outside aggressors and halting moisture loss.\n\nBenefits for Your Baby's Skin of Hydrolyzed Rice Protein\n\nThe advantages of hydrolyzed rice protein for your baby's fragile and delicate skin are excellent. First off, since dryness and irritation are major concerns in newborn skincare, its capacity to retain moisture helps prevent them. It supports keeping the skin's pH balance at its ideal level, which is essential for avoiding inflammation and discomfort. The skin is shielded from environmental aggressors by a barrier made of hydrolyzed rice protein, keeping the skin supple and soft. Additionally, its calming effects help lessen redness and inflammation, which lowers the risk of rashes. This component also helps to retain the flexibility of your baby's skin by encouraging the creation of collagen, which benefits skin health overall.\n\nEffectiveness of Rice Hydrolyzed Protein\n\nHydrolyzed rice protein has been proven to be effective in skincare products by scientific studies. The skin's outer layers can be penetrated by it thanks to its molecular structure, which also encourages the synthesis of collagen while supplying moisture and nutrients to deeper layers of the skin. It promotes long-term skin health in addition to instant hydration. According to studies, hydrolyzed rice protein strengthens the skin's defence mechanisms and promotes a smoother, more luminous complexion.\n\nBaby wash contains hydrolyzed rice protein.\n\nHydrolyzed rice protein does wonders when added to baby wash products. It has a mild cleansing effect that eliminates pollutants effectively without removing the skin's natural oils. This is especially important for your baby's delicate skin because harsh cleansers might damage the skin's layer of protection.

    "body": "Having a baby is one of the most rewarding experiences. It can be life-changing, and you’ll likely be on a rollercoaster of emotions!\n\nFrom what to feed the little ones to how to hold, bathe or clothe them, often you’ll find yourself in a confused state of mind, always figuring out what to do and how to do it. Another most intimidating thing is what to put on your baby’s delicate skin. And since the little one’s skin is 20 times thinner and more sensitive than that of an adult’s, it requires some extra TLC.\n\nWhether you’re looking for the [**best newborn bath products**](https://cittaworld.com/products/tender-foaming-baby-wash) or the best moisturizer for a newborn, you’ll find an array of options. Read on to get a clear understanding!\n\n**Key Features To Look At In Baby Bath Products**\n\nAs you know, newborns’ skin is delicate, and therefore, the products you select for them need to be as gentle and mild as possible. The choice between the [**best body wash for infants**](https://cittaworld.com/products/tender-foaming-baby-wash) and bar soap for newborns typically depends on your little one’s skin needs. Both infant body wash and bar soap can cleanse your baby’s skin effectively; however, you would need to decide on the basis of your little one’s skin preferences.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\nA thorough look at the product label will give you an idea of what ingredients are added to the [**infant body wash**](https://cittaworld.com/products/tender-foaming-baby-wash) or bar soap. Baby bath products comprising natural ingredients like coconut oil, aloe vera, and hydrolyzed rice protein, are ideal for baby skin that not just nourish but also combat post-bath dryness.\n\n**No Harmful Chemicals**\n\nAt the same time, make sure to steer clear of harmful chemicals like sulphates, phthalates, silicones, and parabens.\n\n**Skin-Friendly pH**\n\nInfant soaps and washes with a balanced pH level are important for maintaining your little one’s skin health. Opt for a bar soap or infant body wash that is neither too acidic nor too alkaline.\n\n**Moisturization**\n\nThe best bar soaps and body washes for newborns include moisturizing properties that intensely nourish the baby’s delicate skin without drying it out.\n\n**Tear-Free Formulation**\n\nWhen it comes to choosing an [**infant body wash**](https://cittaworld.com/products/tender-foaming-baby-wash) or bar soap for your little one, always make sure to check if the formulation is tear-free, as an accidental splish splash can lead to teary eyes.\n\n**Convenience & Consistency**\n\nThe [**best body washes for newborns**](https://cittaworld.com/products/tender-foaming-baby-wash) are often available with the option of a body wash foam that is both convenient and playful for babies. The foaming texture is easier to apply and rinse off since it glides effortlessly over the skin. \n\nSumming up, the best bar soaps and body washes for newborns are formulated with gentle ingredients that ensure a bath time filled with giggles. So, go ahead, and get your hands on the [**best newborn bath products**](https://cittaworld.com/products/tender-foaming-baby-wash) that will make bath time a breeze.\n\nHappy Parenting!",

        "body": "From your description it sounds like it could be protein overload.\n\nFlaxseed gel doesn't have a lot of protein, but constant use over a long period of time it would accumulate. \n\nIf that is indeed the case, then stop using protein in your routines for a while (and beware of coconut oil, it can penetrate the hair shaft and mimic the effects of protein). Protein overload is a case of imbalance against moisture, so look to use products that promote that. Products that feature oils like jojoba, argan, or even olive oil, and other hydrators like aloe vera or glycerin.\n\nLosing curl pattern is only one symptom, though. Before you take any advice from me, do a little resarch and see if other signs of protein overload also apply to you.\n\nAnd if that's the case, don't worry, it's totally reversible!",

        "body": "Any number of ingredients or combination of ingredients can be what makes your skin dislike the particular moisturiser you’re using. It’s different for everyone and tbh I don’t think many people can pinpoint in the ingredients list of their moisturisers what exactly makes their skin like or dislike a particular one, unless they have an allergy for a specific ingredient and know of it.\n\nIf you’re confident your skin/eczema doesn’t like the moisturiser you’re currently using, you need to switch to a different one. Since different moisturisers work differently for everyone and everyone’s eczema is different as well, it’s unfortunately a lengthy process of trial and error and elimination to see what works best for you and what doesn’t work at all. Try a different brand and pay extra attention to if the lotion/moisturiser is hypoallergenic, approved by dermatologists or specifically developed for sensitive, dry skin or skin prone to eczema. If one doesn’t work, switch to another until you’ve found one that does help. Good luck!!",
