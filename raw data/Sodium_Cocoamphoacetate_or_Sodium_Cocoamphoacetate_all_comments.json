    "body": "I’m about to drop a lot of information here, but please read! I learned a lot about how to properly use sulfates and silicones, so I want to share!! \n\nSo here’s what I’ve learned from Sarah Tran, who has thigh length hair. \n\nEdit: People have brought up genetics. Of course genetics is a huge factor in hair length, but the point of this post is to maintain *healthy* hair, so that it will grow with minimal breakage and split ends. I bring up her length because it is *healthy* as well as long. \n\nAlso note: silicones and sulfates won’t directly contribute to hair growth, but will make your hair stronger and less likely to break and fall out, indirectly resulting in longer fuller hair\n\nFirst off, silicones and sulfates are NOT bad. In fact, if she didn’t use silicones, she couldn’t protect her hair and have such long hair without split ends. The way most people USE silicones is bad though. \n\nThink about it like this: If you have a pair of high heels that are comfortable and you love them, but your friend asks you to go jogging, the shoes are not the problem, the *use* is.\n\nSilicones do the following: \n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair which makes it easier to detangle \n\n-Provides UV protection\n\n-Seals in moisture to prevent dryness\n\n-Makes hair look shiny\n\n-Reduces frizz and adds definition to curls\n\n-Softens and smooths cuticle\n\nSilicones do all these amazing things!!!! However, there are 4 types: airy, friendly (easy to wash out), resilient, and NO GO silicones\n\n*\n#Airy silicones: \nThese evaporate out of the hair after 10 minutes to a few hours. These do not have any negative effect on hair:\n\n-Cyclomethicone \n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n*\n#Friendly silicones:\nThese wash out of the hair with sulfate free shampoos:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate) \n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n*\n#Resilient Silicones:\nThese do NOT build up on the strand, but are non soluble and *require a sulfate* to remove:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone -Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n*\n#NO GO Silicones:\nThese require multiple washes with sulfate shampoo to remove. NEVER USE THESE!:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone \n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone \n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18 \n\n-Cetyl Phosphate \n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiylamodimethicone \n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n*\n#Mild Sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nThese are Best used to remove airy and friendly silicones and in your regular, daily mild shampoo. These do NOT remove resilient silicones. \n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n*\n#High Strength HARSH sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nTreat these exactly like harsh sulfates and avoid them when looking for a regular, daily mild sulfate-free shampoo. BEST USED FOR REMOVING RESILIENT SILICONES:\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate \n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n*\n#SULFATES that remove silicones:\nThese strong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Mild sulfates May require more applications to remove resilient silicones:\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n*\n#Also here is a list of cationic (anti-static) ingredients:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n*\n#So basically:\n\n1. Get a good sulfate free shampoo\n\n2. Get a good shampoo that HAS sulfates\n\n3. Use airy and friendly silicones ALL the time\n\n4. Use resilient silicones once or twice a month. This will protect your hair more than friendly silicones. Resilient silicones must be washed out with a SULFATE shampoo at the max FIVE DAYS AFTER APPLICATION\n\n*\n#And one last thing!!! Avoid these ingredients in hair care products: \n\nhttps://airtable.com/shrXz5xqoqRg8yKI2/tblol3s4T5YH103yY\n\nIt is hard to find a product with NONE of these ingredients, so make sure that these

        "body": "Hi! Guys please do your research and don't trust everything you hear. Having thigh length hair is a great achievement but it doesn't make someone a science expert, so posting this on a science sub is so misleading. \n\nI'm seeing some red flags. First off, no scientific sources. Second, commonly demonized ingredients in the push for \"clean\" beauty are again demonized here without proper given cause. And third, there are a few things that stuck out to me as glaringly false from what research I've done. Lastly, fourth, the phrasing at all of \"no go silicones\" and just the incorrect categorization of silicones that assigns them value (better to look at the truer category names: volatile, amine-modified, etc.)\n\nMost ingredients on that \"blacklist\" have little or absolutely no evidence of being bad. \n\nAnd the thing that strikes me as absolutely false is the list of cationic surfactabts as static causing, when most research and literature says the exact opposite - that they're anti static ingredients. Give me a minute and I'll add a few sources for the anti-static claim for cationic surfactants.\n\n> The widely used cationic surfactant docosyltrimethylammonium chloride was overall well performing, especially when it came to reduction of friction force and reduction of flyaway hair during combing. It was superior to the other cationic surfactant tested regarding reduction of frizz. This study suggests that the silicones and protein derivatives showed less promising results regarding the overall manageability. Preliminary data has implications that the efficiency of anti-frizz is correlated with cationic charge and high hydrophobicity of the conditioning agent. \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DYduaceeTnvMJ \n\n> Behentrimonium chloride and Cetrimonium chloride are known to be very effective hair conditioners with detangling, anti-frizz, and anti-static  \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D0FbAuscGO8AJ",

If the terminal length of your hair is way shorter, no amount product is going to fix that, at least not to that extent.

I know there's some research with using brown rice water (I think) to improve the terminal length, but I'm not sure how accurate it is, how much it's been tested, or the details.\n\nNot a scientist, so please correct me if I'm wrong!",

A service will give some true information, and then make other information appear overly complicated (sometimes twisting information as they go) so customers of their service will eventually get frustrated trying to figure it out (but not before giving them money). give up, and buy their \"good\" products (for more money).",

    "body": "**Background**  \n\nIn August my favorite shampoo, Hask Argan Oil Repairing Shampoo, got reformulated with ingredients I'm allergic to, so I decided it was high time to try out some AB shampoos.  One of the things I really liked about the Hask shampoo was that it cleansed thoroughly but gently, so I knew I wanted a shampoo that shared some (if not all) of the same surfactants as they can make a huge difference in the harshness of the shampoo.  I also wanted a sulfate/silicone free shampoo that had a few oils like the Hask shampoo as well.  After many nights scouring cosdna for ingredients lists, I settled on Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo.  \n\n**Product Claims/Ingredients**  \n\nMoist Diane's [website](http://www.moist-diane.jp/en/products/extra-damage.html) claims the purpose of this line is to \"restore extremely damaged hair ends and roughness\", as well as repairing hair damage when heat is applied due to the line's unique \"nano repair matrix\".  I don't heat treat my hair, nor is it permed, bleached, etc so I wasn't really drawn in by these claims. \n\nMy main draw was the [ingredients list](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_63e4326873.html):\n\n>Water, **Olefin (C14-16) sodium sulphonate**, **Cocamidopropyl betaine**, **Cocamidomethyl MEA**, Cocoyl glutamic acid TEA, Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed keratin, PEG-7 glyceryl cocoate, Myristamine oxide, Sodium cocoamphoacetate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Gamma-docosalactone, Quaternium-18, Quaternium-33, **Cholesterol**, **Ceramide EOP**, **Ceramide NG**, **Ceramide NP**, **Ceramide AG**, **Ceramide AP**, Propylene glycol, Hydrolyzed keratin, **Argania spinosa kernel oil**, Mango seed oil, Theobroma grandiflorum seed butter, Prune seed extract, Carapa guaianensis seed oil, Sclerocarya birrea seed oil, **Baobab seed oil**, Opuntia Ficus-Indica seed oil, Steardimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed keratin, Pouteria sapota seed oil, Keratin, Isostearoyl hydrolyzed keratin, Alanine, Hydroxyproline, Sodium-PCA, Cetearamidoethyl diethonium hydrolyzed rice protein, **Sodium Hyaluronate**, Hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate, **Hydrolyzed hyaluronate**, **Hydrolyzed honey protein**, Malus domestica fruit cell culture extract, Argania spinosa sprout cell extract, Rhododendron ferrugineum leaf cell culture extract, **Collagen**, Hydrolyzed conchiolin, Bis-ethoxydiglycol cyclohexane 1,4-dicarboxylate, Propanediol, Dipropylene glycol, Butylene glycol, Isomalt, Polyquaternium-10, Isononyl isononanoate, Soybean sterols, Sodium chloride, Xanthan gum, Lecithin, Behentrimonium chloride, Glycerin, Citric acid, **Lactic acid**, Tocopherol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Aroma, Caramel \n\nBold indicates ingredients that my face likes or surfactants that are the same (or very similar) to the Hask shampoo.  Wow.  Five ceramides plus cholesterol, some nice oils (including baobab!!!), and some HA and collagen thrown in?  Yeah.  I like it.  \n\n**Performance**\n\nThis shampoo is a dream.  It lathers richly, which feels great, and it also has a mild fragrance (generic bubble bath scent) that is noticeable while using it but fades very quickly.  It comes in a large pump bottle, which is genius for shampoo and so much easier than fiddling with a squeeze tube.\n\nI have a naturally oily scalp that needs daily washing.  My scalp gets flaky if I use a shampoo that's too harsh, or if it gets super dry in the winter.  I've had no problems with flakiness since starting this shampoo and my scalp overall feels more hydrated and strong.  My hair also feels stronger and is glossier than it has been in a while.  I used to use Hask's argan oil hair mask 2-3x weekly, but I haven't felt the need to do so since starting this shampoo. \n\nI've also used this as a body wash since I ran out a month ago and thought why not share the goodness of this shampoo with all of my body skin. My skin is hydrated and appreciates the extra pampering.  \n\nFor curiosity's sake, I tested the pH with my aquarium drop test kit.  It's a narrow range test kit so it only shows 6.0 to 7.5, with anything below or above those values showing as a 6 or 7.5 respectively.  However, I'm not going to use anything above a 6.5 so it works for my purposes.  Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo comes in at a 6.0 or below, which is awesome so I'm considering testing it on my face because YOLO.\n\n**Verdict**\n\nI have been using this shampoo daily since September and I will continue using it for my hair and body until they reformulate it or discontinue it. **HG**\n\n**Where to find it**\n\nI bought mine off Amazon prime for $15, although it's no longer available on Prime.  You can also find it and the refill pouches for a similar price on Ebay or Amazon Japan. Edit: and Dokodemo",

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

They often end in -ate or “glucoside”.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or “methosulfate” (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application.

Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt’s best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the “feeling” of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this “protein overload” is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it’s wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

I started trying this cream in the peak of winter in extremely dry temperature. It made me break out pretty much the next morning. The pimples were painful and took 2 weeks to subside. This cream and cleanser were the only additions to my routine. I stopped the cream for a while, and continued using the cleanser and my usual routine. However, every time I would use the cream it would aggravate and break me out. But, it worked WONDERS on dry patches on my feet and elbow. So I think this would be good for very very dry skin. But it felt way too heavy for my oily/normal skin. ***WNRP***.",

WATER (AQUA). GLYCERIN. DISODIUM COCO-GLUCOSIDE CITRATE. DECYL GLUCOSIDE. SODIUM COCOAMPHOACETATE. PENTYLENE GLYCOL. AQUAPHILUS DOLOMIAE FERMENT FILTRATE. ARGININE. CITRIC ACID. COPPER SULFATE. SODIUM CHLORIDE. TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE. TROMETHAMINE. XANTHAN GUM. ZINC SULFATE\n\n**Size / Cost:** £7.99 per 200ml\n\n**Texture/Feel:** Blue, watery gel, very light foam, no fragrance\n\n**Review:**\n\nA bit about my skin for context: I have hypersensitive skin that does not tolerate most cosmetics, rosacea & periorbital dermatitis flare-ups and mild acne. Combination skin with dry cheeks and oily t-zone.\n\nFor my skin type, I've been recommended lightweight cream cleansers, but most will irritate me or leave a residue that flares my dermatitis.\n\nI was a big fan of Avene Tolerance Cleansing Emulsion before it was discontinued. My rosacea to the new formula of Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Cleanser, Avene Cleansing Foam and I was stripped red raw by all of their other gel cleansers, so I was scared to try this but I'm very pleasantly surprised.\n\nThis feels extremely gentle and non-stripping due to gentle surfactants and a heavy dose of glycerin. It works both on my dry cheeks and oily forehead.\n\nIt contains copper sulfate (which give it its blue colour) and zinc sulfate, both of which have antimicrobial properties, and I've found that it helped to flatten small breakouts on my forehead and chin. It also works to calm periorbital dermatitis around my eyes, maybe due to the anti-inflammatory action of both of these ingredients.\n\nOverall, I'm loving this **10/10**, and I've found it gentler than cult favourites Balea Wash Gel and Bioderma Sensibio Gel Cleanser.",

I suppose cleanser is an easy step for everyone else but for me its one of the hardest to find one that works without clogging me (can’t have residue), cleansing properly (or my pores clog by itself) or destroying my skin (my barrier is easily cleansed away). Also a 10/10 from me. \n\nI guess now we have two people talking about this here 👌🏼",

    "body": "So in my last post I laid out my recipe, but hadn't tried it yet. When I was actually getting ready to make this, I tweaked an ingredient and made an addition of a few other things. The recipe I used is\n\n\n\nHEATED PHASE\n\n30% BTMS-50 \n\n20% Cetyl alcohol \n\n29.4% cocoa butter \n\n4% jojoba oil\n\n\n\nWATER/COOLDOWN PHASE\n\n10% Sodium cocoamphoacetate \n\n0.1% tetrasodium EDTA \n\n0.5% mixed tocopherols \n\n0.5% liquid germall plus \n\n4% daikon seed extract \n\n1% panthenol \n\n1.5% fragrance oil\n\n\nI melted down my heated phase and thatbwas fine. Took really long but I expected that. When I was measuring out my cooldown/water phase, I accidentally added my EDTA to the beaker with my preservative, vitamin e, daikon seed extract, panthenol, pretty much everything but my surfactant. I was like WHY WONT THIS DISSOLVE and then I remembered the EDTA was supposed to go in the beaker with my SCA. So because i didn't want to risk there being any EDTA crystals in my final product, i mixed everything together. Once my heated phase was melted, i waited for it to cool to 115F. I stirred and checked the temperature constantly. Liquid germall plus can be added when formulations are cooler than 122, but I didn't want to risk it so I waited a bit longer. Upon adding everything, my mix seized up a bit, but I kept stirring and the residual heat made everything uniform again. I poured it into my mold and let it set for a few hours. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/vWHgnnN\n\n\n\nmy last post: https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/comments/im7ki5/i_want_to_make_a_simple_cowash_bar_how_does_this/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share",

Currently for Rs. 269/-. I had bought it as a trial from Smytten\n\n**Key Ingredients as per the brand:** Cherry Blossom, Charcoal Powder, Tea Tree, Aloe Vera leaf juice.\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua\n Decyl Glucoside \nLauryl Sarcosinate\nCarbomer\nPhenoxyethanol\nSugar\nPropane Glycol\nGlycerine\nSodium Cocoamphoacetate\nDMDM Hydantoin\nPolyquat 10\nEDTA\nAloe Vera Leaf Juice\nActivated Charcoal Powder\nTea Tree essential oil\nPeppermint essential oil\nCherry blossom essential oil\n\n**Claims:** Paraben free, cruelty free, formulated with 100% natural ingredients\n\n**Texture:** Black liquid\n\n**Packaging:** Tube/Bottle\n\n**Usage:** For a few weeks\n\n**My Experience:** This was my first attempt at a charcoal based product. The idea that it removes blackheads & whiteheads from a mere face wash drew me in. But sadly, this didn’t do anything. \n\nI know that pores don’t open or close, but this facewash made me think as if they are opening wide. My skin looked weird. This facewash felt harsh, stinged my eyes that eventually I threw it away. \n\nI’ve gotta ask, Is it worth trying a charcoal based products or are they all farce?\n\n\n**➡️Plum Green Tea Pore Cleansing Wash**\n\n**MRP:** Rs. 495/- for 120 ml\n\n**Key Ingredients as per the brand:** Glycolic Acid, Green Tea Extracts, Natural Cellulose Beads\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua (Water), Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Carbomer, Cellulose, Cocamide DEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fda Approved Colours, Fragrance, Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate\n\n**Claims:** Free of parabens, SLS & mineral oil, vegan, cruelty free. Suited for oily, acne prone, combination skin\n\n**Texture:** Transparent liquid with green granules type beads\n\n**Packaging:** Tube\n\n**Usage:** A few times\n\n**My Experience:** It was pretty okay. I didn’t enjoy either the fragrance or the texture. It has tiny green granules, granules not beads that usually absorb into your skin on pressing between your fingers. Due to it, it has felt like a mild scrub than a facewash and I’m not comfortable using a scrub like product on my face daily.\n\nIt also felt mildly harsh on my skin, which is why after a few uses, I was easily turned off. \n\nI still have the product left, that I’m now using to clean makeup brushes. It might work on other skins, but not for me. \n\n**➡️Re’equil Fruit AHA Face Wash**\n\n**MRP:** Rs. 490/- for 200 ml\n\n**Key Ingredients as per the brand:** Fruit AHAs\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Decyl Glucoside, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Aqua, Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/​Leaf Extract, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Betaine, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Glycerin, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzotriazolyl Butylphenol Sulfonate, Buteth-3, Tributyl Citrate, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Ci 19140, Ci 45100\n\n**Claims:** Free of parabens, sulphates, silicones & mineral oil.\n \n**Texture:** Yellow coloured fluid. (almost looks like Pee)\n\n**Fragrance:** No fragrance\n\n**Packaging:** Bottle\n\n**Usage:** A few times\n\n**My Experience:** This is the harshest facewash I’ve ever used in my life. The texture is so watery but generates foam easily after coming in contact with water. However, after every wash, my skin felt very tight, which  is why after a few washes, I stopped using it.\n\nSeeing as I still had some product left, I decided to use it instead of shower gel. Damn, My skin felt so smooth after first wash that since then, I’ve been using them as Shower gels for Bath. \n\nI wouldn’t recommend this facewash to anyone seeing how harsh it was compared to other facewash. So think before you buy.\n\n_________________\n\nThanks for reading 💕",

    "body": "Hello everyone! I've known this thread for a while but this is my first post - I'm so happy with my new routine/new beautiful skin that I need to share it with other skincare junkies (and maybe help some of you!).\n\nOkay so first, how my skin was BEFORE:\n\n* Oily \n\n* Extremely sensitive, I have very thin fair skin\n\n* PIH (mostly from picking)\n\n* Mild facial acne  - I'm in my 20s and I struggle with a bit of hormonal acne, mostly blackheads/whiteheads on forehead, chin and jaw. I had moderate acne during my teens\n\n* Annoying, persistent bacne\n\n\nNow, after the change in regimen:\n\n* Still oily, sensitive\n\n* Almost zero blackheads\n\n* Just the odd zit when I'm on my period\n\n* Bacne is all but gone\n\n\nMy complete regimen:\n\n[Skin]\n\nAM\n\n* *Wash*: **Eucerin DermoPurifyer Gel Cleanser**. I absolutely LOVE this stuff, cleanses well without leaving the skin tight. Personally I think it's because they use Sodium Cocoamphoacetate (a much milder cleansing agent) as the main surfactant and SLES down the list as the 4th ingredient. It's also fragrance-free which is a must for me.\n\n* *Treatments*: **The Ordinary Alpha Arbutin + HA ** for PIH and **The Ordinary Niacinamide + Zinc** for breakouts. From the bottom of my heart, I think The Ordinary is fantastic and I wish them a long prosperous life. I also had their **HA + B5** serum, but unfortunately I broke the bottle. All serums were fabulous for everyday use and I will repurchase the 3 of them soon (plus might add some Vitamin C and Lactic Acid to the cart, because why not). I could elaborate more on each one but I don't want to make this too long, so ask away if you're curious about them specifically. \n\n* *Oils*: facial oils are a new discovery for me and I really like them. There's a shop here in Paris called AromaZone which sells natural beauty products for really cheap, so I got 5 different types of oils (tiny bottles of 10ml though) for I think 13 euros total (15 USD?). I purposely choose oils with high linoleic/linolenic acid content because after some research I found out that high oleic acid oils (such as olive oil) tend to be comedogenic, plus acne-prone skin tends to have more oleic acid in their natural sebum so it's beneficial to try and balance it out ([this](http://www.labmuffin.com/why-linoleic-acid-and-rosehip-oil-might-fix-your-skin/) article explains it well). The ones I got were: **rosehip** oil, **maracuja** oil (most times I'll just use a blend of these two because they're the least smelly ones), **safflower** oil, **kukui** oil and **evening primrose** oil (despite the name, this one smells gross). This has been saving my skin from the horrible Parisian winter, although I haven't tested it in hot/humid weather yet so I can't tell if it works year round. Basically I wake up with glowing and soft skin every morning and any scabs from dead pimples will go away in a matter of days (useful because I'm a recovering picker).\n\n* *Makeup*: I don't bother too much with buying cosmetics that are non comedogenic or aimed at acne prone skin, partly because in my experience they make no difference. What I found that actually improved my skin was using less of it - instead of plastering my face with primer, foundation, concealer and powder all over, I decided to just spot conceal or maybe use a bit of foundation MIXED WITH primer (to thin it out) if say there's a large area with redness I want to cover. I know this is not possible for everyone, especially if you have severe acne/PIH, but even in those cases I think sometimes we overapply in areas where the skin is not as bad, and just end up making things worse.\n\nAs for the products, I currently use **Hourglass Veil** primer, **NARS Sheer Glow** foundation, **Laura Mercier Secret Camouflage** concealer (great stuff) and **Hylamide Pore Delete** on top of makeup for oiliness (points for Deciem on yet another great product). I'm coveting the Bobbi Brown stick foundation as well because they have good coverage and a perfect color match for me - no easy feat for my very very fair skin.\n\nMoving along - when I get back home:\n\n**PM**\n\n* *Wash*: If i have a lot of makeup on (say, I wore foundation and powder, or mascara/eye makeup), I'll **double cleanse** with one of my facial oils mentioned above (usually safflower oil because I bought a bigger bottle), then remove the excess with toilet paper and use the aforementioned Eucerin DermoPurifyer WITH MY **CLARISONIC**. TBH I don't know how anyone serious about washing off makeup can live without one (or equivalent brush from whatever brand).\n\n* *Mud mask*: I actually take a long bath every night after arriving home, this is the moment I take to relax, read a book/magazine et cetera. So I mix some **Kaolin clay** with water, and usually throw some **Colloidal oatmeal powder** in there as well (it's reportedly anti-inflammatory and makes for a fluffier, smoother consistency in the mask). I use Kaolin rather than any other clay because it's the one with lower pH I have access to, other types such as Bentonite clay are more alkaline and therefore can disrupt your skin's natural pH (which is acidic). More on the subject [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/19i8w1/psa_aztec_secret_aka_calcium_bentonite_clay/).\n\n* *Treatment*: if I feel a pimple coming I'll do The Ordinary Niacinamide + Zinc first, but usually I just use my acids at night. I'm currently using **Azelaic Acid** - which I adore and works so well for my sensitive skin - BUT be warned that you have to take it slow with this one or your face will be in flames. I actually started using it every day or every other day *diluted in a bit of water*, eventually grew to using it twice a day without water and now I'd say I'm in \"maintenance phase\" using it just at night undilluted. I think azelaic acid was largely responsible for solving my blackheads issue, it really cleans up the pores like nothing else I've used. I have it in two brands, **The Ordinary 10% Azelaic acid** and **Azelan 15% gel cream** from Bayer (a brief Google research tells me Azelan is called Finacea in the US). The one from The Ordinary is definitely milder so whenever I feel like my skin is irritated or reactive I'll stick to it, or conversely if my skin is congested I'll use the 15% one.\n\n* *Oils* on top\n\n\n\n[Diet]\n\nOkay so arguably the least exciting part, which I'm sorry to inform is probably the most effective one. I became vegan (don't close the tab), cut down on alcohol and added lots of vegetables to my diet. After that, my bacne is gone - I know that's the reason why because I don't apply any products to my back - and my hormonal zits during my period became ONE single tiny zit which will go away in a couple of days. So yeah, no dairy/meat/eggs + little to no alcohol + almost no refined sugar/wheat (I eat bread or dessert maybe once a week) + plenty of veggies = good skin for life.\n\nThat's what did it for me! What do you think? Comments/suggestions/questions/complaints?",

    "body": "Hey guys. Balea MED Ultra Sensitive Waschgel is a very famous product among people who has very sensitive and dry skin. They all swore that this product is their holy grail and a must in their routine. I have a **combination-oily acne prone skin, suffered fungal acne** and still is, but decided to give this product a try. The product is gel-textured and really nice on your skin. It has no fragrance, which is essential in my everyday routine. It should left my skin hydrated but unfortunately this product does not agree with my skin. My skin doesn't like it very much because somehow after rinsing off the cleanser, my skin feels a bit tight and a bit itchy. I believe this is due to the ingredients in the product that can aggravate fungal acne.\n\nHere are the ingredients:\n\nAQUA, GLYCERIN, COCAMIDOPROPYL HYDROXYSULTAINE, METHYLPROPANEDIOL, SODIUM ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, SODIUM CHLORIDE, PANTHENOL, BISABOLOL, SODIUM COCOAMPHOACETATE, POLYGLYCERYL-4 CAPRATE, COCO-GLUCOSIDE, **~~GLYCERYL OLEATE~~**, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, **~~SODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE~~**, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, CITRIC ACID, **~~HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE~~**, TOCOPHEROL.\n\nThe bolded and strikedthrough ingredients may be the culprit behind the aggravation of fungal acne. Until now I can't stop scratching cheeks and forehead lightly. URGH\n\nThese are my honest review, like always you guys should take it with a grain of salt. I'm not against this product, it's just that my skin hates it.\n\nDifferent people have different reaction to different products. Find one that suits you.\n\nIf you still haven't found your holy grail, don't worry. Be thankful for the journey of finding them, because you will learn a lot, not only about which ingredient is good or bad, but also discovering about yourself and building your mental strength :)\n\n(No worries tho, I've given the cleanser to my boyfriend who has combination dry skin, and his skin is loving it, so it's a win-win situation here)",

    "body": "**Introduction**  \nTom Busby is a guy over at the forum [rosaceagroup.org](https://rosaceagroup.org/). He has researched skin conditions, mainly seborrheic dermatitis and malasezzia related skin conditions, for years and he has cured his life long condition through his homemade lotions and cleansers. Through the years he has shared his recipes and research on the forums, mainly in his own thread where he goes over different treatments and his own experiences: [Link](https://rosaceagroup.org/The_Rosacea_Forum/showthread.php?28667-Seborrheic-Dermatitis-amp-Folliculitis-Review-of-OTC-Treatments-for-Malassezia) The whole thread is worth a read\n\nNow that he has years of experimenting and experience behind him he doesn't believe his formulas will change, and he has also started selling his products. You can contact him through email or wait until he sets up his own website to sell his products, which he said will happen in a couple of months.\n\nEach product cost 35$ + shipping. I've been using them for just over a week, not really long enough to write a proper review, so this is more of a first impressions post. I'll try to keep it pretty brief, so just ask questions below if you want to know anything.\n\n**The Lotion**  \nIngredients:  \nDistilled water, Caprylic/capric triglycerides, Niacinamide & dl-Panthenol (proVitamins), Glycerin, Olive Squalane oil, Cetearyl alcohol 30/70 NF (thickener), Sodium Hyaluronate, HMW, & Ceramide complex, (skin quality improve-ment), Ceteareth 20 & Glyceryl stearate (emulsifiers), Toco-phersolan & Retinyl palmitate (Vitamins E & A), Piroctone olamine (anti-demodectic), Climbazole (anti-fungal), Microcrystalline wax, OptiMSM, Isopropanol, Glyceryl caprylate, Phenoxyethanol, Benzoic acid, & Dehydroacetic acid (preservatives). 5.5 pH\n\nA ton of great ingredients, climbazole working as an antifungal and piroctone olamine working as an antifungal and also against demodex. No oils which malasezzia can metabolize and also a ton of other great ingredients for general skin improvement.\n\nThe lotion is a bit runny, which makes it very easy to spread across the face. It's a bit oily at first,  but it soaks great into the skin and dries pretty matte. It has no perfume, it smells a bit of alcohol. It isn't as moisturizing as for example cerave cream or other rich moisturizer, but it works great for my skin. Thick moisturizer makes my skin all shiny and breaks me out, this leaves my skin feeling like I am wearing nothing. I've tried dozens of moisturizers over the years, and even without thinking about the antifungals, this is probably the best moisturizer I've tried. I just need a little bit to cover my entire face and because of the large bottle this will probably last for months.\n\n**The shampoo**  \nIngredients:  \nDistilled water, Decyl glucoside, Cocobetaine, Sodium cocoamphoacetate, Sodium lauryol lactylate, (surfactants), Niacinamide and dl-Panthenol (pro-Vitamins), Olive Squalane oil, Sodium hyaluronate, HMW, and Ceramide complex, (skin quality improvement), Tocophersolan and Retinyl palmitate (Vitamins E & A), Piroctone olamine (anti-demodectic), Acrylates C10-30 cross-polymer, Climbazole (anti-fungal), Citric acid, Di-PPG-2 myreth-10 adipate (solubilizer), OptiMSM, Isopropanol, Glyceryl caprylate, Methylene blue, Phenoxyethanol, Benzoic acid, and Dehydroacetic acid (preservatives). 5.5 pH\n\nThis also contains a ton of great ingredients and no bad oils. I just use it as a foaming facial cleanser. It foams up pretty well, and it has a low pH. Because it is a foaming cleanser it is a bit drying, so using it without the moisturizer is probably a bad idea.\n\n**How to use and results**  \nReading Tom's posts at the forums he has some guidelines on how to use the products. Once a day I wet my face in the sink, then I foam up the cleanser and rub it into my face. Then i wait a few minutes and step into the shower and properly rinse it of. When i step out of the shower i tap-dry my face and apply the lotion on my face.\n\nFrom the first day my face started to shed dead skin. A lot of white flakes appeared on the center of my face and beard area. This might sound worrying, but according to Tom this is great. He is an older guy, so it took him over 5 months for his skin to return to normal, but because I am pretty young I should expect faster results. My skin seems to get less flaky every day, and i just rub the flakes of with my fingers and apply more moisturizer if they are visible.\n\nMy skin is less red and the products also seem to work well for my acne. It remains to be seen how the products work long term, but right now I am happy to have a solid routine that should kill of the fungus on my face causing my seborrheic dermatitis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o0acvbn1a1721.jpg?width=3336&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d824cd13feea43386925fe49c5793cb62db4cb6c",

        "body": "Great thorough review SelectAge.\n\nI bought the lotion and shampoo at the same time as SelectAge (after SelectAges post here on /r/sebderm that Tom had started selling it) and have also been using it for a week. At first I noticed, just like SelectAge, my skin flaking but also my face turned red. But both of these symptoms are supposed to be good since it is a natural reaction for your skin as the skin is fighting the sebderm. After a couple of days my skin has gotten less and less red and flaky. \n\nI'm also pretty young (27) so I expect my skin to react faster than Tom's did. Also he added an ingredient since he used it that he thinks may make it 25% faster than it was for him.\n\nMy routine is just like SelectAge, I mostly use it for my face, but sometimes I use the shampoo for my hair/top body as well but I don't use it often enough to review how good it works on my scalp. It doesn't bug me as much as the sebderm on my face.\n\nAs SelectAge said, it is a good idea to use the shampoo as a cleanser before applying the moisturizer to thoroughly cleanse your skin before putting on the lotion.\n\nIt feels like I am just repeating everything SelectAge has said already, but I will also keep updating how it goes for me. Hopefully I will know for sure in just a month or two if it going in the right direction for me:)\n\nIf you are interested in this product I'd suggest you read up a lot on Tom's research and then contact Tom on either the forum or through his mail which I think is accessible through his post which is posted on 4th of december in the forum thread which SelectAge linked. He has a 'product information file' which he sent me so I'd suggest you ask Tom for it if you are interested. I don't want to share it here without asking Tom so I'd suggest you just ask Tom for it:)\n\nHopefully we'll both get better and better SelectAge *hopeful*",

        "body": "Small follow up to my treatment. According to Tom's research an increase in flaking is a reaction to the immune system responding to the fungus. When you start using an anti-fungal the immune system becomes aware of the fungal invaders and the symptoms flare up. After around 10 days of treatment the flaking is now very minimal, but redness, especially in the inner cheek region, which in first seemed to decrease, is now a bit worse. I have been kind of scrubbing the shampoo into my face, so I am going to try applying it a bit more gently in case the redness is just normal skin irritation.   \n\n\nI've experienced the same increase in redness when using antifungals like lotrimin ultra and terbinafine previously, so I am not really worried, and still optimistic about the treatment. The initial increase in flaking should be an indication that the product is working, an increase in redness is also to be expected. Curious to see if the redness will eventually fade.",

I use it about three times a week.\n\nGeek & Gorgous Hydration Station\n\nWater, C15-19 Alkane, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG/ PPG/ Polybutylene Glycol-8/ 5/ 3 Glycerin, Isosorbide Dicaprylate, Ectoin, Xylitylglucoside, Bisabolol, Allantoin, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/ VP Copolymer, Glucose, Citric Acid, Tocopherol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol\n\nVery moisturising for a moisturiser geared towards oily skin and it doesn’t break me out.  Great for winter.\n\nBioderma Sebium Sensitive\n\nAqua/Water, Glycerin, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Dipropylene Glycol, Zinc Gluconate, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Sodium Polyacrylate, Glycyrrhetinic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Bakuchiol, Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Sodium Metabisulfite, Rhamnose, Ginkgo Biloba Leaf Extract, Tocopherol, Fructooligosaccharides, Fragrance (Parfum).\n\nLight moisturiser, it’s fragranced but I don’t mind this particular scent (kind of fresh). Actually feels soothing on the skin, but only 30 ml. \n\nBonus:\n\nPurito Daily Soft Touch Sunscreen\n\nWater, Propanediol, Dibutyl Adipate, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Amylopectin, Butylene Glycol, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Glycerin, Behenyl Alcohol, Poly C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Disterarate, Sodium Acrylates Crosspolymer-2, Carbomer, Tromethamine, Decyl Glucoside, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Alpha-Bisabolol, Panthenol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Centella Asiatica Extract, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Ceramide NP, Dipropylene Glycol, Cholesterol, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceramide AS, Ceramide AP, Ceramide NS, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ceramide EOP\n\nThis sunscreen is not technically safe (esters), but for some reason it works for me. I have tried a LOT of sunscreens and they break me out, makes me shiny, dehydrates etc. The finish is not matte, but not shiny on me when in sinks in. And it doesn’t break me out!",

    "body": "**Essenherb Tea Tree Cleansing Water**\n\nCleansing waters are kind of a new category for me. I used the Neogen Real Cica Micellar Cleansing Water back in May which was my first ever. So, I don’t have a ton to go off of when it comes to comparisons. And for the most part...that product from Neogen and the Essenherb Cleansing Water were pretty similar in application and cleansing.\n\nThe Essenherb Tea Tree Cleansing Water features coconut based surfactants that help to remove impurities like makeup and sunscreen. I tend to use cleansing waters in the AM in place of an oil cleanser or even water/foaming cleanser if I’m feeling particularly lazy lol. I also found them to be helpful in the PM when removing sunscreen from the eye area when an oil cleanser might cause stinging/blurring if put too close to the eyes.\n\nFeatured ingredients include Tea Tree Leaf Extract, Anise Fruit Extract, Tea Tree Leaf Oil, Centella Asiatica Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, and Chamomile Flower Extract, Peppermint and Aloe Extract also make the list.\n\nYou could probably guess...the scent here is of tea tree lol! It’s something that I find refreshing but does remind me of the acne focused skincare I used in my teens. I could see some people not liking it too much.\n\nAs a cleansing water...this product performed just fine for me. I found it to do a decent job of removing excess oil/sebum from the night before and I never really noticed any residue left behind. It just...did its job lol! \n\nBut, one ingredient that makes it fairly high on the list that I didn’t mention is Witch Hazel. Even though I don’t have a ton of personal experience with this ingredient...I know there are people that avoid it due to its potential drying/astringent effect.\n\nI can say that over time I found the Essenherb Tea Tree Cleansing Water to be a bit drying after use. Not much...but there was a definite difference in the feel of my skin as compared to the Neogen Cleansing Water I used earlier this year. It honestly wasn’t anything that my hydrating toner couldn’t pick up the slack for. But, those with particularly dry skin may want to proceed with caution.\n\nOverall, I didn’t hate this cleansing water. It just seems like something that is really geared towards oily/acne prone skin with its tea tree/Witch Hazel formula. While I do tend to fall into that category more often than not...I didn’t love the slightly drying effect and would much rather use something more “neutral” for this step.\n\nI look forward to continuing my “journey” into cleansing waters. I have two more in my stash that seem to be more focused on hydration/calming alongside cleansing rather than oil reduction or acne fighting. We shall see…\n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Allantoin, Caprylyl Glycol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Illicium Verum (Anise) Fruit Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Centella Asiatica Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract\n\nWhere To Buy (Facetory $25.00 USD): https://www.facetory.com/products/essenherb-tea-tree-cleansing-water\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0xypq1scchd51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff62380bf82fb4b8781bfefbabc9d865e7e84d48",

(sometimes, I have the feeling it will only end with the inevitable decline in testosterone that awaits us all, but I digress...)\n\nFor the last 2 months, I've been religiously doing **NOTHING** about my skin.  \n\\- Sleeping in the same dirty pillowcase (y, gross...)  \n\\- No moisturizer, toner, active, clay mask or whatever.  \n\\- Only using the same BODY cleanser to wash my face once a day and that's it.  \n\n\nThese are the ingredients in the body cleanser I used (**Douche Soin Corine de Farme KIDS 2en1 Corps & Cheveux**) : *Aqua, Lauryl Glucoside, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Glycerin, Parfum, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Citric Acid, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Coco-Glucoside, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Aloe Barbadensis Extract\\*, Viola Tricolor Extract\\*.*  \n\n\nDespite this one being marketed toward kids, it made my 28 yo skin tight, dry and flaky even on the first use. No surprise there, as it happens with every cleanser (even the most gentle ones) if I don't moisturize afterward.  \n\n\nRESULT : **not a single pimple in 2 months.** Skin would get dry and flaky, then oily... and that's it.  \nI'd gladly keep this weird new routine, but fine lines started to show more as a side effect of dryness. So I started to moisturize again 2 days ago (LRP Toleriane Sensitive Cream) and... pimples are back.  \n\n\n**TLDR ; What would be the more minimalist, simplest moisturizer to avoid breaking out ? I've read about Sebamed Gel and ordered it but it looks loaded to me (12 ingredients, Propylene glycol, Vit B5...)**  \n\n\nPure squalene oil, The ordinary HA + moisturizing, aquaphor are already out of the equation. Dimethicone / panthenol are also out.  \n\n\nThanks for reading and answering :)",

I was intrigued by the fat water toner when I saw the pictures, everything else was “meh” to me. I’ve already got a holy grail cleanser and I’m not one for a 2 in 1 sunscreen/moisturizer. Upon seeing the ingredients and reviews yesterday, I was turned off by the witch hazel in the toner. I do appreciate this line and the conscious efforts with the packaging and I think it’s great for people who are just getting started with skincare or are intimidated by the amount of products out there. Although I won’t be buying any of it, I’m excited to see what else she comes out with.",

    "body": "**Essenherb Tea Tree Cleansing Water**\n\nCleansing waters are kind of a new category for me. I used the Neogen Real Cica Micellar Cleansing Water back in May which was my first ever. So, I don’t have a ton to go off of when it comes to comparisons. And for the most part...that product from Neogen and the Essenherb Cleansing Water were pretty similar in application and cleansing.\n\nThe Essenherb Tea Tree Cleansing Water features coconut based surfactants that help to remove impurities like makeup and sunscreen. I tend to use cleansing waters in the AM in place of an oil cleanser or even water/foaming cleanser if I’m feeling particularly lazy lol. I also found them to be helpful in the PM when removing sunscreen from the eye area when an oil cleanser might cause stinging/blurring if put too close to the eyes.\n\nFeatured ingredients include Tea Tree Leaf Extract, Anise Fruit Extract, Tea Tree Leaf Oil, Centella Asiatica Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, and Chamomile Flower Extract, Peppermint and Aloe Extract also make the list.\n\nYou could probably guess...the scent here is of tea tree lol! It’s something that I find refreshing but does remind me of the acne focused skincare I used in my teens. I could see some people not liking it too much.\n\nAs a cleansing water...this product performed just fine for me. I found it to do a decent job of removing excess oil/sebum from the night before and I never really noticed any residue left behind. It just...did its job lol! \n\nBut, one ingredient that makes it fairly high on the list that I didn’t mention is Witch Hazel. Even though I don’t have a ton of personal experience with this ingredient...I know there are people that avoid it due to its potential drying/astringent effect.\n\nI can say that over time I found the Essenherb Tea Tree Cleansing Water to be a bit drying after use. Not much...but there was a definite difference in the feel of my skin as compared to the Neogen Cleansing Water I used earlier this year. It honestly wasn’t anything that my hydrating toner couldn’t pick up the slack for. But, those with particularly dry skin may want to proceed with caution.\n\nOverall, I didn’t hate this cleansing water. It just seems like something that is really geared towards oily/acne prone skin with its tea tree/Witch Hazel formula. While I do tend to fall into that category more often than not...I didn’t love the slightly drying effect and would much rather use something more “neutral” for this step.\n\nI look forward to continuing my “journey” into cleansing waters. I have two more in my stash that seem to be more focused on hydration/calming alongside cleansing rather than oil reduction or acne fighting. We shall see…\n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Allantoin, Caprylyl Glycol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Illicium Verum (Anise) Fruit Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Centella Asiatica Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract\n\nWhere To Buy (Facetory $25.00 USD): https://www.facetory.com/products/essenherb-tea-tree-cleansing-water\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/akgtnwh7chd51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ad4471a97891d425aaf7390f120cf0d095fb6cd4",

    "body": "Below is a list I have compiled of all of the chemicals used in industrial manufacturing of everything from food to hygiene products that are derived from coconut and/or palm. There are a lot of products on the market that contain a lot of chemicals, many of which have by now become familiar sights in ingredients lists. There are an awful lot of them derived from coconut and palm exclusively, but there are also a lot of them that can be derived from other sources. There isn't any regulation currently in place (at least in the United States, that I am aware of) that requires manufacturers to disclose the source of their chemicals, which can lead to a lot of companies falsely claiming that their products are coconut and/or palm free, when they are just the opposite. Some of the chemicals you will see are things like Vitamin A-palmitate. This one in particular can be tricky as it can be found naturally in beef fat, or it can be derived from coconut or palm plants. You see it a lot in milk, particularly milk that is 2% or less milk fat, which would make you think that it is derived from beef fat, but when you start digging, you find out that it is far more readily available (and therefore cheaper for dairies to buy in the quantities they use) to acquire a palm derived version. Now, devil's advocate here, it may be simply that the dairies do not actually know that they are adding a palm derived product into their milk, as they are likely going through a bulk supplier.\n\nI have also come to realize that there are a lot of companies who advertise things as being coconut and/or palm free and are completely unaware that the chemicals they use come from those sources.

    "body": "# Recommended Product Ingredients\n\n​I always have clients review their hair care routine with me during appointments, which helps me recommend better products for their needs. The most common issue people share is experiencing a loss of effectiveness in their products over time. This results from a need to balance cleaning your hair with moisturizing it. Below I've provided a guide to help balance your hair care routine based on the recommendations I usually give my clients, complete with a list of the most effective ingredients for each category. I purposely left non-detergents (soaps) off of the list because they use oils to remove contaminants, which I've found does not clean hair as well.  (This is the full blog but if you want to screenshot the ingredient lists the post is a bit better organized on my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-recommended-product-ingredients.html))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Surfactant Cleanser **Definition:** Surfactant cleansers are detergents or cleaning agents. They work by surrounding and lifting residue off of the hair strand so water can rinse it away. On a product's ingredient list you generally see them listed towards the top. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Detoxes, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used by all hair types. Helpful for oily hair. See [How Often Should I Shampoo?](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html) ​for frequency.\\*\\*Ingredients:\\*\\*​\n\n* Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n* Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n* Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n* Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n* Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n* Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n* Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n* Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate \n* Ammonium lauryl sulfate ​\n* Ammonium laureth sulfate\n* Sodium polystyrene sulfonate\n* Cocamidopropyl betaine\n* Coco betaine\n* Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine\n* Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n* Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n* Sodium lauroamphoacetate\n* Sodium sulfosuccinate\n* Cocamidopropyl betaine\n* Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n* Sodium lauryl sulfate \\*\n\n*\\* Sodium lauryl sulfate is not recommended for daily use.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Non Surfactant Cleanser **Definition:** This cleaning agent does not completely lift oil and grease off of the hair strand, meaning it does not fully remove them. Doing so lightly cleanses your hair while also retaining moisture (i.e. conditioning it). It is not recommended for use with silicones, mineral oil or petroleum products because these ingredients deposit a [residue](https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/493588) under the hair's cuticle that require a surfactant cleanser to remove. I usually suggest using a clarifying shampoo once a month with this type of cleanser. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Detoxes, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair. See [How Often Should I Shampoo?](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html) ​for frequency.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil\n* Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil\n* Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil\n* Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil\n* Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Detox **Definition:** While similar to the Cleanser category, the Detox category is stronger. These cleansing agents remove product build up and help with demineralization of the hair. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used once a month by all hair types. Helpful for oily hair.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Disodium EDTA (Ethylamine Diamine Tetraacetic Acid)\n* Pentasoidum Pentetate\n* Sodium phytate\n* Phytic acid\n* Citric acid (needs large enough quantity to be effective)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Humectants **Definition:** T​his ingredient helps retain moisture from water by attracting it to the hair strand in humid climate conditions. However, in dry weather humectants have the opposite effect and will transfer moisture from your hair into the atmosphere. This can leave your hair dehydrated, which may not be what you want depending on its current state.*Tip: Humectants are complementary to silicones and plant oils.* **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** Can be used daily by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair.

Using a detox once a month is recommended with this category. \n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Any silicone with PEG as a prefix\n* Bis-peg/ppg-16/16 peg/ppg-16/16 (This is an emulsifier - not for shine or lubrication)\n* Cyclomethicone\n* Dimethicone copolyol\n* DEA PG-Propyl PEG/PPG-18/21 Dimethicone\n* Dimethicone PEG-8 Phosphate\n* Dimethicone-PG Diethylmonium Chloride\n* Hydrolyzed Silk PG-Propyl Methylsilanediol Crosspolymer\n* Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n* Hydrolyzed Wheat protein/hydroxypropyl polysiloxane and cystine/silicone co-polymers\n* Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Silanetriol\n* Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol\n* Lauryl methicone copolyol\n* PEG-40/PPG-8 Methylaminopropyl/Hydropropyl Dimethicone Copolymer\n* PEG/PPG-14/4 Dimethicone\n* PEG/PPG-20/15 Dimethicone\n* PEG-12 Dimethicone\n* PEG/PPG-20/15 Dimethicone\n* PPG-8 Methylaminopropyl, Hydroxypropyl Dimethicone Copolymer\n* PEG-7 Amodimethicone\n* PEG-8 Disteramonium Chloride PG-Dimethicone\n* PEG-33 (and) PEG-8 Dimethicone (and) PEG-14\n* Silanetriol\n* Silicone Quaternium-8\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Plant Oils **Definition:** This ingredient is used to retain moisture, condition hair, protect from damage and minimize dryness. **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** Can be used daily by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair.  **Ingredients:**\n\n* Coconut (Cocos Nucifera) Oil \n* Sunflower (Helianthus Annuus) Seed Oil\n* Olive (Olea Europaea) Oil\n* Argan (Argania Spinosa) Oil\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Preservatives **Definition:** Additives that prevent spoilage. Most consumer products contain preservatives because without them any water-based solution will eventually grow mold or bacteria. **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** A routine is not applicable for this category since it's included in most products, but pay attention to whether your products cause scalp irritation.

One that's specifically designed for doing laundry while travelling ('laundry soap leaves') and one 'soapless cleansing bar' that you can (also) use on your body. \n\nThe 'problem' is that both products contain starches. \n\nSoapless cleansing bar ingredients:\n>Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Coco-Sulfonate, **Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Starch**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Paraffin, Aqua, Citric Acid, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Bisabolol, Panthenol, Propylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide. \n\nLaundry soap leaves ingredients:\n>Sodium Dodecylbenzenesulfonate, **Tapioca Starch**, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocoamide Mea, Sodium Carboxymethyl, Cellulose, Sodium Lactate, Aqua, Parfum (Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool), CI 42090. \n\n\nIt's probably no big deal because they even include it in a product that's specifically designed for laundry, but I (as a lay person) always thought that micro-organisms love starches. \n\nWhat do you, the experts, think? How much starch (or something else to eat) do micro-organisms need to multiply? Would there be enough starch left (to eat) after rinsing the clothes with water. Or do they other ingredients 'counteract' bacterial growth enough to compensate for the starch content? \n\nI have tried to search the internet first, but I couldn't really find an answer. I guess most people have other things to worry about. \n\nThanks a lot! ",

I just dug up [this thread](http://www.dryeyezone.com/talk/showthread.php?7170-Periocular-Contact-Dermatitis) on a dry eye forum in which people discussed coco betaine allergies in the *same thread* from 2008 through 2010. It took them two years to post two pages! Anyway, someone mentioned Eucerin sells a shampoo in the UK that is advertised as not containing coco betaine: [Eucerin DermoCapillaire Calming Urea Shampoo](http://www.eucerin.co.uk/products/dermocapillaire/calming-urea-shampoo).\n\nHere are the ingredients:\n\nAqua, Sodium Myreth Sulfate, Urea, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Lactate, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Coco Glucoside, Laureth-9, PEG-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmate, Glyceryl Oleate, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Polyquaternium-10, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Salicylate\n\nWoohoo!! Eucerin doesn't sell it in the US but Amazon will ship it (it's expensive, IMO, and takes a month!).\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything majorly wrong with the ingredients besides the sulfate I already know about. I searched it on Cosdna and on here and didn't find anything particularly negative. I have keratosis pilaris so it could actually help that, too, I suppose.",

Or would GuarCAT or HEC be a better option? And would aiming for a pH between 5-5.5 be alright? Both the SCI and coco betaine have a pH of around there and the SCA has a pH of 9 and I'm assuming the amount I'd like to use will raise the pH significantly. I can always alter it though with a bit of a citric acid solution. I don't want to have to alter the pH too much but I will if it's too high. I think that's about it. I've been looking for shower gel recipes using the surfactants I have, but almost all of them call for decyl glucoside or something else. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!!",

I just recently found out that they are two different ingredients, unfortunately so many people shorten cocoamidopropyl to coco. Just make sure you aren't using anything that's cationic.\n\nSomething I was thinking about today, is if you are using Anionic and amphoteric surfactants and you have it an acidic ph, does that cause any issues since amphoteric turn cationic in an acidic conditions and anionic in alkaline conditions? I just made two cleansers with anionic and amphoteric surfactants and had the ph at 5.5, and I even used honeyquat and silk amino acids which are cationic. I didn't have any issues related to these things, though. I messed up my first one by forgetting to check the ph and the sepimax zen did not hydrate. I know that using cationics with anionics can screw things up. But I don't believe so with the anionic and amphoteric surfactants in a acidic ph.

    "body": "I (29 y/o, male, Europe) need your help, I have a long routine but don't know what im doing wrong. A few months ago, I added a few things to my routine and for the first time in my life I had like no new spots. I was so happy and I felt free, like I could finally always be myself without hiding my face. Then, it stopped and everything was back again. What am I doing wrong? Who can help me?\n\n**Problems**: Papules, pustules and white and blackheads.. a lot of white heads escpecially around my mouth, mostly on chin and sometime, most of the time small but also pustules too. On the cheeck (those I hate the most) are mostly no white heads, but there are pustules or sometimes cysts/papules (striking, most of the time only on my left cheeck) I also have a lot on my upper back, but I dont consider those a problem because they are not visible. My face is always oily.\n\nSo I have been dealing with this since I was like 13 years old. I feel so sad that this is more than half my life. I tried a lot of stuff you can buy at the grocery story but a few years ago, I think like 4 to 5 years, I came up with this routine (except for the last one, those I added months ago)\n\n**Morning**\n1. Shaving with a shaver\n2. Wetting my face (always lukewarm water)\n3. Putting on Eucerin DermoPure gel on my face (ingredients: Water, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate   Salicylic acid, Sebum-regulating technology)\n4. Patting dry with a towel (using for my face only)\n5. Cleaning my face with Eucerin DermoPure Micellair Water, using a cotton pad (ingredients: Water, Poloxamer 124, Glyceryl Glucoside, Glycerine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Decyl Glucoside, Arginine HCL, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Trisodium EDTA, Sodium Chloride, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol)\n6. Waiting a minute or two for my face to dry\n7. Using Inderm lotion Erythromycin Antibiotic on my face (ingredients: Erythromycin, Isopropanol, Isopropyl myristate, Dibutyl adipate), using a cotton pad. Months ago I added this last one after seeing my doctor, which seem to have worked for a few months, but then the results stopped. I am still using it, hoping the results will come back.\n\n**Before going to bed**\n1. Taking a shower\n2. Putting on Eucerin DermoPure gel on my face (ingredients: Water, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate   Salicylic acid, Sebum-regulating technology)\n3. Patting dry with a towel (using for my face only)\n4.

Waiting a minute or two for my face to dry\n6. Putting Benzoyl peroxide Hydrogel 5% on the bad spots (I wash it of the next morning during the morningroutine)(ingredients: ) Months ago I added this last one after seeing my doctor, which seem to have worked for a few months, but then the results stopped. I am still using it, hoping the results will come back. \n\nBesides the morning and night ritual, I also keep doing this, for years now:\n1. New towels for my face every 3 days\n2. New pillow for every 2 days (the other night I turn it)\n3. Eating dairy as little as possible\n4. Eating healthy, lots of fruits and vegetables\n5. Sporting, three times a week (going to the gym).\n6. Using toothpaste without Sodium Lauryl Sulfate\n7. Washing my hair 3 times a week\n\nPhoto: https://imgur.com/wJcrNwO",

    "body": "Hey guys!\n\n\nI have really difficult/sensitive skin, so I was hoping I could get some advise.\nI've tried a lot of different products, but still haven't found something that's really perfect for my skin. So I was hoping someone recognizes my problems and has some good product recommendations (which don't cost a fortune, poor student over here :( ). (btw I live in the Netherlands and sorry if my english is a bit messy)\n\n\nSkin type/problems: I have very oily skin, but it gets extremely dry if I don't moisturize properly. I have some pimples and when I'm about to get my period it gets worse. I think the pimples also get worse when I don't eat healthy. I also have some blackheads.\nI also have these colourless bumps on my cheeks, which are filled with sebum. You can only see them if the lighting is right and you can feel them. I can just clean them like a pimple and it will dissapear, but they always come back.\n\nDuring winter it's very cold and my skin gets really dry. During summer my skin gets really oily.\nLast spring I went to Surinam(South-America). The climate is tropical and I was there during the rain period. I noticed my skin was doing much better. Soft, glowing, healthy looking, no pimples and not oily. When I returned to the Netherlands it pretty quickly went back to how it was before.\n\n\nRoutine and products:\n\nMorning: \n\nI use a face wash from the brand Neutral for about 1 or 2 years now. It's a foam cleanser. \nIt's an ok facewash, but my skin does get dry after I use it. During winter it's like cracking dry. Right now it's warmer so  my skin doesnt crack, but I feel it pulling if I dont moisturize emediatly.\n\nI've been using witch hazel (pure witch hazel, no alcohol) as a toner for about a month now. I really like it, it makes my skin feel clean and kind off hydrated.\n\nI use the Vitamin E Day Lotion SPF30 from the body shop. I've used this for about 2.5 years I think. It's a very light lotion which I like. I don't like thick creams. It hydrates my skin very well, but it also makes it a bit oily, especially during summer. The main reason I use this cream is because of the SPF.\n\nAbout 2 or 3 times a week I use Freeman Charcoal & Black Sugar Gel Mask & Scrub. This makes my skin feel really soft and clean.\n\nEvening:\nSo I have to admit I often skip my evening routine, but I'm trying to make it a habit to clean my face properly in the evenings.\n\nI use the same facewash and toner.\n\nI also started using Vitamin E oil about a month ago as a \"night cream\". It's just pure vitamin E oil, and I think it works really well. When I put it on my skin feels a bit sticky/oily, but it doesn't really look shiny. And the next morning my skin is really soft and not oily at all.\n\n\n\nQuestions:\nI would like to use a different face wash and day cream, any recommendations?\nI've also been thinking about making a day cream myself, if anyone has some experience with this or advice i'd love to hear it.\n\nI've also read about using Salicylic Acid instead of a scrub. Would that work on my skintype or only damage my skin?\n\nI would love to hear any advice from people with similar skin/problems and the products/routine they use. If you think I'm using the wrong products for my skin pleasy let me know.\n\nI listed the ingredients of my products below, I don't know if it's any help but anyways...\n\n\n\nProduct ingredients:\nNeutral facewash - Glycerin\t,Aqua, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Niacinamide, Sucrose, Cocoate, Sodium chloride, Allantoin, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium gluconate, Citric acid \n\nThe Body Shop Vitamin E daycream - Aqua, Butylene Glycol, Octocrylene, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Glycine Soja Oil, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Pentylene Glycol, Polyglyceryl-2 Stearate, PEG-8 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Phenoxyethanol, Stearic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Palmitic Acid, Parfum, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-t-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Linalool, Adenosine, Citronellol, Myristic Acid, Spiraea Ulmaria Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Buddleja Davidii Extract, Thymus Vulgaris Flower/Leaf Extract, Limonene, Benzyl Alcohol, Crithmum Maritimum Extract, Eryngium Maritimum E x t ract, C i t r i c Ac i d , Leontopodium Alpinum Callus Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum.",

I'd recommend the cerave hydrating cleanser. Look for anything marketed as being gentle or for normal to dry skin. I know you said for oily skin, but if that's how your skin feels after cleansing, cleansers marketed for oily skin may be too harsh.\n\nDefinitely switch to a chemical exfoliant. Scrubs are harsh, and can damage your skin and moisture barrier. I don't have a specific recommendation, but BHA  (salicylic acid) is good for oily skin, pimples, and blackheads. Find a leave on product with 2% salicylic acid. Patch test first, then start by using it once per week and slowly increasing the frequency as needed.\n\nIf you like your moistirizer, stick with it! Not sure about DIY face creams, sorry.\n\nOrder of application (skip steps as needed depending on time of day and day of week): cleanse, tone, exfoliate, moisturize, spf",

Unfortunately, I chose the latter.\n* ***\"Clindamycin (antibiotics)\"***, she said. \"***I prefer not to\"***, I answered. ***\"What about topicals, like Retin-A ? I feel like it could also help with my under eyes wrinkles, don't you think ? \"***, I asked.\n* ***\"Retin-A is not appropriate for inflammatory acne, and one does not put Retin-A under eyes... I'll give you differin.\"***\n* ***\"Ok... But what about anti-aging ?\" \"Just put some moisturizer under your eyes\"***\n* ***\" What about niacinamide ? \"There's no large scale study that shows strong benefits\"***\n* ***\"Hm.

I've read some studies showed potential anti aging effects with differin, should I cross my fingers and got for it ?\n4.

    "body": "Hi all! My holy grail acne fighting product lately has been the Essenherb Cleansing Water. Its full ingredient list is:\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Allantoin, Caprylyl Glycol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Illicium Verum (Anise) Fruit Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Centella Asiatica Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract\n\nThe way I currently use the product is to put some on a cotton pad and wipe it on any problem areas throughout the day. This makes my acne literally melt away. As in, if I am in pain from a pimple the pain will dissipate within 15 minutes and redness will be reduced within 30 minutes. I have never had such success with any other product before.\n\nThe problem is that this product is now impossible to find where I live. I have tried to buy it many times but websites will falsely show that they have it in stock when they don't actually, so I'll get an email after purchase saying that they don't have it.\n\nBecause I am coming to the end of my bottle, I have been trying to find a replacement for it. I don't know if there is another product with a similar formula, or if I could save money and time by mixing my own out of a combination. Just using the Lush Tea Tree Toner on its own does not seem to have the same effect for me as the Essenherb Tea Tree Cleansing Water, which makes me think that perhaps it's the witch hazel that's working so well.\n\nMy questions for this sub are:\n\n1. Does anyone have an idea why this product is working so well for me, and which ingredients might be having the strongest effect?\n2. Does anyone know of a replacement product with a similar formula that has worked well for them?\n3.  If it does sound like a good idea to mix up my own, what is a good ratio that perhaps has worked for other members of the sub? I know tea tree extract must be heavily diluted to avoid hurting the skin, and never be ingested, as an example, but I'm unsure if I should dilute the witch hazel.\n\nPlease let me know if this post should instead go in another sub also, as I am new to this one. Thank you for you help!",

    "body": "I will tell you my recent history to understand my case.  In Novermber 2021 i started having a crazy hairloss. Some months before i had checked my ferritin and it was 28 ! But i had no time to go to the doctor again.  I also had no idea that ferritin 28 is low back then, cause they didn't marked it with black, and i also used to have super low ferritin in past so i thought 28 is great. From the start of 2022 i am using the same shampoos. 1st hand with a 92% natural ingredient shampoo that is it for hairloss and 2nd hand with a pharmaceutical dandruft shampoo. After that i was keep loosing a lot of hair, even if i started taking folate. But i didn't had a blood panel done. (I have checked thyroid though A LOT of times in my life and never had an issue). I didn't managed to grow my hair really thick after that, some times i was loosing a lot of hair, some others not so much. \n\nI got covid and had 40 fever for 3 days and after exactly 2 months, April of 2023, a CRAZY hairloss started. I was in shock. I also had 34 ferritin though. Hairloss stopped or stopped being so severe in Late August. And gradually my hairloss came to normal. Normal for me is loosing 2-3 hairs after the wash day, and as i go further to the next washing day i loose more hair but nothing serious. After that i managed to make my hair a lot thicker ! Sure though the were 2 areas were they were still not thick. But in general i was happy, cause they looked good. i just wanted to grow them longer.\n\nAnd OUT OF NOWHERE in July i started loosing A LOT of hair.  I checked ferritin and it was 49. Pretty good and better than before. It could be higher but i guess its not so low to cause hairloss. 1 year before doctor had told me that 34 it COULD possible cause hairloss, and in order to exclude it, it should be higher. So 49 cannot be that bad.\n\nI know my body, and i know that in the first days after the washing day i am just loosing 2-3 hair per day, and as i go closer to washing day (day 7) in the last 2 days i see some more hair shedding but nothing crazy. All summer though  was loosing A LOT OF HAIR every day, it was pretty shocking. Even in the first day after washing.  Even some hours after washing. I was shedding a lot.\n\nI run out of the 92% natural shampoo i use on the 1st hand. So i putted some water on it to use it and i saw LESS hairloss but still not normal it was just better. The next week i had run out of it so i only used the other shampoo i have in 2-3 hands cause it does not foam. And my hairloss came back to NORMAL. Exactly after the wash i didn't used it !\n\nI am pretty sure its from the shampoo, it was just a pitty to loose ALL MY PROGRESS and now be on point zero and trying to grow back my hair again. I just wonder how i didn't had hairloss when i was using it on winter and now it caused me hairloss? All this 2,5 years i was using it i never managed to grow my hair really thick and i didn't checked my ferritin regurarly, so i don't know if shampoo also was an issue.

Bạn có thể dùng tẩy da chết vật lý chứa các chứa các hạt scrub siêu nhỏ để khi massage trên da sẽ cuốn theo lớp sừng và da chết đi ra. Hoặc có thể dùng sản phẩm tẩy tế bào chết hóa học  có nồng độ axit nhẹ rồi từ từ nâng dần lên, với sản phẩm tẩy tế bào chết có BHA nên sử dụng nồng độ 1-2%, sau 1-2 tháng nâng lên 4%, còn với AHA nên sử dụng từ nồng độ 3-5% sau nâng lên 7-10%\n\nBước 4: Đắp mặt nạ đất sét/ than hoạt tính\n\nĐắp mặt nạ đất sét không chỉ giúp làm sạch sâu bên trong lỗ chân lông mà còn giúp loại bỏ dầu thừa, bụi bẩn trên da đem lại hiệu quả trị mụn tốt hơn. Cách thực hiện vô cùng đơn giản, chỉ cần đắp mặt nạ 1 lớp mỏng trên da và giữ trong vòng 15-20 phút sau đó rửa sạch lại bằng nước ấm.\n\nBước 5: Nặn mụn\n\nSau khi đắp mặt nạ khoảng 10 phút, lỗ chân lông đã được làm sạch và mở rộng hơn giúp dễ dàng tiến hành bước nặn mụn. Bạn hãy rửa sạch tay sau đó sử dụng cây nặn mụn đã được khử trùng sau đó dùng lực quét cây nặn mụn nhẹ nhàng trên da để loại bỏ nhân mụn.\n\nBước 6: Đắp mặt nạ phục hồi\n\nSau khi nặn mụn đầu đen, làn da của bạn bị tác động và trở nên nhạy cảm, vì thế bạn cần được đắp mặt nạ để làm dịu da, chống viêm và giảm thâm sau nặn mụn. Có thể sử dụng mặt nạ giấy, mặt nạ sủi bọt, mặt nạ gel,…\n\nBước 7: Sử dụng Toner/ Serum và Kem dưỡng\n\nVới các bạn da khô, sau khi đã nặn mụn và đắp mặt nạ, bạn có thể tiến hành cả 3 bước dưỡng da tiếp theo: dùng toner, serum và kem dưỡng\n\nVới các bạn có làn da dầu: Sau khi đắp mặt nạ nên chọn 1 trong 3 bước dưỡng da trên để tạo lớp bảo vệ, giúp da mau lành vết thương sau nặn mụn\n\nƯu tiên các sản phẩm không có hương liệu, không cồn, kết cấu mỏng nhẹ và chứa ít gốc dầu gây bít tắc da\n\nBước 8: Chấm mụn\n\nNếu là người mới bắt đầu sử dụng các sản phẩm chấm mụn, bạn nên sử dụng các dòng sản phẩm có chứa hoạt chất Benzyl Peroxide 2 – 5% hoặc Adapalene. Sau một khoảng thời gian, khi đã quen với các hoạt chất này có thể đổi sang sử dụng Retinol-A hoặc Teetrea oil. Tuy nhiên, Benzyl Peroxide 2 – 5% và Adapalene vẫn là 2 hợp chất được các chuyên gia da liễu khuyên nên sử dụng.\n\nBước 9: Dùng kem chống nắng\n\nSau các bước chăm sóc trên đừng quên thoa kem chống nắng trước khi ra ngoài vào ban ngày nhé! Kem chống nắng sẽ giúp bảo vệ làn da, giúp các dưỡng chất được hấp thụ hoàn toàn mà không bị mất đi, đem lại hiệu quả tốt nhất.\n\n# Một Số Lưu Ý Trong Quá Trình Chăm Sóc Da Mụn Đầu Đen, Lỗ Chân Lông To\n\nGiữ da luôn sạch và thông thoáng\n\nHạn chế sử dụng những đồ uống có cồn, caffeine và các chất kích thích,…\n\nBỏ các thói quen xấu: sờ tay lên mặt, nặn mụn khi chưa sát trùng tay,…\n\nKiểm soát lượng bã nhờn trên da bằng cách: uống đủ nước, ngủ đủ giấc và dùng giấy thấm dầu thường xuyên\n\nBảo vệ da tránh các tác nhân từ bên ngoài: dùng kem chống nắng, đeo khẩu trang\n\nBổ sung dưỡng chất cho da: Vitamin C, A, B3,..\n\nCó thể đến spa nặn mụn theo chu kì 3 – 7 ngày/ lần\n\n Không lạm dụng các biện pháp lột mụn vì sẽ khiến lỗ chân lông to và dễ tổn thương hơn\n\nTại Sao Da Dầu Thường Gặp Trình Trạng Bị Mụn Và Lỗ Chân Lông To\n\n# Nguyên Nhân Da Dầu Thường Bị Lỗ Chân Lông To\n\nNhững người có làn da dầu, da nhờn thường có lỗ chân lông to hơn những người có làn da khô và da thường. Nguyên nhân là do bã nhờn và dầu trên da quá nhiều khiến bụi bẩn dễ dàng bám dính lại, các chất này có tích tụ trên da khiến lỗ chân lông càng ngày càng nở ra, thậm chí gây nên mụn trứng cá. \n\nHậu quả là, sau khi nặn mụn, vùng da bị kéo dãn đó không hồi phục về hiện trạng ban đầu, lỗ chân lông trở nên to và rõ hơn, hình thành sẹo rỗ.\n\n# Nguyên Nhân Da Dầu Thường Bị Mụn Đầu Đen\n\nDa dầu có tuyến mồ hôi hoạt động cực kỳ mạnh mẽ. Chính vì vậy cũng là nguyên nhân hình thành mụn đầu đen. Cơ chế hình thành mụn đầu đen là do tuyến dầu trên da hoạt động mạnh như không thể thoát ra khỏi bề mặt da do lỗ chân lông bị bít tắc bởi bụi bẩn, tế bào chết hay sản phẩm trang điểm và vi khuẩn. Khi các nốt mụn trong lỗ chân lông tiếp xúc với không khí sẽ bị oxy hóa và nhân mụn chuyển sang màu đen sậm.\n\n**Nguồn bài viết gốc:** [Review 10 Loại Sữa Rửa Mặt Trị Mụn Đầu Đen Cực Kì Hiệu Quả](https://odayreview.com/sua-rua-mat-tri-mun-dau-den/)",

    "body": "I'm fairly sure I have seb-derm or something extremely similar, and have been using the Eucerin urea shampoo to deal with this. It not only helps with my scalp, but my hair gets very soft and clean from it. However, after moving to a different state with harder water, it got a little more oily more often, and I ran out of the shampoo. Since I couldn't find it online for a reasonable price, and my hair was getting steadily worse even oily right after the shower, I tried others.\n\nFirst was a hard water shampoo with helped mildly, then Tsal which helped a bit (applied non-optimally), then Flexitol which seemed to make it worse. I then applied Tsal dry to my hair, sectioning it out, applying it twice more in the shower, letting each application sit for 2-3 minutes. This removed the oily feeling, but it takes a LARGE amount, and a few days later my hair felt dry and a bit tangly. So far I've been doing about the same thing but not applying it dry.\n\nMy question is why does the Eucerin Shampoo help so much when others help very little or take so much product to reach the same effectiveness? I've also used the Sebamed shampoo before, but it's also very hard to find now. Is it just the percentage of Urea, and Eucerin has a very high percentage without noting it anywhere on their website? Other ingredients in Flexitol making the urea less effective? Should I just try using the Eucerin Scalp treatment since this is somewhat easy to get? Any other shampoos with urea that may work the same way?\n\nThank you!\n\nEucerin Calming Urea Shampoo: Aqua, Sodium Myreth Sulfate, Urea, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Lactate, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Coco Glucoside, Laureth-9, PEG-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmate, Glyceryl Oleate, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Polyquaternium-10, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Salicylate\n\nEucerin Calming Urea Scalp Treatment: Aqua, Urea, Methylpropanediol, Sodium Lactate, Laureth-9, Glycyrrhiza Inflata Root Extract, Glycerin, Lactic Acid, Arginine HCL, Hydroxyethylcellulose, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Cetrimonium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol\n\nSebamed 5% Urea Calming Shampoo: Aqua, Urea, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Laureth-9, Lauryl Glucoside, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Parfum, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Phenoxyethanol, Citric Acid, Laureth-2, PEG/PPG-120/10 Trimethylolpropane Trioleate, Sodium Benzoate, Hydroxypropyl Oxidized Starch PG-Trimonium Chloride, Sodium Citrate, Tetramethyl Acetyloctahydronaphthalenes, Lactic Acid, Sodium Lactate, Sodium Chloride, Tocopherol, Helianthus annuus seed oil\n\nFlexitol Scalp Relief + Conditioner: Aqua, Sodium C14 -16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamide MEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, (2%) Urea, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Flour, Amodimethicone, Acrylates Copolymer, Piroctone Olamine, Allantoin, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Trideceth-12, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Phenoxyethanol, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nTsal: 3% Salicylic Acid, Water, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Polyquaternium-22, Sodium Citrate, Hexylene Glycol, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid",

I find it makes my skin feel nice and ~nourished~ at best, but it's almost like the product isn't consistent, even in the same crock. The product texture feels more solid in some areas, and some portions of it are more heavily scented. \n\n\nI'm 28/F, I have mostly oily skin with sebaceous filaments/blackheads/texture in my t-zone. My cheeks are balanced, not too oily or dry. \n\n\nRight now, I use Kalamazoo to wash, followed up with Paula's Choice BHA gel, spritz with Trader Joe's Rose Water facial toner, and moisturize with Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel. \n\n\nI've used a few different cleansers, but the ones I can remember are: Cera Ve (the foaming one, and salicylic acid one) and Neutrogena ultra gentle daily cleanser, which both made my skin burn and feel stripped; and Ole Henriksen's oil control cleanser, which was alright, but nothing to write home about. \n\n\nThe ingredients for Kalamazoo are:\nWater (Aqua) , Stearic Acid (Stearic acid) , Sodium Cocoamphoacetate , Glycerl Stearate & Peg - 100 Stearate (Globe Amaranth (Gomphrena globosa)) , Glycerine , Triethanolamine , Cetearyl Alcohol , Almond Oil (Prunus dulcis) , Apricot Kernel Oil (Prunus armeniaca) , Fresh Pineapple Juice (Ananas sativus) , Fragrance , Organic Jojoba Oil (Simmondsia chinensis) , Cupuaçu Butter (Theobroma grandiflorum) , Lime Oil (Citrus aurantifolia) , Brazilian Orange Oil (Citrus Sinensis) , Olibanum Oil (Boswellia carterii) , Geraniol , Limonene , Linalool , Hydroxycitronellal , Methylparaben .",

It's mostly on these parts like the underarms, inner thighs+kitty, the neck, cleavage and under it. I tried the all time favorite homemade turmeric scrub with gram flour, turmeric and milk and yes it does help. It only lightens it not clears the whole thing. I tried using the ordinary glycolic acid toner for a year and saw no changes but it could be because I wasn't consistent.

Most natural cleansers have a high ph, so I can't recommend anything. But you should try some non-natural ones, there is a lot of variety and those are formulated specially for your skin, so they wouldn't irritate you.\n\nBtw jellies are a high-maintenance product.

    "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm trying to learn more about detergents and the difference between products with detergents (shower gel, shampoo, laundry detergent, dishwashing liquid, etc.).\n\nDo I understand it correctly that the main (active) ingredients in all these products are detergents whereas shower gel, shampoo and dishwashing liquid generally use 'milder' detergents than laundry detergent? And that they often have different ingredients for their specific purpose, e.g. glycerine in shower gel and enzymes/brighteners in laundry detergent?\n\nThe reason why I'm asking this is because I'm looking for product(s) to use when travelling and less/lighter/non-liquid products are easier to carry than a lot of different bottles.\n\nI've read that a lot of people use (castille) soap (Dr. Bronner's) as a detergent for everything, but I'm not sure whether that's ideal (for the skin) because of the high pH.\n\nI have found two products that look like solid soap bars, but they don't use soap as a detergent and have a pH of ~5.5. \n\nProduct 1.\n>Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Coco-Sulfonate, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Starch, Cetearyl Alcohol, Paraffin, Aqua, Citric Acid, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Bisabolol, Panthenol, Propylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide. \n\nProduct 2.\n>Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Triticum vulgare starch, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Talc, Sodium Lactate, Cera alba, Aqua, Lecithin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Panthenol, Inulin, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycine, Magnesium Aspartate, Alanine, Lysine, Leucine, Benzophenone-4, Parfum, CI 47005, CI 61570, CI 77891\n\nWould (the detergents in) these products be strong enough to wash clothes and dishes with or are they too mild? Would it be smart to buy two bars; one soap bar for washing clothes & dishes and a soap-less bar for the use on the skin? \n\nWhat product(s) would/do you pack when travelling? I'm really curious!\n\nThanks a lot!",
