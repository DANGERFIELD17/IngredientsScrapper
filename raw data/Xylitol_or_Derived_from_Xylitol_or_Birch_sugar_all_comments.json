    "body": "So I'm absolutely fucking obsessed with the Fruit Adventure flavor of Tic-Tacs. The flavor combined with the soft *smush* they make between your teeth when you chew them makes my brain very happy. I've been buying them in bulk, where each container has 200 candies each, and they come in bulk packs of 12 containers. I tend to eat them by the handful while I'm working or gaming, so in a day I can easily slam through 1-2 containers. \n\nNow keep in mind that on the nutrition label, it says the serving size is 1 candy, and is listed as having 0 calories, which I thought was awesome because I could have as many as I want! \n\nOver the past year, I found that I gained about 40lbs, and nothing about my eating habits had changed as far as I was aware. I told my doctor about it and she was a bit worried, so she had me do a bunch of bloodwork to see if there was a reason why I gained so much weight in a short period of time. Everything came back normal. She referred me to see a weight loss doctor who would also have me see a dietician. \n\nI had been working with the dietician for a few months now, and we have me keep a food log. I had a virtual visit with her today and during it, I was fiddling around with an empty container to keep my hands busy. She saw it and asked where I got such a large container from, so I told her about it and how I eat 1-2 of those per day. She asked why those weren't on my food tracker and I said it was because they're 0 calories so they wouldn't count. \n\nApparently I was very, very wrong about this. She explained to me that food companies can label something as being \"0 calories\" if the food's serving size contains 5 or less calories. In reality, each individual Tic-Tac actully has about 2 calories. So essentially, since each container has 200 pieces and I typically have 1-2 of those, I've been eating 400-800+ calories *per day* of Tic-Tacs, in addition to all the other food I've been eating - which is very likely why I've gained so much weight. \n\nTL;DR: Didn't realize that tic-tacs weren't actually 0 calories and gained a ton of weight because I eat so many a day. \n\nEdit: Just wanted to clarify that I'm aware that sugar will in fact make you gain weight (I'm not *that* stupid), but I never actually read the product ingredients. I assumed they must have been made with something like Xylitol or some other artificial sweetener to make them \"0 calories\" so it never crossed my mind to check!\n\nEdit 2: Dang y'all are brutal lmao. But at least some good came out of it since apparently, like me, a lot of people didn't realize about the \"less than 5 calories per serving\" rule can legally be classified as 0 in the US. Personally I wish we could have the model they do in other countries where they list calories per X amount of grams. \n\nEdit 3: MY TEETH ARE FINE üòÇ I actually just had a dentist appointment two weeks ago. No cavities or decay, gums are healthy. Despite my candy habit I do take good care of my teeth!",

He was buying low calorie bread, but never compared the calories to regular bread. Just assumed it was much, much less. Instead of serving her 2 slices of regular bread each morning (190 calories) he was serving her 4 slices of lower calorie bread (240 calories - slathered with \"zero calorie\" butter spray, of course).",

Companies should not be able to change a name of a product without having to tell the public that it's the same thing as something that people stop buying because of the product being used in it. Unfortunately this happens way to often. And apparently our people in charge of these types of things don't care about the people who try to avoid buying these products that have certain ingredients in them to prevent having issues with them enough to stop it from happening either. IMO, of course! Because this happens with way to many products. It's high time that our government make them do more about this. But for now, the only way for us to be able to do anything about it is to band together and boycott buying from the companies that do this or allow it to be done. But until enough people band together on this (IMO) this will continue to be an issue. The makers of these items are more interested in making money than caring what the consumers want. And IMO so are the companies that allow it to happen. Because IMO they are willing to take bribes or hush money to not force them to let the consumers know of the other names that they sell their products under.\n\n  Please everyone share any products known to be bad for us or our fur babies that they know of by any other names so hopefully in this way maybe we can help to stop this type of thing from continuing. And I do realize that sometimes a company will put other names on it without the authorities that regulate these things knowing it for a while. But they should start banning that companies products from being sold until they either stop it, or are willing to make announcements of the other names. Preferably by making them put the other names in parentheses.\n\nIf you are reading this and are one of the authorities that are in charge of regulating these types of things, PLEASE be proactive about stopping this from continuing. For not only is consumers, but also for the fur babies we love so much. And if you are the consumers of these types of products from these companies that do it  (1.) Stop buying anything that they do this with.  (2.) Tell others about it. That way we can hopefully put an end to this continued deceitfulness.\n\nThank everyone for their cooperation in this matter in advance.",

Original post by** u/IntrudingAlligator **in** r/RBI¬†\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**ORIGINAL POST**](https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/p9k6bp/what_chemicalsubstance_could_have_killed_my_dog/) \\- 23rd August 2021\n\nIt happened incredibly fast. I let the dog (2 y/o pom) outside in the backyard this morning, she was out there with the other dog for maybe ten minutes. She came back in and suddenly froze staring straight ahead, totally stiff. I yelled her name and she started listing and fell over. She got up again and started walking sideways like she was drunk, then tried to run at the back door again, then she fell over unconscious. We raced her to the vet who drew blood for her kidneys, liver, but she was already dying. He said it was definitely something she ingested, but he wasn't sure what. The tests haven't come back yet. I'm in shock. I can't understand how this happened so fast.\n\nShe was healthy this morning. My daughter walked her this morning and said she didn't get into anything. The other dog who was out there is fine, the vet has him for observation just in case. I have a 3 y/o so everything is childproofed and the floor is clean, nothing she could have eaten in the house. I got down on my hands and knees and searched everywhere. It happened outside. A week ago we had a company rip a dead tree out of our yard, that's the only thing that's changed. There's a side gate where someone passing by could have fed her something under the gate.\n\nWe live in socal and we're friendly with our neighbors. Our neighborhood has a rat problem the hoa recently started baiting for, but we don't have any bait or traps in our yard because of the kids. I thought maybe she found a dead rat but I searched and couldn't find anything. The vet said it didn't look like rat poison anyway, but we have to wait for the tests. Does anyone have any idea what substance could have done this so fast?\n\n¬†\n\n[**UPDATE**](https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/pa8qa1/update_what_killed_my_dog_so_suddenly/) \\- 24th August 2021\n\nI wanted to give an update to this post and thank everyone who offered suggestions, there were so many comments I couldn't reply individually. It was **xylitol poisoning** from an icebreakers mint one of my kids dropped in the backyard. Xylitol is toxic at 0.05 grams per pound of body weight in dogs. Icebreakers mints have about a gram per mint. My pom was only 3.5 pounds. I knew about xylitol in gum but never thought about mints. The kid who dropped it is devastated with guilt. We'll never bring home any product with xylitol again as long as there are pets in the house.\n\nA a side note I really want to thank the plant people, because I had no idea so many backyard plants were poisonous. Someone recommended using google lens to get actual IDs, that helped a lot. We had plants out there that are toxic to pets and babies so we've been lucky to this point. Thank you everyone. You gave me something to do instead of panic and flail.\n\n¬†\n\n**Additional Resources from Comments**\n\n* Xylitol is also known as - Birch Sugar & E967 additive (European term)\n* Xylitol is present in a large number of regular household items\n* List of products that contain Xylitol thanks to u/Bluitor \\- [https://www.preventivevet.com/xylitol-products-toxic-for-dogs](https://www.preventivevet.com/xylitol-products-toxic-for-dogs)\n* Also, deadly toxins present in certain Toads & Mushrooms. Plants such as oleander, Angel's Trumpet, Cardboard Palm etc. are toxic to pets - commentators have detailed their experiences. Make sure to check your yard for such deadly species using google lens to get actual IDs.\n* [FDA list of Potentially Dangerous Items for Your Pet](https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/animal-health-literacy/potentially-dangerous-items-your-pet#:~:text=Onions,syrup%2C%20mouthwash%2C%20and%20toothpaste)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Reminder - I am not the original poster.**",

This morning a massive cramp woke me up and culminated in a two-octave, 9-second masterpiece that made my dog get off the bed.  My wife is pregnant and said that the baby kicked.  It's been two hours and I am still farting every 15 minutes, loudly.   The sheer quantity of air behind these bad boys means that a sneak attack is not possible.  It's like my colon is a digeridoo: there's only one volume - ON.  I work in a shared office and my coworkers are asking me if I'm ok because I keep running outside every 15 minutes.   I hope this ends soon because I have to do some invoicing and it's hard to focus when your guts are revolting (in every sense of the word). \n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk.\n\nEdit @ T+5:00:  I believe the worst is behind me (haha).  My officemates must have figured me out because when I came back from my last \"outing\", someone had plugged in the Glade diffuser that we had from back when Two-Packs Tom worked here.  I'm now just praying for what Warren G. Harding called \"A Return To Normalcy\" in the wake of The Great War - the aftershocks are still affecting me deeply but my mind has mercifully already begun blocking out the memory of this morning's more horrific bathroom atrocities, the details of which I would spare you anyway.

I grew up with dogs, but hadn't had one since my old boy passed right before I went to college, so I decided it was time. I talked to my landlady, and she said sure, so long as the dog didn't destroy the walls and I filled in holes in the backyard. \n\nMid 2020, a friend of mine lost his job, his wife left him, and he was thrown out of the house, leaving him homeless. He's been a long time buddy of mine, so I again cleared it with my landlady, she said he could move in, and I offered him a place to stay. \n\nNow, my friend wasn't the best with dogs, but he got along well with Abby, so it didn't seem like a big deal. He said she really helped him with his depression, and I was glad he was doing alright. However, I didn't leave them alone. I kennel trained Abby, and she slept in my room, and was in her kennel if I had to leave the house. \n\nOn the day of the incident, I left the house to run some errands, and came home to Abby really sick. My friend had gone into my room, taken Abby out of her kennel, and fed her all sorts of shit. I took her to the vet, racked up a shit ton of bills even with pet insurance, but she still didn't make it. \n\nMy brother is a lawyer, and after helping me find a crematorium and get things set up, he suggested I sue for the bills. I loved Abby, and sure, she was an older dog, he still stole at least 5-8 years from me. A different friend, however, pointed out that he's heart broken, just wanted to cuddle with her since he was upset while I was gone, and she was my responsibility in the first place.\n\nEdit- I double checked my copy of the vet report since people are asking, and it was massive amounts of xylitol in her systems. I don't know the exact food he gave her, but yeah.",

Your roommate made two serious and unfortunately for Abby, deadly mistakes -\n\n\\- Removing Abby from her kennel without checking with you.\n\n\\- Feeding Abby anything at all, much less without checking with you or at least googling whether or not it was safe for dogs.\n\nYour roommate is directly responsible for your dog's death. The fact that he is not offering to pay for your vet bills, even in small installments that he could afford, makes him a huge AH. Your friend's points are null - you did the responsible thing and placed her in her kennel while you were out; the roommate's actions removing her from the kennel and  feeding her the toxic food that killed her therefore make him responsible. It could not be more clear.\n\nI also wanted to add that depression is not an excuse for his terrible choices, and I write that as a person with severe clinical depression. A dog is not a stuffed animal to cuddle with for comfort; dogs are living things and we are responsible for their welfare, which means being exquisitely careful about anything we feed them or any other actions that could put them in harm's way. I hope your roommate will change his mind and willingly do the right thing. If not, he deserves to be sued.\n\n\\[Edited to fix a typo.\\]",

The roommate actually committed criminal animal abuse by neglecting to give the dog medical care. \n\nAt first, I thought the roommate simply made a mistake.  (Although he still had to pay for the financial damages caused by his mistake).  But it‚Äôs actually WORSE than that. \n\nThe roommate would‚Äôve noticed the dog sick for hours before you came home.  It‚Äôs impossible that he didn‚Äôt notice.  She would‚Äôve been whining, crying, throwing up, lethargic, etc.  Clearly she was very sick and in need of emergency medical care. \n\nThe roommate refused to help a sick animal. \n\nHe committed animal abuse by refusing to get her medical care. \n\nShe was suffering and  for HOURS before you came home.  If she had gotten the correct medical care ASAP‚Äîshe might have lived.  At the very least, she might have suffered less pain. \n\nBut the roommate didn‚Äôt want to get caught paying the medial bill, and poisoning the dog accidentally. \n\nI‚Äôm sure he put 2+2 together, and realized she was sick from something he fed her. \n\nHe was probably crossing his fingers and praying that the dog got over the sickness before the owner came home. \n\nHe SHOULD have taken the dog to the emergency vet ASAP.  Screw the medical bills. \n\nHeck, even if he didn‚Äôt want to take her himself‚Äîhe could‚Äôve called you and asked you to come home, and explained your dog was sick.  He didn‚Äôt.  Because he didn‚Äôt want you to catch him having accidentally fed her stuff he shouldn‚Äôt have. \n\nHe swept it under the rug.  \n\nHe watched her dying, whining, suffering, crying, for hours.  Doing nothing about it. \n\n**Denying medical care is legally considered criminal abuse.  In humans, and in animals.**\n\nPrevious comment: \n\nYes, your friend just wanted to cuddle.  And he made a mistake to feed her.  Yes, he made mistakes when he was sad.  Unfortunately‚Äîas an adult in the real world, we pay when we make mistakes.  Even if the event was done on accident.  He caused harm.  He needs to make restitution for that harm. \n\nUnfortunately, ‚Äúbeing sad‚Äù isn‚Äôt a legal excuse when someone hurts someone else.  And ‚Äúbeing sad‚Äù won‚Äôt bring your dog back. \n\nYou aren‚Äôt ‚Äúpunishing‚Äù him.  You are simply having him pay for what he damaged. \n\nIt is the consequences of his mistake.",

My wonderful, curious, energetic, loveable, loyal, beloved Kuma consumed Xylitol a couple of days ago. \n\nI went to the store and went to pick up some lunch. When I came back she seemed fine and I let her outside.  She is such a vocal dog, so after an hour of her not letting me know she needed to come back in, I went to check on her. When I called her, she didn't come. So I went out looking for her.... And I found her half dead in the corner of my yard. I immediately saw the vomit: a mixture of dog food, orange and SUGARLESS GUM. And I immediately KNEW. I knew she had gotten into the gum while I was gone. I knew that xylitol was toxic for dogs. I called her vet. They told me to take her in right away.... I was by myself at home but my dog weighs 76lbs, and was non-responsive... I couldn't move her by myself to load her onto the car, so I ran outside.  Like a headless chicken, I rang the first door bell, neighbor wasn't home. Rang the second door bell, a cop's house, her car was there yet she didn't answer the door; and finally, a third neighbor answered the door and I begged her to help me load my dog onto the car. She did.\nWhile on the way to the vet, I called my husband, who was working, in panic. I bet I was barely coherent, all I remember him saying is I'll meet you there. \nWe barely made it to the Vet on time. My dog was dangerously hypoglycemic. Because of covid, we couldn't go in so we had to leave her. It was awful. As of today, she is still not out of the woods, her sugars look ok, her liver shows sign of damage. They kept her till today when her sugars were stable without the IV.\n\nSo FYI, please keep an eye out for xylitol. Found in many household foods including but not limited to: vitamins, melatonin, ice cream, and even peanut butter, while great for humans... Not so great for dogs, it doesn't take a lot to kill them. My dog ate approximately 40 pieces of Orbit gum and that was above fatal dosage. She's alive due to quick intervention from me, her vet team and circumstances. Had I not been home, the story would've been different. Also, kudos to her Veterinarian Hospital for accepting my dog right away, she's was in the hospital for three days.\n\nAnd thanks to my super awesome neighbor for helping me load my dog onto the car. She helped saved her life.\n\nUpdate:  Kuma is back to her energetic, happy self. Vet sent her home with liver meds but her sugars look good! She'll have a series of follow up blood tests till they come back in the normal range. Thank you everyone for your well wishes, I'll be forever grateful.",

    "body": "Why YSK: prevention is key + some species are vulnerable to things that are harmless to people.  \n\nIt's highly recommended that all pet owners familiarize themselves with items in the home that can result in intoxication. The [ASPCA's poison control center](https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control) has online education resources for this purpose. [This guide](https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control/toxic-and-non-toxic-plants) helps people identify toxic (and non-toxic) plants in the home and yard.\n\nFor example, ***xylitol*** is a newer product increasingly used in a [variety of products](https://aspcapro.org/sites/default/files/xylitol%20poster.pdf) that we ingest but can cause severely low blood sugar,  liver failure, and death in dogs + rabbits.  Look at ingredient lists and keep xylitol far away from your dog(s). Chewing gum is a big one.\n\nAlso, ***all parts of a lily are highly toxic to cats*** and even a few grains of pollen or nibbling a leaf will almost certainly cause kidney failure. Consider this if gifting flowers to a cat owner. It's Easter o'clock + we've already seen pet cats die of acute kidney injury soon after lilies were brought into the home. Hence, taking a break to post this and hopefully prevent accidental intoxications. There's no specific test for lily tox so your guess is as good as anyone's re: why your outdoor cat gets severely ill.\n\nAnd no, animals do not inherently know what's unsafe for them. PSA done ‚úÖ",

Sure enough did a couple rounds of it and both dogs threw up balls of gum and ended up being completely fine. Obviously in my situation we had time on our side and a lot of luck. This is a dangerous ingredient to pets and needs to be taken seriously. Keep it far away from your animals and if they still get it call pet poison control and your vet immediately.",

They're usually fairly easy to avoid though, but sometimes I'll have to make a request, since they can trigger pretty bad discomfort and cramps. I've been a waitress before though, so I try to avoid making any difficult or unreasonable requests.\n\nAnyway, I went out for dinner with my Dad and sister for Father's Day. When we get there, the waitress took our drink orders and we all ordered Pepsi. When the waitress brought the drinks, she mentioned they were diet. Unfortunately, I'm intolerant to xylitol, an artificial sweetner often used in diet sodas. I confirmed that they were diet, then asked if I could get a regular drink and explained that I had an intolerancy. She said that was my fine and brought me a new drink and everything else was fine.\n\nI started feeling a bit off during the meal, but just dismissed it as a one off. A little while later, I flagged down another waitress (ours had disappeared and hadn't returned, but it was also busy) and asked if I could get another Pepsi. Given the confusion earlier, I specified that I wanted a regular one. That waitress apologized and let me know that they'd run out of regular Pepsi and Coke the day before and that they weren't due to get their next order until tomorrow. When I mentioned that the other waitress had told me she'd brought me a regular Pepsi, the second waitress double checked and confirmed that they were entirely out of regular soda.\n\nI've never had this happen before. If a customer very directly says they can't have something for dietary reasons, you don't lie to them about what you served them. If they were out of the soda I requested, she should have simply told me that. I would have just ordered a ginger ale or a water. I've been dealing with my symptoms for an hour now, and all that could have very easily been avoided. What the hell?",

(Aspartame, in diet sodas, isn't a sugar alcohol, but does often give people some nasty symptoms like headaches. Some sodas are starting to use Stevia instead (sucralose), which is also not a sugar alcohol, but doesn't seem to have as major side effects as aspartame.)",

    "body": "Sweeteners are a complex issue. With all of the brand new resolution folks posting, I have seen sweeteners come up so much by so many of you. I have seen posts about Swerve, Atkins, and more. As such, I wanted to make a post directly about artificial sweeteners and how they can affect keto. They can be your best friend or your worst enemy, and it largely depends on your body's chemistry as well as the type of sweetener.\n\n\n\n\n***In general***\n\n________________________________________________\n\nIn general, cutting out sweets can only help you stick to any diet easier. Sweet stuff tastes good and when things taste really good, we often find ourselves having just one more bite.\n\n\nThat said, I personally wouldn‚Äôt be on this lifestyle without sweeteners. Most of us simply want to be able to have a treat now and then. Being too restrictive can kill any type of health improvement by making it too daunting to achieve. As such, sweeteners are fine for most people to use. There are cautionary tales by some that they can increase cravings, but most people likely won‚Äôt experience this and it‚Äôs up to you to experiment to see if they are what is causing your cravings or not.\n\n\nHowever, not all sweeteners are created equal. \n\n\n\n***Sweeteners to watch out for***\n\n________________________________________________\n\n>**Maltitol:** This is almost identical to sugar in terms of carbs, its impact on your blood sugar is very bad.  It simply has the same impact on you as downing sugar would for the most part. It also causes very distressing bowel movements when eaten too much. Sadly it tastes very good and almost like sugar, meaning it‚Äôs the #1 one people experiment with--and pay for later. **Almost all sugar free candies will use this one making them not a low carb option nor an option you want if you want to spend your life outside the bathroom.**\n\n\n> **Xylitol:** While better than the other -tol, this one is very dangerous to dogs/cats. It‚Äôs toxic to them. It also can cause similar bowel issues if consumed in moderate to large doses.\n\n\n>**Splenda:** The granulated version of Splenda has a lot of carbs. This is because it uses high GI sweeteners with Sucralose as binding agents, making it surprisingly bad for low carb diets, even if it is often suggested as a SF option. Liquid splenda or sucralose itself is fine, but if a product says \"Splenda (TM)\" it is likely using the granulated version. **The sugar free candies that are not using Maltitol will likely use this, making them a poor keto choice.**\n\n>**Just Like Sugar (and anything with Malodextrin):** Malodextrin isn't good. It will often be used in products as a binding agent. Always read ingredients and, if it has that, be wary. Sometimes people will make Stevia mixes with it, completely off-setting the benefits Stevia has.\n\n\n\n\n\n***Sweeteners to freely enjoy***\n________________________________________________\n\n\n> \n>**Stevia:** This is a great, natural sweetener. Its taste can be off-putting, but when you bake with it, you can use extracts to cover it up. I recently made a cranberry pie where I simply added extra vanilla extract to mask its taste.\n\n\n> **Erythritol:** Another good one, this sweetener is gaining in popularity. Chocolate bars like Lily‚Äôs and ChocoPerfection both use this sweetener, and they taste pretty close to the real thing!\n\n\n>**Monk Fruit:** I recently tried ChocZero which has monk fruit. It is the hardest to find since it is rarer. It is very, very good.\n\n\n> **Allulose:** The new Quest cereal bars use this one. It tastes great, like really really really good. It has not impacted my blood sugar and I trust Quest largely because their protein bars have been a staple for many ketoers, so this may change as further research comes out, but it is a new sweetener.\n\n\n> **Swerve/Truvia/Sukrin:** These are ~~two~~ three hybrids that mix sweeteners and they are GREAT for baking, coffee, and more. I highly suggest either one if you want to dabble in making your own keto baked goods, they are easy to use--and in the case of Swerve, they come in confectioner‚Äôs or granular, allowing you to make frostings! Redditor /u/mymagaboo has also informed me that Sukrin comes in Sukrin Gold which is a brown sugar substitute making it extra useful for baking projects.\n\n\n> **EZSweetz/Liquid Splenda/Sucralose:** Remember how I said Splenda can kind of suck? Liquid splenda is actually great compared to its granular cousin, and you will find it often sold as generic liquid Sucralose. This isn‚Äôt the best sweetener ever and is probably the worst on this list of ‚Äúgood ones,‚Äù but it‚Äôs pretty decent as a drop or two in your coffee. It is VERY potent, meaning a single drop often satisfies what a few TBSP of sugar used to. The Da Vinci and Torani syrups use this to be sugar free as well, and they are safe to use.\n\n> **Aspartame:** A lot of comments about this. Aspartame is pretty hated by a lot of health gurus as a \"bad\" sweetener, but I haven't been able to substantiate any of the hate it's gotten.  I have always had diet soda with it and I have never had any issues. A small percentage of people will have an insulin response to it, but research has proven there isn't one. I personally use it, but YMMV.\n\n\n\n\n***Onto the products***\n\n________________________________________________\n\n\nThe main reason I wanted to make this post is I wanted to suggest some good ones, shame some bad ones, and in general help out new ketoers find their substitute sweet.\n\n\n\n\n***Products that are generally bad***\n________________________________________________\n\n\n>**Russell Stover Sugar Free chocolates**: After nearly six months here, I have seen so many posts about these suckers. They are a sham. They use Splenda and Maltitol, they are not low carb, and they will stall you en masse. If your macros can handle it, having 1 or 2 is a fine treat (and technically better than sugar, as it‚Äôs slightly less carbs), but anyone who is snacking on these for their calories will have more cravings and likely be knocked out of ketosis. I have had their sugar free mint patties, one a day, as a dessert for a few weeks to no ill effects but I made sure that I was eating virtually zero carbs the days I did indulge.\n\n>**Hershey‚Äôs Sugar Free Bars/Reeses/etc**: Same deal as Russell Stovers, avoid.\n\n>**Werther‚Äôs Originals/Gummy Bears/Twizzlers/Jelly Belly SF Beans**: Same deal.\n\n>**Asher's Chocolates**: Same deal.\n\n\n>**La Nouba**: La Nouba‚Äôs stuff tastes so good. Sadly most of it uses maltitol. It is a huge shame because they make sugar free marshmallows that taste perfect. They do have chocolate bars with Stevia that are OK.\n\n\n>**Atkins Bars and Candies**: These are another sham. They use maltitol, they will make you feel sick, and their carb count is a bold lie because of the sweetener they use. When they say 3g carbs, it‚Äôs really more like 15-20g *per* bar. If you achieve success eating them, it‚Äôs likely because you stayed under calorie counts or already ate virtually zero carbs meaning you were still in keto after eating one. They aren‚Äôt worth it.\n\n\n>**Beef Jerky**: I just wanted to put this one out here, a lot of people eat jerky without realizing it has been drenched in sugar. Try biltong jerky over the regular stuff as well or get a dehydrator to make your own so you can control what goes in it. Random life tip!\n    \n\n\n\n\n***Products that are good alternatives***\n\n\n________________________________________________\n\n> **ChocZero chocolate**. I love ChocZero. It came out recently and is taking the keto community by storm. But it's really, really good. Their 50% dark is their best by far and they use monk fruit (no sugar alcohols) which makes me love them.\n\n> **Lily‚Äôs chocolate bars**. I‚Äôm not a shill, but I love these things. They taste great, the only downside is they do use Erythritol. They have a lot of flavors as well, I found their regular milk chocolate to be the best with their coconut to also be good.\n\n> **ChocoPerfection**: These taste nearly identical to Lily‚Äôs, slightly harder to get, but just as good. They make a great dark chocolate orange bar.\n\n\n> **Quest bars and Quest cereal bars**: very good protein bars. That said, the cereal bars taste completely different--and I like them a lot more! They taste like cereal granola bars and are 3g carbs a pop, a great dessert.\n\n\n> **Halo Top/Artic Zero**: Some people hate AZ's taste, myself included, but I am including it since so many like it. These two ice cream subsitutes rock. They are very low carb and made with sweeteners that have low GI. If you can afford the calories, add a few TBSP of heavy cream in with them and make it into a milkshake--you will thank me later.\n\n> **Skinny Syrups, Da Vinci Syrups & Torani**: These are sweetened with liquid Splenda and they are awesome for baking as well as coffee and tea. I highly suggest picking these up if you are missing something: I recently did an eggnog flavored tea with their eggnog SF Da Vinci syrup and it was heavenly :)\n\n> **Nutritious Living Hi Lo Cereal**: this one is a mixed bag, it‚Äôs about 5-9g of carbs per serving depending on the flavor. It does use cane sugar. That said, it is a minor amount and has never knocked me out of keto as long as I have one serving (¬Ω a cup). I feel like it is a perfect cereal substitute if you are one of those lazy people who sometimes craves cereal in the morning.  Since it is almost all fiber, it is very filling compared to other higher carb low carb products (err, that came out badly, but you know what I mean?).\n\n\n> **Extremely dark chocolates**: These will be low carb naturally, even if they have a bit of sugar. Most have about 5g of carbs a serving. I personally like Lindt‚Äôs 85-90% in small squares. Easy to track and a great treat to savor with tea.\n\n> **Biltong jerky:** While most jerky is very sugar heavy, some brands won't be. Additionally, biltong jerky is a style of jerky that is very low on sugar. Always check the label, but even sugar heavy brands often make their biltong jerky have only 1-2g carbs an ounce!\n\n> **Epic Bars:** Epic bars are really good albeit very expensive. They make a bacon bar that tastes amazing with no extra sweeteners or anything. Highly suggest them if you are going for a wholesome, filling snack that won't damage your diet.\n\n> **Homemade goods**: These aren‚Äôt as bad to make as you think. Some Swerve, butter, and almond flour literally makes amazing shortbread cookies. In general, you can use almond flour in lieu of regular flour then use Truvia/Swerve/Stevia to cover the sugar and make the majority of the recipes you used to make. There are thousands of awesome recipes online and on r/ketoreceipes. \n\n> **Have any others?** I will add them here, let me know.\n\n\n***The science***\n\n________________________________________________\n\n\nThis is a helpful chart of every GI of every sweetener, including things like honey vs regular sugar. \n\n\n* http://www.sugar-and-sweetener-guide.com/glycemic-index-for-sweeteners.html \n\n\n\n***A few recipes***\n\n________________________________________________\n\nHere are a few recipes I have made while on keto and enjoyed that help with a sweet tooth. There are thousands more, these are just a few I can verify are pretty good and fairly easy to make (I sucked at baking prior!).\n\n* http://alldayidreamaboutfood.com/2016/11/low-carb-cranberry-cheesecake-pie.html\n* http://www.ruled.me/keto-chocolate-cake-mug/ \n* http://www.ruled.me/keto-chocolate-roll-cake/ \n* http://paleomagazine.com/paleo-peppermint-patties-recipe\n\n",

Throw all the other ingredients in a bowl and add in the beef slices. Mix it all up and then transfer everything to a ziploc bag (including all the liquid!). Put that in the fridge overnight. The next day, drain as much liquid as you can and they put each piece of beef on paper towels to dry off any exterior liquid (otherwise it will caramelize and get sticky and gross). I recommend stacking the beef on doubled-up paper towels to get both sides dried off well. Then throw it in the dehydrator for 8-12 hours and you'll be golden. \n\nDust some ground black pepper on there as you fill up a tray for some extra flavor. You can also throw hot sauce in the liquid mix to add some heat as well. And then try not to eat all of it in one day. It'll be tempting, for sure :)",

I did it by allowing myself a few raisins a day. 1 raisin with 1 bite of unsweetened chocolate, chewed together are plenty sweet, and the raisins are easy to control carbs with. Eventually I stopped using the raisins at all; I now love the taste of pure chocolate.\n\nI do like to make chocolate candies, though, and I've been experimenting with different sweeteners. I wish I'd seen this before I bought a bag of Splenda...but erythritol is my go-to sweetener; I was making candy for someone who likes the Splenda.\n\nAnd the flavorings!

    "body": "Hi guys! \n*For title it should be Lasers/Skincare/Beauty Hacks\n*I have tan skin so lasers are a bit complicated due to risk of hyperpigmentation I.e. IPL not mentioned\n\nDISCLAIMER: PLEASE double check this with the science, before/afters, own skin and goals, and research articles. I'm not a dermatologist but a majority of my friend circle are physicians and we all do this anyhow before trying anything. I don't have time to cite articles etc and this is just MY experience SO I thought after spending so much money and buying all the overhyped products I should share what worked for me to reduce my skincare regimen and allow me to be makeup free for work. \n\nSo I've been deep into skincare for a long time and I wanted to officially share it as a lot of my friends asked me to. We don't gatekeep here and I thought Reddit would be the best place. My background: I'm into digital portraits and it requires an understanding of good ratios of the face. I'm also into deep diving into skincare hacks like all of us. Here's what I think works off the top of my head.\n\nProcedures\nUltraclear + Coring: forget ponytail facelifts, lip lifts, belphs, skinpinch, brow lifts, etc until you try this first. A good tech can get you the results you want. Ask to core where you want max lift. Make sure they pass with all the levels. It's painful so use your own numbing cream (I think some Russian brands are stronger available online), numb for a long time, and opt for the laughing gas or whatever. Make sure to have them use eye shields for your eyes. Have them core in the direction of the lift you want. Ask for a map of how they did it. \nYou'll want 2-3 over a year to get the full lift you want. Nothing supersedes this procedure. For healing: 10% vinegar soaks + ointment + Benev exosomes + Alastin skin nectar. Hydroquinone to prevent spots from forming. \n\nMoxi Level 3: It works REALLY well but it's a baby compared to Ultraclear. Make sure to try level 3 for maximum lift. You can do a series of 3 if you're not ready for Ultraclear. \n\nFontana 4D: It also works REALLY well and can contour your cheeks skin the buccal fat removal. Moxi Level3/Fontana 4D def made me hot again after 20lb weight loss causing signs of aging before my wedding.  Again do a series of 3 for max results.\nUltraclear did the most though, I would do all 3 until I die or go broke.\n\nBBL Laser: It works and makes you look like you have foundation on (and gets rid of under eye darkness) but because of techs fears of hyperpigmentation (a real fear) it's hard to find someone to do it. \n\nPRF/EZGEL: My under eyes looked better but also the swelling stretched out the skin so it also looks worse? Not worth it. PRF or PRP is useless, the gel is the only thing worth trying. \n\nLaser Hair Removal: Make sure they are using the newest machine that is practically painless, find a center that does a full body membership it's cheaper, you'll need 8-12 sessions. The painless one is worth it just get it done all over at \n\nMorpheus: painful and melts fat stay away. I did it 3 times, it got rid of my beautiful under eye fat pads, it slimmed my buccal fat, and it got rid of some acne though. It's not worth it due to pain and fat melting and lack of skin tightness effects it so claims. \n\nKatalyst EMS Suit >> Emsculpt: They cost the same and both work but you can keep Katalyst for life. Just use settings on abs/butt and get up to level 400,  you can thank me later! I had Emsculpt 5X on butt and AB's, it works temporary, now we own. 2 Katalyst suits and they make sure fit whenever we want and honestly just as fast. \n\nEmsella: Amazing for sex drive and preventing or helping with prolapse issues! Also works for urinary issues post kids :). Do 6 sessions for prevention and amazing sex. \n\nCoolsculpt: Bullshit. Can burn skin btw. \n\nHIFU: Melts fat. But it works:) so use in the right areas. \n\nJ Plasma: feels like lightening bolts attacking skin and limited outcome, stay away. \n\nPDO Threads: Forget it, painful, invasive, temporary. \n\nOmnilux Redlight Mask: Get the MENS version. It works. \n\nJovs: it breaks apparently l but I'm gonna try it and update yall later. Also curious about Amiro devices given what they say they do/tech they use. \n\nZIIP Halo + Silver Gel >Nuface: It works better than all the other main home microcurrent devices I've tried (nuface, medicube, 2 others on amazon) get the silver serum as daily easy skincare. Forget the other ones. \n\nThings on my list:\nSofwave, Emface (per reviews sounds useless?), Syllifirm, Profound, comment and lmk I'll try it if it sounds safe and effective. \n\nInjections: \nBotox: Prevent wrinkles (but tbh this is BS until you have a baby line forming), get rid of wrinkles, shrinks muscle. What I've liked: TMJ/Jaw Slimming (30-50U per side), TRAP TOX (amazing and makes your neck longer), LIP FLIP, NOSE TIP, BROW LIFT (only do the tail of the brow not the whole brow) and PLATYSMA (prevents face sagging and actually works, prob the most underrated and important area for Botox!).\n\nFiller: Deep Lasers (\"lift\" = volume) >> Sculptra (natural body makes volume) >> Slow Down on Fillers >> Injector >> Price/Injectable. Fly to the right person LA, Miami, or New York. Make sure the area they inject, they do often. Treat multiple areas BUT WITH 1/3 THE ACTUAL DOSE you want and go again twice. This prevents the botched look. Dissolve overfilled lips, it hurts, but it's worth it.\n\nALA/Glutathione/Vit C: Shrinks pores and evens out skin tone. Make sure to add ALA for max pore shrinking. It also helps regulate sugar. You can also opt for liposomal. Go to a reputable IV center and make sure to have labs to get ALA. \n\nPeels/SkinCare:\n30%+ Glycolic Acid On Body - Fast way to clear scars and evens out skin tone. Start low and increase slowly to prevent a burn. \n\nTCA Peel - Amazing for anti-aging tbh. But go to a spa and have them do it (face or full body) because it's more serious. \n\nMusely Spot Cream - Amazing stuff if you're lazy like me and don't like to do 100 things. Combines all the stuff you want for face skincare.\n\nApostrophe Triple Cream for Rosacea - Top 3 ingredients that work for rosacea in 1 bottle. Also look into low dose naltrexone. Also moxi or ultraclear helps.\n\nBenev Exosomes + Microneedling: Use for scars and face/body with a home microneedling pen (max the number of needles Dr Pen is good).\n\nCalecium Exosomes + Microneedling: A godsend for hair growth. \n\nRetinol Gel .1% + Stack With Hydration: get it prescribed. Level up to max %, look up how to layer with coconut oil/moisturizers/Benev to prevent the ugly phase (breakouts, dry skin). Don't need if have Musely spot cream or alternate days.\n\nClindamycin/Benzyl Peroxide Compound Cream: Get it prescribed and store it fridge now. It's the only thing that reliably clears up my acne overnight (I've tried dozens of acne products over 16 years). \n\nAlastin Skin Nectar: My main moisturizer post laser. * Wanted to add for Daily I use Prakti Maha mask because it works like under eye filler almost when you stack it on and gets rid of my acne without extra stuff about 60-70% of the time. I combine with Clarins double serum or snail stuff just depends. Also considering plated exosomes.\n\nOurself Lip Plumping: If you don't want lip filler or just want to maximize lip size try this brand it's from the makers of one of the actual fillers and it works.\n\nMinoxidil>Grandelash>Latisse: Latisse darks eyelids /under eyes and lose eye fat so stay away!! It's so hard to get that fat back!! Use castor oil for eyelash durability and oral minoxidil for eyelash growth. \n\nPills:\n\nOral Minoxidil: Max your eyelashes and hair volume\n\nLow Dose Accutane: Freeze eggs before doing this. Derm will prescribe for chronic acne especially if on back etc. It will also help reduce size of tip of nose if issues with rosacea or thick skin. Gets rid of acne but horrible side effects even at a low dose. \n\nSpirinolactone: NOT FOR ME - will give me headache, dehydration, makes me dumb because I'm so dehydrated, worse breakout for months, also just not worth taking this pill. It may work for others?\n\nEyes: Lumify (duh) \n\nHair: Nanoplastia > Keratin Straightening > KBond20 > Olaplex > Dyson \n\nTeeth: SMILE Whitening (in office dental procedure) INSANE will get you white instantly Request for double frequency teeth cleanings Purple Toothpaste = Safe Alternative to Home Teeth Whitening that works better Boka Nanohhydroxy Toothpaste (so you don't loose enamel) Toothbrush with Water Flosser Combined (another lazy girl hack) Therabreath (contains xylitol known to prevent cavities)\n\nMind Hacks: TDCS headband :) works for insomnia, works for mood I'll copy past all my comments into above later I use Elemind headband + Calm Sleep Powder for sleep after having sleep issues - (don't want to take meds, Benadryl is very bad for long term health and linked to increased dementia risk)\n\nMultivitamin: Make sure it has 5 methylfolate not \"folic\" acid. Try pure encapsulations or if you want to eat food-source multi try TEND prenatal bar chocolate flavor. \n\nVit D: Try to get level to 60-90 it's suppose to help with a lot of things including depression!! Alzheimer prevention! Even used by oncologists to decrese cancer risk!! I take 50k unit every week and recheck my level after a month to make sure it's atleast 80. I used to have depression. \n\nAstaxanthin: 2000x more potent antioxidant than Vit C. It can give you an orangish glow if you overuse or if you're aiming for that! I used to use Vit c and other antioxidants. \n\nOmega 3/DHA (fish derived not algae!): Take it or eat fish it's good for you. DHA 1000mg I've been using for 10 years and it makes me smarter and remember more for exams etc.\n\nSilica Drops + Collagen 10G Daily w Hylaronic Acid + 100G Protein Daily > Nutrafol > Biotin/Hair Nail Vitamins: yes the standard female nutrafol works, I prefer Minodixil it's faster and better for me and less big pills lol.  \n\n1G Water A Day - Eat good food, drink water. Take collagen, eat protein 100G daily, fat 50G daily. Otherwise this is useless. ADD POTASSIUM (prime powder packets) to SLIM FACE SWELLING. Add gua sha or lymph suction drainage also to help. Sauna/Ice Water on Face also works. \n\nLow Fat is a FAD - Hit 50G fat a day - obv is you need to optimize weight lower calories and cut inflammatory food like most non vegetable carbs. You can take a food allergy test also and optimize. For example no tomato skins, no onions for us. \n\nExercise (weights good for bones: BUT for brain benefits it's only with aerobic workouts!): increased bdnf and prevents depression also improved blood flow from skin - look into the research and thank me later - you need to burn 1200cal a week to hit this \n\nDairy Does Cause Breakouts - cut it out and see if there's a change for acne \n\nColustrum: ARMRA works better than others but they all work. It's good for gut health aka good for skin.\n\nSeed Probiotic: the best strains here. \n\nRosacea/Autoimmune Skin Stuff: Look into low dose naltrexone and astaxanthin. Autoimmune issues cause the face to look puffy! \n\nPCOS/Hunger Cravings: Inositol 6G powder or gummy inositol/myoinositol Vitamin: Tend Prenatal Bar (hate daily pills) Gummy CoQ10 200mg Tru Niagen NAD+ (gives me energy) OM matcha mushroom powder (this flavor specifically has a blend that makes me happy/laughing next day, I use when stressed) Silica Drops (makes my hair shiny, nails stronger within weeks) Zinc Picolinate 30mg (if sick or acne) Fisetin (or Qualia monthly) gets rid of dead cells I just feel good when I take it Vital Protein Collagen/Hylaronic Acid Dessicated Beef Liver or Shilajit (micronutrients) Multivitamin: Pure Encapsulations ONE\n\nI don't take pills daily except multivitamin or depending on my aim. But these are what work for me and what I've read that makes sense and I've tried without side effects and some benefit x Inpsitol is a miracle that everyone should know about it'll legit make you less anxious too\n\nDeodorant: Chlorella Liquid (removes body odor) > Native > Certaindri. want to try the weekly devices out there that actually stop sweating but weighing risks. Native covers me all day smelling good and I used to sweat through EVERYTHING. \n\nNails: basic - sally hansen hard as nails clear (drop 3-4 magenta drops of any brand in for a natural pink nail look) -  silica drops make nails tough af - only do RUSSIAN manicures they are magic thank me later\n\nSUN: the sun is your enemy for skincare, it's time to be aware of this all the time! Legally UV tint the max of your front car window (there's a way to uv protect without darkening so it's legal). Always wear long sleeves or a hat. Cover face with hand when walking and unprotected. I use supergoop clear sun stick because I'm lazy and it's a stick and doesn't have white caste. I'm sure there's better ones but this is the best clear stick I found. The powder makeup ones are BS and don't actually protect you. A HAT + Long Sleeves >>\n\nWeight Loss: I have a chubby face if my BMI is above 19 genetically. Find the BMI you need for optimizing your face. I drink all my water before eating. I drink black decaf with monk fruit (stevia is not as safe, Splenda is bad news) instead of lattes. I put all\nmy food on a salad instead of rice. I don't eat grain carbs because it makes me bloated. I eat spinach daily because it has highest potassium (reduces face bloating). I try to have have less than 1.5G salt daily. I also make sure there is IODINE in my salt for my thyroid (pink salt is causing iodine deficiencies and thus thyroid issues!). No dairy because it gives me acne (try cashew milk 25 cal). I hit 100G protein via NATURAL NO POWDER sources. Then I sleep by getting my fat intake (50g) and veggies cooked with seasoning I like or whatever I want to eat (kind of a baby Intermittant fast but more lax). If I'm craving sweets I eat frozen fruit and add fake honey (monk fruit sweetened avail sprouts). \n\n\nIf you made it this far, the most important thing is to be at a healthy weight, eat right, drink water, no alcohol (I've heard from friends: Passion flower extract \"anxiety\" > IV NAD (addiction)), no smoking(I've heard from friends: Chantix > Wellbutrin> Nicotine Patch > Tapering Nicotine Vape ), no all nighters (if insomnia look above TDCS headband elemind > Calm Sleep Powder > Sublingual Melatonin). \n\nThis is all I could think of but I've tried a lot feel free to DM me.\nI've also deep dived into fertility and dementia stuff for friends/family! If you want reccs DM! You can fact check me but I research this stuff just like we all do so you'll find out or realize this is likely the consensus. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

I have under eye bags that looks so so ugly I wish it was just dark I wouldn‚Äôt care, have been spending on PRP it only stays or looks tight for a day and goes back the next day. Never heard about a gel, I assume it‚Äôs a gel product they will sell and I will apply at home. BBLazer I am so wanting a skin like that, foundation look so I am going to find out with all the places if they do, I until now have done peels like clear skin malanage that gives this look too but only for 15 days.

    "body": "Friday night, I fell asleep on the couch. My one year old french bulldog somehow jumped on top of the dining room table and snagged, opened, and ingested 15-20 pieces of grape Icebreaker gum.\n\nI wake up to a pile of puke with roughly 15 pieces of the gum in it, pretty much unchewed. Not knowing the toxicity level, with him acting pretty much OK Saturday morning, I am wary but not panicking. Long story short, by 4 PM Saturday night I am admitting him to the ER. Within an hour of admitting him and the vet contacting poison control, they tell me his liver is failing and its 50/50 at best if he will make it. They've had him on a series of plasma transfusions since to try to help repair his liver levels. He is far from out of the woods but starting to show some progress. His blood is not clotting properly, which puts him at high risk for internal bleeding. His \"PT level\" is now down to 25% after being off the charts. Put another way, his blood is clotting 25% slower than it should be. It needs to be sustained under 20% to lower the risk and to be on the path to full or near full recovery.\n\nShame on me for not calling the vet ASAP Saturday morning. I had no clue what Xylitol was and how incredibly dangerous it is to dogs. And how many things it is in - all sugar free gum, many candies, mints, and even a lot of baked goods. The poison control people and vet said that even ingesting one piece of Icebreaker gum can be very dangerous and my dog ingested at least 15. And that the vast majority of the Xylitol is on the outside of the gum, meaning they don't even have to ingest it.\n\nMy little guy is now fighting for his life, literally. And the vet bills are already at like $7-$8K. I have Healthy Paws insurance but am unsure what it will cover. Wanted to take a moment to make this post in the event it helps prevent the same for happening for one other pooch.",

        "body": "Update ...\n\nBut before I go there, heartfelt thanks to the many people that left nice comments and well wishes. I have gotten next to no sleep these last three days waiting to call the hopsital for my next update every 5-6 hours and the comments were very uplifting today during a tense day.\n\nWas a good day for Frankie. After his fifth plasma transfusion this morning at 11 AM EST, his blood coag levels dropped from -25% to -20%, which is the level they want to see. So they did not give him a 6th transfusion to see how his levels would react. As of 6 PM, they were still at -20%. They're rechecking his levels tonight at midnight.\n\nHis ALT liver test that was sent out Saturday when I admitted him also came back. Its a test that shows liver damage. If your liver is damaged, it will release more ALT into your blood and levels will rise. The high end of what they want to see is 118. Frankie's was 10,000. Yes, four zeroes. They're rerunning it in the morning. Based on the fact he's doing clinically well and his coag levels have stabilized, the doc is hoping to see that come back at 5,000 but said she'd be happy with any improvement.\n\nStill very touch and go with him, but the doc used the term \"cautiously optimistic\" for the first time. She said a best case scenario would be continued stabilization of the blood coag levels, an improved ALT test, and he may be able to go home with medication Wednesday.\n\nDoc said he continues to be in good spirits. Like all Frenchies, he is a food obsessed maniac. They said he is the hit of the hospital with the staff, who all have funny nicknames for him. They said he's freaking out (in a funny way) when the critically ill dogs are given chicken and he's given regular dog food. And when they take him outside on walks, he's barking and lunging at cars and people in the parking lot and whining when they try to bring him back inside.\n\nKeep him in your thoughts. Glad my initial post had value to people and so, so, so appreciate all the nice comments! Felt like they helped my little guy today!",

But when I was in an apartment in college I was playing games in my room came out to see him chewed up on the floor cleaned it up and went ‚Äúoh Finley‚Äù threw it out and went back when I had the thought ‚ÄúI wonder if dogs can eat gum?‚Äù So I googled it and my heart sunk, I called the vet rushed her there and they made her puke and said the margin for error was really close and she could be in danger since I wasn‚Äôt sure how many she had ate, but her vomit was pink so she definitely had some.  I watched her all night long giving her treats and making sure she was okay.  Luckily she never had anything but lethargy.  If I didn‚Äôt take her idk what would have happened, it‚Äôs definitely something people need to know more of because people know the chocolate, but that‚Äôs close to 300mg/kg so a 25kg dog needs almost 7g to kill them a reasonably high amount needed to ingest.  Xylitol though has an LD50 of .1g per kg, meaning you only need 2.5g of it, which is well within a single packet of gum.  The moment I told my family about this my mom through out all the gum in the house to be safe.  It‚Äôs something most just don‚Äôt know about, similarly with grapes people just don‚Äôt know because people know chocolate and onions so much.\n\nI‚Äôm sorry to hear about your dog though, please keep us updated on how he‚Äôs doing and hopefully he pulls through.",

    "body": "So yesterday I made a post about Iris eating xylitol gum and update is that she started acting a bit sleepy so took her to the vet. I knew that xylitol can lead to increase insulin production (low blood sugar) and she was fine there but apparently xylitol can also lead to sudden liver failure so I decided to take her to a hospital. The good thing about this hospital is that I could stay with her in a room with a bed so we hung out all night. The staff absolutely loved her (she got lonely when I had to leave for a few hours and they sat with her until I could come back, she is crate trained but I think she knew that crying would work with them hahaha). Although I got basically no sleep she had a lot of fun making new friends and played dress up with them (as seen in the first photo) üôÑ. Anywho, she is all good as of right now and I‚Äôm thinking that she threw it all up yesterday. Gonna get some more blood work tomorrow and if that‚Äôs all good then we are probably fully good!\n\nDefinitely a lesson learned for me that she needs to still be locked up in a puppy proof room when I cannot fully supervise her and to check all products that come into my house for xylitol. I‚Äôve never had a dog get into as much stuff as she gets into (and I grew up with a lab) usually at this point my dogs have had full range of the house but she clearly needs a bit more time hahaha! Judging from all the photos taken I can definitely see that she would do it again in a heartbeat.",

And if you have a cats... well I'm not quite sure why you would have a cat instead of a dog, but you probably still shouldn't poison them. \n\nHere's the list of foods that can make your pets ill. Some of them can be fatal: \n\n* Chocolate-- fast heart rate, hallucinations, severe diarrhea, epileptic seizures, heart attacks, internal bleeding, and eventually death\n\n* Ethanol (Alcohol)-- animals are generally more susceptible to alcohol than humans are. The caveats here are similar to alcohol poisoning in humans. \n\n* Raw yeast dough--  intestinal obstruction and/or ethanol poisoning \n\n* Hops (beer hops) Edit: the plant, not necessarily beer itself. --  malignant hyperthermia in dogs, usually with fatal results\n\n* Avocados-- possible damage to the heart muscle cells, leading to heart failure\n\n* Grapes/raisins-- acute kidney failure\n\n* Macadamia nuts-- non-fatal stiffness, tremors, hyperthermia, and abdominal pain\n\n* Onions, garlic, shallots, etc.--  hemolytic anemia\n\n* Xylitol (sweetner found in gum and other sugar-free things)-- toxic or even fatal liver damage\n\n* Moldy or rotten food-- some molds produce toxins called tremorgenic mycotoxins, which can cause serious or even life-threatening problems if ingested by dogs.\n\n* Raw meats and raw eggs-- Salmonella and E. coli can be bad. Raw eggs contain an enzyme called avidin that decreases the absorption of biotin (a B vitamin), which can lead to skin and coat problems.\n\n* Salt-- Large amounts of salt can produce excessive thirst and urination, or even sodium ion poisoning in pets; vomiting, diarrhea, depression, tremors, elevated body temperature, seizures and even death.\n\n* Milk-- mammals are naturally lactose intolerant \n\n* Bones-- choking hazard; splintering can cause damage to soft tissues. \n\nNow here's a shitty picture of my dog being [weird.](http://i.imgur.com/1CArC4w.jpg?1) \n\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control/people-foods-avoid-feeding-your-pets\n\nhttp://www.aspca.org/pet-care/virtual-pet-behaviorist/dog-behavior/foods-are-hazardous-dogs\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_health#Dangerous_foods\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_health#Toxic_substance\n\nEdit:\n\nBecause a lot of people are unhappy about the raw meat/bones, it should probably be clarified that a lot of raw meat isn't really healthy for your dogs/cats, especially if they aren't used to it. So if you're pet has been eating 3 pounds of raw meat every day for the past 8 years, you're probably safe; if your pet's food is primarily pet food, then you should probably be careful. \n\nAnd about the bones, I know for a fact that bones can splinter and lodge in soft tissues internally. Chicken bones are the worst in my experience, though beef and pork have never made my animals sick. \n\nEdit 2: ffs, feed your dogs all the raw meat you want. See if I care!\n\nEdit 3: to be more correct, mammals are lactose intolerant outside of their infancy",

Years of planning and preparation, training and drills without end‚Äîall of it was for this day alone.\n\nOf all the many trials placed before my unit, the worst of them had to be that dreaded surgery: removing the indicators of our divine heritage to blend us in with the blaspheming masses of this cursed nation. Without the glorious markings of our gods, we had no longer a place within the mortal realm. Following this mission, each of us was to dispose of themselves using hidden capsules of concentrated xylitol‚Äîone of the deadliest natural poisons on Archesa. However, with the passing of our mortal vessels, my unit‚Äôs place in paradise was assured.\n\nSpeaking, however, of poisons, transporting our intended payload was a stressful endeavor indeed. Despite my concerns regarding the Talon‚Äôs use and protests for something more straightforward, the powder-bomb option nevertheless won out in the war of ideas. C17H21NO4‚Äîbetter known as ‚ÄòSoulhealer‚Äôs Talon‚Äô‚Äîwas said to be a most fitting ambrosia to the gods: creating within them an intense intoxication. Such glory, however, was not fit for mortal consumption. To them, it was pleasure; yet to us, a great poison. Fitting, my comrades argued, that the heretic leader should die by it‚Äîa reminder that even their greatest demagogue was nothing before the might of our gods.\n\nEntering the heretic leader‚Äôs decadent palace was a most difficult thing to plan for. Even with the gods on our side, we could not afford to be reckless. Small armies of armed guards waited in every corner of that cursed castle of crass noncompliance. Initially, the plan was for half of our unit to distract the soldiers with a small hostage situation outside while the other half went in for the kill. The heretic leader‚Äôs chef apparently had made nest with a Temeniin, and from their unholy union gave rise to a child bearing but one of our gods‚Äô marks. And so, we took her for ourselves. Our demands to him were simple: ‚Äòdo as we say, and your spawn will be allowed to live amongst us. Fail, and she shall face the consequences of her heretical heritage‚Äô. Such persuasion was thankfully enough to draw this chef onto the path of righteousness.\n\nFortunately for us, the first half of our plan would ultimately prove unnecessary. High Priest Yelat himself was the one whom had passed on the information; gleaned, I‚Äôm sure, from his correspondence with the gods. It seemed that in their hubris, the heretics had laid out for us a proverbial welcome mat. Their heathen leader was to be receiving soon an important guest, and as a curious result would be calling off much of his defensive legion‚Äîa perfect opportunity to strike.\n\n‚ÄúAre you yet prepared, brother Riftik?‚Äù My comrade asked me, leaning forth from the backseat of our moving transport with excitement in his voice. Takeel and I had known each other since we were but hatchlings‚Äîboth of us constantly pushing our counterparts to greater heights, from climbing the tallest trees to seeing who could fast the longest and all the way into combat training, the two of us were as good of friends as they came.\n\nSmoothing over my nerve ruffled feathers, I clicked affirmatively before turning round to face my dearly-known crew. Okathi was his usual stoic self, more concerned with the gentle polishing of his Hearthflame rifle than anything going on around him; up to and including the obvious advances of Spiritual Warfare Specialist Lika, who by this point was busying herself trying to obtain his attention.\n\nUnder the usual circumstances, someone so vulnerable as Lika would never be allowed on a suicide mission like this; that being said, her uncanny talent for understanding and deceiving heretics made her a necessity for this task. Her elegant stride and lustrous feathers painted together the very picture of Temeniin beauty even after our surgical mutilation. This, supplemented with a cunning wit allowed her to talk her way into or out of whatever situation she so desired. Perhaps it was for the better, then, that she selected Okathi in her quest for shallow gratification. The man possessed for our gods a single-minded zeal I myself could only pray to understand after death, making him far more difficult to distract than her usual targets.\n\n‚ÄúLook well for the gods, everyone!‚Äù I squawked merrily, awakening without delay the sleeping soldiers Gevik and Coru as I continued my squad leader speech. ‚ÄúToday for us shall be the final and most glorious of our lives. I hope you‚Äôre all prepared, for today we deliver judgment once and for all to their blasphemous mortal master!‚Äù\n\nExcited chirps and whistles rippled across our transport as each of my colleagues variously cheered to the heavens and prayed to our gods. Qew, however, noticeably declined to participate, instead maintaining a gaze fixed upon the floor. His attitude throughout our journey was‚Ä¶ *disconcerting* to say the least. And so, being the leader of our merry crew, I took it upon myself to speak with him.\n\n‚ÄúIs something amiss, Qew?‚Äù I asked, noting with interest the way he flinched upon hearing my words. ‚ÄúA feather‚Äôs width from paradise and yet here you are, moping so morosely. Tell me, brother: whatever is it that‚Äôs rattled you so?‚Äù\n\nFor a moment, the youngest of our unit did not reply, maintaining his gaze firmly affixed to the floor with an expression I could only identify as fear. ‚ÄúAre‚Ä¶ Are we *sure* this is that the gods desire?‚Äù He asked shakily, glancing up toward me before promptly shriveling away upon the linking of our gazes. ‚ÄúFor us to die‚Ä¶ Do they really want that?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúQew‚Ä¶‚Äù I hummed softly, reaching out behind the driver‚Äôs seat to place upon his shoulder a comforting claw. ‚ÄúWhy are you so afraid? You know our gods are beyond this facade we call death, yes?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù Again, he hesitated, casting his gaze out the tinted window of our transport as though admiring the creation which surrounded us. ‚ÄúOf course, sir‚Ä¶‚Äù He then murmured, returning attention to the briefcase settled betwixt his legs‚Äîthe very same one containing our poisonous payload.\n\nAccepting for the moment our youngest member‚Äôs naive lack of godly zeal, I returned my attention to our assigned driver, Niqis, and continued. ‚ÄúHow many more heretic checkpoints must we contend with?‚Äù I asked, noting the bored expression painting our infiltration specialist‚Äôs countenance as he slowly began easing our vehicle to a stop before a small blockade of military vehicles.\n\n‚ÄúThis is the last one.‚Äù He grumbled, quickly silencing the others‚Äô chitchat with a fearsome glare. ‚ÄúRemember, fellow acolytes: we are Zyntrish special forces here on a ‚Äòcode Northeast‚Äô‚Äîemergency security detail; no time for inspections. Understood?‚Äù\n\nNo sooner had the sum of our unit voiced their understanding than was the door flung open by Niqis as he promptly paraded the building security towards us. Two minutes of brief conversation and a small sprinkle of sweet talk from Lika later, we were walking through the blasphemer‚Äôs garden on approach to an auxiliary gateway.\n\nWaiting patiently for Coru to work his gods-given talent upon the wrought iron gate‚Äôs trio of complicated locks, I once again returned my attention to the fellowship of followers around me. ‚ÄúI will lead us in prayer while we wait‚Ä¶‚Äù I began, folding both claws around my heart in reverence and watching as my allies did the same. ‚ÄúHearthsage‚Ä¶ Soulhealer‚Ä¶ Elderscribe; gods of equivalent greatness and renown!‚Äù\n\n*Clink!* resounded the first padlock, falling to the ground with a clatter of reverence to the gods ‚ÄúToday, we honor your names and carry out your judgment against the evils of the nonbelievers.‚Äù\n\n*Clack!* ‚ÄúPlease guide us in this final line of our living hymns so that we may molt our mortal plumage and join you amongst the stars for all eternity‚Äî‚Äù\n\n*Clonk!* finally, as the last lock fell, I concluded our prayer with the usual worshippers‚Äô haiku and stepping forth toward Coru nudged open the gate before finally stepping forth into the courtyard‚Äôs back area.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs finally happening‚Ä¶‚Äù Takeel chirped excitedly, joining alongside me as our band of merry sacrifices approached a back door set against the decadent den‚Äôs wall. Unlike Qew, my best friend held in his heart no hesitation for our divine task. ‚ÄúI cannot wait to meet the gods‚Ä¶‚Äù he continued with tears of joy slipping down his face.\n\nAs per usual, Okathi had little to say, sparing us not a single idle word as he stalked up to the door and wrapped his claws thrice against it, signaling to the chef inside that those worthy of existence have arrived.\n\n‚ÄúGot the lights, Gevik?‚Äù I asked, watching as my comrade picked open a nearby junction box and haphazardly took to cutting its wires, darkening the windows high above us as Goldnest‚Äôs power cut out, retaking from these heretics the stolen light of Hearthsage.\n\nMoments later, the entrance before us creaked open as peeking through came the terrified eyes of our host, no doubt contemplating now how best to frame his sins before the gods‚Äô judgment. ‚ÄúY-you‚Ä¶‚Äù He stammered fretfully, casting open the door defending him and allowing us inside without a mote‚Äôs resistance.\n\n‚ÄúWhere is the heretic Salkim?‚Äù Gevik growled, shoving the chef down onto the ground and placing a claw onto his throat.\n\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôs‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs in the dining room‚Ä¶ With his guest!‚Äù Our contact whimpered, sighing in relief as my subordinate promptly lifted off his foot. ‚ÄúNow, please‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve done all you asked‚Ä¶ Just let me and my daughter go!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYour daughter will be fine; you have my word about that.‚Äù I cooed gently, angling my rifle down toward his prone form. ‚ÄúYou, however‚Ä¶‚Äù Momentarily squeezing down upon the trigger, I hummed with satisfaction as a bullet rocked into the heretic‚Äôs cranium, silencing the blasphemer once and for all.\n\nNary another word rose up between my allies as Qew set down the briefcase and meticulously took to unlatching it, retrieving from within after a ponderous period one small cylindrical canister of ‚ÄòTalon‚Äô and handing it obediently to myself. Stalking toward the dining room door and wrapping my free claw around its handle, I shivered with excitement as from from behind this obstruction came a voice I recognized from our video briefing‚Äîthe voice of the heretic leader.\n\nCarefully easing open the door and cringing upon its loud groan of complaint, I chuckled to myself as finally Salkim‚Äôs sinful silhouette fell into view. ‚ÄúAh, Thrick!‚Äù He called out, referring to me by his former chef‚Äôs name in utter ignorance of the end soon to befall him. ‚ÄúI was wondering where you‚Äî‚Äú\n\nUnwilling to further entertain this comic facade, I trilled happily to myself as my claw flicked off the canister‚Äôs pin and slid it it across the floor, stopping just short of the Prime Minister‚Äôs seat. It was done. Within my mind‚Äôs eye, I was already sitting at the gods‚Äô table, accepting their words of approval like the greatest of trophies. However, in my own hubris I had unfortunately failed to scan the mortal room before my toss. After all, what was a few more dead heretics in the grand scheme of our plan? A bonus, that‚Äôs what!\n\nI was a fool‚Ä¶\n\nThough at first, I had assumed my eyes to be deceiving me, soon it became clear that the shadowy figure darting toward my grenade was no illusion. I watched first in confusion as this stranger curled their form around the canister, waiting there on the floor until finally the weapon detonated with a *pop*, sending into the figure‚Äôs face a puff of Talon drastically hindered by it‚Äôs body‚Äôs obstruction. *How unfortunate‚Ä¶* I though at first, surveying the figure‚Äôs motionless body. Frustrating as it was that our display‚Äôs meaning had fallen flat as a result of this sacrifice, one suicidal stranger would hardly be enough to save Salkim from a hail of bullets, after all!\n\nThen, the stranger stood once more‚Ä¶",

Surely, I thought, these were but empty speculation. Heretics were by birthright blind to the matters of divinity; spiritual stillborns incapable of true worship. They could not possibly comprehend the demonic, let alone accept aid from it.\n\nHowever, standing before this mysterious creature‚Äîdiminutive in stature, with a flat snout and gruesome scaleless skin like a mutilated chick‚ÄîI could think of no other explanation. What else could do easily shrug off Soulhealer‚Äôs Talon? What other monstrosity could be so enraged by the gods‚Äô ambrosia? This‚Ä¶ This *thing* could be nothing else but a Demon!\n\nSuddenly, killing the heretic leader no longer seemed to matter. Now, our objective was to defeat blasphemy incarnate‚Ä¶ Or at the very least to survive it.\n\nFlinging open the door to allow my comrades a better view of the abomination before us, I grabbed my sidearm and quickly set to unloading upon it. Following my lead, Okathi readied his rifle and began to charge, displaying his nigh-divine fire rate for all to see as behind us, Gevik and Coru supplemented our fire with intermittent bursts of their own, absolutely peppering the Demon in projectiles.\n\nRegardless, however, of our onslaught's veracity, the unholy creature before us appeared utterly unfazed. In fact, if anything, all we succeeded in doing was pissing it off. Lurching forth with horrid preternatural speed and effortlessly yanking away Okathi‚Äôs rifle before wrapping its disgusting, clawless tendrils around his neck, the creature roared furiously as it threw him to the ground and positioned its foot atop his head.\n\nI‚Äôd never heard Okathi scream before‚Ä¶ Years of knowing the man had solidified in my mind the image of an unflappable bulwark of faith. Dozens of times, I‚Äôd seen the man staring down death‚Äôs barrel and offering nary a shrug. That being said, hearing my comrade‚Äôs piercing shriek as the Demon brought down its leathery hoof into his skull‚Äîculminating in a meaty *squelch* as my ally‚Äôs head splattered against the nearby wall like an overripe sorka fruit‚ÄîI could feel the beginnings of panic settling over me.\n\nFollowing along with my increasingly frantic fire, Takeel quickly readied his own firearm and continued on in vain the late Okathi‚Äôs attempt to fell it with mortal weaponry. Down to my sidearms‚Äôs fourth and final bullet, I steadied myself with a breath before firing it directly into the creature‚Äôs forehead, prompting from this thing naught more than a roar of fury. The sound of a body hitting the ground behind me conjured a glance over my shoulder to find Coru sputtering on the floor. Given the choice between facing down the brutality of this Demon and a relatively painless death by xylitol, evidently my comrade had chosen the latter.\n\nFuriously lunging toward our firing line with reckless disregard for the projectiles hurled it‚Äôs way, the heretic‚Äôs pet abomination howled in rage as it reached out and took hold of Takeel‚Äôs snout, ripping him away from us with a mighty yank and sandwiching his head between its freakish palms, slowly compressing down upon him until at last came the horrid *crack* of his skull giving way.\n\n‚ÄúBlasphemer!‚Äù Shouted Gevik, tossing aside his presumably empty rifle and charging the Demon with his combat baton at the ready. I could do nothing save for watch as my comrade‚Äôs strikes did little more than further enrage the already-fuming nightmare before us. Hopelessly tossing toward it my now-empty sidearm, I fiddled about beneath my uniform and at last produced a melee weapon of my own‚Äîthe blessed dagger used in our blood sacraments.\n\nAlas, whilst I was busy rummaging through my satchel for the improvised weapon, the creature wasted no time in finishing off poor Gevik; tossing him against the far wall with spine-shattering force. ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù I called out, pleading to the gods for my friend to remain with me for just a moment longer. We were supposed to meet them together‚Äîto dine in the divines‚Äô great hall side-by-side. All that was ruined, however, by this Demon.\n\nTears streamed down my face as I charged our attacker with reckless abandon, caring no longer for my former mission. Now, this was about revenge! Narrowly weaving beneath a wide swing from the abomination, I raised my dagger high and murmuring a brief prayer to the gods plunged it forth toward where a Kafel‚Äôs heart would be. The janky movements of my opponent, however, largely mitigated my attack as it shifted its weight moments before my attack would land, forcing the dagger into its arm.\n\nStabbing weapons were uncommon in war‚Äîand for good reason! Even heretics could fight on for a long time with stab and puncture wounds peppering their mortal husks. However, of all the armaments to be effective here, the knife was one which I had least expected. Clearly it was the blessed status of this weapon which caused pain to our Demonic foe. Seeing this display, my admiration for the gods‚Äô wisdom grew eightfold: for every challenge they set before us, so too did they provide us tools with which to overcome their tests.\n\nUnfortunately, my last-ditch attack was too little too late. Immediately shoving me back in retaliation for its wound, the Demon roared in fury as it sent me flying spine-first into Lika, sending a jolt of pain through my system and laying the both of us out upon the ground as it staggered forth toward our final standing acolyte. ‚ÄúP-please!‚Äù Qew pleaded, holding out his claws in self-defense as the nightmare before us drew ever-closer. ‚ÄúI surrender! J-just don‚Äôt kill me!‚Äù\n\nI could hardly believe my ears. For something petty as sparing himself mortal death, this coward was abandoning our gods. So infuriated was I by this revelation that had I a bullet left in my sidearm, it would‚Äôve gone straight into the Traitor‚Äôs empty skull. But I had no bullets left, and regardless of my desires to move, my body simply wouldn‚Äôt comply.\n\nBeneath me, our female ally had already begun the process of ingesting her pill, dislodging it with her tongue and quickly swallowing down the sweet mercy of a quick death. Perhaps, I reasoned, she had the right idea. This was not a fight we could win‚Äînot against such an unstoppable juggernaut of heresy. ‚ÄúCurse‚Ä¶ You‚Ä¶ Qew!‚Äù I coughed, swallowing down the xylitol and welcoming the sweet embrace of death. Hopefully, the gods would forgive my failure.",

He was right to curse me, for what I had done was a betrayal of the highest order. Why did I surrender? Why couldn't I bring myself to simply accept my fate and pop the xylitol? All these thoughts and more rattled through my mind as I tentatively tested the strength of my restraints.\n\n*Maybe if I can escape and bring back the knowledge of what we've learned, the gods will forgive me!* This, however, was a pipe dream at best. Trapped in the heretics' lair with no actionable avenue for deliverance, my only real option was to play along with their twisted games.\n\nPerhaps, I reasoned to myself, the heretics were keeping me as a sacrifice to their demonic pet. Every time I closed my eyes, I could see the awful thing. Legends said that Talon served as a calming agent to our gods; inducing within them a pleasant, dreamlike state. This creature, however, was no god. The fact that a holy substance enraged it so only confirmed what we already knew: this... This *thing* was the precise antithesis to our gods' holiness.\n\nI cringed as the sound of a creaking door indicated the heretic's arrival. Whatever tortures to which I was about to be subjected would surely make my former option of a quick death outright merciful by comparison. Unfortunately, the heretics were smart enough to forcibly remove my toxic capsule‚Äîthough I was slightly sedated at the time, I distinctly recalled one of their surgeons plucking it from my mouth like a harmless cyanide mint and in doing so depriving me of the gods' sweet embrace.\n\nMy train of thought, however, was rather abruptly interrupted when into the room stepped that creature which would surely haunt my darkest nightmares for so long as I may live. The Demon which had with such ease dispatched us was now stood over my helpless form. \"Guess who I brought!\" The heretic interrogator taunted, regarding my newfound bout of struggling with a short click of laughter.\n\n\"No! Please!\" I whimpered, my logical thought processes once again overridden by a faithless drive for self-preservation. I could never admit it to my fellow believers, but I did not wish to be a martyr. I simply lacked the faith. Now, however, the hopelessness of my situation was finally beginning to kick in. I couldn't handle torture. In fact, much as I hated to admit it, I actually had to cheat on the willpower test by taking painkillers beforehand, allowing me to hold out for the minimum time.\n\nSlowly stepping toward me with the grace of a stalking Gashi, the Demon regarded my helpless form with a look in it's eyes I could only reason to be deceptive in nature. Had I not known any better, I might almost assume it to be pitying me. \"Your name what?\" It asked primitively, eyeing me up and down like one would a particularly delectable meal.\n\nOf course, I knew better than to give a demon my name. \"Three gods in equal renown; Hearthsage, Soulhealer, and Elderscribe... I am their servant and you, demon, will n-not break me!\"\n\nAt first, my reply seemed to confuse the creature, evidently defying its expectations of an easy mark. That being said, there was no time to celebrate my small victory, as immediately following my reply the heretic interrogator retrieved from his terrible toybox an instrument I recognized from training: the shock prod. Without skipping a beat, the blasphemer jammed the tool's two sharp prods into my neck, sending through it an electrical current which prompted from me a pained squeal akin to that of a hatchling.\n\nVisibly disconcerted by this Redscale's method, I watched as the Demon quickly lunged from behind him and effortlessly plucked the device from my torturer's hands. Compact stature aside, this thing was far stronger than the average Kafel, leaving little chance for my tormentor to retrieve his tool. Fear flooded my conscious thought as I watched the creature ponder this device, clearly contemplating how to cause me the most pain with it.\n\nClosing my eyes, I awaited helplessly the oncoming torture. Seconds passed like hours as I awaited the horrid machinations of pure malevolence this creature would surely delight in. However, when no such pain presented itself, I risked opening my eyes to steal a glance as I saw this Demon casting aside the shock prod. Clearly, whatever it was capable of would far outclass a tool or mortal interrogation.\n\n\"Chose not die...\" The Demon began curiously, removing my arm restraints and allowing me to sit up. Whatever it's game, clearly the creature sought beforeclaw to lull me into a false sense of security, and evidently had convinced the Redscale to acquiesce, judging by the brief conversation which concluded with it once again turning toward me. \"Why?\" It continued, forcing me to think for a moment as I pondered the meaning of such a question.\n\n\"What does it matter?\" I grumbled, laying back down and directing my gaze toward the drab concrete ceiling. \"Everyone else is with the gods now. I was simply too cowardly to jump the nest...\"\n\nAgain appearing baffled by my answer, this creature continued its verbal assault. \"Mind-cleaned...\" It muttered to itself, momentarily confusing me with the term evidently borrowed from its demonic tongue. \"Hear! You tell us, we help you!\" It continued, moving around it's strange appendages as though to punctuate the words escaping it's flat snout.\n\n\"Never...\" I hissed, resisting the Demon's temptation with a halfhearted display of my teeth‚Äîthe last semblance of a weapon available to me in this trying time.\n\nSilence sliced through the air like a dagger as without another word the creature began making it's way around to my side, placing its uncannily-warm fingers beneath my chin and leaning in to provide me a better look at its freakish facsimile of a face.\n\n\"Okay! Okay! I'll tell you!\" I whimpered, unable for the time to contain my terror and once again allowing fear to guide me from the gods' path. Nevertheless, however, my answer appeared to appease the creature before me, as it promptly removed its meaty talons from around my neck and once again set to speaking.\n\n\"Friends died. You didn't. Why?\"\n\nHanging my head in shame and narrowly holding back tears, I replied. \"Like I said; I was too afraid to die! I regret my weakness now...\" I confessed, hoping and praying the gods might hear my plea and simply strike me down as I asked. The gods, of course, did not work that way. I had abandoned them, and they in turn have done the same to me.\n\n\"Not weak,‚Äù the heretic beast began, placing its disgustingly smooth claw between my neck and arm. Tears coalesced within my eyes as despite its horrid nature, the Demon‚Äôs touch nevertheless comforted my weary soul. ‚ÄúYou are strong‚Ä¶‚Äù it affirmed. By this point, I could contain my emotions no longer. Fear for what would soon happen to me. Anger for what I‚Äôd done‚Äîor more accurately what I hadn‚Äôt. Hatred for the heretics and their betrayal of divine order‚Ä¶ All of it was just too much.\n\nAnd just like that, I began to sob. Suddenly, it felt as though the responsibility placed upon my young yet tired shoulders had multiplied eightfold, and now finally I was given the opportunity to set them down. I could hardly believe how badly my treacherous mind wanted me to throw it all away.\n\n*Whatever it says, don‚Äôt you dare believe it!* The gods‚Äô voice echoed in my head, reminding me that this thing was in no say like a Kafel. It wasn‚Äôt comforting me; it was trying to butter me up so I‚Äôd betray my divine masters! ‚ÄúShut up!‚Äù I hissed, desperate to silence this creature before it could further taint my thoughts with it‚Äôs perverse persuasions. ‚ÄúGods‚Ä¶‚Äù I murmured, prompting from this horrid creature a small recoiling of surprise. ‚ÄúForgive me, for I have no other choice‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nThen, with silent fanfare an idea materialized within my mind. A beautiful thought surely brought down from on high. *If I can gain their trust as a ‚Äòvictim‚Äô of ‚Äòfalse‚Äô teachings, perhaps I could sabotage the heretics from within‚Ä¶* If this demon wanted to turn me against my own people, then it was surely mistaken.\n\nSuddenly, the discolored skin around the demon‚Äôs mouth began to contort into what I could only presume was a gesture of false sympathy. ‚ÄúYour name what?‚Äù It asked‚Äîit‚Äôs question seemingly coming as a surprise to my interrogator. *So even they cannot truly control it‚Ä¶ Fascinating!*\n\n‚ÄúQew‚Ä¶‚Äù I began, allowing without restraint my tears of former failure to flow down my face. Perhaps this was the opportunity intended by our gods‚Äîfor me to be captured and to deceive these heretics for the good of our people‚Äôs collective souls. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ What do you want me to do?‚Äù I asked in a tone of false compliance.

Remember that dogs can't have COOKED bones as they tend to splinter and can damage their mouth and throat - so please don't give dogs bits of roast left behind that contain bones. \n\nIt's a difficult time of year though with sweets and chocolate everywhere and children sitting on the ground eating them.

It is safe for humans (but will cause diarrhea in large amounts) but CAN kill your dog very quickly unless taken to the vet IMMEDIATELY. When 5mg per 1lb of body weight is ingested, it quickly causes liver failure followed by death and the effects will begin 10-15 minutes after ingesting. Any amount less than this can cause liver cirrhosis, seizures from severe hypoglycemia, tremors, and coma in under an hour. \n\nThis sweetener is found in most ‚Äúsugar free‚Äù snacks, gum, toothpaste, candies, and if you know anyone who follows a Keto Diet or is just simply diabetic, they most likely have a whole bag of the stuff in their cupboard because it tastes and bakes very similar to regular sugar. It‚Äôs even in some brands of peanut butter. With the holidays going on and everyone baking sweet treats, I thought I would mention this because until my own dog ate toothpaste with Xylitol, I had NO idea it was so dangerous. She‚Äôs fine, now. Thankfully she threw the majority of it up herself. It‚Äôs extremely easy for a pup to eat this amount of Xylitol. If you bake a sugar free cake and your dog eats it off the counter while it‚Äôs cooling, or you forget to put your toothpaste in the drawer and your curious puppy eats it like puppies do‚Ä¶ you could have your heart broken in under an hour. So please be careful! Also never give your pup a homemade treat that you didn‚Äôt make yourself!! This info is not well known at all and a good-intending person may use xylitol in place of sugar to make the treats ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù. So just be careful, fellow pet owners :) \n\n\nHere is some more info! \n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/xylitol-toxicity-in-dogs",

It appears that this may be a post regarding a medical concern, due to the sensitive nature of medical advice the mod team manually screens health posts for approval. r/dogs mods may comment and lock or remove a post if it is clear that the only appropriate answer is to seek emergency care or the question cannot adequately be answered here, otherwise there may be a slight delay in approval. In an emergency situation, the most important thing to do is to remain calm and work to get your pet help. If your primary care veterinarian cannot see an emergency, the best way to find a nearby emergency facility is to do a web search for \"[your location] emergency vet\", \"[your location] animal hospital\", or \"[your location] animal emergency\". Whenever possible, calling ahead may help a facility to better prepare for your arrival.

I started looking through my products and noticed it was in several of them, seems to be mostly Korean products but digging around is pops up in all kinds of cosmetics and skin care products. Also was chock full in my teeth whitening gel, which was less surprising but a good reminder about dental products.\n\nWorking in emergency veterinary medicine I was stunned that I‚Äôd never heard of this before.  Xylitol in even very small amounts can be catastrophic and fatal for dogs in particular, and a lesser extent in cats.\n\nJust a PSA - make sure if your products do have xylitol keep them stored safely and be mindful when using them around your pets and wash your hands thoroughly after applying.\n\nI wish xylitol was required to be labeled clearly since it is so highly toxic to dogs.  And if your dog does get ahold of ANYTHING with xylitol, even a tiny amount, take your friend to veterinarian IMMEDIATELY.\n\n",

Thor is stable in all areas. They are going to keep him for one day longer to ensure stabelization. The amount of relief is astounding.

Xylitol a chemical added as sweetener in sugar free products like gum is a very toxic chemical in dogs which causes low blood sugar, liver failure, and even death. Yesterday my Siberian Husky got into a large pack of sugar free chewing gum. He is currently admitted to the animal hospital awaiting test results to find out the next steps. Please use this info and be sure to properly secure products potentially harmful to animals. I learned this the hard way. No one else should. Wish Thor luck.\n\nThor http://imgur.com/a/R1Lx4w7",

DH chews sugar free gum and I'm constantly making sure it doesn't get to close to the edge of the counter (or better yet, kept in a tall cabinet or drawer).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI check new things I bring into the house. I work on the leave it command. I'm careful of the pet toys he gets.. thinking.. okay what can he tear off, chew, and swallow. He is supervised with new ones and I watch the old ones for when they get past their prime.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd you know what? He's still gotten into things he shouldn't. Thank goodness a bottle of clariton withstood his chewing the first time we left him home alone. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe's pooped out soft ear plugs he has eaten, pieces of fuzz/toys he has swallowed, he's yelped trying to jump on the bed when he was too small and not making it. He's swallowed a paper towel that I have no idea how he got... and then puked it up. He's ignored my leave it command to snatch \"safe\" foods that have fallen to the ground. He's pulled to hard on his collar. He's pushed his luck with bigger more dominant dogs. He's vomitted up things I had no clue had access to. New house, hadn't seen any mushrooms in the back yard and he finds   \n\nsome. 11 weeks old and puking everything up, then just puking up bile. Scared momma rushed him to the ER vet. He was okay, thankfully. Miserable for a few hours.. but okay. I've pulled nasty chicken and baby back rib bones from half way down his throat on walks (construction is still happening in our neighborhood).  It's one thing if he picks up something not desirable and we work on the drop it/ leave it/ trade command. It's another if whatever he has in his mouth can cause him harm or death. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe try to protect our fur babies, and sometimes we fail them. Sometimes they fail us, but you taking immediate action and taking Thor in to the vet,  saved his life. While I hope it's a speedy recovery - your well taken care of dog deserves a good long life with his owner who obviously cares about it, and I hope things turn out the best it can for him. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven though I have seen the Xylitol warning dozens of times, I never think \"god don't people know?!?!?!\" because I know seeing the warning means others see it.. and maybe they don't know. And now they do, and maybe it saves not only a dog, but a family from heartbreak thinking \"if only we had known.\"",

Didn't think the inhaler (still in the box) would be interesting to him, so it stayed on a low table. \n\nAnother PSA to throw out there: apparently albuterol inhalers smell really really good to dogs. Poor guy snatched it off the table, punctured the canister after biting into it, and got all 200 doses at once.  Within 30 minutes, his gums were swollen and his heart rate skyrocketed (240 bpm).

    "body": "I used to post on GOMI analyzing the ingredients of different Glossier formulations and would generally comment on their product releases, but I thought I'd move to reddit for this one since I think it's more helpful here.\n\nMe: I work in the beauty industry on the product development side and because of that I'm constantly testing new products from competitors either just to keep up with the industry or when clients bring them in as comparisons. Recently I came across a product that I thought omg, I need to post this on reddit bc there are a ton of people who would probably want to know this.\n\nThis post will cover the first [Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser](https://www.glossier.com/products/milky-jelly-cleanser) dupe which is a 99.999% match, is half the price (or usually less) - and the sole difference is that it has a different fragrance.\n\nIf you look up ‚ÄúGlossier Milky Jelly Dupes‚Äù the one that is always coming up is the Bliss Makeup Melt Cleanser. That one is annoying because is not a real dupe at all; it‚Äôs just vaguely texturally similar and has a similar bottle, but the formulation has nearly nothing in common with Milky Jelly in any way. Kind of pointless.\n\nPresenting the last word in Milky Jelly dupes, the [ELF Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser](https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9). It is \\*nearly identical in every way\\* to Milky Jelly and is usually on sale for $3. Srsly.\n\nIngredients comparison:\n\nE.L.F. Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser Ingredients: Water (Aqua), PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Dipropylene Glycol, Poloxamer 184, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Betaine, Isohexadecane, Xylitylglucoside, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Juice, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Panthenol (Vb5), Hydroxyacetophenone, Isopropyl Myristate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Anhydroxylitol, Polysorbate 80, Allantoin, Xylitol, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nGlossier Milky Jelly Ingredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Propanediol, Isohexadecane, Poloxamer 184, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Xylitylglucoside, Betaine, Allantoin, Glycerin, Panthenol, Symphytum Officinale Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Anhydroxylitol, Polysorbate 80, Xylitol, Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Isopropyl Myristate, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nThese formulations are nearly identical. They have the same cleansing agents in almost exactly the same order, and even the same textural ingredients. E.L.F. was definitely duplicating the formula exactly when they were formulating.\n\nAs I've said, I've tested the E.L.F. Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser and the Milky Jelly face wash and they are nearly identical. The texture is bang-on and the use experience is the same. There is just one real difference - the Glossier cleanser uses rosewater as the scent ingredient, and the Bounce Back uses a coconut fragrance. I‚Äôm sensitive to fragrances and it doesn‚Äôt bother me at all, it‚Äôs pretty light.\n\nThe best part? The E.L.F. Bounce Back Milky Jelly dupe is $6.00 for 100ml.\n\n$6.\n\nAnd when I ordered it for testing, it was actually $3 because E.L.F. always has sales.\n\nTo compare, Glossier Milky Jelly is $18.00 for 177ml + shipping.\n\nWhere to buy the Bounce Back: it‚Äôs is a little annoying, since they don‚Äôt have it in Target, or on Amazon it seems, but you can get it on the ELF website. Here‚Äôs the link:\n\n[https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9](https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9)\n\nAlso, disclaimer: I don't work for ELF, and never have, and think most of their products are very mediocre. But this one is clearly a copy of something already tested and popular (and I don't feel bad about sharing it because the Glossier Milky Jelly was a total rip-off/copy of the LaRoche Posay Physiological Gel, soooo)",

And if there are other human clinical trials looking at nasal sprays for preventing COVID-19 let me know and I will review them and edit the post to add them in.\n\n# 1. As a brief overview, some major issues with these studies include:\n\n* The fact that the test spray and not the placebo spray contain ingredients that can cause false-negative COVID-19 tests (combined with no information on the timing between applying nasal sprays and taking nasal/nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 tests)\n   * Ex: a heparin nasal spray can cause false-negative COVID-19 RT-PCR tests ([study A](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38649069/)) and carrageenan from vaginal swabs after using carrageenan-containing lube can cause false-negative PCR tests for HPV ([study B](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.26963)). If we take the estimate from another paper ([study C](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/virology/articles/10.3389/fviro.2021.746824/full)) that nasal sprays get immediately diluted approximately 1:1 by nasal fluid (when the spray volume in each nostril is 0.100 mL), then the amount of carrageenan in a nasal swab taken immediately after spraying the nasal spray is comparable to that in the carrageenan undiluted samples in experiment 4 in study B. Those samples from study B all produced false-negative PCR tests for HPV. (EDIT APRIL 13, 2025: [study R](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39913533/) shows carrageenan nasal sprays causing false-negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test results and reductions in measured viral loads.)\n* Lack of placebo spray, participants having to seek out the test spray themselves (suggesting they may take more precautions than those in the study taking no spray, not even a placebo)\n* Lack of sufficient information for reproducibility (especially regarding what is considered a positive and a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test result)\n* Lack of testing for asymptomatic/presymptomatic infections (how can we say something prevents COVID-19 if we aren‚Äôt testing for asymptomatic and presymptomatic COVID-19 infections?)\n* Inappropriate COVID-19 testing methods\n* Wide 95 % confidence intervals for relative risk reductions\n* The group promised a follow-up study with more participants and the trial was completed but the results were never posted (suggesting that the results did not show the test spray preventing COVID-19)\n   * Ex: in [study D](https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-022-06685-z) a protocol was published for an upcoming carrageenan nasal spray clinical trial, and that trial finished in 2022 but the [results haven‚Äôt been posted](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04590365?term=NCT04590365&rank=1&fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaazwtXy-AS4JIQcaCCFdLUKzt9K2o3qNww5bkapp7Y8-TxUDmI-EBKjdAk_aem_UhX-7Nu_JhiXcWir4xMcZQ). Generally, if you do a search on [clinicaltrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov) with [the condition ‚ÄúCOVID‚Äù and the intervention/treatment ‚Äúnasal spray‚Äù](https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?cond=COVID&intr=Nasal%20spray&limit=25&page=1&fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAabmmuQEJwHXGg_TlYJCmer9RsT4Fv9GzluPIrNli_IsCfBvmZeTwgCzPAE_aem__l8QUba6qzYbAkDseiH6Ww), you find 41 studies where only 4 have the status ‚Äúcompleted with results‚Äù, 14 are ‚Äúcompleted without results‚Äù, 9 have ‚Äúunknown status‚Äù and 6 are ‚Äúwithdrawn‚Äù or ‚Äúterminated‚Äù\n* Many nasal spray companies having to majorly walk back false claims of their sprays preventing COVID-19 after warning letters from the FDA (link [here](https://cen.acs.org/materials/biomaterials/biopolymers-behind-multimodal-nasal-spray/102/i30?fbclid=PAY2xjawHhEZJleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABplkfYWLZPD8ITdJAqsUTqxr67H1D2FkJFkPrLaocxpnJaDTELpo5_DeWpA_aem_J_1hkkM1nXJ9SpZptQHA8A), ignore the Profi nasal spray praise, we‚Äôll get to the study on it lol). As well as a [lawsuit](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/10/ftc-sues-utah-based-company-falsely-claiming-its-nasal-sprays-can-prevent-treat-covid-19) about falsely claiming to prevent COVID-19 when it comes to Xlear\n* False claims that we mainly contract COVID-19 through nose cells (and not lung cells) with either no citation or citation of papers that don‚Äôt prove that (such as [study E](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30675-9))\n* Lack of acknowledgement that the location in the respiratory tract that aerosols end up is determined by their size (aka a nasal spray will not prevent the sizes of aerosols that end up in your lungs from going into your lungs), see Figure 3 and all the studies referenced in that figure in [study F](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-022-00506-7))\n* Not everyone breathes through their nose\n* Nasal sprays are flushed out of the nasal cavity in a matter of hours\n* Nasal sprays don‚Äôt appear to coat even 50 % of the nasal cavity (see [study G](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21499839/), [study H](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02786826.2014.931566), [study I](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12383290/))\n* Many of these sprays contain the preservative benzalkonium chloride, which have harmful effects at the concentrations used in nasal sprays in some studies (see [study J](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11575893/) and [study K](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31028024/) and references therein)\n\nNote: the sizes of aerosols that would end up deposited in your nose are very efficiently filtered by high-quality respirators such as N95s, provided that the N95 is sealed to your face and the seal doesn‚Äôt break. This is even true for a respirator with a lot of wear time (see my previous post on some studies looking at the effects of wear time on N95 fit and filtration efficiency [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroCovidCommunity/comments/1hnxlns/debunking_the_myth_that_n95s_are_super_protective/), again, provided that it stays sealed). This is because the filtration mechanisms that act on the sizes of aerosols that get deposited in your nose do not degrade with wear time (whereas the filtration mechanisms that act on smaller aerosols do degrade with wear time). Thus, while wearing a sealed N95, aerosols containing SARS-C0V-2 in the environment should not be deposited in your nose anyway.\n\nOnto the studies!\n\n# 2. Human clinical trials with placebos\n\n[Study 1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34629893/)\n\nThe Argentina healthcare workers iota-carrageenan ‚Äú80 % relative risk reduction‚Äù (in quotes because it‚Äôs misleading) study\n\nFigueroa JM, Lombardo ME, Dogliotti A, Flynn LP, Giugliano R, Simonelli G, Valentini R, Ramos A, Romano P, Marcote M, Michelini A, Salvado A, Sykora E, Kniz C, Kobelinsky M, Salzberg DM, Jerusalinsky D, Uchitel O. Efficacy of a Nasal Spray Containing Iota-Carrageenan in the Postexposure Prophylaxis of COVID-19 in Hospital Personnel Dedicated to Patients Care with COVID-19 Disease. Int J Gen Med. 2021 Oct 1;14:6277-6286. doi: 10.2147/IJGM.S328486. PMID: 34629893; PMCID: PMC8493111.\n\nIssues with study 1:\n\n* Basically [this comment](https://pubpeer.com/publications/578D01FB4482CC282EF7AEBB9CF5DF) on PubPeer but I‚Äôll reiterate the points here too\n* In an¬†[earlier version of the study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.13.21255409v1)¬†the authors said \"Finally, a small number of individuals were lost to follow up (6.8%). In sensitivity analysis where it was hypothesized that the 13 lost individuals from the Iota-Carrageenan group were infected, and that the 14 lost individuals from the placebo group were not infected, no differences were found in infection rates of both groups (p= 0.3).\", but that section was removed in the final version of the paper. Basically the number of people who tested positive for COVID-19 in the study (12 of 394 participants, but really, 12 out of 367) is small enough that the results could be very different if the participants lost to follow up (27 people) were not lost to follow up\n* Calculating the percentages of participants testing positive for COVID-19 in each group using the original number of people in each group, as opposed to subtracting the number of people lost to follow-up. Those lost to follow-up should not be included in calculations and assumed to have not tested positive for COVID-19, because we don‚Äôt know whether or not they would have tested positive for COVID-19\n* No mention of timing between applying the nasal sprays and taking nasopharyngeal swabs for PCR tests. This is really important because carrageenan can cause false-negative PCR tests (see the point about heparin nasal sprays and carrageenan lube in the beginning of section 1 for more details). If the carrageenan spray causes false-negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test results and the placebo spray does not, that is a major issue in the study design making the results of the study untrustworthy and meaningless\n* Only testing if symptoms arose (missing asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections). Again, we really can‚Äôt say anything prevents COVID-19 if we aren‚Äôt testing for asymptomatic/presymptomatic infections\n* They report a relative risk reduction of 79.8 % with the 95 % confidence interval for that value being 5.3 % to 95.4 %. This means that, really, they‚Äôre pretty sure that being on the carrageenan nasal spray as opposed to the placebo spray lowers your chance of testing positive for COVID-19 by between 5.3 % and 95.4 %, which is a very big range! Combine that with the issue of carrageenan having the ability to cause false-negative tests and this study is garbage!\n\n[Study 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653222001809)\n\nThe **RETRACTED** Indian healthcare workers study with the spray containing xylitol, essential oils and other ingredients\n\nBalmforth D, Swales JA, Silpa L, Dunton A, Davies KE, Davies SG, Kamath A, Gupta J, Gupta S, Masood MA, McKnight √Å, Rees D, Russell AJ, Jaggi M, Uppal R.

Not a good sign and I don‚Äôt think I need to go into the issues point-by-point in light of this. Check out the PubPeer comments if you‚Äôre curious\n* Spray contains benzalkonium chloride (see section 1)\n\n# 3. Studies in humans without placebos (which are not clinical trials)\n\n[Study 3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33759682/)\n\nHypromellose taffix nasal powder study\n\nShmuel K, Dalia M, Tair L, Yaakov N.

PMID: 33759682; PMCID: PMC8022337.\n\nIssues with study 3:\n\n* The relative risk reduction reported is 78 %, with the 95 % confidence interval for that value being 1 % to 95 % (very large range! They‚Äôre pretty sure taking the spray lowers your chance of testing positive for COVID-19 by between 1 % and 95 %)\n* Participants using the spray had to request it (those who seek out a nasal spray might also take more precautions than other people)\n* No placebo\n* No mention of timing between spraying the powder and taking nasopharyngeal swabs for PCR tests, which is important given the next point\n* Hypromellose may also inhibit PCRs (as cellulose can, see [study L](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.57.12.3529-3534.1991) and references in [study M](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7072044/), and hypromellose is modified cellulose), which would lead to false-negative COVID-19 RT-PCR results\n* Spray contains benzalkonium chloride (see section 1)\n\n[Study 4](https://sanotize.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Miller-Thai-Prevention-Study-RT-1.pdf)\n\nNitric oxide nasal spray study on students from a university in Bangkok\n\nRespiratory Therapy: The Journal of Pulmonary Technique. Epidemiological Analysis of Nitric Oxide Nasal Spray (VirX‚Ñ¢) Use in Students Exposed to COVID-19 Infected Individuals. 2023. 18:2.\n\nIssues with study 4:\n\n* Participants using the spray had to find out about it and request it (those who seek out a nasal spray might also take more precautions than other people)\n* No placebo\n* Rapid antigen tests have a higher false-negative rate than RT-PCR tests\n* No mention of timing between applying the nasal sprays and taking swabs for rapid antigen tests, which is important given the next point\n* VirX, SaNOtize, enovid and FabiSpray are all from the same company. On the [SaNOtize website](https://sanotize.com/technology/nasal-spray/faq/), they state both that the spray causes conformational changes to the spike protein (see answer 2 in the first section) and that it doesn‚Äôt interfere with rapid antigen testing (see answer 10 in the second section). Rapid antigen tests rely on interactions between proteins from the virus that causes COVID-19 (called SARS-CoV-2) and antibodies in the test. Thus, changes to the shape of SARS-CoV-2 proteins via nitric oxide could cause false-negative rapid antigen test results. I reached out to ask about this 2 months ago and I haven‚Äôt gotten a response lol\n* Spray contains benzalkonium chloride (see section 1)\n\n# 4. Studies in test tubes/cell culture and why preventing infection in those contexts isn‚Äôt relevant to the human respiratory tract\n\nThis section is not an exhaustive list of all the studies I could find, just two examples so I can explain my point.\n\nBasically, adding nasal sprays or nasal spray ingredients to animal cells growing on the bottom of a cell culture dish is very different than spraying a nasal spray up a human‚Äôs nose. Cells in our nasal cavity help physically flush matter out of the nose and into the throat, ending with us swallowing the matter. In a cell culture flask, there is nowhere for the spray or spray ingredients to be flushed out. In a human, there are many types of cells throughout the respiratory tract, from the nose to lungs, that can be infected by the virus that causes COVID-19 (called SARS-CoV-2). In a cell culture dish, the nasal spray or nasal spray ingredients can interact with all of the cells that have the potential to be infected. In a human, nasal sprays don‚Äôt seem to cover even 50 % of the nasal cavity (see section 1 for references for this). As well, nasal sprays definitely don‚Äôt protect cells in the lungs from SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nExamples of these studies:\n\n[Study 5](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202406348)\n\nthe Profi spray study\n\nJoseph J, Baby HM, Quintero JR, Kenney D, Mebratu YA, Bhatia E, Shah P, Swain K, Lee D, Kaur S, Li XL, Mwangi J, Snapper O, Nair R, Agus E, Ranganathan S, Kage J, Gao J, Luo JN, Yu A, Park D, Douam F, Tesfaigzi Y, Karp JM, Joshi N. Toward a Radically Simple Multi-Modal Nasal Spray for Preventing Respiratory Infections. Adv Mater. 2024 Nov;36(46):e2406348. doi: 10.1002/adma.202406348. Epub 2024 Sep 24. PMID: 39318086.\n\nIssues with study 5:\n\n* (Adapted from [this comment on PubPeer](https://pubpeer.com/publications/2B49C5B4CC30DAB35CC61E1861CC25) and [my Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBHzfvdyvJ9/?img_index=1) about this study)\n* Making multiple unsubstantiated statements and incorrectly citing papers that don‚Äôt provide evidence for what they‚Äôre saying\n   * Example 1: the authors state ‚ÄúTransmission of most respiratory pathogens predominantly occurs through inhalation of contaminated respiratory droplets and their subsequent deposition in the nasal cavity, which has an entry checkpoint.‚Äù and they cite [study N](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abd9149) for this. What does study N say you might ask? Something very different! Here are two quotes from study N: \"When unburdened by conventional definitions of transmission routes, the available evidence for SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus, and other respiratory viruses is much more consistent with transmission by aerosols <100 Œºm rather than by rare, large droplets sprayed onto mucous membranes of people in very close proximity. Recent acknowledgement of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by the WHO (48) and US CDC (49) reinforces the necessity to implement protection against this transmission route at both short and long ranges.\" and \"Because viruses are enriched in small aerosols (<5 Œºm), they can travel deeper into and be deposited in the lower respiratory tract. The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be higher and the virus persists longer in the lower respiratory tract compared with the upper respiratory tract (164, 165). Initiation of an infection in the lower respiratory tract adds technical challenges in diagnosing patients because current screening commonly collects samples from the nasopharyngeal or oral cavity using swabs.\"\n   * Example 2: the authors state ‚ÄúThe nasal cavity is a primary target for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to high expression of ACE2, which decreases towards the lower respiratory tract.\" There is no direct evidence that SARS-CoV-2 mainly infects nasal cells (whether in the studies cited in that sentence, [study O](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/148517), [study P](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0868-6), [study Q](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2766522), or elsewhere, such as [study E](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30675-9) mentioned earlier)\n* No testing in humans\n* The one experiment in mice is not comparable to humans and is irrelevant. In this experiment, they physically placed drops of the nasal spray up the mice‚Äôs noses and then physically placed the influenza virus suspended in liquid. This is nothing like real-world human scenarios, where nasal sprays don‚Äôt coat the nasal cavity well and we breathe aerosols into our noses, mouths, throats and lungs\n* Issues with other experiments (see [my Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBHzfvdyvJ9/?img_index=1) for more info)\n* [Super misleading to the point of being untrue reporting about the study](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2024/09/drug-free-nasal-spray-blocks-neutralizes-viruses-bacteria/) that the authors were involved in\n* Spray contains benzalkonium chloride (see section 1)\n\n[Study 6](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202008304)\n\nThe NoriZite gellan and carrageenan nasal spray study\n\nMoakes RJA, Davies SP, Stamataki Z, Grover LM. Formulation of a Composite Nasal Spray Enabling Enhanced Surface Coverage and Prophylaxis of SARS-COV-2. Adv Mater. 2021 Jul;33(26):e2008304. doi: 10.1002/adma.202008304. Epub 2021 May 31. PMID: 34060150; PMCID: PMC8212080.\n\nIssues with study 6:\n\n* Similar to study 5 (the Profi nasal spray study) in that they make unsubstantiated claims\n   * Example 1: the authors say ‚ÄúFrom this data, a mechanism for both prophylaxis and prevention is proposed; where entrapment within a polymeric coating sterically blocks virus uptake into the cells, inactivating the virus, and allowing clearance within the viscous medium. As such, a fully preventative spray is formulated, targeted at protecting the lining of the upper respiratory pathways against SARS-CoV-2.‚Äù Stating ‚Äúa fully preventative spray is formulated‚Äù is not true, as this study is not a human clinical trial, nor was the spray tested in a human nor was it tested in an animal.\n* Spray contains benzalkonium chloride (see section 1)\n\n# 5. Summary/TLDR and final thoughts\n\nUnfortunately, many people including covid influencers have fallen for the falsehood that nasal sprays prevent COVID-19. Some such influencers have promoted these nasal sprays for free and helped spread the misinformation that they prevent COVID-19. Unlike with nasal sprays, there is ample, sound evidence that high-quality well-fitting respirators, ventilation and air purification prevent COVID-19.\n\nThe human clinical trials testing whether or not nasal sprays prevent COVID-19 have major methodological issues, and to my knowledge there are only two (EDIT MARCH 15, 2025: and one of the two has now [been retracted](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653222001809?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=920e1cfeecbf491d))! Please don't lower your covid precautions based on two (EDIT MARCH 15, 2025: one) low-quality, flawed human clinical trials, two low-quality, flawed human studies with no placebos and other misleading studies performed in test tubes! As time goes on, more concerns about these studies appear on PubPeer which sometimes triggers investigations of the studies and warnings to not treat the studies as reliable in the meantime. Most clinical trials looking at preventing COVID-19 with nasal sprays mysteriously [never published the results](https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?cond=COVID&intr=Nasal%20spray&limit=25&page=1&fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAabmmuQEJwHXGg_TlYJCmer9RsT4Fv9GzluPIrNli_IsCfBvmZeTwgCzPAE_aem__l8QUba6qzYbAkDseiH6Ww) (most likely, the results were not good so they didn‚Äôt publish them). In my (PhD biochemist who studied COVID-19) opinion, we have enough studies to reasonably conclude whether or not nasal sprays prevent COVID-19, and we may not get many new ones, because the evidence suggests that nasal sprays do not prevent COVID-19. However, as a scientist, I will continue to review any new studies and keep an open mind.\n\nWhile this post may be upsetting to read, false hope is dangerous. Well-fitting high-quality respirators, ventilation and air purification give me true hope. Many of these companies are [no longer allowed to claim that their sprays prevent COVID-19](https://cen.acs.org/materials/biomaterials/biopolymers-behind-multimodal-nasal-spray/102/i30?fbclid=PAY2xjawHhEZJleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABplkfYWLZPD8ITdJAqsUTqxr67H1D2FkJFkPrLaocxpnJaDTELpo5_DeWpA_aem_J_1hkkM1nXJ9SpZptQHA8A) after warnings from the FDA. Let‚Äôs stop spreading dangerous misinformation and stop providing free advertising for these companies who have never proven their sprays prevent COVID-19! <3",

Studies since then on SARS-CoV-2 (like [this one](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajplung.00552.2020)) have given me enough continuing research support to still lean on the idea that it *might* be useful.\n\nI've pretty much had to live with the fact that there isn't a proper single-product randomised, blinded clinical trial, and there isn't ever going to be one. There's no money in it for drug companies because it's a readily-available (and food-safe) natural product. I'm particularly frustrated by [this combination trial](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.26.21254398), where most of the publicity was around the *other* stuff (which has been specifically discredited on numerous occasions), and ignores the possibility that iota-carrageenan might have been the reason for the unexpected positive outcome.",

Furthermore, we are complicit in spreading dangerous misinformation, that also by implication, would jeopardize the safety and lives of others.  I am not an expert.  I don‚Äôt tell anyone to do anything.  I look at the research and see a low-risk prophylactic, that with the use of a respirator, may provide some benefits.\n\nSince you seem fine with casting moral aspersions and value judgments, I think it‚Äôs fair to question your hyperfixation on nasal sprays.  This isn‚Äôt your first time commenting on them.  I think you see a world where most people have given up masking, which is the best method for preventing COVID-19, and instead of seeing the promise of some nasal sprays, you associate them with the global hatred of masking.\n\nYour promotion of ventilation and air purification is a red herring to appeal to the COVID-conscious crowd here.  These can be great things but their effectiveness is extremely variable, ranging from substantially lowering the amount of respiratory particles in one environment or situation to having little benefit in another.  Here in the US, we don‚Äôt even try to improve air quality with existing tech where we know it can make a difference, even in high-risk places like pre-schools or physicians‚Äô offices.  Public spaces basically have to all be treated as hazardous, and in them, I wouldn‚Äôt trust any air purification system as being built correctly, maintained properly, or effective enough to not wear a respirator.  Air purification is totally outside of my control other than in my home.  At least nasal sprays, with more research and development, might possibly give someone the ability to help protect themself when most other people have stopped caring to protect themselves and others.\n\nYou are much more qualified than I am to understand the research.  I‚Äôm skeptical of much of the nasal spray research as well.  I‚Äôm interested in looking more into what you posted.  I‚Äôm not married to nasal sprays.  I‚Äôve considered stopping using the one I do use due to some of the very things you have pointed out.  But I do find other research persuasive enough for me to use one.\n\nIf you want to help people, I would recommend helping people understand risk compensation theory and how their choices regarding the use of nasal sprays may affect their overall precautions.

Long story short, he's got some serious dental issues (looking at the xrays, probably more problems than he realizes), and it's all his fault.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs your friendly co-UL'er and a dentist, here are some things to keep in mind when it comes to dental health and UL activities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Take a toothbrush, toothpaste, and floss.  It is super easy to take an entire dental kit that weighs right at 1 ounce.  I don't care how much weight you are trying to save, don't be stupid UL and leave your dental kit at home.\n2. USE your dental supplies.  People ask me all the time, what's the best toothbrush/toothpaste/floss?  My answer: the one you'll use.  If you take a dental kit with you and you don't use it, you have no one to blame but yourself.  No one is going to do it for you, and it's so much easier and cheaper than waiting until you have a serious dental issue.  How are you supposed to enjoy the great outdoors and the joy of being UL if you're in pain and in serious need of a dentist?  And remember, as you use up your toothpaste, your base weight will go down.  \n3. Having your teeth extracted is not a good way to be even more UL.  It's just not.\n4. When you're on the trail you should be extra aware of your dental hygiene.  Doing big miles means lots and lots of eating, and usually it's calorie dense stuff that's full of carbs, sugar, and sticky stuff.  It's going to keep you moving, but it's going to wreck your teeth.  At the very least, brush and floss every night before going to sleep.  Ideally, brush every morning and every night.  \n5. No matter your opinions on government fluoridation of public water sources, study after study has shown that fluoridated drinking water significantly reduces your risk of dental decay.  That's good for you, me, and your teeth.  But when you're out on the trail, you will rarely encounter fluoridated water.  Most streams, springs, lakes, and rivers have very little if any fluoride, which means your teeth will be in serious need of some fluoride reinforcement day and night.  Here's a tip: after your brush, don't rinse your mouth.  Spit the remaining toothpaste out, and leave a slight film of if on your teeth.  Don't eat or drink for 10 minutes, and your teeth will enjoy a nice fortifying infusion of fluoride that will strengthen them for the task of processing trail food.  This approach requires less water, and will help you reap the largest possible benefit from that toothpaste you've been lugging around.\n6. Last piece of advice.  Chewing sugar free gum has been shown to also reduce the risk of tooth decay, especially after meals.  In fact, brushing right after meals can sometimes damage your teeth (counter intuitive, but true).  After eating a snack or having a meal, try chewing sugar free gum (with xylitol is even better to reduce bacteria numbers).  This will help clean remaining food particles from your teeth, and also stimulate increased saliva production, which will in turn expose your teeth to the calcium and other minerals found in your own saliva.  The human body is pretty amazing, so let it do it's thing.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Take care of your teeth.  It's super easy and your teeth are worth it.",

    "body": "The problem: Pretty much all of the meds prescribed for ADHD cause xerostomia (dry mouth). This includes all stimulants, and intuniv. Dry mouth is a huge factor in getting tooth decay and gum disease. You saliva naturally has antimicrobial components (like dozens of types) which reduce the bad bacteria. In someone with chronic dry mouth, bacteria accumulates on the gumline, not on the occlusal/top of the tooth like you normally think of. Even with regular brushing twice a day, you can still get cavities. \n\nYour options:\n\n1. Get a professional cleaning and evaluation every 4-6 months (more frequent than people who aren't as high risk. These are official guidelines for anyone taking these meds). It's expensive now, but when you're risking paying for $2000-3000 to replace a single tooth, it's a really good investment. \n2. Dry mouth options: Biotene mouthwash is fantastic. Use that several times a day. Also Xylimelts by OroCoat is a tablet that goes on your cheek and helps day and night. I personally love these, especially at night. Gum with xylitol is also good. \n3. Make sure you're brushing properly, especially for you guys. Your brush should be at a 45 degree angle and using a soft brush, make sure you get the gum line. The idea is to clean in the little pocket between your gum and your teeth. This is where the bacteria proliferates in dry mouth\n4. Use toothpaste with lots of fluoride. Sensodyne is my recommended brand. You can also get prescription toothpaste with even more fluoride. You can also get prescription fluoride rinses. Additionally, your dentist can give you MI Paste/recaldent which you just brush on at night and don't spit out. It reverses small lesions on your tooth that haven't had enamel break off. \n\nIt sucks that we have this challenge, but this is really important to save you money down the road. Dentistry is insanely expensive if you have wide-spread cavities. The office should send out reminder cards to make appoints, so that's some pressure off of you! \n\nIf you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them!\n\nTL;DR: If you're taking ADHD meds, you need to take extra steps (above) to prevent you from paying tons of money in dental work later because you're at a high risk for cavities.",

With this in mind I have worked to maintain a recommended dental care routine to hopefully reduce any troubles that may arise. The usual has been brushing and rinsing twice a day with flossing at night.\n\nOne of my employers was awesome enough to offer dental during my trip home during hurricane season, and I hadn't seen a dentist in at least two years at that point, if not longer. Even on the phone they said it was likely I would be needing more than one appointment for a check up and cleaning.\n\nHowever after going to the appointment they only needed to do about 10 minutes of cleaning and said my oral health was better than some who come in for their checkups every six months.\n\nMy first cavity was found and filled when I was 27.\n\nSo yes!

This morning one of my essential coworkers called me and asked if they could rummage in my cubical for some paperwork. I said sure go for it. \nFast forward to 20 minutes ago when another coworker texted me and said that the essentials ransacked my desk and ate all the candy in it. I wracked my brain and the only candy I had in my desk was the sugar free kind (xylitol) that has a bad reaction if you eat more than one of them. He went on to say that they all got sent home for some kind of stomach bug so karma. Management was very concerned and closed our building to make sure no one else gets sick. I was stunned but I kept my mouth shut about the candy and what really caused their ‚Äústomach bug.‚Äù I really hope no one figures it out before the trash gets taken out. I know this seems like more of their FU than mine but pranking is pretty common in our building and I don‚Äôt want that on me.\n\nTL;DR I left sugar free candies in my desk and my coworkers ate them all got epic diarrhea and our building was closed to ensure no stomach virus spread.",

Personally, having a moderate amount of healthy carbs in my diet improves my hair shedding. I shed so much hair when I was on a low carb diet. My detailed hair growth routine is here:*** [***https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/173ktba/how\\_i\\_have\\_successfully\\_grown\\_my\\_hair\\_back/***](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/173ktba/how_i_have_successfully_grown_my_hair_back/)\n* **Scalp conditions: healthy white scalp, no itchiness, no flakes**\n* **Shampoo routine: shampooing every other day, using Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair every  7-10 days, Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo for the rest of the week.**\n* **Diet and Lifestyle: Mediterranean diet; go to bed before 12; 7-8 hours of sleep everyday;**\n* **Stress management: don't give a shit about things that used to bother me, overall better mood**\n\nHi there, I've benefitted a lot from this community, so I'd like to make some contributions. I was losing an average of 200-300 hairs everyday at the onset of my sebderm. After two months, I'm now only shedding about 90 hairs daily, which is within the normal range. I know that clinically speaking there is no cure to sebderm and it may come back later, but I'm just happy that it's at least under control now. So I want to share this as my SOS protocol. As for long-term maintenance, I'm still learning so much about it from this community.\n\nBackground:\n\n\\- suffered from dry dandruff (large and white flakes) for more than 12 years but never experienced any hair loss\n\n\\- Because of COVID, I developed a bad habit of only shampooing 1-2 times a week (I have an oily scalp and straight hair). On non-wash days, I used a lot of hair products to keep my scalp feeling clean, e.g. scalp serum and dry shampoo. I only found out later that they contained denatured alcohol, which can destroy our skin barrier.\n\n\\- In late Aug, I experienced increased hair shedding of a daily average of 200-300 strands when I usually only shed a maximum of 30-60 strands a day. At the worst point, I was losing 500 hairs when I was shampooing one day. And I almost passed out.\n\n\\- My scalp was tingling, burning, and sore.\n\n\\- I went to a dermatologist in early Sept. He diagnosed me with severe sebderm and folliculitis on my scalp. He said I needed to get my sebderm under control before he could treat my hair loss\n\n\\- My before and after pics (warning: my sebderm was really bad on my scalp): [https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i](https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSebderm and hair loss:\n\n\\- I was very anxious and depressed about my hair loss because I've always had thick and healthy hair. People always give me compliments on how my hair looks. The point is that I was feeling so much pain mentally.\n\n\\- I consulted other dermatologists. Some said sebderm could cause telogen effluvium because my condition was so severe that it shocked my hair. Some said even though sebderm could cause increased hair shedding, mine was too serious to be caused by sebderm alone. There might be other causes.\n\n\\- But from Dr. Donovan's blog, there is a study that revealed that the more seborrheic dermaitits a person has, the more shedding (telogen effluvium) a person will experience. This tells us that individuals with severe seborrheic dermatitis are likely to have a severe telogen effluvium.\n\n\\- I still went to my family doctor and a naturopath to get blood tests done just to be sure what we're dealing with here. Everything was normal, so I focused on getting my sebderm under control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow I got the situation under control:\n\n\\- My dermatologist prescribed me with clobetasol solution and ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo.\n\n\\- At first, I was reluctant to use steroid. However, the longer my scalp stays inflamed, the more possible damage will be caused to my hair follicles, so I followed my derm's instructions and applied clobetasol to the affected areas daily for 21 days. My scalp was less red but I was still shedding 150-200 hairs a day.\n\n\\- Using the ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo (every other day for 8 weeks, as instructed by my dermatologist) was not very helpful. After much research, I came up with my own protocol that has really helped me get my sebderm under control.\n\n**- What I found is key is that the protocol needs to consist of three components: 1) destroy the biofilm, 2) kill malassezia, and 3) rebuild skin barrier. For each component, there are numerous ingredients/products available.**\n\n**- You can do all three components on a particular day or scatter them around throughout the week, depending on whatever suits your schedule and skin needs. Experiment and observe what suits your skin the best.**\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **on a given shampoo day**: 5% xylitol solution on the affected areas to be left on for at least an hour --> wash it off with an antifungal shampoo --> apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **in a particular week** (this is what I'm doing now): biofilm shampoo on day 1 and day 3 of the week followed by ciclopirox shampoo on day 5 and day 7. Each time after shampooing, apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 1) destroying the biofilm: xylitol, ACV, and selenium sulfide, MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 2) killing malassezia: ciclopirox, ketoconazole, coal tar, zinc pyrithione, and MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 3) rebuilding skin barrier: panthenol (vitamin B5), niacinamide (vitamin B3), glycerin, and aloe vera\n\n\\- Salicylic acid is not anti fungal per se, but it's great at removing the scales, regulating sebum production, and calming down inflammation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy detailed protocol:\n\n**-  I shampoo four times a week: Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide --> Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide OR T/Sal --> Ciclopirox 1.5% Shampoo --> T/Sal (I only use Selsun Blue twice a week for 2 weeks when things are bad because it is very strong)**\n\n**- This protocol is for short-term ONLY, e.g. 2-6 weeks! To get things under control first.**\n\n**- (updated on 4 Jan 2022) As my sebderm is getting much better, I have switched to this gentler protocol, which again incorporates all the essential components, for long-term maintenance. I'm rotating three different shampoos: Neutrogena T/Sal, DermaKB Scalp Detoxifier (biofilm disrupter), and Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Shampoo (contains an antifungal Piroctone Olamine). To hydrate my scalp, I've been using a DIY niacinamide and panthenol spray.**\n\n\\- Selenium Sulfide 2.5% is a game changer for me!! The dandruff/biofilm was finally coming off after 1-2 uses. Antifungals cannot get to the malassezia to do their job if the biofilm is present.\n\n\\- After shampooing, ~~I apply a DIY 3% panthenol aloe vera gel to my scalp.~~ I'm now using this DIY 2% glycerin, 2% panthenol, and 4% niacinamide in water spray.\n\n\\- Avoid ANY ingredient that may feed malassezia (I use a website called Sezia. Simple Skincare Science is also a very good source).\n\n\\- Even though I don't suffer sebderm on any other area, I switch all of my skincare products to seb-derm safe products because my skincare may transfer to my pillow.\n\n\\- I use a silk pillow case to reduce the friction (I can't afford to lose even one more hair).\n\n\\- I change my pillow case every 2-3 days and wash my pillow every week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct recommendations:\n\n\\- What is weird is that a lot of the products that are supposed to be formulated for people with sebderm are not sebderm friendly. They contain ingredients that feed malassezia. There is a useful website called Sezia that I use to check whether a product is safe (not affiliated). This is also the reason I need to DIY the panthenol and aloe scalp treatment.\n\n\\- Products that I like: Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide Shampoo, Neutrogena T/Sal, Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Scalp, dermaKB Biofilm Scalp Detoxifier, Philosophy B5 powder, the Ordinary 100% niacinamide powder,\n\n\\- Products that made my situation worse: Head and Shoulders Royal Oils Scalp Elixir, Inkey List Salicylic Acid Scalp Treatment, Head and Shoulders Clinical Strength 1% Selenium Sulfide\n\n~~- I will be experimenting with a DIY niacinamide and panthenol toner (for rebuilding skin barrier and calming inflammation) and 5% xylitol solution (for destroying the biofilm) and will keep this community updated of my results.~~ After much trial and error, I settle on this DIY scalp toner (2% glycerin, 2% panthenol, and 4% niacinamide in distilled water, which I think is really helpful for calming my scalp.\n\n**- Neutrogena T/Sal shampoo may be too harsh for people with a dry/sensitive scalp, but my oily scalp loves it!!! It helps get rid of the oily buildup and flakes on my scalp while also regulating my sebum production. My scalp is definitely less oily. And malassezia loves an oily scalp because they also feed on our natural sebum.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDiet and supplements (Please see here for a detailed wholistic approach to tacking sebderm: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/rggsrj/a\\_novelwholistic\\_evidenceinspired\\_approach\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/rggsrj/a_novelwholistic_evidenceinspired_approach_to/)):\n\n\\- Daily: Vitamin D3+K2, cod liver oil, ~~reishi, homemade kefir~~, nutritional yeast, ~~MCT oil~~\n\n\\- 2-3 times a week: zinc, magnesium glycinate, and collagen powder\n\n**- What I would recommend for almost everyone: vitamin D3+K2, magnesium, and fish oil.**\n\n\\- Around 60-70% of people in North America are deficient in vitamin D. There are also studies that point to an association between vitamin D deficiency and inflammatory skin conditions such as sebderm. Although this does not mean a causal relationship, taking vitamin D3 overall can help regulate our hormones and immune system. Magnesium and vitamin K2 should be supplemented with vitamin D3. This combo also help me better deal with stress, which is also a trigger of sebderm.\n\n\\- Fish oil supplement helps the body repair the skin barrier. It is also highly anti-inflammatory. But remember to choose a reliable brand. Many of the fish oil supplements on the market are contaminated. Brands I love that are also third-party tested: Nordic Naturals, Natural Factors Pharmaceutical Grade Fish Oil, and InnovixLab.\n\n\\- Probiotics that I've tried and quite like: Garden of Life Dr Formulated, Seed, and Visbiome (not affiliated in any sense; purchased all products with my own money)\n\n\\- Garlic powder supplement and oregano oil capsules daily for 1 week for killing the bad bacteria in my gut\n\n\\- Homemade bone broth for repairing my gut\n\n\\- Gluten-free\n\n\\- No refined carbs at all\n\n\\- No sugar\n\n\\- No dairy ~~except kefir~~\n\n\\- Lots of greens with some meat each meal\n\n\\- Berries everyday (there is a study that revealed a correlation between low fruit intake and sebderm in women). Plus, berries are anti-inflammatory\n\n\\- Avoid using vegetable oil in cooking. Opt for more heat-stable oils that are also low in omega-6s, e.g. extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, ghee, and butter.\n\n\\- To sum up, the key is to incorporate as much anti-inflammatory food as possible. Some further examples are turmeric and ginger.\n\n\\- What I usually eat: [https://imgur.com/a/nr1JKne](https://imgur.com/a/nr1JKne)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummary of helpful resources/research:\n\n\\- Simple Skincare Science website\n\n\\- Sezia Website\n\n\\- Dandruff Deconstructed Website\n\n\\- Dr. Donovan's blog (He has recently published quite a number of articles on sebderm)\n\n\\- Ceramide insufficiency in sebderm patients ( [https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(07)01771-9/fulltext#relatedArticles](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(07)01771-9/fulltext#relatedArticles)) ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12115025/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12115025/))\n\n\\- Niacinamide increases ceramide production ([http://fagron.lookhere-dev.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Atopic-Dermatitis\\_Nicotinamide-Tanno-O-2000-BJD.pdf](http://fagron.lookhere-dev.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Atopic-Dermatitis_Nicotinamide-Tanno-O-2000-BJD.pdf))\n\n\\- Caprylic and Polygalacturonic Acid Combinations for Eradication of Microbial Organisms Embedded in Biofilm ([https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01999/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01999/full))\n\n\\- Topical nicotinamide \\[i.e. niacinamide\\] for seborrheic dermatitis: an open randomized study ([https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/55117499.pdf](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/55117499.pdf))\n\n\\- Skin moisturizing effects of panthenol-based formulations ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21982351/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21982351/))\n\nFinally, I want to say that there is still hope. Don't give up. I will pray for everyone in this community to regain their health soon!\n\nEdit: I will continue to edit this and add on to it based on my ongoing research and trial and error. And also to add the things that I forgot to mentionEdit: Added some before and after pics and meal idea pics.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have any questions\n\nEdit on 19 Jan 2022: Now my scalp is free from dandruff with very mild redness, itch is very neglectable like only very mild itch every 5-6 days, and I'm shedding an average of 70 strands of hair daily, which is within the normal range of 50-100 hairs daily as advised by most dermatologists. This is my latest weekly routine (I shampoo four times a week): Neutrogena T/Sal Shampoo --> Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Scalp (start with as little shampoo as possible because it lathers very well; too much lather can be irritating to the scalp) --> Phillip Adam Apple Cider Vinegar Shampoo (Fragrance Free) --> Ciclopirox 1.5% Shampoo (available by prescription only; alternatives are ketoconazole shampoo and selenium sulfide). ~~Each time after shampooing, I apply the DIY hydrating scalp spray containing 2% panthenol, 2% glycerin, and 4% niacinamide.~~ No longer using the toner as the shampoos I'm using now are very hydrating and gentle.\n\nEdit on 23 Jan 2022:  I've just stumbled across some substitutes for this DIY spray from a brand called COSRX. Although they are not hair products, the ingredient lists seem pretty good. This toner ([https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/centella-water-alcohol-free-toner](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/centella-water-alcohol-free-toner)) contains panthenol and sodium hyaluronate, which are both good hydrating ingredients. This one ([https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/bha-blackhead-power-liquid](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/bha-blackhead-power-liquid)) contains salicylic acid, niacinamide, and panthenol. I'm probably going to try these out soon as I sometimes don't have the time to make the DIY spray. BIG **DISCLAIMER: These are not products formulated for the scalp. Use at your own discretion.**\n\nUpdates on 15 Mar 2022: I'm now using a routine targeted at healing my skin barrier because my scalp is now flake-free but mildly red. Shampooing every other day: ciclopirox shampoo once a week and Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo (if you have a really oily scalp, Briogeo Be Gentle Be Kind Matcha Shampoo may be a better alternative) for the rest of the week. Each time after shampooing, I apply some diluted niacinamide serum from The Ordinary because the original 10% may be too irritating. The study that suggested niacinamide as a potential treatment for sebderm used a concentration of 4%. I also added some panthenol powder to the mixture (at a concentration of about 1.5%), which is completely optional. I'm now shedding about 50 hairs daily.\n\nThe new HA hydrating serum by The Ordinary did not work for me. I tested it on my hairline, then the sebderm migrated to my hairline while my scalp, luckily, is still clear.\n\nUpdates on 12 May 2022: Shampooing every 2-3 days because my scalp is less oily and less itchy. Not using any topical hydrating product because I think my skin has healed so much. Now I'm using ciclopirox shampoo (by prescription only) once a week, and Bioderma Node A Shampoo for the rest of the days\n\nUpdates on 7 July 2022: Shampooing every other day; Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair once a week and Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for sensitive scalp for the rest of the week; taking anti-inflammatory herbs prescribed by a licensed Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner (TCM); shedding 40-50 hairs daily; scalp pretty healthy; incorporated more carbs in my diet because realized a low-carb diet makes me shed more hair\n\nUpdates on 28 Aug 2022: Shampooing every other day; Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair every 10 days and Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo for the rest of the week; been taking the herbs for almost 2 months now. Noticed my scalp is less oily, zero itch now, no flakes, and redness almost gone. There are some days where I'm shedding only 20-30 hairs daily, which is my pre-sebderm level. But I DON'T recommend visiting a TCM practitioner in western countries. Most of them have no idea what they're doing, and the herbs, if not prescribed properly, can cause damage to the liver and kidney. They are also not well-regulated under the law. My diet is lots of cooked vegetables, some berries, some carbs, and some meat. My TCM doctor told me to avoid seafood (except some fish) and beef.",

I‚Äôm so so happy something has finally worked. I‚Äôm on about week 4-5 doing this routine just once a week, and my scalp free from those red patches that would turn into scab like flakes. I plan to continue for another 3 weeks with this routine, and then switching to just a normal (sezia safe) to see how my scalp reacts.\n\nI know sebaderm doesn‚Äôt really go away, but I‚Äôm just really happy to have found something I can rely on for future flare ups. Thank you again!!",

Peanut butter in a bucket. I don‚Äôt believe in an expiration date. ;p\n\n**kurtmanneru**\n\nI don‚Äôt usually either, but if you ever taste rancid peanut butter you will change your mind a bit. Trust me üò¨\n\n**Frank\\_Dank\\_Latte**\n\nI wonder how many holes I can make before having to get a spatula to smooth it back out.\n\n**\\[deleted\\]**\n\nW-what are you making the holes with üò≥\n\n**19bluestars**\n\nMake sure they‚Äôre xylitol free. Dogs can get sick from xylitol\n\n**Homeowner2023**\n\nGood call. I looked at the ingredients and verified it with the shelter staff.\n\n**Amandanay**\n\nJust wanted to comment to add for awareness that some brands have started to label xylitol \"birch sugar\" (warning from my vet) - so be careful out there :)\n\n**Update 1**\n\n**The 35lb pail of creamy peanut butter (item 1094873) I bought on Wednesday at the Denver Business Center for $2.97 didn't last. So I went back yesterday for 4 more. I think I'm the only one buying them.**\n\n* Here's the¬†[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/1juqcy7/3_for_a_food_grade_bucket_comes_with_35_lbs_of/). Barely any change in stock.\n* Best Buy date of April 10, 2025 (today).\n* Most likely suitable for use after that date. If donating, you need to check the organization's rules for accepting and using near or past date food.\n* Can make 650 peanut butter sandwiches but does not come with bread, jelly or packaging.\n* Regularly priced at $50 or so. That only adds $0.07 per sandwich. So still worth buying for feeding the homeless (as suggested by many) or bodybuilders at the gym (as mentioned by a few) even at full price.\n* Sorry, I'm still waiting for photos from the shelter. In the meantime I hope you enjoy¬†[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbH7tJXuizk).

You might contact them and ask them to donate the remaining to the shelter.\n\n**KnittingKitty**\n\nYou could tell the Costco manager what you're doing and ask if they'll donate the rest.\n\n**DegredationOfAnAge**\n\nFor that price I could coat my entire body with it and lay down in the middle of an animal shelter\n\n**carsandrx**\n\nAre you going back?

I personally would go for the Be Plain when it's available because it has a simplified formula without the unnecessary plant extracts and flower oils. I think the Be Plain one would be better for oily skin than the Round Lab one. Both of the Hyggee sunscreens look promising, but I'm gravitating towards the Vegan Sun Cream because it is a chemical sunscreen and I have a tan complexion, I don't want to risk a white cast. However, the Real Sun Cream does have an interesting ingredient list and whipped texture (as I can see on Yesstyle)  and I will be looking out for reviews to see whether it leaves a white cast or not and make my decision accordingly. What I love about the Hyggee sunscreens is that they are fragrance/essential oil free, but they still contain alcohol. I prefer alcohol because it allows the sunscreen to set better and be less tacky. If you have oily skin, I would think that one of the Hyggee sunscreens would work better for you because I have a Kolmar sunscreen (Isntree Watery Sun Gel) that is similar to the new Round Lab and Be Plain sunscreens and I definitely wouldn't recommend it for oily skin as it is way too shiny.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream has beet root extract, which made me think of the Krave Beet Shield. Get this, the Beet Shield was also made in Cosmax, same as this new Hyggee one. So I did some digging and found out that the Beet Shield has the SAME exact 5 filters as this new Hyggee sunscreens in the same order. The rest of ingredients are not too similar though, so I do not think they are the same exact sunscreen, as opposed to how I feel about the Be Plain and Round Lab sunscreens, which I do think are almost identical. I do think this Vegan Sun Cream is inspired by the Beet Shield, with maybe an improved formula, since the Beet Shield did not pass SPF tests. So if you are looking for a replacement of the Krave Beauty Beet Shield but with verified SPF protection, get the new Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream!",

Over time, with tartar/calculus and bacteria buildup *under* the gum line, bacteria eat into this tissue, forming pockets to form in this tissue. Small at first, 2mm or so, then progressing to over 5mm where you are in danger of either losing the tooth, or worse, forming a life threatening/crippling root abscess.\n\n**Symptoms ;**\n\nIt is known as a silent disease so it usually progresses with few symptoms. Eventually you will feel a dull aching pain and discomfort in the gum around a tooth. \n\n**Abscess?**\n\nIt's important to note that any further pain than 'discomfort' level eg: pain accompanied by pressure, systemic illness like severe pain, fever, nausea, headaches should be regarded as a possible periodontal abscess.\n\nPeriodontal abscesses ***can be deceptive*** causing highly variable symptoms, from systemic illness and severe tooth pain and pressure one day, to feeling fine the next because the periodontal pocket can drain some of the infection at random as it opens and closes.\n\nDo not rely on your dentist to pick this up.\n\nOrdinary dentists are not good at picking up periodontal abscesses with their 2d x-rays. That's because periodontal abscesses can be hidden along the complex roots of the teeth. If you believe you may have an periodontal abscess that your dentist has failed to pick up you will need a 3d xray of some sort.\n\n**3D x-ray:**\n\nMany advanced dentists called Endodontists (dentists which specialise in the roots of the teeth) have 3d xray technology called 'Cone Beam CT' (usually 3d CBCT). Periodontal practices, and local dental hospitals also have this.  Check your local area. (Ideally you will have the x-ray when inflamed so it shows up clearly)\n\n**Diagnosis:**\n\nUsually obtained on a referral from a Dentist to a specialist - The local dental hospital or a periodontist. A specialist dentist called a periodontist in conjunction with a periodontal hygenist will derive a treatment regieme, you may be able to save teeth with specialist treatments only they can offer like gum flap surgery or periodontal ligament cell stimulating compounds and bone replacement.\n\n**Treatment:**\n\nA map of the size of the pockets surrounding the teeth will be made. Any pockets with a depth over 4mm are diseased and will likely need a special instrument used to plane down the surface of the tooth and root to remove the bacteria and calculus. This process is called root plaining/scaling. Any pockets over 6mm and you stand a good chance to lose the tooth or have a root abscess develop. Usually the periodontist will do the examination and some initial scaling, and  a periodontal hygienist attached to a local dental practice will later take over the management when the disease has stabilized.\n\n**Prognosis:**\n\nCurrently the periodontal disease infection is regarded as incurable because although it can be killed by antibiotics, some of the bacteria will always hide inside human cells and be inaccessible to harm. Even when your pockets have closed and you are 'stable' the disease will remerge and progress if you provide the opportunity through neglect. If you have active disease, from untreated pockets (which are effectively open wounds) or a more advanced (deeper) infection which is more difficult to treat, the bacteria will be constantly populating your bloodstream and will try and colonise your organs and body. It is known that with periodontal disease the risks of developing heart disease rise significantly, and the risk of developing many serious cancers like lung and pancreatic double. If that's not enough, it's looking like the key P.D. bacteria, p.ginivalis, could be the main driver of Alzheimer's disease. There is a long list of diseases which the risk is known to rise significantly with P.D. However, for most people, if you follow the tips below, and the pockets have gradually reduced to 2-3mm, you do not then need further periodontal management on more than perhaps a simple usual monitoring basis with usual dental checkups. Once stable, the harm caused by a constant stream of this nasty bacteria getting to your bloodstream is over. \n\n**TOP TIPS TO MANAGE THE DISEASE**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Sonic Toothbrush](https://preview.redd.it/i7s9mgh2kx661.jpg?width=159&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91cc48ce97c0771f8c91d5ea57524d4217ecd1ba) (click to view picture)\n\n1. ***Buy a SONIC NOT a rotary electric or manual TOOTHBRUSH***. There are many brands out there - the Phillips Sonicare range for example. But realize spending money on this **vital tool** is tiny compared the overall cost of the disease, so I would go for a leading brand! \n\nWhen first using the sonic toothbrush and aiming it 45 degrees at the gumline you will find your gums bleed and a lot of 'grit' and blood is in your saliva. This lasts for about 10 days or so. This is a good thing!\n\nThat grit is tartar (also called calculus) - the stuff a dentist cleans with ordinary scaling. Tarter helps form periodontal 'pockets' of bacteria and food, progressively destroying the ligaments and structures underneath your gums. The energy waves of the Sonic brush ***penetrate UNDER the gumline*** by about 2mm to 4mm - cleaning it - places a ordinary brush or rotary cannot possibly access to clean. It does this by generating a wavefront distant from the brushhead, which although far weaker than the brushing action still breaks down calculus and biofilm (see https://www.animated-teeth.com/electric_toothbrushes/t3_sonic_toothbrushes.htm) \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2.** **NO SUGAR/SUGAR RICH FOODS**\n\nVery important. I have found it only takes 2 weeks to kick the sugar cravings, and then you don't think about it.  Even fruit juices are bad, but fruit itself is okay. If your eating juicy sugary fruit like oranges or apples, fine, but try to drink some water immediately afterwards. Things that are intensely sweet like raisins or dried fruit are to be avoided.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3**. ***Use XYLITOL to starve out bacteria in your gums.***\n\nThis is a KEY, MIRACLE product that costs only about $15/Kilo (2021) in managing the disease. You HAVE TO get it if your serious about defeating this illness. It is clincally proven and backed by science to greatly reduce plaqueload and transform peoples dental health.    \n&#x200B;\n\n[Xylitol](https://preview.redd.it/c0a59rd3lx661.jpg?width=78&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22a251237d3c438e9c5a3de66300fc55346890aa) (click to view picture)\n\nThis is, ***unbelievably***, a sugar which starves the bacteria in your mouth. It tastes completely like sugar, it has no aftertaste or residue, and no diabolical side effects on your gut. It is completely natural and found in many fruit and vegetables. (produced commercially from tree bark or cornhusks) humans have all the millions of years of fruit eating evolution to break it down into glucose (fuel) no problem. But bacteria don't. They think its sugar, gulp it, and then cannot break it down, or get rid of it, so starve to death. \n\nYou can get it from Amazon, Health stores, or other online retailers as of 2020 it's about $15/Kg. I don't think this has caught on with many dentists, my dentists even at hospital level don't have a clue about it!\n\n***But this was a major -huge- gamechanger for me. On the same level as the sonic toothbrush in managing the disease.***\n\nYou should try and take a teaspoon in a hot drink in the morning or sometime in the day, and that will tend get you to take it on a regular basis and improve your dental health dramtically by reducing plaqueload. I even found when suffering with discomfort a hot drink with a teaspoon of Xyiltol brought massive relief over 40 minutes or so, as the liquid travels up the gums and starves out the bacteria and inflammation. It also stays in your mouth/gums for hours (like sugar) continuing to do its work and help you conquer your disease symptoms.\n\nIf your diabetic (and diabetics often get periodontal disease) Xylitol is a great alternative to sugar for as it does not raise [blood ](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes_care/Diabetes_and_blood_glucose.html)[glucose](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes_care/Diabetes_and_blood_glucose.html) or [insulin](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/forum/) levels, and has a reduced caloric value.\n\n**4. FLOSSING/TEPE BRUSHES**\n\nVery important to remove food stuck between the teeth. This can relieve a lot of discomfort with an inflamed pocket.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[6 tepe brushes](https://preview.redd.it/ieemebncjx661.jpg?width=119&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b4c1856c5f21cf65fa042a1b3af5f05c1cad8ed4) (click to view picture)\n\nTe-pe brushes are generally better IMO than flossing alone, but flossing, while not great at removing food, can get under the gumline and remove calculus unlike a brush. There is a bit of a technique to flossing, with many youtube videos on the proper technique. But the golden rule is to be gentle always.\n\nYou can get packets of tepe brushes online, I get mine (pink ones - the smallest size) from eBay or Amazon.\n\nWaterflossing. Another great aid - but no need to get a overly complex expensive machine like a waterpik IMO. I have used all sorts of water flosses including the waterpik and the low tech pump up ones you can buy for a few dollars on ebay work just as well. \n\n[Cheap Pump Up Water Flosser\\/Irrigator](https://preview.redd.it/xk55hbrlix661.jpg?width=102&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a919b45605465f55dd1960768e5021fd892649a1) (click to view picture)\n\nThe mainstay will be the tepe brush, followed by flossing to prevent inflamed pockets.\n\n**5. MOUTHWASH**\n\nA disinfectant mouthwash like Chlorohex daily or hydrogen peroxide is also very good at killing the bacteria if you have an uncomfortable flair up. Dip the tepe brush in and make sure it gets to the pocket. You can even add some to your waterfloss and pump it into the pocket.\n\nLastly, take heart - I have found this is a disease with ***an end*** if you follow the above tips to get stable.",

The only good plant oils for cooking are coconut and olive. Other oils are good for your skin but either not suited to or not practical for cooking\n\n-use low heat when cooking, wet cooking methods produce less AGEs than dry methods (like stewing versus baking)\n\n-carotenoids can increase skin resilience to sun, but are absorbed better with a fat source. Beta carotene is not the same as retinol (animal source vitamin A) highest source of animal vitamin A is liver. Some sources like myfooddata are now claiming the highest source of dietary vitamin A is carrots, but I swear a few years ago they listed beef liver, which is the standard listed food with highest vitamin A. Idk what the agenda is, but be aware that there have been studies on women from the UK showing most of them do not absorb beta carotene at all. It will still help your skin tho, as it is present in the skin (hence why you can turn orange from too many!)\n\n-avoid sugar like the plague, read into skin glycation. If you need sugar in your tea or coffee like I do, use a sugar alcohol like xylitol or erythritol. Erythritol is easer for digestion\n\n-stay hydrated. Drinking water is not the best way to hydrate. Better is adequate fat in the diet  and eating foods rich in water (melon, celery, tomatoes, etc)\n\n-sunscreen: not all equal, there have been studies that show chemical sunscreens can cause aging when exposed to sunlight. Better is titanium or zinc based. Titanium leaves less of a white cast. Sunscreen expires - throw it away after 9 months. Treat your neck as an extension of your face\n\n-avoid seed oils, they are oxidizing agents\n\n-no excuse for smoking or drinking. They both age you like crazy. Alcohol is just sugar on steroids for your skin.\n\n-Collagen is important to get from the diet. People in modern times eat more muscle meat than our ancestors ever did. Try making bone broth with bones you would normally discard - good for your skin and wallet\n\n-preventing bone loss is crucial for preventing loss of beauty. You should do some kind of resistance training and make sure to get enough trace minerals like Mg and Silicon in addition to what everyone already knows like Ca and vit D. Oral hygiene is crucial to prevent bone loss in the jaw. You should brush at least 2 times a day, but lightly to preserve gums and enamel. Don't eat or drink anything but water within 30 min of brushing\n\n-ideal BMI for women is 21-24.\n\n-retin A serums can exacerbate skin damage from the sun, only use them at night and wash your face in the morning.\n\n-red light therapy and IPL are both able to repair skin and build collagen. I just don't know how effective home devices really are. I use a Braun IPL device and I do believe it improved the appearance of my cellulite.\n\n-microneedling can also build collagen but a pen is better than a roller for hygiene purposes. Always disinfect between uses or just go to a professional.\n\n-Collagen supplements actually work, if you don't have access you can also try organic gelatin sheets. Organic and high quality is the key here. Don't listen to people who say it will never end up on your face, if you take enough, it will. Also refer to point 12\n\n-exercise is great but if you can't run properly, it's more harmful than helpful. I personally prefer weight lifting and walking. If you are exerting yourself to the point that you have to breathe with your mouth open, your body thinks you are being hunted and produces stress hormones, which trigger aging and also storage of bellyfat. You get all the same benefits from walking and even more from weightlifting.\n\n-consider niacin supplements - nicotinamide has been proven to combat aging\n\nThings that Aren't Lifestyle Related that Make Women Look Younger\n\n1.\t‚Å†Neotenous features\n2.\t‚Å†Prominent jaw and chin (as opposed to even slightly weak)\n3.\t‚Å†Long hair - never just give in and cut it, women look significantly better with hair at least to lob length. It probably won't be possible to maintain waist-length hair at 60, but shoulder-length is quite manageable\n4.\t‚Å†Lower BMI and smaller frame, visible muscle tone in the extremities\n5.\t‚Å†Forward Growth - similar to a strong jaw, forward growth in the upper thirds will also help prop the skin up as you age. Forward projected midface supports the eyes and prevents old, tired looking eyes.\n6.\t‚Å†Bigger lips - the more volume you start with, the more you can afford to lose. Also a lengthening philtrum is a telltale sign of aging.",

You are **not** a bad owner for using a muzzle correctly. If this muffle can keep your dog from **death** then it is definitely worth the investment. If this muffle cannot do this then consider a muzzle for the sake of your dog. You are **not** a bad own for putting a muzzle on your dog to save its life. Basket muzzles, like others are saying, is very breathable. There is also a cotton closed muzzle if your dog can eat through a basket muzzle (my dog could still eat poop with a basket muzzle and had to be switched to a cloth one while training her to not eat others poop- she was getting extremely sick from her sick little habit). \n\nPs: whoever is killing dogs is a scumbag.",

        "body": "In Italy every dog owner (no matter how small or sweet the dog is) must ALWAYS have a muzzle on themsleves, and must be able to put it on the dog if necessary ( = if an officer, or someone of authority, asks).  \nMuzzles are also mandatory in pulbic transports (unless the dog is small enough to ride in a small crate).\n\nMany owners don't actually get the muzzle and/or muzzle train their dog, at least not until they need it/get a big fine, but the point is: I muzzle trained my dog.  \nI consider it vital: it is necessary by law, he follows me on bus and trains very often, it might become necessary at the vet (my dog is almost 40 kg: imagine he's hurt and the vet has to touch him - even if he were the sweetest boy in the world, which he isn't, he might bite as a pain reflex, so it is either the muzzle or sedation: the first one is safe for him as well, the second one not as much)\n\nSo what I did was getting a huge basket muzzle.  \nThen I took it out and showed him the muzzle, letting him sniff it as long as he wanted, while saying look, isn't it a nice muzzle? yes it is! Good boy, look, muzzle! Nice!\" and I verbally reinforced him every time he approached the muzzle to sniff it.  \nThen I put away the muzzle.  \nA couple of hours later I took it out again and did the very same thing.  \nThen again.  \nBy that point, half a day since I got the muzzle, he approached it wagging his tail as soon as I got it - he had even started to recognize the word \"muzzle\".  \nThen I took out food: my dog eats everything, but you should still choose something the dog goes crazy for.  \nSo I showed him the muzzle and offered him a biscuit from the other side of the muzzle, meaning he had to put his head in to get the treat.  \nI did that a couple of time making sure to tell him \"muzzle!\" before showing him the treat (and having him put his head in).  \nThen I put it away.  \nNext time I took it out I repeated the muzzle-treat thing, except I started to ask him to put his head in first, and then I took out the treat: by that point he was expecting me to give him something, so he did. I slowly increased the time I had him waiting for a biscuit.  \nThen I closed the muzzle: as soon as I did that I started saying \"good boy! look who's a good boy! Want a biscuit now?\" - he knows the word \"biscuit\", and he was expecting me to go get a biscuit from the jar anyway, so he immediately forgot that he had something on and started waiting for his treat, which I gave - then I took off the muzzle.  \nI slowly increased the time I let him wait with the muzzle on, asking things like sit or heel or high five.\n\nThat took me 2 days, I think.   \nBy the end of day 2 he was jumping with joy every time I took out his muzzle, trying to get it on on his own. He's able to wear it for many hours and he nevers shows any stress while doing so: he sleeps, get treats, licks himself...  \nThat was 9 years ago: he was a young teenager then, and today he's an old boy: I've never had to do this muzzle-treat association again, it may be months between the times I use the muzzle, and yet every time he goes crazy with joy.\n\nNot joking, if I get the muzzle he pushes his head in, he loves it!  \nThe only thing you have to do is make a good enough positive association, then the dog won't be stressed or annoyed - actually, they'll love it",

Would you like to set my mouthful of gold crowned molars? ü´† That had to stop.\n\nI like crunchy food and in terms of meals, great. Salads, crispy veg (if you've boiled that veg for more than 30 seconds I'm not eating it!) I can eat \"healthy\" at meals, as long as the specific things I like are available. Meals aren't the issue..\n\nIn between meals, whether I was studying in school, reading a book or doing my data entry job, i NEED to add the stim of hard, crunchy food. Chocolate covered nuts, frozen choc chips, mini eggs, m&ms, in a pinch I can tolerate chips and salsa, but generally it's chocolate and it's frozen solid, like ice. Nuts on their own aren't as appealing and that's still a lot of unnecessary calories.\n\nIt's not about not eating enough protein or lacking a vitamin, believe me. Working in the \"health food\" industry in my early 20s helped me develop my (unhealthy) black and white thinking about food and I tried every \"diet\" or food fad there is, thinking there was a right eat to eat to be a good person. I just had to find that way. \n\nI'm done with disordered eating thanks. \n\nI've thought about chewing gum but honestly after about 4 minutes it's just tasteless rubber and it all seems kind of stale lately so it's not appealing to gnaw through that stale layer at all. \n\nIf there's was a safe way to eat ice chips I'd 100% do that. Truly!!! The idea of having a bowl of carrots nearby holds zero appeal (my stint with keto years ago ruined carrots for me) and frozen peas only stay frozen for so long, believe me, I've tried that too. Cutting celei into cubes feels tedious. \n\nI could totally eat dry cereal as another post suggested, but it's still food/calories I don't need and as I approach 50 this year, my body needs less excess calories, not more. \n\nHas anyone found a way to add that necessary second layer of stim when you're a) doing something with your hands already, like data entry or holding your book, so they're \"busy\" and b) it can't be something auditory because then I can't concentrate on what I'm typing or reading, without using eating as that stim?\n\nTeach me your ways oh wise one. üòé\n\nUPDATE:\n\nHey all!! Thanks so much for these great responses. I know us ADHD folk can struggle not to just reply right away, without necessarily reading the full question. \n\nThought I'd summarize my takeaways in case you also wanted a list like this and can just save this post and not have to read through it all of needed. There are great suggestions all around, some wouldn't work for me, and these are the ones that could work for me: \n\n* Nugget ice maker - $$ and might still fuck up my teeth but I'm open to looking into it. And hey, extra hydration!! It would be great if this could be the fix! But with so much dental work in my past, I'm still afraid to try it. But that sonic ice, specifically, looks so good and not any harder/firmer than roasted nuts. \n\n* Cut up celery with lime and spice. The cutting up is key because part of the fixation is picking bits up with my hand and then chewing while I type (vs holding a stick of celery, taking and bite and putting it down again. That's not automatic enough! Lol) I def can't type with it in my hand! \n\n* Popcorn but not too salty or sweet (counters the point of trying not to get diabetes/excess salt) I could eat caramel corn all day, but don't. \n**Fancy option: use chopsticks to keep my fingers clean if it's cheesy corn. Though runs into same issue as celery sticks, but I'm open to finding solutions. We love to research stuff right? Could use this for those lime-y celery bits too. \n\n* Mini dill pickles, slices into little coins. Small crunchy things just like mini eggs. \n\n* Dry cereal. This would need to be sugary to appeal, but still less cals than candy/choc. I did this as a kid and forgot. Also looking into a Korean cereal puff thing. \n\n\n* Consider fewer/smaller meals so that these snacks can be part of my overall daily food intake, rather than just sweet treats for hours on end. \n\n* Gum, but only minty chicklet-style (not thick bubble gum) and only sometimes, not all the time (learned about bloating from open mouth smacking all day and becoming sick of that much xylitol).\n\n* Gonna look into chewy necklaces again. I did before but wondered if I'd actually use it. \n\n* Could do snap peas. Can't do cukes, too soft in the middle. I don't like carrots. \n\nIf I discover more fixes I'll add them!! And I'm sure there's more below that I've missed. I'll update this as I go. \n\nI like to eat crunchy stuff in general, so crackers and rice cakes feature in my lunches anyway. But I can't just nosh on them in the same way between meals. I like them with stuff like cheese or avocado and that's not the same \"small things I use one hand to stuff into my mouth while I type\" goal I have with candy. \n\nI used to eat tons of grapes at a time and would develop mouth sores from it. One of my superpowers is I can overdo anything. \n\nI've done dried/roasted chickpeas before but can't handle the dryness. Lol. I can't explain it but there you go. \n\nI can't do frozen fruit (grapes etc) because my teeth are super sensitive to cold, like can't bite through it. Eating frozen chocolate is diff because I'm like cracking the Choc when I bite it, vs sinking my teeth into/through it, which would transfer the coldness. \n\n\nRe IRON: I have an inability to absorb iron, in any form or method of intake. I've tried them all. It cannot be cured/helped, and it sucks, so yeah, over been through all that with a doc and there's nothing I can do about it. My kids have it too. \n",

Like dark chocolate chips or something?\n\nIf sweetness is the requirement (which it sometimes is for me), I combine fruits with my crunchies. So I'll have a bowl of chips with a bowl of fruit. I keep chopped fruits in my fridge. Because I can't stand very sweet stuff so I prefer some sweet and sour.\n\nI also like having chilled water in the fridge. Which I take into a glass and sip little by little. Very satiating.\n\nAnd as you said - ice chips is fun. It's nice crunchy and somehow tastes also nice.\n\nYou can try baked ragi snacks? I'm sure there must be an equivalent like baked corn snacks or baked millets or Quinoa snacks or something. Those have lower gi. I liked those but again - addictive.  So I only buy it once in a while.\n\nI avoid keeping gorgable things like chips and chocolates and cookies because I have the self control of a toddler. Don't buy and don't eat is my motto.

    "body": "‚ö†Ô∏è **DISCLAIMER:** Since making this post, I've learned some new information that has changed my perception and usage of the term \"fungal-safe\". I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è\n\nIt's been over a year since I first made a list of fungal-safe products, for anyone dealing with malassezia follicutlitis (fungal acne), seb derm (seborrheic dermatitis) or similar conditions. Since then, more products have come on the market, reformulations have happened, I've used more products - plus I figured having just a list would be handy reference, since my first post was... really long üòÇ\n\n[My first list of fungal-safe products](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), with an in-depth guide to how I made my first fungal-safe skincare routine, and practical tips. Notable point is, since that post, I've learned that cetearyl alcohol is not fungal-safe, and switched to using https://folliculitisscout.com as an ingredient checker since I find it up to date, with that ingredient flagged. if any of you want to check if a product is fungal-safe - that's the website I personally use ‚ò∫Ô∏è If you want a detailed rundown of how and why these ingredients affect our skin, I highly reccomend the SimpleSkincareScience website - [Their Fungal Acne Treatment Bible post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) is very thorough and cites sources ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n[My current routine in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (more or less) with some haircare.\n\nThese are not recommendations, they're just useful information - some products have reviews linked, but please do use ‚ú®Ô∏èthe search bar‚ú®Ô∏è as well as other sources to check out other reviews, and make an informed purchase  ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\n**Disclaimer:** These products are not guaranteed to suit anybody. It's just that ingredients that are known triggers for seb derm or fungal acne - like plant oils, esters, fatty acids, etc. - are absent in these products. They may not suit your skin for other reasons. YMMV.\n\n**They will not treat malassezia related conditions**, they're intended as options for those who want to use a fungal-safe routine, to prevent flare-ups and maintain their skin.\n\nIF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MAY BE SUFFERING FROM ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS, PLEASE SEEK MEDICAL GUIDANCE FROM A DERMATOLOGIST.

I've mentioned the source of the squalane in these products whenever I've been able to find that info.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you are dealing with active seb derm/fungal acne and want to be on the safe side, best to avoid products containing mineral oil, liquid paraffin or Vaseline/white petroleum altogether.

The meat itself was from an animal native to Datsot, but the aromatic seasoning was imported from off-world.\n\nRosemary.\n\nIt gave off an odd scent but a pleasant one‚Ä¶ once he got used to it. Some called it an acquired taste.\n\nIt was an expensive taste, to put it mildly. But being able to afford luxuries like this was one of the perks of the job as a fuel cartel boss.\n\n*What‚Äôs the point of all the credits in the galaxy if you can‚Äôt enjoy life?*\n\nHe accompanied the steak with a sip of the mystery alien drink from his fancy glass. It was a dark brown liquid with the consistency of water. There were bubbles floating in it, rising to the top. His chef had assured him it was another top quality import from the new aliens.\n\nAs the liquid touched his tongue, he shuddered at the mildly spicy, extremely sweet flavor.\n\n‚ÄúWhew. It‚Äôs got a kick to it!‚Äù Zaernust exclaimed, turning to his chef. ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù\n\nHis chef asked excitedly, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what they call‚Ä¶ soda. Is it any good?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSoda, huh?‚Äù He gulped down the rest of it, letting it bubble and fizz on his tongue before feeling it run down his esophagus into his stomach. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost like our stelgi. Amazing. Another!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGlad you like it,‚Äù his chef said, pouring him another glass. Zaernust didn‚Äôt wait before greedily licking the thin layer of foam off the top. The chef continued, ‚ÄúThis cost us a small fortune to acquire. All completely genuine, I was assured. In its original packaging too!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOriginal packaging?‚Äù He raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúLike they‚Äôre collectibles?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThey came in these red and black aluminum cans. Vintage.‚Äù The chef showed him one of the empty cans.\n\n‚ÄúAluminum?!‚Äù he gasped at the smooth metal, feeling it bend slightly even as he held it in his paw. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this‚Ä¶ what we use to make airplanes and spaceship hull?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat very metal‚Äîit‚Äôs a high-quality alloy!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAmazing, these aliens. How do they even come up with this stuff?‚Äù He shook his head in wonder and grinned, ‚ÄúNot to mention their equipment.‚Äù\n\n*That* was his personal favorite. Unlike most Federation or Znosian military hardware, Terran armored vehicles ‚Äî the ones that had been transported to Datsot, at least ‚Äî drank fuel. Just gulped it down. Their Navy and Marines knew their supply chains and logistics, but given the lack of any refueling stations between their systems and Datsot‚Ä¶ As the owner of 85% of fuel processing plants on Datsot, this war had made Zaernust a very rich criminal indeed.\n\n‚ÄúMore soda?‚Äù his chef asked, as he finished off yet another cup.\n\n‚ÄúJust one more cup.‚Äù\n\n*What‚Äôs the point of all the credits in the galaxy if you can‚Äôt enjoy life indeed?*\n\nAt that moment, one of his lieutenants walked into his dining room with her datapad. Her face told him it wasn‚Äôt anything as pleasant as his meal.\n\n‚ÄúCan‚Äôt that wait?‚Äù he asked, looking greedily at the remaining plates on the table even as he chugged another glass full of soda. He gestured for another refill from his chef.\n\n‚ÄúNo, sir. It‚Äôs that annoying bitch from upstairs again. And she‚Äôs not taking no for an answer.‚Äù\n\nIt really was a pity that the car bomb ‚Äî and the backup hit squad ‚Äî didn‚Äôt manage to take her out last week. It wouldn‚Äôt be hard for her to trace it back to him, but what was she going to do? She was one of those high society penthouse folks with their golden pens and corner offices, afraid to get their paws dirty with what needed to be done. Of course, she couldn‚Äôt be allowed to stick around now; he‚Äôd have to send her another present shortly‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄúWhat does she want now?‚Äù he asked his lieutenant.\n\n‚ÄúNo idea, but she‚Äôs been persistent. I threatened to hang her whole clan from a bridge by their tails, but she‚Äôs still clogging up our line.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAh, give me the datapad,‚Äù he said, extending his paw. ‚ÄúMaybe she doesn‚Äôt believe your threats. She‚Äôll believe mine.‚Äù\n\nShe handed it over. As he accepted the call, Zaernust examined the female on the screen. There was a thin band of uneven fur in her wavy silver mane, but he couldn‚Äôt tell if that was something he gave her from the explosion or a deliberate stylistic choice.\n\n‚ÄúThis is Zaernust,‚Äù he said, activating the microphone. ‚ÄúI understand that my associates have properly communicated the consequences of annoying us, Eupprio?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou cub of a Grass Eater!‚Äù she snarled. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think I don‚Äôt know what you did.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúCareful now, Malgeirgam outsider. There‚Äôs nothing you can prove to a court,‚Äù Zaernust cautioned.\n\nThat was not technically true. What was true was there was nothing she could prove to a local court‚Ä¶ that hadn‚Äôt been bribed or had their clans threatened by him.\n\nHe continued his threat, ‚ÄúAnd I know where you live. I know where your whole clan lives. Don‚Äôt think I can‚Äôt reach you just because they‚Äôre offworld. We have connections in every system‚Äî‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh, you do?‚Äù Eupprio said sarcastically. ‚ÄúYou know where I live?!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSure I do. And I don‚Äôt think I like your tone, executive.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMy bad,‚Äù she continued in an equally grating tone. ‚ÄúYou know where I live. I should be scared of you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou should. Perhaps you have not heard‚Äî‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúShould I?‚Äù He saw her turn her head to look at the screen from another angle, as if trying to peek out of the datapad. ‚ÄúThat looks like a nice dinner. How‚Äôs your drink?‚Äù\n\nZaernust frowned in confusion at the non-sequitur. ‚ÄúMy drink? Huh?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYour soda. My company imports a lot of it into Datsot.‚Äù\n\nHe guffawed. ‚ÄúAnd you think your obscene wealth gives you any power over me? Must be odd for you‚Ä¶ dealing with someone that all your credits can‚Äôt do anything about. Guess what? I can find another soda supplier any time I want. It‚Äôs not like the recipe is some state secret from the Terrans.‚Äù\n\nEupprio stared at him without changing her expression. ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not. In fact, the recipe‚Äôs been public forever.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYeah, so what‚Äôs your point‚Äî‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFor the regular version of the soda anyway,‚Äù Eupprio added.\n\nZaernust tilted his head. ‚ÄúRegular version?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDo you know what the biggest public health problem the Terrans had about a century ago?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúTerran health‚Ä¶ problem?‚Äù Zaernust asked uneasily as he downed another cup of the delicious, sweet soda. His stomach groaned briefly, and he felt the aftertaste came back up into his mouth. It wasn‚Äôt unpleasant, just‚Ä¶ odd.\n\n‚ÄúYes. Obesity. Heart problems, blood sugar levels, joint issues‚Ä¶ All related to eating too much.‚Äù\n\nZaernust licked his nose. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs strange. Why didn‚Äôt they simply eat less?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHave you *had* Terran food?‚Äù Eupprio asked, a hint of amusement flashing across her face.\n\nHe refilled his cup and downed the delicious soda again. ‚ÄúPoint taken, but what do Terran health issues have to do with you being annoying?‚Äù\n\n*Grumble, grumble.* His stomach made another odd noise as more of the sweet aftertaste came up in a burp.\n\n‚ÄúBefore they put anti-obesity drugs in their water supply to get rid of these issues, you know what they did to address it?‚Äù It was a rhetorical question. Of course he didn‚Äôt know. She continued, ‚ÄúThey made these different versions of their food, using components that were almost equally as delicious, but they didn‚Äôt contain as many calories as the original, if they had any calories at all. For example, diet soda.‚Äù\n\nZaernust‚Äôs stomach was grumbling non-stop now. And as Eupprio kept lecturing on with that dangerous, confident expression on her face, he was getting more and more anxious.\n\n‚ÄúDiet‚Ä¶ soda?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes, diet soda,‚Äù she said, nodding. ‚ÄúNow, most Terran foods are perfectly safe for us to consume‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nAt that, his heart sank. He‚Äôd threatened enough people with creative methods of death to know where this particular thread of conversation was going.\n\n‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ there is one particular compound, that when consumed in large enough quantities, is extremely bad for our species. It‚Äôs an artificial sweetener called‚Ä¶ xylitol. It‚Äôs very sweet, making it perfect for use as a substitute sugar in certain sugary drinks.‚Äù\n\nZaernust hurriedly picked up one of the empty red and black aluminum cans on his table and squinted to read the small text, searching for the exotic alien name with his very limited grasp of Terran language. He swore he could feel his vision blur even as he skimmed through the lengthy list of chemical ingredients.\n\nEupprio continued, as if not noticing his growing panic. ‚ÄúAfter they fixed their obesity issues, the Terrans stopped needing substitute sugars, and they stopped producing as much of it. But‚Ä¶ some stocks do still exist for connoisseurs, and some people simply enjoy the taste. Say, are you panting more than usual, Zaernust? Is your heartbeat feeling regular?‚Äù\n\nZaernust closed his mouth to hide his rapid breathing. He could feel his heart pounding in his chest harder than it‚Äôd ever done.\n\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äî what does this xylitol do?‚Äù he asked in a small voice, his ears ringing.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs perfectly safe for humans. For us, well‚Ä¶ it depends on how much you‚Äôve had. A couple sips is a recoverable accident ‚Äî you‚Äôd just need to get your stomach pumped,‚Äù she said nonchalantly. ‚ÄúBut a can or two‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôre looking at rapid liver failure, heart failure‚Ä¶ nothing good even if you do escape death. Any more than that, you‚Äôd be lucky to have an open casket funeral. I heard a few of our people in the Republic had sporadic incidents. Their hospitals know the symptoms, so they know how to deal with it. And since they know it‚Äôs dangerous to us, it‚Äôs generally restricted for export out of Sol‚Ä¶ unless, of course, you have Terran engineers on your staff who like the vintage stuff.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat did you do?‚Äù he asked desperately, feeling a sharp pain in his stomach even as he asked.\n\n‚ÄúWhen I saw a certain shipping manifest‚Ä¶‚Äù Eupprio sighed dramatically. ‚ÄúThese accidents and shipping mix-ups do happen from time to time, you know?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äî you‚Äî‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúCall the doctor!‚Äù his lieutenant yelled, sprinting out of the room. ‚ÄúWe need a doctor!‚Äù\n\nEupprio stared at him through the datapad. ‚ÄúWhy did you do it? Why did you try to blow me up? It‚Äôs not like you can take over my business. The Terrans won‚Äôt work with someone like you. Even if they‚Äôre okay with your shady activities, which some of them are, they weren‚Äôt going to trust you after what you tried to do to me.‚Äù\n\nZaernust doubled over in pain as his stomach grumbled non-stop. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIs it the Grass Eaters? The Znosians?‚Äù she asked, leaning into the datapad.\n\n‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell‚Äî tell‚Äî‚Äù He couldn‚Äôt even finish his sentence before he threw up a puddle of the spicy liquid onto his very expensive carpet.\n\n‚ÄúWhat are they? Paying you? Threats to your life?‚Äù\n\nZaernust stuttered as he choked on the foam coming up from his digestive system, ‚ÄúIt was just‚Äî just business!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWho was it? How did they get to you?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell‚Äî‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre dying anyway. Be a Malgeir! For once in your life, be a Malgeir!‚Äù she yelled.\n\nZaernust doubled over as another bout of sharp pain struck his midsection. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Äî it‚Äôs‚Äî they have a hibernation ship half a light year out from Datsot‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHow do you talk to them?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFuel‚Äî fuel deliveries,‚Äù he gasped as he threw up another mouthful of sour diet soda onto his carpet. ‚ÄúOne of our orbital fuel ships on the dark side has a one-time code book with them‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nEupprio sat back, nodding with a seemingly satisfied expression. ‚ÄúThat should narrow it down enough for the Terrans to search.‚Äù\n\n*Hyuk. Hyuk. Hyuk. Blaaarrrrgh.*\n\nThis time, it was almost half a cup of soda coming out of his nose. And Zaernust could almost swear he tasted metal on his tongue.\n\n‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the doctor?‚Äù he whimpered to himself as he panted heavily, leaning into his table.\n\n‚ÄúBusy,‚Äù Eupprio said, grinning a wide grin at him. ‚ÄúAs are all the emergency services in your area who have been instructed specifically not to respond to something at your address at the moment. What were you saying about my cold, hard money?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúPlease‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt mean‚Äî it was just business. Eupprio, please‚Ä¶ You have to understand!‚Äù Zaernust begged.\n\nEupprio‚Äôs grin disappeared, and she glared at him coldly. ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt understand. I like money, and I do business, but never! Never have I betrayed my species like you have. Not for money. Not for anything.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúPlease‚Ä¶‚Äù he whined again.\n\n‚ÄúAfter you tried to kill me, I went to the Terrans. My friends on Mars have this thinking machine; it sees everything, it knows everything. I already guessed it was either you or those buffoons in Stoers, but the machine looked at a slice of Datsot communications traffic and came up with all the proof I needed in half a millisecond. And it said you were probably getting paid by Grass Eaters. Then, it generated for me a thousand methods of revenge, complete with your whereabouts, your schedule, your weaknesses‚Ä¶ your eating habits. It suggested all kinds of painful ends for you‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre lucky Abe or Fleguipu weren‚Äôt seriously injured; I would have slaughtered your entire clan.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúPlease‚Ä¶ no‚Äî hup‚Ä¶ Eupprio‚Ä¶‚Äù Zaernust hiccupped. ‚ÄúI have a hup‚Äî I have a clan. I have‚Äî hup, I have a six-year-old cub!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDo you even realize how monumentally hard you screwed up?‚Äù Eupprio tilted her head as her voice turned harsh. ‚ÄúI make weapons and warships, you dumb fuck. And all my friends are people who make weapons and warships. And all my clients are people who actually use those weapons and warships. The piles of Znosian bodies that can ultimately be traced back to me would make me the‚Ä¶ top five‚Ä¶ maybe top three killers in the entire Federation. Why do you think the Grass Eaters wanted you to kill me so badly?‚Äù\n\nHis hiccupping got worse as he sobbed. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realize‚Äî hup‚Äî I didn‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAlas, luckily for you,‚Äù Eupprio sighed after a moment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a total psychopath like you. So‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll let this simply be a lesson to you.‚Äù\n\nZaernust sat up, hope in his eyes even as he sucked in shallow breaths. ‚ÄúHuh? Lesson?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôll report yourself to the authorities. And you‚Äôll ask for ten years in prison, which is way less than you deserve. In fact, you‚Äôll bribe them for it and pay for the stay. And if your people on the outside don‚Äôt screw around with my fuel source, *my* people on the inside won‚Äôt shank you in the showers.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôll do anything! Is there‚Äî is there an antidote‚Ä¶ for this xylitol poison?‚Äù Zaernust asked hopefully through his tears. ‚ÄúPlease?‚Äù\n\nEupprio looked at his pitiful face for long moment and then broke into a giggle. ‚ÄúXylitol‚Äôs not toxic for us, you idiot.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat? But my stomach‚Ä¶‚Äù Zaernust‚Äôs voice trailed off even as he sat back up and stared at the puddles and mess he made all over his carpet and dining table.\n\n‚ÄúYou drank like twenty cans of soda in a single meal. Of course you‚Äôre going to have a stomach ache and vomiting and hiccups, and your own brain invented the rest! Bahahahahah! Your face!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut‚Äî but‚Äî‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLook at your face!‚Äù she laughed in pure delight, wiping a tear off her face with the back of her paw. ‚ÄúOh, that almost made it all worth it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt‚Äî What‚Äî No! You can‚Äôt‚Äî hup‚Äî you can‚Äôt just do this to me!‚Äù Zaernust stomped his feet paws in frustration.\n\nEupprio stopped laughing and looked at him severely. ‚ÄúI was serious about that reporting to jail thing, by the way. I own your district. I‚Äôll know if you don‚Äôt do exactly as I ordered.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut prison! Ten years!‚Äù he whined. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Äî hup‚Äî that‚Äôs forever!‚Äù\n\nEupprio pointed a claw at him through the screen. ‚ÄúAnd if I ever *hear* your name again after today, the next thing that‚Äôs going to come for you isn‚Äôt going to be hiccups and diabetes. It‚Äôs going to be a fucking Raytech hypersonic bunker buster from my assembly line through your front window. We don‚Äôt *play* on the same level, asshole. This was your only warning. Now, get out of my face; I‚Äôm going to go get more Grass Eaters killed.‚Äù\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n### TRNS Crete, Slasograch (2.4 Ly)\n\n**POV: Carla Bauernschmidt, Terran Republic Navy (Rank: Rear Admiral)**\n\nCarla watched the organized chaos calmly as her fleet completed their final preparations before blink.\n\nSpeinfoent tapped her on the shoulder. ‚ÄúCall from Atlas. Fleet Admiral Amelia Waters.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôll take it here,‚Äù she said, activating her console. ‚ÄúFleet Admiral?‚Äù\n\nAmelia‚Äôs voice came through. ‚ÄúAny last minute issues with the operation, Admiral?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo. I just got a solid green from all my squadrons.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGood, good,‚Äù Amelia said. Carla could hear her take a deep, pained breath through the audio call. She continued, ‚ÄúDid you hear about what the Buns did? McMurdo, Gruccud, Datsot, Malgeiru‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nCarla nodded. ‚ÄúGood old hybrid war. Our old SRN friends‚Äô M. O. except with the combined resources of six hundred star systems. Are you alright?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDid they catch who did it?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHe died on the shuttle. We rolled up a few small collaborator cells operated by one of their underground networks near Gruccud city, but‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSo much for end of major combat operations‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nAmelia grunted without a response.\n\nNeither of them said anything for a moment. Carla continued, ‚ÄúI heard the Malgeir lost a whole spaceport right on Malgeiru.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYup. And six power stations in their capital. And that‚Äôs just one city. The assholes can do this all day. The Buns have no shortage of resources or people they can threaten. And they‚Äôre not going to stop until we stop them. If we go through with the phased armistice agreement that‚Äôs being discussed in the Senate, well‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt have a good feeling about what happens after.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still doing the armistice? I thought people would‚Äî‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúPeople are pissed. I‚Äôm pissed. We‚Äôre not having peace with them today or tomorrow. But remember, our enemy thinks in centuries. So, we have no choice but to consider as far in advance. We can‚Äôt count on the Republic to be ready to fight a war longer than it has existed. The nature of this threat is not new, but yesterday, we have been reminded of how adaptive the enemy has become. Therefore‚Ä¶ we must adapt even more rapidly.‚Äù\n\nCarla raised an eyebrow at the sharp tone. ‚ÄúAre there to be any‚Äî any major additional objectives in our current campaign?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo additional objectives. But there will be a slight‚Ä¶ clarification for your rules of engagement.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúA‚Äî a clarification?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAffirmative. Admiral Carla Bauernschmidt: in the coming operation, you and all those who report to you will follow all the laws of the Republic and the Republic Navy Code of Justice‚Ä¶‚Äù Amelia‚Äôs blue eyes stared straight into the screen without blinking, and she continued coldly, ‚ÄúBut *no more consideration than that is necessary*.‚Äù\n\nCarla sucked in a deep breath as her eyes went wide. ‚ÄúNo more consideration than‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nAmelia nodded and said softly, ‚ÄúYes, Admiral. Do you understand? Read it back.‚Äù\n\n*No more consideration than the laws of war‚Ä¶*\n\nThere was a good half minute of silence on the call before Carla trusted herself to reply, ‚ÄúYes, Fleet Admiral. I read back: the scope of our operations will be limited only by the capability of my fleet, my people, and the laws of the Republic.‚Äù\n\nHer heart skipped a beat until Amelia nodded again to confirm her response. ‚ÄúSpot on. Good luck, Admiral. Make them remember. Atlas, out.‚Äù\n\nSpeinfoent stepped up next to her as the screen dismissed itself. He cleared his throat. ‚ÄúIs that‚Äî does that mean what I think it means?‚Äù\n\nCarla turned to look him in the eye. ‚ÄúIt means‚Ä¶ that when we are done, they‚Äôll know it‚Äî they‚Äôll feel it in their hearts. This lesson ‚Äî they won‚Äôt be forgetting this in the long history of their people.‚Äù\n\nHe glanced sideways at the simulation computers with the latest exercise results still displayed on the screens. He agreed softly, ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt think they will.‚Äù\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n[Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1jiqtsp/grass_eaters_3_59/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1jlyuv3/grass_eaters_3_61/)",

A Terran is free.\n\nWith a deep booming voice, Steven began to decree.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúMerry Christmas to all, and to all a good cheer.\n\nHappy holidays to all, to a fantastic new year.\n\nI'm Santa from Earth, I‚Äôve travelled so far\n\nTo bring good tidings and presents, to every star.\n\nI bring candies and gadgets, wishes galore.\n\nCome closer little children, to see what‚Äôs in store.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith eager excitement, the crowd pushed up quite tight.\n\nTheir faces were filled with anticipating delight.\n\nSteven reached into his bag, with flourish and glee\n\nWhile the children awaited the show, what could it be?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúSee what I have, see what I‚Äôve got in store.\n\nCandies and sweets, treats and nibbles galore!\n\nThis is called chocolate, a popular delight,\n\nA perfect companion to a chill winters night‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith a panic and worry, I stepped in between,\n\nStopping the gifting, it must seem quite mean.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt give that out, you know what it contains?\n\nChocolate is deadly, it carries thromboxane.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry my helper‚Äù Said without thinking twice\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve also got sweet chilli crackers, a savoury spice.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúCapsaicins a no go, that‚Äôs one everyone knows\n\nIs there anything not poison in the things that you‚Äôve chose?‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSteven took a moment to root through his dangerous haul.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve got some sugar-free gum, no wait that‚Äôs got xylitol‚Ä¶\n\nI‚Äôve got an old classic, a mint candy cane.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMint is still poison!‚Äù I simply exclaim.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve got cheese!‚Äù, he added, with a flourish grandiose.\n\n‚ÄúTechnically not poison, but they can‚Äôt handle lactose‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe children were confused, getting rowdy and sad\n\nTreats and candy had been promised, but none had been had.\n\nBut Terrans never quit, they never do stumble\n\nSteven simply continued from his poisonous fumble.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just treats that I bring, let it be understood\n\nI‚Äôve got toys from Earth, from my childhood\n\nThis is called ‚Äòlawn darts‚Äô, a most wondrous game.\n\nYou throw metal spears with the most unruly of aim.\n\nIt started out as a weapon, but now it‚Äôs a toy,\n\nFor all the small children to love and enjoy.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI looked on in horror, I looked on in dismay.\n\n‚ÄúThat seems highly dangerous‚Äù I started to say\n\n‚ÄúThat once was a weapon, but now for a kid?\n\nYou can‚Äôt hand that out, I absolutely forbid!‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúJust be careful, it‚Äôs fun!‚Äù he simply did cry\n\n‚ÄúIn the past, only a few unlucky children have died!\n\nBesides weapons are fun!‚Äù Steven practically sang\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve got bundles of yo-yo‚Äôs and a boomerang!‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúNo weapons!‚Äù I said, with the sternest of face.\n\n‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt endanger children, no matter your case!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a chemistry set, educational and placid‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat contains uranium, and five forms of acid!‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSteven gave a shake of his head, with a little dismay\n\nLooking for something safe with which children can play.\n\n‚ÄúWhat about this‚Äù he replied ‚ÄùIt‚Äôs just simply a sled!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe jet engine‚Äôs obvious, they‚Äôll all end up dead!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave you brought anything safe, that won‚Äôt end in tears?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThis is what I played with in my formative years!‚Äù\n\nThis was somehow expected, this somehow made sense.\n\nHow Steven grew up to be quite this dense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut before I could argue, with this stupid matter\n\nA new sound from a distance, a jingling clatter.\n\nA new figure approaches, an Eltari it seems\n\nA giant spider ripped straight from bad dreams.\n\nHis six legs gave a click and a clack as he moved\n\nNothing about this new person did soothe.\n\nJacket it wore, the marks on this stranger\n\nSuggested a scummy despicable danger.\n\nIn its left hand was a gun, being pointed our way\n\nWith a vile clicking voice, it started to say.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúI hear you‚Äôre a good guy, a hero a saint\n\nProviding free charity to children, so lovely, so quaint.\n\nI need a donation, for my own endeavour\n\nHand over the stuff, and no being clever.\n\nHand over the items, please make it curt\n\nListen to what I say and nobody gets hurt.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe room had gone quiet, nobody made a sound.\n\nAll eyes staring at this new danger to be found.\n\nThe Terran gave a grumble, the Terran gave a squeak.\n\nIn an angry tone, Steven started to speak.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúHow dare you bring violence, you ignorant thug,\n\nSomeone should teach you a lesson, in your dumb spider mug\n\nYou're being absolutely naughty, you‚Äôre not being nice!‚Äù\n\nThen the stranger fired his gun, not once but simply twice.\n\n‚Äî-------------\n\nThe pirate had made many mistakes in this life to get to the position they were now in, but shooting at the Terran had been the worst one by far. The only sound that could be heard in the core of the station was the harsh wet sound of the Terran‚Äôs fist slamming into the arachnid's body, the exoskeleton was like wet cardboard in a hailstorm as it failed to deflect Steven‚Äôs constant flurry of blows raining down upon him\n\nPerhaps such thuds could be used as a beat for a rhyming stanza, if the sickening change of pace from what had once been a happy upbeat event didn‚Äôt make one shocked at just how much damage an angry Terran could accomplish.\n\nThe shouts and screams had stopped for some time, to be replaced with a mild whimpering as Steven stood above the pirate, teeth bared in anger and rage as he continued to pummel down blow after blow upon the unfortunate Eltari. Blue blood now joined the red and white of his Santa costume as the beatdown continued.\n\n‚ÄúYou. Could. Have. Hurt. The. Children. You. Fuck!‚Äù\n\nEach word was accompanied by a blow, a rage at the audacity of someone to try and steal from kids, and then to shoot in their direction. Steven couldn‚Äôt even feel the wound in his shoulder where one of the two shots had clipped him, the rage of the situation fueling him on.\n\n‚ÄúSteven, I think he‚Äôs done now, you can chill.‚Äù\n\nI stated this quietly, causing the Terran to look up in our direction, covered in the pirate's blood as he stared back at the many pairs of tiny eyes, all terrified; watching him as he dispensed some find-out in response to the thug‚Äôs fuck around. With a sigh he began dragging the now not-resisting arachnid body around the corner out of sight, leaving a trail of blood behind.\n\n‚ÄúYou are so lucky there are children here, the station‚Äôs security can deal with you now.‚Äù\n\n‚Äî---------------\n\nWith a skip and a jump, Steven did reappear.\n\nA forced smile on his face, showing no fear\n\n&#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúThe bad man is gone, he'll be off to jail\n\nSt Nick will protect you, I never will fail.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven with his injury, Steven seemed ever so sure\n\nThough the calming effect was countered by gore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n‚ÄúI must leave you for now, but a lesson to learn\n\nNever to crime and to evil do turn,\n\nHow you wish to be treated, how you treat each other.\n\nRemain well-behaved for your father, your mother.\n\nIf you have good in your heart, and always act kind,\n\nProtectors in Terrans you always will find.\n\nNever be naughty, always be nice,\n\nAlways be good children, don‚Äôt make me ask twice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I leave for this winter, the paramedics are near.\n\nHave a very merry Christmas and a happy new year.‚Äù\n\n\\----------------------\n\n*This Story is part of the \\[LF Friends, Will Travel\\] Universe*\n\n[**\\[Patreon\\]**](https://www.patreon.com/BainshieWrites) **-** [**\\[First\\]**](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/z22xg7/the_exception/) **-** [**\\[Prev\\]**](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/18hpn0y/lf_friends_will_travel_our_clockwork_children/) **-** [\\[Next\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/18tv5p6/lf_friends_will_travel_our_clockwork_children/)",

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

(It‚Äôs sorta low to the ground). On Thursday my puppy stopped eating food and was showing signs of illness. On Friday she didn‚Äôt eat again and ended up having convulsions and seizures, and eventually being put down at the vet later that day.. the vet told us that she was showing signs of hypoglycaemia which was odd as she never had this problem brought up before. (Went to the vet often for my dog). Anyways fast forward to today, Monday, I came home from a trip over the weekend and when I came into my room I noticed the fucking protein bar was gone - just the wrapper left. \nI instantly googled what would happen if my dog ate xylitol (the fake sugar in the bar) and apparently it‚Äôs insanely toxic to dogs causing hypoglycaemia, siezures and death üò∂ \n\nSo um yeah I basically have to live with the guilt that my dog died because I refused to eat a fucking protein bar like a normal person.

    "body": "This is hennessy and yesterday he ate 40 grams of Xylitol when I was hanging out with my friends. Luckly I found out within 20 minutes of him eating it. He is a labradoodle and he is about 40lbs and he is only 8 months old. He threw up all of it and then we got him to the emergency. He was trembling and could barely stand when we got there I held him and we had to call for them to let us in because it was 12 am and it was after hours. At his current his liver is at 289 and glucose is at 120. Doc said he was able to hold down his food and he was energetic. It was all my fault. I had left a bag of gum on the counter in his penn and when I came back it was all chewed up. God forgive me [this is him](https://imgur.com/a/l3woOAz)\n UPDATE GUYS\n[hes backkk](https://imgur.com/a/60h0DaU)",

It appears that this may be a post regarding a medical concern, due to the sensitive nature of medical advice the mod team manually screens health posts for approval. r/dogs mods may comment and lock or remove a post if it is clear that the only appropriate answer is to seek emergency care or the question cannot adequately be answered here, otherwise there may be a slight delay in approval. In an emergency situation, the most important thing to do is to remain calm and work to get your pet help. If your primary care veterinarian cannot see an emergency, the best way to find a nearby emergency facility is to do a web search for \"[your location] emergency vet\", \"[your location] animal hospital\", or \"[your location] animal emergency\".

    "body": "Let me make one thing clear before I get into it: I‚Äôm not here to hate. I joined attachment parenting groups before I was even pregnant. I came from a cold, emotionally detached home filled with spanking, zero warmth, zero safety. My husband‚Äôs childhood? Even worse.\n\nSo I thought, let me learn now. Let me break the cycle. Let me raise my daughter with connection, gentleness, respect. I wanted to do this consciously. Carefully.\n\nBut lately these spaces are starting to feel less like communities and more like hive minds with pastel Instagram filters slapped on top. What set me off, prompted this post? A comment I left on another patform on a co-sleeping thread.\n\nThe original post asked, ‚ÄúDo you prefer co-sleeping or your baby having their own space?‚Äù Seemed like a chill question. So I replied:\n\n‚ÄúRoom-sharing was sweet for the first couple months, but we all genuinely sleep better in our own spaces now. It was a really smooth transition, and everyone seems happier.\"\n\nCue the pitchforks:\n\n ‚ÄúDid your baby personally tell you that?‚Äù\n\n\n‚ÄúHow do you know they‚Äôre happier? They can‚Äôt even talk.‚Äù\n\n\n‚ÄúJust say you don‚Äôt want to parent at night.‚Äù\n\n\n\nExcuse me? I thought ‚ÄúMama knows best‚Äù was your whole thing‚Äîuntil that mama goes off-script. Then suddenly she‚Äôs cold, lazy, uninformed, and raising a future therapy patient.\n\nFor context: we did co-sleep. Mostly room-share, sometimes bed-share. It was sweet. Until it wasn‚Äôt. My daughter started waking up every time we crinkled a water bottle or tiptoed to pee. So we moved her to her nursery. Ten feet away. No tears. No sleep training. She just‚Ä¶ slept better.\n\nWhen I shared that? I got swarmed. ‚ÄúDid your baby tell you that?!‚Äù Okay. Did yours tell you they loved bedsharing? Or are you projecting?\n\nAlso, can we talk about intimacy? My husband and I missed our sacred space. We didn‚Äôt want to sneak off to the guest room every time we wanted to reconnect. And I‚Äôm not going to use fluffy language here: I wanted to fck the sht out of him without tiptoeing past a bassinet or praying she didn‚Äôt stir.\n\nAnd before y‚Äôall start:\n\n\n‚ÄúThere are other rooms and times of day for sex!‚Äù-- Sure. And what a privileged take. I‚Äôm lucky we had a guest room. What about people in studios? Living with in-laws? Should they bang on the couch and hope their FIL doesn‚Äôt wander down for water? Be serious.\n\n\n‚ÄúThere are other forms of intimacy.‚Äù-- Mmhmm. And none of them have sent me to the cosmos twice before breakfast. Sorry not sorry.\n\n\nSecure attachment depends on the caregiver being emotionally available during wakeful, present moments. That‚Äôs hard to do when you‚Äôre touch-starved, sex-starved, sleep-deprived, and one sleepless night away from going feral.\n\nA couple protecting their sleep and intimacy is not anti-attachment‚Äîit‚Äôs pro-relationship. And that makes for a more securely attached child in the long run.\n\nAnd the martyrdom‚Ä¶ oh my god, the martyrdom.\n\nI saw a post the other day from a mom who hadn‚Äôt brushed her teeth in a week. Because the moment she left the bed, her 2 year old screamed. Her words verbatim were \"if I leave the bed for two minutes he will scream. I cannot let him scream. It will harm our attachment\". \n\nNot a newborn. Not an infant. A toddler. She was terrified that two minutes of crying would destroy their bond forever. I do not say this to shame her. It makes me deeply beyond sad that this is PRAISED. \n\nYou know what that toddler could understand? ‚ÄúMommy‚Äôs brushing her teeth. Mommy‚Äôs right here. Mommy needs to take care of her health too.‚Äù\n\n\nBut instead of sane advice in the comments, I saw:\n\n‚ÄúMama, keep a toothbrush in every room! ‚Äù\n‚ÄúMama, bring a bowl of water and a toothbrush to your nightstand.‚Äù\n‚ÄúMama, just babywear while you brush!‚Äù\n‚ÄúMama, chew xylitol gum‚Äîit‚Äôs antibacterial!‚Äù\n\n\nBABE. GUM IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR ORAL HYGIENE. Finally.... finally... one glorious commenter said:\n\n ‚ÄúSomeone in my family died of an untreated tooth infection during a depressive episode. Please. Let your kid cry for two fucking minutes and brush your damn teeth. He‚Äôll be fine. He needs a living mother.‚Äù\n\nAttachment theory does emphasize responsiveness BUT it doesn‚Äôt mean your baby must be responded to immediately at every second, or that they‚Äôll be traumatized if you brush your teeth. In fact, not taking care of your health‚Äîmental, physical, or dental‚Äîis modeling a lack of self-worth. The child learns that their caregiver‚Äôs needs don‚Äôt matter. That can lead to anxious or disorganized attachment, not secure.\n\nAnd don‚Äôt get me started on breastfeeding. I didn‚Äôt breastfeed. And in these circles? That makes me public enemy number one unless I offer 47 disclaimers and a tearful apology.\n\nBut here‚Äôs what they didn‚Äôt read in my comment: I had DMER, a hormonal crash that made me feel like I wanted to unalive myself every time I nursed. I had low supply due to PCOS. I had no family in-state I needed my husband to be an equal parent not just the guy bringing me water while I suffered in silence.\n\nAnd instead of support, I got:\n\n‚ÄúHave you tried a lactation consultant?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give up! It‚Äôs not too late to relactate!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúTry donor milk!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou must not have had enough support!‚Äù\n\nNo. I had enough support. I had enough education. What I didn‚Äôt have was a desire to die just to prove my loyalty to the sacred tit. Breast is best? Maybe.\nBut fed, loved, protected, and alive mom is even better. Because what‚Äôs the point of ‚Äúgentle parenting‚Äù if it‚Äôs only ever directed at the child?\n\nWhen do moms get treated with gentleness? With grace? Why is our suffering a badge of honor? Martyrdom is not the gold standard of parenting. And I don‚Äôt know who needs to hear this, but a child who watches their mom fall apart every day is not going to feel more loved.\n\nOne of the first moments I realized these attachment groups might not be the sacred space I hoped for was when I asked to be called by my actual name‚Äînot ‚ÄúMama‚Äù‚Äîin every reply.\n\nI said something like, ‚ÄúHey! Totally appreciate the support, just a gentle ask to call me by my name‚ÄîI have an identity outside of motherhood and I‚Äôm trying to hold onto that.‚Äù\n\nSeemed simple enough, right? Y‚ÄôALL. These women lost their collective sh*t. I‚Äôm talking bullying that rivaled my most traumatic middle school years. I was literally questioned as to why I even had a baby.\n\nAnd here‚Äôs what gets me: isn‚Äôt attachment parenting supposed to be about respecting boundaries, consent, and autonomy? So why wasn‚Äôt my boundary respected? Why wasn‚Äôt my consent and autonomy honored when I politely asked to be called by my name? Especially when I‚Äôm eager and happy to call someone else ‚ÄúMama‚Äù if that‚Äôs what makes them feel safe and heard. That‚Äôs the whole point, right? Respecting what helps someone feel seen and held?\n\nI love being a mom. But I also like my name. I like having conversations that don‚Äôt involve sleep regressions and Montessori toy recs. That doesn‚Äôt make me less attached to my child‚Äîit means I‚Äôm attached to myself, too. Imagine that.\n\nAnd the irony? A huge part of true attachment theory is modeling a strong, secure sense of self.\n\nSo if I lose every piece of who I am in the name of ‚Äúbonding,‚Äù what exactly am I modeling for my daughter? Certainly not boundaries. Certainly not self-respect. Certainly not joyful motherhood.\n\nAnother thing I‚Äôve noticed in these groups? The ‚ÄúMama knows best‚Äù mantra only applies if you‚Äôre parroting the Attachment Theory Bible‚Ñ¢.  The second a mom says, ‚ÄúHey, my husband noticed‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚ÄúMy partner suggested‚Ä¶‚Äù the replies go cold. Shut down. Invalidated.\n\nBecause apparently, ‚ÄúMama knows best‚Äù‚Äîunless she‚Äôs slightly different. Unless he gets credit. Unless it breaks the illusion that only the birther has instincts.\n\nCarrying the baby doesn‚Äôt automatically make you the superior parent. And if you need proof, let me tell you about the time I almost froze our daughter.\n\nShe was 10 days old, five weeks premature, barely over five pounds. I had read all the social media slogans‚Äî‚Äúcold babies cry, hot babies die.‚Äù Everyone online said to keep babies slightly cool, don‚Äôt over-bundle, better to err on the side of chilly.\n\nSo I kept the house at a brisk 68 degrees, dressed her in a single onesie, and confidently shut down my husband when he gently said, ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm cold in a hoodie, I guarantee she‚Äôs cold.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt being some ‚Äúmama knows best‚Äù gatekeeper‚Äîit was genuine fear. I was terrified that raising the thermostat one degree would kill her. That‚Äôs what the mom groups and Instagram infographics had me convinced of.\n\nFast forward: she‚Äôs acting weird. Just‚Ä¶ off. We put on the Owlet. Oxygen level? 60. We think it‚Äôs a glitch. We check her temperature. Rectally. Twice. 95.1, then 95.4. She was cold. Like, medically cold.\nWe take her in, and sure enough‚Äîshe was hypothermic. And this wasn‚Äôt some healthy, full-term baby. This was a 35-weeker who needed to be swaddled, bundled, and warmed.\n\nAnd it was her dad who saw it. Any parent is capable of deep, intuitive care. Sometimes it‚Äôs Mama who sees it first. Sometimes it‚Äôs Dada.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs the whole point. Being a mother doesn‚Äôt grant you divine authority. It doesn‚Äôt make you the all-knowing oracle of parenting just because the baby came out of your body. Being ‚ÄúMom‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make you automatically superior. It makes you one half of a team.\n\nAnd if you truly believe moms are automatically the superior parent just by nature of birthing the child, then I have a question for you: Who‚Äôs the ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù parent when two gay men have a child via surrogate? Is it the surrogate who isn‚Äôt involved in raising the baby? Is the child just‚Ä¶ out here being raised by two clueless, disconnected dads with no instinct?\n\nNo. Because, intuition, attunement, and good parenting are not biologically assigned. They‚Äôre built, earned, practiced, and shared. If that logic doesn‚Äôt hold up in every family structure, then maybe it was never real logic to begin with.\n\nAgain, Im not here to stir the pot. I‚Äôm not some cold, rigid parent out here Ferberizing my baby or ignoring my child‚Äôs needs. Quite the opposite. I‚Äôve poured myself into motherhood with more intention and heart than I even knew I had. \n\nI joined these spaces to learn, to heal, to do better than what was done to me. But somewhere along the way, I realized that a lot of what‚Äôs being pushed in these circles isn‚Äôt about true attachment, it‚Äôs about performance, purity, and control. \n\nReal attachment is built on attunement, not martyrdom. On responsiveness, not erasure. And if these spaces truly care about connection, then that connection has to extend to mothers too. Not just when we‚Äôre silent, sacrificial, and agreeable, but when we speak up, set boundaries, and protect our own well-being, too.\n",

But parenting is full of situations that require nuance. I have always liked the concept of gentle parenting, but I am almost never in agreement with the collective gentle parenting community about the best ways to handle something. I take from the general idea and apply it as I see fit, rather than subscribing to the idea that it must be all or nothing and that if Susan on Facebook says I‚Äôm raising a future therapy patient, I must change everything I‚Äôm doing.\n\nI also keep in mind that when I do ask for input, some people are always going to be pissed at the question no matter what it is because they are nuance-less, black and white thinkers that think there is actually a parenting manual and it goes by the name of ‚Äúattachment parenting‚Äù or ‚Äúgentle parenting‚Äù or ‚Äúcrunchy parenting.‚Äù",

When he came home I thought every thing I was going to do was going to not be enough because I also have a mom with narcissistic tendencies. Attachment parenting can be brutal if you let it. My son is 2 years old now. I have found that this group is wonderful for advice, but you do have to weed out the people who are hyper anxious. Doing this is especially hard as a new parent when you question everything you're doing. \n\nSome babies need physical closeness to sleep soundly. Mine does. Some babies need the quiet like yours. Your needs are as important and I know as new parents we do put ourselves last most of the time. It's okay to put yourself 1st (or 2nd) so that you can get what you need. If what you need is sex with your husband in your own bed, that's okay. \n\nAll groups are going to have extremes on either end. Even the other group I'm in r/moderatelygranolamoms can be extreme when the people who are free birthing get mad about people going to the hospital. I think you need to find different groups to address different needs. I found the breastfeeding group to be really good about validating people who say that they can't breastfeed for one reason or another. Certainly, you wanting to kill yourself is a really valid reason to not breastfeed. Another valid reason is just not wanting to do it. I say that as someone who fought really fucking hard to breastfeed and did it for over 2 years. \n\nYou should leave this group if it isn't serving you. But, I do also think that there are a lot of good people here who hear you and see you and have great attachments and great advice to give. \n\n***I also hate being called \"mama\" it's cutesy and annoying.

We would co sleep a lot when our daughter was very young because it was the only way any of us would get sleep. We would all just be waking each other up at night. We made the transition to her being in her own room and she sleeps so much better and so do we! We are all well rested and show up much better.\n\nAlso, something I think these attachment parenting groups you describe do is end up creating children who don‚Äôt know how to be told no or learn how to wait for things. I‚Äôm not saying let your child cry forever, but crying isn‚Äôt harmful in and of itself and it‚Äôs okay that they cry forever a bit and learn the entire world does not revolve around them, especially when they start becoming more aware. I will say, it can be hard to know where that line has to be drawn between when you respond to them quickly and when you let them experience a little more discomfort by waiting a little longer. That line started becoming more clear around 8/9 months. All that to say, children need to learn that they are part of a family unit of other humans who have needs too, not just them. Also I‚Äôm so tired of attachment people thinking that crying is traumatizing. As an adult, when I cry it‚Äôs not traumatizing. It actually somewhat helps regulate me. Any way, I digress.",

Keep that in mind, and it helps to let those kinds of comments roll off your back. \n\ni only dabble here occasionally, to offer some perspective on AP beyond baby/toddler ages (my 4 are young adult/teens).

She played she ate and acted normal. I called the vet and she advised to give Benadryl and that the kids liquid I had on hand was fine (said sucrose not xylitol) within the hour she seemed back to normal. Question is: what could she be reacting too? My thought went to my down feathers duvet or the night before I was diffusing eucalyptus oil in my room so there might have been reminence on my bed? I didn't know about the dangers of oils until today (first time dog owner and we've had her 5 days) \n\nSecond: a few hours later she had blood around her anus and what looks like a hemeroid. She seemed fine but was scooting her bum on carpet. I took her to vet and they said they have never seen this before. They said it's not a prolapse. And didn't think it had anything to do with the morning incident. My thoughts are that maybe because we are crate/pen training and she's been very anxious while in there she may have been straining. They gave me a wash and a dewormer just in case and some probiotics. Anyone else experience anything like this? Thank you!",

I'm just here to let you know what I think my clients would have to say about Gina's new line.**\n\n**Also, I hope you're hearing Tre mispronounce \"cumin\" right now.**\n\n‚Äî\n\nTo make this as simple as possible, I've listed Gina's products below, with the active ingredients (referred to as \"actives\" below) that she has highlighted on her website.\n\n**Blemish Set:**\n\n1. **Blemish Cleanser:**\n   1. **Salicylic acid:** arguably the most common acne treatment in the world, this is typically the Western consumer's first intro to skincare via Neutrogena, Clean and Clear, Biore, etc. I find it strange that Gina doesn't list the percentage amount (1%? 30%? that's a big difference) because that is the smartest way for the consumer to control how many irritants go on their skin at once.\n   2. **Glycolic acid:** a really common exfoliant, but *that does not make it gentle*. I don't recommend starting with glycolic acid as your first AHA.\n   3. **Lactic acid:** *another* AHA exfoliant that is usually much gentler than glycolic acid, but they are *strong* when combined. This combination of AHAs isn't uncommon but it is not for sensitive skin. Again, there is no percentage available to let you know the balance of these ingredients in the wash.\n2. **Hyaluronic Acid Serum:**\n   1. **Hyaluronic acid:** this is purported to be a miracle ingredient for retaining moisture in your skin by every major skincare brand and publication right now. What Gina's website doesn't tell you: HA works by pulling moisture from the air and absorbing it into your skin. If you live in a dry climate, *it may actually dry your skin out further.* The addition of HA makes this even less of a one-size-fits-all routine than the AHA combination and I'm curious if Gina herself would even use this during a trip to the desert.\n3. **Reservatrol Hydra Surge Serum:**\n   1. **Reservatrol:** okay, admittedly, the only thing I know about this is that Brooks Ayers claimed it cured cancer. It was a fad ingredient that has largely fallen out of the headlines, skincare commercials, and client work that I oversee. Regardless, I think we can look at Terry Dubrow's face and see that he is *not* relying on reservatrol for miracle anti-aging benefits.\n   2. **Peptides:** another trendy ingredient that claims to return collagen and elastin to aging skin, but the research is still fresh. I am not anti-peptides, but I simply haven't seen enough data from my research to believe that a super presence of peptides would make such a strong acne treatment more bearable on the skin.\n4. **Blemish Peel Pads:**\n   1. **Salicylic acid** (above)\n   2. **Lactic acid** (above)\n   3. **Mandelic acid:** *another* AHA in the Blemish routine? Yup...and Gina even goes so far as to write on her website that we are prone to forgetting to exfoliate. About that: her cleanser is already exfoliating the fuck out of your face! You don't need more layers of acids. You need a MOISTURIZER and a SUNSCREEN. Guess what this set doesn't have?!?\n   4. **Willow bark:** Gina claims it fights photodamage, but willow bark is exactly what salicylic acid (and aspirin!) are derived from, so it shouldn't be surprising that it can calm down inflamed and painful skin. As for fighting sun damage, I've seen very little evidence to believe that it has any effect on that.\n   5. **Chamomile:** a common soothing ingredient used in skincare, essential oils, and teas.\n   6. **Witch hazel:** another common skincare ingredient used to reduce redness and irritation. Also a very common irritant that may dry out or inflame your skin.\n\n* **Verdict for the Blemish set: overpriced, over-exfoliating, and incomplete. Gina isn't entirely honest about hyaluronic acid and outright lies to you about the level of exfoliation you're enduring in her own web copy.**\n* **You can find a dermatologist-recommended salicylic acid cleanser, hyaluronic serum, peptide serum, and AHA peel (without the waste of pads!) for under $20 each. If you buy a moisturizer and a sunscreen for under $20 each, you are still saving $40 and getting way more product.**\n\n**Combination Set:**\n\n1. **Rosehip Wash:** I just want to flag that Gina immediately advertises this as a foaming cleanser, which is not always appropriate for combination skin. It may relieve oily spots, but it could also further strip dry patches. I find it strange that she gave the Blemish wash a \"lotion\" texture, but made the combo wash foam. It seems like it's backwards, since blemish-prone skin tends to be oily all over. As a businesswoman with lots of experience in beauty, I am curious if subverting this common-around-the-world model was meant to be a marketing gimmick that they didn't flesh out in the web copy.\n   1. **Rosehip oil:** this is a very popular ingredient for skin that is experiencing dryness and dullness. Rosehip oil is naturally full of Vitamin A, which is a very powerful exfoliant, and Vitamin C, which is a golden ingredient for mild acne and dark spots. At face value, this combo sounds great, but Gina doesn't tell you that you *have* to use sunscreen when using Vitamins A and C. Again, guess what isn't included in this set. I also want to flag that rosehip ingredients are *very* common irritants, especially to sensitive skin and skin with many known allergies. My last flag here is that most rosehip skincare products have artificial fragrance, which is one of the most common irritants in cosmetics around the world.\n   2. **Seaweed extract:** this is a \"superfood\" that is frequently included in \"green\" and \"vegan\" skincare products since people associate seaweed with healthy diets. I have had scientists tell me everything from \"it's a mega moisturizer\" to \"it's a gentle way to deliver nutrients to the skin\" to \"it's a Kbeauty scam,\" so there isn't a strong consensus on what it's supposed to do for you or how well it does it. Gina claims it's full of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and antioxidants for your skin, and I won't argue with her. I've definitely heard that before! But I should flag that seaweed moisturizes like hyaluronic acid does, which means it may not be appropriate or effective in dry climates.\n   3. **Rosewater:** frequently sold as a moisturizing ingredient, rosewater *is* effective but still carries the allergy/fragrance risk I mentioned under rosehip oil. Also flagging that Gina herself mentions the fragrance on her website, so she's not even trying to hide the most common irritant in this product.\n2. **Vita Brightening Serum:** this is the first product I've seen of Gina's that actually makes sense to me in terms of formulation and chemistry, so I truly can't shit on the entire regimen.\n   1. **Vitamin C:** (covered above under rosehip oil)\n   2. **Vitamin B5:** a vitamin that works similarly to hyaluronic acid by absorbing environmental moisture, but also has the benefit of being an emollient, meaning that it directly provides moisture, too. This is a more universal moisturizing ingredient, so that's a plus.\n   3. **Vitamin E:** another great moisturizing ingredient that enables Vitamin C's glow, so this combination of ingredients actually makes sense to me.\n   4. **Ferulic Acid:** an antioxidant that boosts the effects of Vitamin C and Vitamin E. Again, this serum makes a lot of sense to me and is named appropriately as a brightening agent.\n3. **Reservatrol Hydra Surge Serum:** (above)\n4. **Blemish Peel Pads** (above)\n\n* **Verdict for the Combination set: overpriced, incomplete, and full of common irritants and allergens.**\n* **Again, you can find better products with these ingredients for under $20 each, and if you add the moisturizer and sunscreen that you need, you are still saving $40 and getting way more product.**\n\n**Dry Skin Set:**\n\n1. **Beyond Calm Milk Cleanser:**\n   1. **Coconut oil:** NO! NO! NO! Coconut oil is widely recognized as one of the most irritating, comedogenic (pore-clogging), greasiest ingredients out there. It is practically a Western beauty rite of passage to use coconut oil as a makeup remover or moisturizer and to deal with the resulting breakouts afterward. It is also very likely that this product will be fragranced. JUST SAY NO TO COCONUT OIL. DO NOT TAKE YOUR SKINCARE ADVICE FROM DIY PINTEREST BOARDS. (Jonathan Van Ness is on my shitlist for recommending this on Queer Eye, too.)\n   2. **Chamomile:** (above)\n   3. **Safflower oil**: a much gentler and more neutral oil that is rich in Vitamin E. I wouldn't recommend safflower oil as my go-to facial cleansing oil, but I think literally anything is better than coconut oil for the masses.\n2. **Essential Peptides Serum:**\n   1. **Peptides** (above)\n   2. **Hyaluronic acid** (above)\n   3. **Seaweed** (above)\n3. **Intensive Hyaluronic Cream:** an actual moisturizer, not a serum!\n   1. **Xylitol, Xylitylgulucoside, Anhydroxylitol:** these are pulled from sugar and, according to Gina's website, \"allows for moisture circulation throughout all layers of skin and strengthens skin's barrier function to limit transepidermal water loss.\" What a word salad. To be perfectly transparent, I had to look up all of these to realize that I know these compounds as \"Aquaxyl.\" This is a common moisturizing ingredient that I don't have a true problem with, but I have noticed that it is mostly advertised by pricy brands that have enormous marketing platforms, like Tatcha, Paula's Choice, Glossier, and Murad. Because Gina is pricing herself even higher than these products, and because she used so many twenty-five cent words to explain what it does, I encourage all consumers to exercise caution and trust your gut about what these brands are actually trying to do for you.\n   2. **Hyaluronic Acid:** (above)\n   3. **Squalane:** rapidly becoming a very popular product, squalane is derived from fat in plants. It produces a rich oil that many people experience great benefits from: moisture, clarity, smoothness, and brightness. That said, anything oil-based can be irritating on your skin, so there is potential here for it to take a hard left turn on sensitive skin and hormonal acne-stricken skin.\n4. **Radiant Peel Pads** (above)\n\n* **Verdict for the Dry Skin set: overpriced, incomplete (where is the sunscreen?), and full of even more common irritants and allergens than the Combo set.**\n* **Again AGAIN, you can find better products with these ingredients for under $20 each, and if you add the sunscreen that you need, you are still saving $60 and getting way more product!**\n\n**Overall verdict? Skip CaraGala** and look for **salicylic acid**, **vitamin C**, **vitamin E**, and **emollient moisturizers** from dermatologist-recommended lines like CeraVe, Olay, Neutrogena, Aveeno, The Ordinary, and La Roche Posay.\n\n**If you want to try the other ingredients here,** purchase products from the above brands and patch test them behind your ear or on your wrist.\n\n**THIS SKINCARE IS NOT WORTH $160, AND THE LARGEST COMPANIES IN THE WORLD WOULD NOT CHARGE $160 FOR THIS.**\n\n**ONE MORE IMPORTANT THING: GINA OFFERS TO LET YOU SIGN UP FOR A DISCOUNT BY SUBSCRIBING AND PAYING A MONTHLY FEE. LOOK UP CRITICISM OF RODAN AND FIELDS SKINCARE AND CRITICISM OF SAVAGE X FENTY LINGERIE TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS PREDATORY.**\n\n**Also adding the return policy because this shit is important: 30 days, application to return, buyer is responsible for all shipping fees. Regimen sets must be unopened and complete. Free gifts given by CaraGala must be returned. Items marked as promos and final sales cannot be returned. Refunds may be given as store credit. CaraGala recommends purchasing shipping insurance.**",

The way I understand exfoliating is removing dead skin cells so that they don‚Äôt clog pores. I was always told by my derm that exfoliating after the chemical peel action of glycolic becomes more important because the glycol is causing more dead skin cells in action. So you would use either a mildly abrasive pad to wash/exfoliate the dead skin cells, or perhaps a scrub would do same. \n\nJust pointing out the glycol doesn‚Äôt so much exfoliate, but does cause added need for exfoliation, actually accomplished with either a scrub or a cleansing pad to slough/exfoliate dead skin cells",

My mom has bird feeders all over her yard, and many of them were in the gardens. Her cats loved to go outside and roam around. My yard isn't any better....we have feeders and I do see bird poop under those as well. We think letting the cats roam in the garden made them sick. It took a good 12 years to figure out. The first cat got very sick and jaundiced. He also had breathing problems and limped. The Xrays showed either cancer or a fungal infection. At the time the vet said a fungal infection was unlikely due to where we lived so we figured it was cancer. My sister made the decision to have the cat euthanized as he was very sick and suffering. 10 years later one of my mom's other cats keeps losing weight. We can't figure out why and we are very concerned it's cancer again, especially since this cat is younger. He's taken to the vet, checked out and were told it's not cancer. However we don't know what's going on. This cat manages another year or so with weight loss, tiredness but he never gets better so my mom took him for his final trip to the vet. Just last month my mom's female cat wasn't doing well. She was losing weight, lethargic, limping and just not feeling well. She's taken to the vet and they say they can't tell if it's cancer or a fungal infection. They give my parents IV drugs, appetite stimulants and other things to help the cat and for a while it seems to work. She's going outside, she's eating and seems to be doing better. We breathe a sigh of relief. However she sadly took a turn for the worse and we had to let her go last week. My mom noticed that all the cats who went outside ended up getting deathly sick. The vet highly suspects histoplasmosis and is running tests on the female cat's lung tissue to confirm but we're certain that it's Histo. \n\nWe aren't blaming the vets as Histo is a very difficult diagnosis to make and hard to catch. We do the best with the information that we have. These cats were between the ages of 9 and 13 so they were older and cancer was high on the possibility list. \n\nI talked to my vet because I was very concerned about how to keep my cats safe and she told me that it was best to keep them indoors.\n\nHisto is a nasty disease.",

        "body": "@Beneficial_Elk_182:  \nUnfortunately, I‚Äôve also noticed veterinary costs have skyrocketed. Of course vets deserve to make a living and get paid for their expertise. I‚Äôm just not sure how fair their rates are and they‚Äôre definitely not consistent from one practice to the next. \n\nA perfect example is our adopted 9-11 year old feral cat had to get his few remaining teeth extracted and our regular clinic of 4 years wanted ‚Äú$1200-1600‚Äù ‚Äòdepending upon what‚Äôs discovered during the surgery‚Äô. The quoted price range included surgery, anesthesia, take-home meds and a follow up visit. My dentist doesn‚Äôt even charge as much as this vet does (although to be fair, I‚Äôve never had to get several teeth removed.)\n\nFor a second opinion we brought him to another clinic recommended by a client. They charged us $430, which included an overnight stay, the same surgery, the anesthesia, all meds and a follow up visit plus his Rabies vax and removal of a small cyst on his shoulder. \n\nWe have stopped using the first clinic and now take all of our pets to the second clinic which not only has fair and affordable prices, but two knowledgeable and caring doctors. The clinic is clean but it‚Äôs in an older building and their interior designer hasn‚Äôt been seen in years. The first clinic is also clean but it‚Äôs in a newer building and their designer must be on retainer. They have many vets and are very professional and organized. Besides their prices which have skyrocketed over the last 3 years, 28 months ago one of the vets misdiagnosed one of my cats, giving him ‚Äúless than 6 months to live‚Äù, so all the expensive and beautiful decor means nothing as far as competence goes. Had I been using the second clinic, I would have saved a lot of money over the last 4 years. \n\nStories of escalating prices and the wrong diagnosis aren‚Äôt uncommon. It‚Äôs getting harder these days to find a great veterinarian, especially one with fair pricing, however this problem isn‚Äôt limited to the veterinary profession.",

I was in the shower last night, mid shave (so all shaved except 1 legüôÑ) and my husband comes in and shows me an empty plastic container of gum. The big plastic one. Ice Breakers Gum. Grape flavored. The ‚Äúif your dog gets into gum you‚Äôd better pray it isn‚Äôt THAT GUM‚Äù gum. I said grab 3cc syringes, peroxide, the offender, pull the rugs and let‚Äôs go. Time to get his puke on. Called our vets for protocol post puke, got the tech with an after hours key on standby and started forcing peroxide. 45cc, violent belly shaking, running around in the yard, excessive drooling and a few nasty burps later‚Ä¶still no emesis. Standby tech alerted, to the clinic we head. By now it‚Äôs absorbing, at 1g per piece, approximately 30 pieces eaten, 30g of xylitol on a dog whose weight could put him into hypoglycemia and liver failure in no time at only 3.6g we‚Äôre looking 100 times of fucked at 10x a potentially lethal dose. Get him there, run bloodwork, place a catheter, grab everything for my makeshift ICU because he‚Äôs not leaving my eyesight, labs look great so home we go. Get him set up, uneventful, he‚Äôs the perfect patient - leans his forehead on mine during treatments and just sits like that. Apollo, the dog keeping vigil by his crate, is my helper. Laying on supplies. Getting the tape full of hair. Watching my every move to make sure I don‚Äôt fuck up. Periodic glucose checks overnight, high carb snacks, and started him on NAC to prevent hepatotoxicity (thank you harm reduction - because of you I have a healthy supply on hand for his mega doses!). Uneventful night, glucose never dropped, no signs of hypoglycemia, eating, drinking, energetic, no signs of jaundice. Pulled his catheter and he‚Äôs doing great. I‚Äôll continue NAC every 8 hours through the weekend and check a complete blood panel on Monday but all my research says he shouldn‚Äôt be here right now. I don‚Äôt know how he made it without so much as vomiting but he did. He was my wedding present from my husband. He‚Äôs as goofy as they come. Both of his brothers rallied around him and were next to his crate all night.\nSo - watch your babies. Make sure shit is put up. Get medical attention fast. And no Ice Breakers Gum!!

I think not. ](https://preview.redd.it/dnk227q2mjs51.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=3313ec866104df8907bb5f24d7433c73ebb26e50)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR ‚Äì This is the story of how nicotine controlled my life, and how I‚Äôm fighting back. The impossible is possible. I hope there are a few nuggets of information in here that may help anyone who needs it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT (for proper context) - To clarify, 2 packs every 3 days was what I was smoked **as a freshman in high school, NOT when I quit smoking a few weeks ago.** At the time of my quitting, I was smoking 3 vape pods every 2 days, in addition to 1 weed pod every 2-3 days. This is not safe and I would strongly advise against mixing nicotine & THC on a daily basis. It's just not good for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI smoked for 15 years ‚Äì since I was a freshman in high school. I hung out with bad people, did drugs, then received cigarettes from my mom because it was the ‚Äúsignificantly lesser of the evils‚Äù. I thought it was cool to be a ‚Äúgangsta‚Äù. I thought it was cool to do hardcore drugs, as well as softer ones. I thought it was cool to throw away all that my parents did for me. Damn, how wrong I was.\n\n2 packs every 3 days. Marlboro lights and reds. I smoked a lot, because nobody could stop me.\n\nI‚Äôve had asthma since I was young. During high school, I got good grades - 4.0 nearly every quarter. I played sports as well (wrestling, volleyball). But I kept smoking, kept hanging out with bad people, and kept making bad decisions. It continued through to college.\n\nIn college, I partied even harder. I went the social fraternity route, where they ONLY party. I got kicked out of college for bad grades, then went to a community college ‚Äì where I smoked even more! Those were a good 3+ years of not doing shit ‚Äì except for partying, smoking, and destroying my life.\n\nEventually, I made my way back to university - electrical engineering at a California State College. I still smoked a ton, and still partied. But upon getting back to university, I had to take a placement exam for math as an engineer, and I bombed that test so hard that they kicked my math down to remedial levels. To top that off, I failed my first engineering class back, and had severe math course requirements to make up in order to proceed even further. Long story short ‚Äì if I thought I‚Äôd be done in 2 more years, I was wrong. I had a LONG and STRESSFUL way to go.\n\n**That simply means that it was a tough road - with lots of smoking. LOTS. And LOTS. Damn, it was a lot. I‚Äôd smoke between classes. I‚Äôd go for smoke breaks in classes. I reeked of smoke, and it wasn‚Äôt only nicotine that was being smoked. I was poisoning my lungs all day long.**\n\nWhen vapes came out, it got even worse. Now, I‚Äôd smoke anywhere and everywhere. Whether I‚Äôd be at home, at a friend‚Äôs house, or at school ‚Äì I always had to get my fix. I was THAT GUY who smoked the most out of my friend group and everyone I knew. Vape just made this problem worse. In terms of nicotine though, first it was cigarettes, then both cigarettes and vape, then vape only.\n\n**Yup - I went through ALL the vape phases. You know, you start off with them eGos. Then you move up to something else, like a provari. Then you start becoming an expert at modding and ‚Äúbuilding wicks‚Äù. Oh, how they get you. As I kept going and going, vaping evolved to cannabis also, so you bet I was on that train. I‚Äôd use my inhaler sometimes between weed hits. I could feel myself getting anxiety from weed and nicotine and all this smoking. I went down a freaking spiral, and didn‚Äôt stop.**\n\nHeck, even if I was in a car with my FAMILY, going to a FAMILY dinner, I‚Äôd still vape in front of them. I was that messed up. ***I was that addicted. I was that guy.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Not me. I wouldn't have a picture of me smoking in front of family, but you get the point.

I decided that business was my passion. However, my mom begged me not to drop out of engineering school. And for business, the best time to start is always yesterday. So I started my business halfway through engineering school, and did these both at the same time. Do you know how stressful that was? **Take whatever I was smoking before, and multiply it by 2.** I could cry and feel tears in my eyes, when I think back to how much pain I was in during this period and how difficult this was.\n\nIf it was a non-school day, or if I was going HAM on my business, I‚Äôd be smoking all day. My room would literally, be a hotbox of just vape. The air in my home was became bad ‚Äì because of me. At this point, I also withdrew a lot socially, in order to focus on these priorities of business and school. **That led to even more stress, as I watched my friends slowly graduate one by one, party and have fun, and start really living life.** Guess what more stress means. I don't even have to say it. Downward spiral much?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Not me, but my room was similarly smoked, lol. I wish I had pictures, sorry.

It sold out 5 manufacturing runs and I still lost money. *Oh wells, I‚Äôll just smoke the pain away.*\n\nI started 2 other e-commerce stores after that, both of which failed due to issues where we could not get to making sales. *More smoking.*\n\nThen the next store I built, somewhere around 2017 or so, we hit it off. I did 7 figures in sales within a year (sales, not profit ‚Äì but still damn good though). Then, due to some bad business decisions and some suppliers bait/switching me, I lost it all. I watched my bank account, go from nothing‚Ä¶ all the way to 6 figures‚Ä¶ then back down to NEGATIVE 5 figures. And, it was a slow burn down also. Not a fast one. Believe me, I tried EVERYTHING I could to fix the business, but nothing was working at that time. *Guess what ‚Äì* *even MORE smoking. Now it was getting bad.*\n\nMind you, I‚Äôm still in school also. And electrical engineering school is math heavy, which made things even more difficult because I hated math. But I persevered, whilst using nicotine to fuel myself. A poor decision that led me to smoke even more than I could imagine ‚Äì now it was becoming a burden to smoke. However, at this point, my life was ecommerce, smoking, and school. ONLY. I literally became a ‚Äúgrandpa‚Äù and ‚Äúturtle‚Äù and withdrew from a majority of social things. *That means puff, puff, and puff.*\n\nI ended up building 2 other stores that failed after that. They were good stores, but they never took off. More smoking. *I learned a LOT, but I smoked a lot as well.*\n\nThen I had a breakthrough. I partnered up with a friend who built a store but was not profitable on most days, and barely profitable on some days. We went 50/50 ‚Äì and in 3 days of work I cut his advertising in half. I was ecstatic, and *I was still smoking a lot.* After a few more days, he decided to ‚Äúghost me‚Äù because we didn‚Äôt sign paperwork, as I trusted him. He basically said ‚ÄúI think this is something I have to do alone‚Äù, then went MIA (after I made his story very profitable). *I lost it, and smoked even more from that stress.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Not me, but watch out, cool guy over here.

He scammed me, but I learned a ton and started making breakthroughs. **I kept grinding, kept smoking, kept grinding, kept smoking.**\n\nThat experience gave me the insights and strength I needed to rebuild the right way. It was very stressful, very smokey, yes ‚Äì but at the same time ‚Äì it was what was needed to take me to the next level.\n\nMy health is important, and how can I possibly make an impact on the world if I‚Äôm smoking every minute I‚Äôm on this planet? Stuff just started clicking, not only in terms of business, but also in terms of beginning to think about the long term implications of smoking. Yeah, I was even that guy at the gym who would vape immediately as soon as I got out of the gym, on the way home, and after the post workout shower. I hated nicotine, but at the same time I couldn‚Äôt stop nicotine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI‚Äôll spare you guys the details, but fast forward a ton of work later, I‚Äôve finally clawed my way out of rock bottom in business. My business has huge plans for 2021, and we‚Äôve already done pretty good in 2020 and have made excellent progress. I am a learner, and every struggle makes me stronger. I‚Äôve crawled out of my rock bottom hole, have rebuilt my business, and have really started focusing more on innovation and being the best option in the market for anything we sell. In a nutshell \\~ doing business the right way, by way of innovation & domination.\n\n**I‚Äôd like to think that I am an inventor who had to learn how to market and sell. BUT, NO MATTER WHAT I THOUGHT, I KNEW FOR A FACT that I was also a smoker who had lost control of his life to nicotine. In order to succeed you must pay a ‚Äúprice‚Äù ‚Äì but my health was the wrong ‚Äúprice‚Äù to pay. This was a skeleton in my closet that I had to conquer.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the midst of this, I managed to barely scrape by and graduate with my electrical engineering degree, which I‚Äôve just received this past summer. I hated every second of it. **I smoked myself through everything I learned.** But at least I finished it. Momma got what she wanted, even though I have no use for this degree.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Sorry, I haven't taken any graduation pictures yet. ](https://preview.redd.it/ptvgek9oqjs51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10486cb0a61657ba1c0cdacdf31b4a3566cdd479)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n‚Ä¶ Sweet. Now life is finally starting to rebuild. But I‚Äôve still got to conquer my biggest demon ‚Ä¶\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Nicotine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***You do that dance. You know, that old dance*** ‚Äì I‚Äôll put my vape down, tell myself NO MORE, then find myself picking that crap up a few minutes later.

Seed was planted, or rather ‚Äì the seed is being watered as I‚Äôve wanted to quit for a while now. But I wasn‚Äôt strong enough. No trigger. No catalyst yet. Mind you, when I smoked, there were times when I had chest pains and kept smoking. This started happening a few years ago. Something to do with asthma? Blood pressure? Etc etc‚Ä¶? Not sure.\n\n‚Ä¶ Then a little over 2 weeks ago, I smoked a lot of nicotine, a bit too much. I topped it off with a few ganja hits ‚Ä¶.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut something felt off. I started having a full blown panic/anxiety attack, and just felt immense pain everywhere. It was in my chest, yes‚Ä¶ but for some odd reason my back started feeling uncomfortable, laying down felt uncomfortable, and I just felt like crap. Not sure why this happened ‚Äì maybe it was a stroke of luck from God, but it happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# I decided I had enough. I decided that I was no longer going to let nicotine control me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn tears, I went to talk to my mom. I just told her I needed to talk to her, and I‚Äôm fortunate that she worked as a social worker for the county (people go to her for food stamps basically). **Because the first thing I said when I opened my mouth was ‚Äì ‚ÄúI need help.‚Äù**\n\nI don‚Äôt know why I said that. I‚Äôm never that ‚Äúweak‚Äù ‚Äì but this time, I just gave myself up. I finally admitted, that I had a fucking problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI‚Äôve kicked weed a few times in the past and have smoked on/off for years at a time‚Ä¶ but nicotine was always the constant. I NEVER missed a day of smoking for 15 years. One day I almost came close ‚Äì when I got my wisdom teeth pulled out. The doctor told me NO SMOKING. Guess what I did after I went home and rested? Yup ‚Äì I vaped ‚Äì against the doctor‚Äôs orders. As I said, I was that guy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# And quit I did. I threw it all away. Grabbed all my vape AND weed paraphernalia, and anything even remotely related to it. Fucking crumpled it all up and threw it in a bag, and threw it away.\n\n# This must be done, symbolically. To show your mind ‚Äì ‚Äúhey, fuck you nicotine. I‚Äôm in charge. You‚Äôve taken away enough from me‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\n‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**And I haven‚Äôt looked back since.**\n\nI must have cried 25+ times throughout the first few days, just by myself. For no damn reason. Just start tearing up. But I knew that this was a demon I had to conquer.\n\nAnd you know what, it isn‚Äôt painful to fight this demon. The pain comes from the EXPECTATION of pain that you‚Äôll feel, when trying to fight nicotine. **But believe me, you can do it.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n‚Ä¶\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# I am now 15 days clean.\n\n**Me, the guy who all my family, friends, everyone ‚Äì would NEVER EVEN FATHOM quitting ‚Äì I‚Äôve fucking quit.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I‚Äôve ALREADY quit for good. I say that, because there are no ands, ifs, or buts. There is absolutely 0 chance of me relapsing. Done is done. I‚Äôve had enough of you, nicotine. 15 years you‚Äôve taken from me. You've given me nothing and have taken so much. But now no more.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat‚Äôs 15 years of bad health.\n\n15 years of hurting those around me.\n\n15 years of not being fully ‚Äòpresent‚Äô, because I‚Äôd always need my nicotine fix.\n\n15 years of thinking that school/business/weed was giving me ANXIETY, but it was actually nicotine that was doing it.\n\n**And most importantly, 15 years of being controlled by this monster they call - nicotine... now - over.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The labor is finished. The task is complete. The next level of life is unlocked. Goodbye nicotine, and thank you for absolutely nothing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you to anyone who read this far. That is my story.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Here are the tips and tricks I used to FIGHT BACK against my addiction. I hope this helps someone:\n\n**1.** You must know, that you must FIGHT. I promise you, it‚Äôs worth it. You might think nicotine is making you ‚Äúless stressed‚Äù and giving you ‚Äúmore energy‚Äù to deal with life ‚Äì but it‚Äôs a false illusion. It‚Äôs a temporary fix, for more pain later. And it snowballs.\n\nThese past 2 weeks have been the most STRESSFREE I‚Äôve been, actually.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2.** The first thing you must do is download an app. Some type of quit smoking app. The one I used charges $7 a month, but gives you access to counselors. Trust me, it‚Äôs worth it. Just spend that damn $7, even if you feel like you don‚Äôt need it. It will force you to talk to these people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3.** Next, in order to fight the cravings, you must MOVE YOUR BODY. Just force yourself to move it.\n\nTake a walk, do some yoga, do some meditation, go for a run.\n\nI know these 4 things are things you DO NOT WANT TO HEAR, or are LAZY AS FUCK when it comes to it‚Ä¶.\n\nBut believe me ‚Äì from smoker to smoker:\n\nWhen you‚Äôre running at full speed, you aren‚Äôt going to be thinking about a cigarette or vape. You‚Äôre going to be thinking about how badly your lungs hurt.\n\nI ran through that pain. I used this pain to EXORCISE the demon out of me.\n\nIf I did have a craving while walking, then I had to punish my body with a small 10 second sprint.\n\nBelieve me, it‚Äôs fucking worth it. It felt so liberating ‚Äì as I hated running. But for some reason, running this time, feels great. My lungs stopped hurting as bad. More air was going in them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4.** Throughout your activities, put on some motivational podcasts. These helped me immensely. Just type something like ‚Äúchange your life motivation‚Äù into YouTube. Play it in the background, and go for a small jog. I guarantee by the end of your jog, you‚Äôll be a better person than you were before you started that jog.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5.** GUM. BUY GUM. XYLITOL is my go to, because it will WHITEN YOUR TEETH. Plus, it will define your jawlines. Remind yourself of this. Remind yourself to take care of yourself. Yup ‚Äì just by you taking care of yourself, this DOES snowball. So don‚Äôt forget.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6.** Replace the unhealthy habits with the healthy habits. WAIT ‚Äì before you skim past this, hear me out.\n\nThink about HOW MUCH TIME YOU WOULD SPEND VAPING/SMOKING. THINK OF HOW MUCH EXTRA TIME IS WASTED, BECAUSE YOUR BRAIN HAS TO KEEP SWITCHING TASKS AS YOU GET CRAVINGS.\n\nNow fill that void, with stuff that makes you a better person. Fill that void with meditation and yoga, because chances are, the nonsmokers in your life don‚Äôt do that anyways. So let‚Äôs take this opportunity, to ascend in our lives and get to the next level.\n\nI started showering 2-3 times a day, started taking better and better care of my health, grooming, cleaning, sorting out my life, etc‚Ä¶. and you know what ‚Äì doing this has been immense help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**7.** Steps 1 to 6 were very helpful to me as now I rarely get cravings. HOWEVER, when I do, there are a few things I tell myself. Some mantras. Some phrases. Check this out.\n\n\\> First, identify if it is a PHYSICAL or MENTAL craving. If it‚Äôs physical, that means you need to get your body moving. Do something else. If it‚Äôs a mental, gum will do the trick.\n\n\\> If it‚Äôs a mental and gum isn‚Äôt helping, I assure you this trick will help. Instead of trying to resist your craving, instead‚Ä¶ just WATCH YOUR CRAVING COME AND GO. Just watch and observe. Don‚Äôt fight, don‚Äôt react. Just watch it. Just feel it. It‚Äôs there, but it isn‚Äôt really. So just watch it come and go. Because it will go.\n\n\\> You must view the nicotine craving as a demon. The evil nicotine demon. You must realize, that when you feel like shit due to the cravings‚Ä¶ that more nicotine isn‚Äôt the solution. Do you feel pain that you‚Äôre going to explode and die because no nicotine???? My friend, that‚Äôs EXACTLY WHAT THE NICOTINE DEMON does to you. It tricks you into thinking that the solution to this pain, is more poison in your body. Think about that for a second. You want to cure pain with poison????!?!? Kidding me.\n\n\\> Lastly, you must remember the main benefit of quitting. I thought it was my health, but I was wrong. It isn‚Äôt your health. It‚Äôs not money. It‚Äôs not family. It‚Äôs not this, not that. I‚Äôll tell you what it is.\n\nThe main benefit is that you‚Äôre more present and in the moment. You‚Äôre here. You‚Äôre normal again. YOU. ARE. BACK. TO. NORMAL. AGAIN. Don‚Äôt you ever forget that. This has implications on every aspect of your life. So let‚Äôs make these implications GOOD implications. Trust me, you will thank yourself later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**8.** Allen carr has a great book and there are links somewhere here. But to sum it up in a nutshell, or at least to give you what I GOT out of it ‚Äì Allen carr smoked 100+ cigs a day, even when he was ALREADY dying. He had constant pain. He was so addicted, he had to smoke in order to turn on a light bulb. Goddam, now that ‚Äì is addicted. Yet, he was able to quit.\n\nHe used a simple shift in mentality, which also helps me. What is it?\n\nQUITTING SMOKING IS NOT YOU TRYING TO CLIMB THIS LARGE UPHILL MOUNTAIN OF PAIN.\n\nEVEN IF YOU‚ÄôVE ONLY QUIT AND BEEN CLEAN FOR 5 MINUTES‚Ä¶ THE POINT IS THAT YOU ARE ALREADY AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN.\n\nYou‚Äôre already ‚Äúquit‚Äù. Now, you have to make that downhill climb of ‚Äúmaintenance and not relapsing‚Äù into smoking.\n\nWell, that‚Äôs what I got out of it ‚Äì but I encourage you to read it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**9.** Lastly, if you‚Äôre ever in a tough time, please TALK ABOUT IT. You guys here on reddit, are absolutely amazing. Hearing the stories of others, being able to provide insights to others, and helping others through their struggles ‚Äì is really a medicine and high of its own.\n\nIf it wasn‚Äôt for all these support networks and amazing subreddits and people in them, I‚Äôm not sure if I could have done this. Seriously.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo please, if you‚Äôre in a similar position, and have a craving ‚Äì before you send more poison into your body, why don‚Äôt you send someone here on reddit a message. Even me. Post something. Comment something. **Just reach out and talk to someone! Because you‚Äôre not the only one struggling. I thought it was impossible for me to quit, but I did it.** Just trust me, there‚Äôs something about talking to someone who has been in a similar situation, which is really reassuring. And at this point, we really have to support each other because smoking technology is only going to get more addictive and accessible as time goes on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you guys for reading everything. It is a long story, yes ‚Äì but I sincerely hope this helps someone. If you need help, just ask and I will do my best to help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**15 years I smoked every single fucking day. Now I‚Äôm 1 day clean for each year I smoked. Pretty soon, it‚Äôll be 2 days clean for each year. Then 3. Point is ‚Äì I‚Äôm done with nicotine, and there is no looking back. It feels fucking great to be free again. To be myself again. And to have my full potential back again.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# And P.S. - Fuck you, nicotine. Seriously. Fuck you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSincerely,\n\nKenny",

So many setbacks and you still managed to just stop altogether! \nI am so inspired that I oblige myself not to let the addiction inflict on me.

My stamina increased dramatically (could run a lot longer before getting short of breath) and yes, savings on those packs that I used to buy.\n\nOne more tip that might be helpful to others,  have an old school money jar where you put in the money that you saved from not smoking every day and  use it to buy stuff that you always wanted to buy (I'm saving up to buy BOSE 700 headsets and I'm almost halfway there)\n\nKeep it up dude and wish you all the best!",

He‚Äôd had very light symptoms (stuffy nose) that only started the night before. \n\nI immediately sent an Instacart order with saline nasal rinses, CPC mouthwash, xylitol nasal sprays, tests and some other goodies and he went into bedroom quarantine. He and the whole family have been using everything religiously and he is already testing negative on multiple tests, as is the family still. Of course i‚Äôm still not comfortable hanging out, but it does mean that we likely kept the viral load quite low for him which makes me feel better. His immediate family is going to do a (spaced) outdoor Christmas morning, bundled up and with two fire pits going. \n\nThey never would‚Äôve considered doing anything like this if they didn‚Äôt have a cautious family member, but now they‚Äôre going to maintain the Christmas magic for the kids.

Along with nasal spray and CPC mouthwash.\n\nEdit: I came back to say how I think nasal rinsing has helped me.\n\nI caught some kind of infection Christmas 2022. I never tested positive for covid.  I caught it from work because I was forced to work with a sick person. While they badly wore a blue surgical mask and kept pulling it down. All day working, even in my kn95... Well the longer I'm with someone sick, the more chance of catching something even with my mask. Working a 9 hour shift, I never stood a chance.\n\nUp until then, I was using a nasal spray along with wearing a mask. Guess that wasn't enough.\n\nIn 2023, I started doing nasal rinsing. And I know indoor spaces aren't safe even if they are empty but I don't have a car to eat my lunch in and my locker is beside a back door and I use my CO2 monitor and I get a good reading. And I've been to a few concerts as well. I will use a nasal spray after eating lunch in this locker room. \n\nI normally do nasal rinsing twice a day. Morning, before going out and before bed. I will follow by using a nasal spray, I use enovid.",

    "body": "I had high expectations for these bars given their excellent reputation in the West - and they did not disappoint. Most of these bars were good, and some were very, very good. Similar to Mars and Grenade, they are much closer to chocolate bars in both taste and texture, unlike Quest and Carman‚Äôs with a more ‚Äòfunctional‚Äô protein bar feel. I like that Barebells had no noticeable protein powder taste, and that most of their bars had a good balance and weren‚Äôt too sweet. I‚Äôve ranked them according to taste and texture again below.\n\nThe soft protein bars lined up on the right are an upgrade in both taste and texture, even after I had to refrigerate them. They‚Äôre supposed to be softer and fluffier, but got butchered through shipping to the province and arrived in a flat and melted state huhu. I imagine they would‚Äôve been similar to 3 Musketeers - firm, soft to bite into, and with the right amount of chew. The two [9.5]s were so perfect in flavor that they would likely be a [10.0] if they had held their intended shape and texture. \n\nThese bars have 200 calories on average. The soft bars have a lower protein content at 16g versus the original bars at 20g, and they also have more sugar alcohols at 9 to 10g versus the originals‚Äô 5 to 7g. I‚Äôve included macros and ingredients for a couple bars at the bottom. Their website says that Barebells products do not contain added sugar. I did not experience any stomach discomfort or throat irritation with these bars\n\nI purchased the original protein bars from a WiseChoice physical store for P190.00 each. Yes, I know - ripperino. It stung and I had my reservations, but decided that this would be one brand I was willing to pay in full for because of the overwhelming positive reviews online. For the soft protein bars, I ordered them through Shopee for around P165.00 each after discounts.\n\n\n**RANKINGS**\n\n**[9.5] Rocky Road Marshmallow** ‚Äì chocolate base, marshmallow layer, peanut bits, crisps, milk chocolate coating. delicious bar with amazing texture. great even after refrigerating, peanuts and crisps did wonders. \n\n**[9.5] Salted Peanut Caramel** ‚Äì nougat / peanut (?) base, salted peanut crunch, caramel syrup, milk chocolate coating. these peanut / peanut butter protein bars have become unexpected favorites of mine and they just keep on giving. the saltiness in the peanut crunch was popping, making this the best peanut-flavoured bar for me\n\n**[9.5] Creamy Crisp** ‚Äì fluffy base, caramel, crisps, milk chocolate coating. core was straight-up delicious and i‚Äôve got a soft spot for bars with crisps. easily my favorite from the original protein bar line\n\n**[9.0] Salty Peanut** ‚Äì soft base with a little chew, peanut bits, milk chocolate coating. saltiness was faint, but the bar still delivers. another bar with that Snickers vibe - in a good way!\n\n**[8.5] Caramel Choco** ‚Äì chocolate base, caramel syrup, milk chocolate coating. stuck to the basics and nailed it. reminds me of Jack n Jill Chooey Toffees i adored as a kid\n\n**[8.0] Cookies & Caramel** ‚Äì cookie / chocolate base, caramel, crisps, milk chocolate coating. light but pleasant caramel taste, familiar flavors that held up well\n\n**[8.0] Banana Dream** ‚Äì banana base, caramel, milk chocolate coating. texture is as basic as it gets but the typical banana food flavour was pleasant, something different from the usual chocolate and caramel options\n\n**[8.0] Chocolate Dough** ‚Äì chocolate brownie (?) base, choco crisps, milk chocolate coating. rich chocolate flavors that satisfy\n\n**[7.5] Caramel Cashew** ‚Äì caramel base, cashew bits, milk chocolate coating. i liked the cashew bits - i wish there were more, and the caramel flavor was too subtle for my liking, but still a solid pick\n\n**[7.5] White Chocolate** ‚Äì caramel (?) base, white chocolate coating, almond pieces. white chocolate coating was delicious but somewhat crumbly. the almond and cashew pieces from the bar above were a nice change from the usual crisp texture that i enjoy\n\n**[7.0] Birthday Cake** ‚Äì vanilla base with sprinkles, crunchy toppings, white chocolate coating. not exactly partial to the birthday cake flavor, but i did like this over Quest‚Äôs. noticeably sweeter than other Barebells\n\n**[6.5] Cookies & Cream** ‚Äì cookie dough base, cookie bits, crisps, milk chocolate coating. decent enough, had those toppings i usually enjoy, but wasn‚Äôt eager to finish this one for some reason. this was the first Barebells bar i had and maybe the expectations were initially set too high from all the reviews, or maybe it was the core that was average\n\n\n**MACROS & INGREDIENTS**\n\nMarshmallow Rocky Road - 209 kcal 10F 17P 17C\n\nINGREDIENTS: Milk proteins, sweeteners (maltitol, xylitol, sucralose), humectant (glycerol), hydrolyzed collagen, cocoa butter, bulking agent (polydextrose), whole milk powder, peanuts, soy protein, cocoa mass, soluble corn fibre, soy oil, sunflower oil, fat reduced cocoa, salt, flavourings, emulsifier (soy lecithin), tapioca starch. May contain cereals containing gluten, egg, nuts and sesame seeds.\n\nCreamy Crisp - 200 kcal 8F 20P 19C\n\nINGREDIENTS: Milk proteins, humectant (glycerol), sweeteners (maltitol, sucralose), collagen hydrolysate, polydextrose, cocoa butter, water, cocoa mass, whole milk powder, soy protein, sunflower oil, flavourings, tapioca starch, salt, emulsifier (lecithins). May contain cereals containing gluten, peanuts and nuts.\n\n\n**FINAL THOUGHTS**\n\nOverall, Barebells lived up to the hype. The higher quality ingredients were apparent, even in the most basic bar - especially their chocolate coatings. Their good selection, decent macros, solid textures, and more than satisfying flavors have them currently sitting at the top of my list. However, they are expensive and not as widely available. I expect to buy these again only if they go on sale, or if I somehow end up with eff-you money.\n\nMy favorites to date from the protein bars I‚Äôve covered are Quest S‚Äômores and Double Chocolate Chunk, the flavoured Snickers Hi-Protein bars, Grenade‚Äôs Oreo, Oreo White, and White Chocolate Salted Peanut, and Barebells Rocky Road Marshmallow, Salted Caramel Peanut, Salty Peanut, and Creamy Crisp.\n\n**P.S.** Shitty weather kept me from work, so I had time to experiment with my elementary creativity. Do they look weird without the backgrounds? Also, sorry for the messy photos of the original Barebells bars - these were taken before I started photographing them more consistently (no wrapper, and without a chunk bitten off hehe) Let me know if you have protein bar recommendations! My side quest has me covering brands with at least 6 flavors, with Carman‚Äôs next on the list.\n",

    "body": "Hi everyone, yesterday, my dog got into some gum that contained a sweetener called xylitol. He became ill within ten minutes so I rushed him to the emergency veterinarian. They told me one piece of xylitol containing gum is enough to kill a 20lbs dog. My dog is a 25 pound King Charles cavalier spaniel who ate ten pieces or so. If I didn‚Äôt take him in right away, he would of died. The vet neutralized his blood sugar and did something to help protect his liver. Apparently he had one elevated enzyme but that has gone back to normal as of this morning. He is expected to make a full recovery. \n\nIf you have any gum in the house, I would make sure it doesn‚Äôt contain xylitol. This stuff is literally cyanide to dogs. The gum he got into was the ‚ÄúP√ºr‚Äù gum that‚Äôs at Whole Foods. Please be careful.",

It's 5 times cheaper than the dog stuff and at least in my country, it's just peanuts oil and salt. Not the most ideal but peanut butter isn't really a good treat for dogs anyways so feeding them a little bit less to account for the added salt is a fair tradeoff for me. Plus the dog specific jar of peanut butter I got was knocking around for 6 months after being opened, the human stuff was fresher because it had more uses than the dog peanut butter which was essentially compacted peanut dust by the end.

    "body": "EDIT: well, that blew up a smidge more than I expected. Thank you everybody! I won't be able to answer you all I'm afraid. You have all convinced me to ditch this dentist and find another. Yeah, the more I think of it, the less convinced I am that I want her digging around in my jaw. She also dropped the idea that any dentist I see will make me suffer pain due to inadequate local anaesthetic, and that I just need to deal with it. As somebody with a history of really bad dentistry who is terrified of it: she was NOT very reassuring. So, yeah, I'll be benching her.\n\nAs for some FAQ:\n\nA. No, I did not misunderstand. She was extremely clear in what she said. I can consume liquids and solids a total of 7x a day maximum, and a single sip counts as 1. Including water. I asked her to explain again twice. I did not misunderstand which is why i came here, cause it sounded bonkers to me.\n\nB. As for the \"juice\" I put in my water, it is typically 3-5ml of sugar free flavouring, topped up with between 300 and 500ml water (depending on the glass size). (For the dutchies; extreem zwakke suikervrije opmaaklimo) Yes, I measure it, cause I don't like it too strong, just enough to make it not taste like gross water (we dont have great water). If I'm still not 'allowed' that, then I guess I'll be having a lot of cavities, because the tap water we have is not it. \n\nC. No, I haven't had any procedures or surgeries done. This was general advice for life, for me and the rest of the world. Specifically to limit the amount of acid in my mouth that would cause cavities.\n\nD. She also told me mouthwash was useless and for \"aesthetic\" purposes, like, just to make the mouth feel good. That's pretty antithetical to anything I have ever heard, but maybe it's true, idk. And that if I do use it to get alcoholfree ones because keeping alcohol in the mouth might cause oral cancer (?!).\n\nE. I can't take xylitol gum unfortunately, I've a severe case of bruxism and can't afford to eat anything that requires extensive mastication. Yes, that includes steak. Yes, I am sad.\n\nF. Considering that a minority of comments do feel the dentist has a point, I won't try to report her or anything. She works at the same practice as my own dentist (idk when or if she'll be returning) so that makes things awkward. I will just have to find a trauma-informed dentist closer to home. Wish me luck.\n\n\nOG POST:\n\nMy own dentist is out of town for a while. She's a good egg, never thought I'd MISS her, but there you go. She saw my teeth at their worst and helped me cope with PTSD from horrific butcher-dentists I had as a child and saw how much better I've been takin care of the pearly-not-so-whites-but-im-trying. With her out of town I saw a different dentist.\n\nAs per new dentist, I'm not allowed to drink milk, juice or tea. (Or coffee, carbonated drinks, or alcohol, but I wasn't drinking those anyway) I am relegated to water only. I am allowed 7 moments a day where I am allowed to eat and/or drink. I am allowed to sip my water only if I am having it with a meal - if without a meal, I have to chug it back in 1 go. A single sip is 1 moment - so if I sip a drink 7x, I shouldn't eat or drink for the rest of the day.\n\nNow, I'm all for the brushing and the flossing. I understand I have a few cavities and some gum issues. I have chronic jaw bone disease. Yeah, I need to be doing more. Fair enough. But only water and no sipping? Are we well? Is this how neurotypicals have been living this whole time and I'm the crazy one? \n\nFor me this falls into the same bucket as \"eat enough but not too much but also you're fat so dont eat more than 800kcal but also never eat less than 2000 kcal and also give up fat but actually sugar is way worse and consume plenty of proteine but don't have meat because of the environment or soy or eggs because of the carcinogens, make sure you get plenty of exercise but no more than an hour a day and you need to do weight training but also only cardio and because you're disabled the best exercise is swimming but don't go swimming itll ruin your hair and skin, wear an SPF or you'll get skin cance but don't wear SPF because the ingredients will give you skin cancer, and spend time doing skin/hair care because otherwise you're gross and lazy but never more than 10 minutes because then you're self absorbed and vain and shallow\"\n\nExtra points: my brother refuses to drink anything but cokeycola, doesn't do any exercise, and consumes 80% premade food. He has 0 cavities and is skinny.",

        "body": "....What?\n\nThis is some bullshit.\n\nLook op, I have really shitty teeth, mostly because genetics and braces. I don't have trauma thankfully, and I have had a lot of dental work done and four root canals, and have always gone to the dentist because they're so bad. (Not to shame you at all because I get it, but I'm really familiar with dental shit).\n\nDespite the fact that I have minimal enamel, (and when that shit's gone it's gone) and BONE LOSS in my jaw, I have never been told to drink only x times a day. It has been recommended to me to drink less acidic things, to use a straw when I drink those as that helps it bypass a lot of your teeth, to rinse with water after drinking acidic things, to brush after, but never to only drink a certain amount of times a day.\n\nIf your regular incredible dentist has not said this, I'd safely ignore it. You can tell them you did it next time you see them, there's not gonna be a difference in drinking 7x a day or less or more. Especially if you're on stimulants they make you thirsty, I drink 7x a day before 9am, like that's just not possible to limit.\n\nI had a sub dentist tell me I needed to stop using listerine because it was bad for me, and only use scope instead. Um weird, because my periodontist, the guy I see for my gum disease, says listerine is the best for mouth health. And some mouthwashes don't kill bacteria, just make your breath nice for a time. Listerine kills germs. So I promptly ignored her advice because the person I saw regularly I trusted more.\n\nAlso, if it helps, as long as you brush every 24 hours, its better than nothing. Or if you can use listerine/other bacteria killing mouthwash. Flossing is great, and helped me reverse some bone loss from my gum disease, but it's hard to start or keep in a habit. I go through cycles, but I found the shape of the oral b floss picks (like these: [floss picks](https://www.amazon.com/Glide-Floss-Picks-30-count-Packages/dp/B00YDJAHY8/ref=sr_1_13?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.gSVKdtYk_GNmLzI8BKMLHzOXUXnU-A4sG-0ChSdBtvvg7Uoc1bBumqoTqyrptifTUy0p1JU2IatnieE_wUOil88bM0JFlENCfqawefT9gtpOxT7dwioPkXEAfAtsMPYu1QcaktIAJWiDXndZhHp_ZHofuscUhB-yAC2Zst2ewRKUWKqhAf7zInlCJ6aDpA28vBJlcr31H7XCXFPdku0Z93RX2sByfyxtBA_wf3SS0YjOvUrlWIfXPeePODNWVZDLVP6uWkbPCfuNPti86HotGx7fPuGg-WDmP1F6ZXG9WY0.y9kIm09_YoBr3V8zgQN1p7zNDzF5CRz22I1c_jRvjPI&dib_tag=se&hvadid=153686416078&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=1021129&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=18118904127488436914&hvtargid=kwd-52443873438&hydadcr=21001_9317677&keywords=glide+oral+b+floss+picks&qid=1716660521&sr=8-13) ) are way easier for me to use. Unfortunately they're the only kind like that? But if flossing is hard, you may want to find some of these in the grocery store and try them out. [These kind of dental pics](https://www.amazon.com/GUM-Soft-Picks-Original-Dental-Picks/dp/B073C6LMJD/ref=sr_1_30?crid=2QWCB6H4I3NTO&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.4xqZUWHDxxA7LDUnQkxRS2r6kV7D5iMnQaAxMdG2co1ZzcP28-ls7P1zcnVDVynXqH-yEkG2WJxzgLJ8c5gMVK1JAwOw3W3lXpjSTTELTSIsBXSyi80jr1Wgj7VeInkMNDq4CmpFBeNtSZwyAoNst9HxhugCAh84q0Js5oIevPDfuuGheIACc5kxbOoeN3NmaCJPmd94-_u0npMUWna9slms62nrTvfvTW2tJOT_qVl4ifnq_0pL9IYksFgz7Rg6yHSedN_8Numvaou6KMceAsh_t3RYN_4j_b9AnPsXQBk.Q47NgDaiFB8fwgYl6m3hRE58_IybvLSwHVnWVLxfp2M&dib_tag=se&keywords=floss+picks&qid=1716660612&sprefix=floss+picks%2Caps%2C108&sr=8-30) may be easier to start using instead of floss as well. They come in different sizes and styles too, but you can push them between most parts of your teeth. Not as great as floss since you won't hit all the spots like floss will, but anything is better than nothing.\n\nBest of luck to you in all your dental adventures! I'm proud of you for finding a dentist that works great for you, for going to the dentist in the first place after such a horrible time before, and for going to a new dentist while yours was out. Those are not easy things. Hopefully your dentist is back before you need to go again!\n\n  \nEdit to add- you may want to ask if you can use MI Paste. It's prescription, and made from milk caesin, but helps a lot when my teeth are super sensitive, and firms up a lot of soft spots before cavities can form. Unfortunately, I'm shit at using it, and you can't rinse it out for half an hour after, but it comes in a few flavors and really works better than regular toothpaste. It's a once a day type thing.",

If you do not wish to have these things said to you, please try to fact-check the things you‚Äôre saying, and please read the post in its entirety and consider everything presented here before commenting.

If this brings up feelings of sadness or anger, please try to realize that you are sad/mad at someone other than me, and please don‚Äôt take it out on me.\n\nWith that all out of the way, let‚Äôs get into a table of contents:\n\n1. Brief overview of issues with the studies\n2. What would good methods look like for these kinds of clinical trials?\n3. What would good results look like for these kinds of clinical trials?\n4. How do the current clinical trials stack up?\n5. How do nasal sprays without clinical trials stack up?\n6. FDA warnings\n7. Takeaways/TLDR\n\n# 1. Brief overview of issues with the studies\n\nGenerally, there is strong evidence that certain nasal spray ingredients prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture. The quality of this data depends on the methods used in the study (ex: checking if the ingredient(s) affect the viability of the cells you‚Äôre using, quantifying SARS-CoV-2 infection in ways that don‚Äôt rely on RT-PCR when you haven‚Äôt demonstrated that the ingredient(s) don‚Äôt interfere with PCRs, etc.).\n\nHowever, a nasal spray in a human nose is a very different scenario than a nasal spray in cell culture. Unlike in cell culture, mucus, etc. is flushed out of the nose and swallowed in a matter of hours. As well, it is easy to expose all cells in cell culture to a nasal spray, whereas nasal sprays sprayed in a human nose tend not to cover even 50 % of the nasal cavity (see the third to last bullet point below). Add to that the fact that SARS-CoV-2 infects cells outside of the nasal cavity, and you can see why, thus far, the evidence suggests that nasal sprays don‚Äôt prevent COVID-19.\n\nIn the case of having COVID-19, if nasal sprays were able to lower viral load in the nose (which remains to be seen, as the current studies have major methodological issues as described in the bullet points below and in section 4), it is unclear how meaningful that is in terms of lowering how infectious someone is. Again, this is because SARS-CoV-2 infects cells outside of the nasal cavity and nasal sprays don‚Äôt even tend to coat the nasal cavity well.\n\nList of general issues with these studies (modified from my post entitled ‚Äú[There is no convincing evidence that nasal sprays prevent COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroCovidCommunity/comments/1iv64oi/there_is_no_convincing_evidence_that_nasal_sprays/)‚Äù):\n\n* The fact that the test spray and not the placebo spray often contain ingredients that are known to interfere with PCR tests, and many of these studies rely on RT-PCR COVID-19 tests from nasal/nasopharyngeal swabs (aka swabs from where the nasal sprays are sprayed). This is almost always combined with no information on the timing between applying nasal sprays and taking swabs. This means that the test spray could cause false-negative COVID-19 tests and/or viral load values that are lower than the true values\n   * Ex: both a carrageenan ([study A](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39913533/)) and a heparin ([study B](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38649069/)) nasal spray can cause false-negative COVID-19 RT-PCR tests\n* Lack of placebo spray\n* Lack of sufficient information for reproducibility (especially regarding what is considered a positive and a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test result)\n* In prevention studies: lack of testing for asymptomatic/presymptomatic infections (how can we say something prevents COVID-19 if we aren‚Äôt testing for asymptomatic and presymptomatic COVID-19 infections?)\n* Inappropriate COVID-19 testing methods\n* Wide 95 % confidence intervals for relative risk reductions (see section 2 for a definition), reductions in viral load and symptom improvements\n* The group promised a follow-up study with more participants and the trial was completed but the results were never posted (suggesting that the results did not show the test spray preventing COVID-19)\n   * Ex: in¬†[study C](https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-022-06685-z)¬†a protocol was published for an upcoming carrageenan nasal spray clinical trial, and that trial finished in 2022 but the¬†[results haven‚Äôt been posted](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04590365?term=NCT04590365&rank=1&fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaazwtXy-AS4JIQcaCCFdLUKzt9K2o3qNww5bkapp7Y8-TxUDmI-EBKjdAk_aem_UhX-7Nu_JhiXcWir4xMcZQ). Generally, if you do a search on¬†[clinicaltrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov/)¬†with¬†[the condition ‚ÄúCOVID‚Äù and the intervention/treatment ‚Äúnasal spray‚Äù](https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?cond=COVID&intr=Nasal%20spray&limit=25&page=1&fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAabmmuQEJwHXGg_TlYJCmer9RsT4Fv9GzluPIrNli_IsCfBvmZeTwgCzPAE_aem__l8QUba6qzYbAkDseiH6Ww), you find 44 studies where only 4 have the status ‚Äúcompleted with results‚Äù, 16 are ‚Äúcompleted without results‚Äù, 9 have ‚Äúunknown status‚Äù and 6 are ‚Äúwithdrawn‚Äù or ‚Äúterminated‚Äù\n* Many nasal spray companies having to majorly walk back false claims of their sprays preventing COVID-19 after warning letters from the FDA (link¬†[here](https://cen.acs.org/materials/biomaterials/biopolymers-behind-multimodal-nasal-spray/102/i30?fbclid=PAY2xjawHhEZJleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABplkfYWLZPD8ITdJAqsUTqxr67H1D2FkJFkPrLaocxpnJaDTELpo5_DeWpA_aem_J_1hkkM1nXJ9SpZptQHA8A), ignore the Profi nasal spray praise, see my other post entitled \"[There is no convincing evidence that nasal sprays prevent COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroCovidCommunity/comments/1iv64oi/there_is_no_convincing_evidence_that_nasal_sprays/)‚Äù for issues with the Profi study). Also see section 6 for more info on FDA warnings\n* False claims that we mainly contract COVID-19 through nose cells (and not lung cells) with either no citation or citation of papers that don‚Äôt prove that (such as¬†[study D](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30675-9))\n* Lack of acknowledgement that the location in the respiratory tract that aerosols end up is determined by their size (aka a nasal spray will not prevent the sizes of aerosols that end up in your lungs from going into your lungs), see Figure 3 and all the studies referenced in that figure in¬†[study E](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-022-00506-7)\n* Not everyone breathes through their nose\n* Nasal sprays are flushed out of the nasal cavity in a matter of hours\n* Nasal sprays don‚Äôt appear to coat even 50 % of the nasal cavity (see¬†[study F](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21499839/),¬†[study G](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02786826.2014.931566),¬†[study H](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12383290/))\n* Many of these sprays contain the preservative benzalkonium chloride, which have harmful effects at the concentrations used in nasal sprays in some studies (see¬†[study I](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11575893/)¬†and¬†[study J](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31028024/)¬†and references therein)\n* None of these sprays have long-term safety data on their regular (repeated) use\n* The sizes of aerosols that would end up deposited in your nose are very efficiently filtered by high-quality respirators such as N95s, provided that the N95 is sealed to your face and the seal doesn‚Äôt break. This is even true for a respirator with a lot of wear time (see my previous post on some studies looking at the effects of wear time on N95 fit and filtration efficiency [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroCovidCommunity/comments/1hnxlns/debunking_the_myth_that_n95s_are_super_protective/), again, provided that it stays sealed). This is because the filtration mechanisms that act on the sizes of aerosols that get deposited in your nose do not degrade with wear time (whereas the filtration mechanisms that act on smaller aerosols do degrade with wear time). Thus, while wearing a sealed N95, aerosols containing SARS-CoV-2 in the environment should not be deposited in your nose anyway\n\n# 2. What would good methods look like for these kinds of clinical trials?\n\nPlacebo\n\n* A test spray and a placebo spray, where the placebo spray lacks the one important test ingredient only\n* Participants being assigned the test spray or the placebo randomly and not knowing which one they got\n* Researchers analyzing the data not knowing who got the placebo and who got the test spray\n* Approximately equal numbers of people getting the test spray and the placebo spray\n\nTesting\n\n* Periodic testing for all participants, regardless of symptoms (to pick up asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections in prevention studies, and to get viral load data for many timepoints in treatment studies)\n* Testing whether or not the spray ingredients affect viral load measurements or the COVID-19 test results. And either showing that it doesn‚Äôt, or taking steps to minimize the effects and quantifying the effects (referred to as interference testing,¬†*this has never been done in any of the current studies*)\n* High sensitivity testing method\n* Relevant testing method given the experimental circumstances\n\nAnalysis/reporting\n\n* Analyzing and reporting on data from all of the participants\n* Sticking to running analyses that they decided on before the trial\n* Only making statements about differences between the test group and the placebo group if the differences are statistically significant\n* Representing the results in a way that isn‚Äôt misleading\n* Appropriate analysis methods\n\n# 3. What would good results look like for these kinds of clinical trials?\n\nFor preventing COVID-19:\n\n* The relative risk reduction (a measure of how much being on the test spray compared to the placebo spray lowered the chance of testing positive for COVID-19) would be a high percentage and the 95 % confidence interval for the relative risk reduction would be a small range of percentages\n   * Example: a relative risk reduction of 80 % where the 95 % confidence interval for that value is 70-90 %\n\nFor treating people with COVID-19:\n\n* Over time, the viral load would be reduced in those on the test spray more than those on the placebo spray (with a 95 % confidence interval for that reduction not too wide)\n* People on the test spray would recover faster than people on the placebo (with a 95 % confidence interval for that difference not too wide)\n\nNote: having enough participants influences the stats associated with the results, so that important quality of a clinical trial is accounted for here.\n\n# 4.

Takeaways/TLDR\n\n**Main takeaway (repeated from the beginning): there is no sound evidence that nasal sprays prevent nor treat COVID-19.**\n\n**Thus, nasal sprays should:**\n\n* **not be used for COVID-19 prevention in place of effective measures such as high-quality well-fitting respirators, ventilation and air purification**\n* **not be considered to lower the infectivity of someone with COVID-19 in any meaningful way**\n* **not be considered to help people with COVID-19 recover more quickly**\n\nTLDR and things to consider:\n\n* Sadly, there are no high-quality clinical trials showing that nasal sprays prevent nor treat COVID-19.\n* No study has done the obvious and necessary experiment: determining whether or not the spray interferes with the test used to obtain the results of the study. This is especially concerning because many of these sprays contain one or more ingredients known to interfere with the tests used in the studies. This is a major issue, because the sprays are sprayed in the nose and the swabs are taken from the nose or from the nose, mouth and throat. It is unusual for such basic and necessary experiments to be missing from a scientific article. This would even be unusual for studies from several decades ago.\n* There is no long-term safety data for regular (repeated) use of any of these nasal sprays, and not even short-term safety data for some. For some sprays, the evidence suggests they aren‚Äôt even safe for short-term use ([study 19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-72262-w)).\n* Nasal sprays should not be referred to as a layer of protection against COVID-19, as such statements are not based in science.\n* Any COVID-19 accounts promoting nasal sprays for preventing or treating COVID-19 are not being responsible, whether or not they have the experience/knowledge to critically review these studies. We can‚Äôt just repeat what others are saying, we need to fact-check things and be science-based.\n\nSigned, a PhD biochemist with extensive experience critically reviewing published studies and who cares about people and their safety <3\n\nP.S. Please see the¬†**comment note**¬†near the beginning. To summarize, I will be clearly pointing out if your comment: is misleading, contains misinformation, or if it demonstrates that you didn‚Äôt read the post. It would benefit us all to not believe and spread misinformation about nasal sprays and COVID-19!",

        "body": "So as someone with a science background as well: to the extent that your criticisms of these studies, I feel that you are taking an approach of similar magnitude in the opposite direction of the papers you are critiquing, and taking a more black and white approach (which can be valuable in science) but that isn't helpful for real life. I also find it interesting/problematic that while in academic science, people tend you use more conditional language when presenting evidence in either direction, you are here stating things with much more certainty than your own evidence warrants. \n\nSkepticism in science is a great thing, but your title is somewhat click-baity and some of what you say can also be misleading to a layman who doesn't have an understanding of academic science. Nasal sprays don't prevent or treat COVID, but they could potentially lower viral load and prevent a more severe outcome. To not look at this aspect and only criticize them for not 100% preventing covid in a post for the general public is anywhere between unintentionally misguided or outright disingenuous. I of course don't know your intentions, but Reddit isn't academia where you do a meta-analysis of papers on one specific issue and people understand that it is an exact point you're trying to disprove. I think the vast majority of us here are already not using nasal sprays as a sole preventative measure - it's a precaution I take when I need to get on an airplane and I've weighed potential known/unknown risks of sprays vs. risk of getting covid. At no point do yiu address this aspect of it. \n\nSecondly, absence of evidence =/= evidence of absence. Covid is incredibly new if we use a scientific timeline. Culture wars and general disinterest over the fact that the pandemic is \"over\" mean that people aren't studying covid as much now. There's still an incredible dearth of information around bigger issues of covid. There aren't even that many papers on novavax. So while there are issues with the papers thst do exist on nasal sprays, i think waiting for evidence to prove they are useful before actually using them in a circumstance as an additional precaution means you could be missing out on potential protection as well. How are we going to find people to do RCTs on nasal sprays when covid is \"over\"? Sure, on an academic level, let's not do something until we have evidence it works. In real life, well what are the risks of iota-carageenan potentially helping compared to potentially cstching covid? I think as irresponsible as it is, as you say, to recommend sprays when there could be issues with safety, it's also as irresponsible to advocate for not using them when they could be helping. I recognize the safety risks, and you analyze each study, and then at the end talk about there being safety issues with certain sprays, but then you blanket suggest not using nasal sprays, when the different sprays very likely have different safety profiles. You critique each individual study, but you don't present evidence where you actually look at each individual spray's issues vs. risks and do that kind of cost benefit analysis. In a academic setting, this is not necessary, but on Reddit, I think it's problematic to go so deep in one direction without looking at the other side. \n\nI think as much as there are criticisms around the studies that do exist around nasal sprays, it is also highly problematic to be stating the things you say them, with the amount of authority that you do. You are a single person with a PhD in biochem, and to a layman, that might seems like you are more of an expert, but as someone that also has a scientific background, and is a science educator, I find your analysis is problematic in the ways I've stated. I appreciate that you want to warn people that there really isn't solid evidence out there - however, you're in a way making recommendations that you don't necessarily have evidence for either. And you're communicating in a way that presents your own evidence as stronger than it is as well, and presenting it in a way that actively discourages the average person without a scientific background from using sprays because of a dearth of evidence, instead of presenting the evidence neutrally and saying \"look, there's no evidence of them preventing covid, but there could still be potential benefits the scientific community isn't aware of that could impact covid outcomes\" - you're not a doctor, so present the evidence neutrally and let people make the choice for themselves. \n\nOverall, I think, if you are coming from a good place, you are overapplying academic science to the realities of real world. As I have said, reddit isn't academia and so the perspective we take when assessing precautions shouldn't be the same perspective as one would take from an academic approach. But the other thing is that science is just as much about the content as it is about communication. If you are not able to effectively communicate the meaning behind your message, then your science is moot. Again, I'm not sure if you've worded things the way you have because you are set out to disprove nasal sprays or just because you're not aware of how to communicate science outside of an academic context, but your post is problematic to me as someone that is also able to evaluate scientific evidence critically.\n\nEta: I'll also add that as someone who went from really believing in the rigours of science and looked down on things without scientific evidence, to becoming disabled by multiple medical conditions, science isn't the be all end all. Anecdata from patients with my conditions about random supplements or treatments that have no formal evidence and are not used at all in clinical medicine (which I tried when medical interventions failed), have often ended up helping me much more than many of the scientifically tested medications that were associated with clinically and statistically significant improvements in their patient populations. Obviously this is a separate issue because pharmacokinetics/dynamics are much more person-dependent than the human-to-human variance that might come from a nasal spray, but my point is that even if there isn't scientific evidence for something, it doesn't mean that it can't be helpful. I'd love to see more studies on nasal sprays with larger sample sizes - but I'm not going to wait around for science to tell me something is helpful before I try it. In this case, I do a risk-benefit assessment and choose the spray that has lower risks and use it as an extra precaution with masking when I go to higher risk situations, because the potential risks of carrageenan are lower to me than the state I'll be in after another covid infection when I already have long covid.",

So I certainly get that none of them can claim to be a layer of protection, without well conducted studies, that's largely speculative. \n\nConceptually it makes sense that nasal sprays cannot entirely prevent infection, however if they can reduce viral load in any meaningful way, that could be enough to provide a measurable difference in outcome. \n\nNot all of these likely have the same long term risk profiles either, though again were back to needing larger, well conducted studies to know what, if any, are safe and at what frequency.",

As a fellow PhD chemist I did similar analysis for local covid conscious friends and urged caution especially if folks wanted to rely on nasal sprays as an alternative to masking. \n\n1) I have another nasal spray that isn't mentioned in this post, brand name Norizite, sold by Birmingham Biotech. Its effectiveness is based on the following study: https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202008304\n\n2) Another flaw I identified fairly early on in many COVID related research studies is sample size and diversity in human trials (notably many on the effectiveness of masking, which suffer the opposite problem to above, where in fact masking is MORE effective than the study shows because many people in the study are masking improperly) I can't remember the sample sizes of the above nasal spray studies although I did read and criticise most of them, I do remember many of them had small sample sizes (less than 1000 and in some cases less than 100 participants) I also wonder about the location/occupation and other covid risk factors of the study participants and how that could introduce flaws in tbe studies. For example, many studies of mask efficiency were of healthcare workers who have a much higher risk of exposure to covid due to their jobs, but also may have access to other PPE, may only wear masks at work but not in their personal lives, etc. Any comments on this would be most welcome!",

    "body": "Last week my dog Eloise was a [healthy, 4-year-old border collie mix](https://imgur.com/lBLzYv6), but last Sunday night into Monday morning she started vomiting and acting lethargic. I wasn't sure how serious it was, but around 9:30 on Monday morning I called the vet, asking if I could bring her in. They told me they were fully booked and didn't have any room for walk-ins and suggested another vet. I called them and got the same response. I called a third vet, who said they could fit us in at 2 PM. Eloise was just sleeping and seemed slightly uncomfortable so I figured we could make it until then. \n\nBut by 1 PM it was clear something was wrong. She wasn't really able to focus on anything and she couldn't stand up. I quickly carried her to the car and rushed to the vet. By the time I got there, she was nonresponsive and blind. They started her on fluids, but told me she'd need to be transferred to an emergency vet center down the street. I bundled her up into the back of my car, and again rushed her through the doors, her head dangling over my shoulder. I spent an hour sobbing in the waiting room.\n\nThe vets asked me if she could have eaten anything toxic but I had no specific memory of her eating anything unusual. I moved into a new apartment last week so could there be something there? I took her for a walk off leash in the woods, is it possible she could have eaten something there? There were many possibilities: acetamenophin, xylitol, mushrooms, other drugs, bacteria, mold, etc. \n\nEloise went through a full battery of tests, with the conclusion that some toxin had caused acute liver failure. Her liver enzymes were over 100 times higher than normal. The vet told me she had less than a 25% chance of surviving 12 hours, that euthanasia would be a fair consideration. I knew I had to give her a shot at surviving. \n\nAnd miraculously she did. In those 12 hours she started to stabilize, thanks in great part to the treatment she received from the vets and nurses, who threw everything they had at her. She remained [in the ICU for four days](https://imgur.com/IGKRV5w), with her blood pressure and blood sugar still dangerously low. Even for those days they said she had a 50/50 chance of surviving. \n\nBut yesterday they let me take her home. I think I may be harassing her with how often I check to make sure she's breathing and alert, but she seems to be [on the mend.](https://imgur.com/T2lqDBp) \n\nIt's been an enormously stressful week, emotionally and financially. She's not out of the woods yet, but everything is going in the right direction. The poison control center that the vet consulted with throughout Eloise's treatment believes it was most likely a toxic mushroom that Eloise ate when she was off leash on our walk. I didn't even realize that poisonous mushrooms would have been a risk in freezing temperatures. We can't lock our dogs up in ultra-sanitized spaces all the time, and this won't stop me from going on walks in the woods with my dog, but my god will I be more vigilant. \n\nUPDATE: Thanks everyone for the well wishes! Eloise seems to be doing a bit better each day. I can tell she's feeling better since she sought out her favorite toy in the world today, [the tennis ball!](https://imgur.com/NnrfLIp)",

I knew right away that some asshole has poisoned him (welcome to Greece) and I ran outside, put him on my shoulders and ran to the vet. Thankfully she is only 5 minutes away. She gave him some injections and some pills that made my dog throw up. She kept him there overnight and actually stayed with him (I found that out after) and I couldn't sleep.

Blend one block of tofu with half the amount of melted chocolate and 2 tablespoons of coconut cream. Add sweetener to taste. Optional: include a pinch of cinnamon or vanilla for extra flavor.\n\n(Example: I used 500g of tofu, this time just 200g of Lindt Dark chocolate (sugar-free), and a small amount of xylitol for sweetness).\n\n\nBrownie Batter:\n\n1. Mix 2 tablespoons of flaxseed powder with 6 tablespoons of water and let sit to thicken.\n\n2. Blend the thickened flax mixture with one small can of black beans, 85g of cocoa powder, a pinch of salt, vanilla extract, 60g of sweetener (such as xylitol), and 1.5 teaspoons of baking powder until smooth.\n\nIf the mixture is too thick, add a little more water as needed. You can also add nuts if you like.\n\n3. Pour the batter into a baking pan (or divide evenly between two smaller pans for two layers) and bake at 180¬∞C (350¬∞F) for about 20 minutes.\n\n\nAssembly:\n\n1. After the brownie layers have cooled, spread some of the chocolate mousse and a layer of cherries between the two layers.\n\n2.

    "body": "# Proof That Sugar/Cavities Are Killing You\n\nI'm going to prove it here:\n\n[How to Stop Tooth Decay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC_-X6CBQtw)\n\nThe above video shows that *processed* sugar is the ONLY cause behind cavities.\n\n[Best Food for Periodontal Disease and Cavities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLat2Im_R84&t=40s)\n\nThe above shows that people before tooth brushes (and processed sugar) had no cavities. They even replicated the results with people on a survivor like reality show. While plaque on their teeth went up, the bacteria that causes cavities and gingivitis disappeared. Their gum health also improved.\n\n(They also ate sugary foods like berries and honey. [Honey](https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2001/02/28/Honey-fights-tooth-decay), despite having a ton of sugar, has been shown to have antibacterial properties and is probably fine for your teeth.)\n\n[The Hidden Epidemic - Interview with Dr. Thomas Levy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7s8susk4a4) (LONG video but WORTH the watch)\n\nThis video shows that all the abscesses from rotten teeth and gum disease are the cause behind most oxidative stress in your body, heart attacks, and even cancers.\n\nAlmost all heart attacks (the number ONE killer in America) had plaque and bacteria in it that causes cavities.\n\nThe pressure from the jaw while eating pushes all that bacteria in your lymph nodes and blood stream.\n\n\n# What About Acidic Foods?\n\nWhile, yes, people who eat a lot of acidic and sweet foods (like vegans) tend to get more cavities, it isn't the *main* contributor.\n\nHere is the thing: your body is built to handle acidic foods but not PURE SUGAR.\n\nYes, acidic foods will wear down the enamel of your teeth but those foods are only on your teeth for a little while‚Äîand your teeth are supposed to remineralize and heal any damage done overnight while you sleep.\n\n(Personally, I have a ton of cavities between my teeth because I hate orange and apples all the time and the pulp would get stuck between my teeth all day. Would I never get cavities there if I didn't eat processed sugar back then? I don't know. But I don't think it'll hurt to floss after you eat certain acidic foods like oranges and apple. If you can't floss, keep toothpicks handy. Even a rinse with water wouldn't hurt.)\n\nAlso, [wait about at least an hour after eating acidic foods before brushing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8BKmlTLwUo). They're in a weakened state, and you'll scrub off more enamel material.\n\n# Fix Your Teeth - Videos To Watch\n\nSo you want to start preventing cavities but not sure if you can COMPLETELY remove all that sugar?\n\nHere are some other good videos worth watching. I'll give TL;DRs for you as well:\n\n[NO CAVITIES after YEARS without dentist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trvMgLQEnYw)\n\nA paleo woman (so almost no processed sugar in her diet) goes to the dentist after 3 years to find no cavities (claims to also not have a cavity for 9 years). How did she do it? 3 things:\n\n* **Natural toothpaste** (Dr. Bronner's Peppermint All-One Toothpaste) without fluoride (as she claims it kills the good bacteria in your mouth)\n* **Cod Liver oil high in vitamin D** (Green Pasture's Fermented Cod Liver Oil and Concentrated Butter Oil) - claims what has kept her from getting a cavity in 9 years\n* **Fermented food like sauerkraut** (fermented versions with good bacteria will always be in the refrigerated section of the grocery store). Instructs you to make sure it doesn't contain vinegar.\n\n[Natural Cure For Gum Disease Amazing Results!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eJX4Ga6kZ0)\n\nWoman shows that putting **fermented vegetable juice** (like the juice from sauerkraut) in her gums healed her gum disease.\n\n[Heal Gums Naturally with Probiotics (Part 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO9T4lmWins)([Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrN8PB-aZJI))\n\nElderly lady uses standard gut probiotics to heal her gums and teeth‚Äî**she put gut probiotics directly on her gums**. She open the capsules and packed them directly between the teeth and gums with her tongue. Said she **did it for 4 days** and stopped after her body told her to.\n\nI wish she would give the brand, but this is all I could find in the comments when one person asked:\n\n>You want ones with a variety of cultures in them with both \"bifido...\" strains and \"Lacto...\" strains. No particular brand.\n\nFirst video also said her brand had about **10 billion per capsule with mostly various Lactobacillus strains**.\n\n[What‚Äôs the Best Mouthwash?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHyghcN9Sws)\n\nAbove video shows that **green tea plus amla powder** is way more effective and safer than the most popular commercial mouthwashes.\n\n[Waterpik Flosser + Real Salt = Oral Health Game Changer!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWawWdsJUu8)\n\n**Water flossing with salt water**\n\n[3 Home Tips to Keep Your Mouth Healthy ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUq42lkvxRo)\n\n**Water flossing with hydrogen peroxide**\n\n[Is CAPB in SLS-Free Toothpaste Any Better?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAlYq4hDglA&t=274s)\n\n**Avoid all detergent toothpastes**, especially sodium lauryl sulfate.\n\n[The Best Toothpaste!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_GpHjng7OE)\n\n**The best toothpaste is no toothpaste?**\n\n[Xylitol Pulling Instead of ‚ÄúOil Pulling‚Äù For Even Better Results!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t58ucaPcGE)\n\n**Xylitol mouthwash**\n\n[Make Your Own Mouthwash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDT2Y8N7Z9w)\n\n**DIY mouthwash** (water, baking soda, and mint essential oil)\n\n[What Happened After 4 Years Using DIY Toothpaste](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh4NXZFgtIg)\n\n**DIY toothpaste** (calcium carbonate powder, coconut oil, baking soda, trace mineral powder, and peppermint essential oil)\n\nShe claims the popular one you see online (just coconut oil, baking soda, and peppermint oil) actually *de*mineralized her teeth, but she *re*mineralized her teeth with her new formula.\n\n[Killing Bacteria Naturally with Salt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQuOVRJkhlo)\n\nMicroscope vision of bacteria dying from salt water\n\n[Fluoride in Water - The Good, The Bad & The Ugly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RHVGIyhmEE)\n\nNot giving a TL;DR for this one as fluoride for your teeth is a complex issue.\n\n[Fluoride in Our Water | 2 Alarming New Studies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nizvddHUd0)\n\n**A few studies that will make you think twice about fluoride.**\n\n[Raederle's Teeth Remineralizing Masterclass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF06YqKL_qw)\n\nHolistic approach to remineralizing your teeth. I usually make fun of hippy girls like this but everything she says agrees with the above. I guess she's just way smarter than me :)\n\n**Supplement or get naturally** (she covers how): K2, calcium (phosphorus), silica, magnesium, retinol, vitamin D2 or D3, DHA & EPA, vitamin C, iodine, selenium, and zinc.\n\n**Avoid**: triclosan, alcohol, sodium lauryl sulfate, fluoride, and excess amounts of glycerin (they're in almost all toothpastes, even the \"natural\" ones). Personally, I would add [carrageenan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8zoPKID_eM) to that list. (Updat: she mentions to avoid that later in the video series. See, she knows what she's talking about!)\n\n**Add to your dental routine**: 20 minutes of oil pulling each day; water flossing after your brush; rinse with sea salt after oil pulling, flossing, or brush; and  mouthwash (herbal for gum infections or with fermented foods like coconut kefir of sauerkraut).\n\nThe only thing I'm not sure about is oil pulling based off the video on about [oil pulling risks (lipoid pneumonia)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zf5PKnKIJc), how [oil pulling undermines the protective teeth layer against acid (at least temporarily)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=betOW0qVGLM&t=283s), but [oil pulling is as effective as commercial mouthwashes (however, so might swishing with water for 20 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72lfQUJo10k&t=260s) from Dr. Greger.\n\nSo if you're going to oil pull, do it before bed or wait a few hours before eating anything acidic. Also, don't swallow the oil, clear the back of your throat and tongue of any oil, and then brush your tooth using a different toothbrush rather than your regular one. And if you think you have any kind of leak into your nasal cavity, you shouldn't oil pull. See above for some great alternatives.\n\nFinally, go to your dentist! At the very least, they can see things in your mouth you can't. Yes, the [x-rays are bad for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYGkvMwqyys) (don't do them all the times and [get your antioxidant levels way up that day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAlUwBOk1kg&t=236s)), but you need to get checked from time to time. Better to tackle a cavity while it's small and where you can remineralize it, before it becomes a big problem where they want to do a root canal on you.\n\n# Conclusion\n\n**Keep in mind, if you didn't grow up eating sugary sweets, you wouldn't crave them, they would be too sweet.**\n\n[Your taste buds adapt.](https://paleoleap.com/taste-buds-sugar/)\n\nBut all that the sugar industry cares about is selling more product.\n\n**Edit**: Added a *proven* DIY toothpaste (the lady claims the popular one you see online *de*mineralized her teeth, but she saved them with her formula), link to show that your taste buds will adapt, added the remineralizing master class by Raederle, Dr. Greger talking a ton about oil pulling, and a video on how another older woman healed her gums with off-the-shelf probiotics. Cleaned up the post with headers. Added more info on dentists and x-rays, and on acidic foods and brushing.\n\n**Bonus**: Watch [Root Cause (2018)](https://tubitv.com/movies/507721).

Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

    "body": "A healthy mouth is more than just a nice smile‚Äîit‚Äôs a reflection of your entire body‚Äôs well-being. Scientists have discovered powerful links between oral health and major diseases like heart disease, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and even cancer. When your gums are bleeding or your enamel is wearing away, your mouth is telling you something deeper: inflammation is building, and it can affect your whole body. The good news? With a few simple, daily habits, you can protect your gums, teeth, and health for life.\n\nStart with brushing, but make it mindful. Use a soft-bristle toothbrush and take two full minutes, twice a day. Gently brush at an angle toward your gum line using small circles‚Äînot back-and-forth scrubbing. Choose a toothpaste that strengthens enamel, like one with stannous fluoride or nano-hydroxyapatite. It‚Äôs not just about fresh breath; it‚Äôs about fighting bacteria and keeping your enamel strong and your gums calm.\n\nFlossing matters just as much as brushing, maybe even more. It‚Äôs the only way to remove food and bacteria from the tight spaces between your teeth. If string floss is tricky or painful, don‚Äôt give up‚Äîtry a water flosser or interdental brushes instead. You‚Äôre not just cleaning your teeth‚Äîyou‚Äôre preventing chronic inflammation that can travel from your mouth to your heart and brain.\n\nMouthwash isn‚Äôt just a bonus step‚Äîit‚Äôs a powerful way to reduce harmful bacteria. Choose one with antibacterial ingredients like chlorhexidine, essential oils, or CPC (cetylpyridinium chloride). Or go natural with a warm saltwater rinse, which is incredibly soothing and effective. A clean mouth is a low-inflammation zone, and your entire body benefits from that.\n\nWhat you eat also shapes your oral health. Leafy greens, berries, green tea, and fatty fish reduce gum inflammation. Dairy and eggs help strengthen enamel with calcium and vitamin K2. Probiotic foods like yogurt and kefir help balance the bacteria in your mouth, just like they do in your gut. On the flip side, sugary snacks, sticky carbs, and acidic drinks wear down your enamel and feed harmful bacteria.\n\nYour lifestyle plays a big role too. Smoking is one of the worst things for your gums‚Äîit cuts off blood flow, slows healing, and raises your risk of gum disease and oral cancer. Alcohol dries out your mouth, allowing bacteria to thrive. Staying hydrated with plenty of water throughout the day helps keep saliva flowing, which is your body‚Äôs natural defense against decay.\n\nDon‚Äôt forget your tongue! It harbors bacteria that cause bad breath and contribute to plaque. Use a tongue scraper or gently brush it daily. Chewing sugar-free gum with xylitol is another great habit‚Äîit stimulates saliva and even helps reduce cavity-causing bacteria. Little habits like these add up to big protection.\n\nAnd of course, see your dentist regularly‚Äîat least every six months. A professional cleaning clears away tartar you can‚Äôt remove on your own, and it gives your dentist a chance to spot trouble before it turns serious. Combine that with key supplements like CoQ10 for gum repair, vitamin C for collagen support, and D3 + K2 to strengthen your teeth from within, and you‚Äôre giving your oral health everything it needs to thrive.\n\nYour mouth is the front door to your body. Keep it strong, keep it clean, and it will reward you with better health, clearer thinking, and a longer life. Treat your teeth and gums like a part of your whole being‚Äîbecause they are. A healthy smile is a sign of a healthy you.",

I had mild tooth decay 3 years ago before starting doing fasting daily (19h/5h) and today I have no more tooth decay as my teeth have regenerated.  \nAnother trick is to have at least 12 hours daily in which you don't drink or eat anything, in this interval, your saliva will regenerate your teeth.

Told the dental hygienists I‚Äôm off sugar, and asked if replacing that with occasional sugar alcohols and stevia is ok. They picked up very quickly I‚Äôm doing Keto, hah. Were thrilled to hear it and wanted details on my new WOE! It was hard to answer their questions with my mouth full of teeth cleaning equipment, but we managed. üòÑ\n\nI asked about xylitol, and one of the hygienists told me xylitol is the new fluoride. Studies have proven that if you put xylitol in a bowl of bacteria, the bacteria will not grow. They were very supportive of xylitol chewing gums and using it in my Keto foods, and feel it will just keep growing as the next big sugar substitute.\n\nTeeth were great, no cavities. A positive experience at the dentist, and I got to be a Keto ambassador for a day!",

We had a friend over that gave us some gum. They put it in our stocking and we thought nothing of it. Well the stocking must have fallen during the night without us knowing because the next day after running some errands we came back to a ripped up bag of the gum. I freaked out because it was sugar free gum which usually means xylitol in place of the sugar. Sure enough after reading the back xylitol was the top ingredient. I freak out.\n\nWe call around to see what emergency vets are open, not many of those in our area to begin with, found one and rushed her there. They immediately induce vomiting and found a couple pieces in her vomit. They hook her up to an IV and start her on meds and a glucose drip because her liver enzymes ended up being over 4Xs the regular amount. They end up telling us she has to stay the night because there was a definite possibility of it getting worse and that less than what she had in her system could easily kill any dog. We stayed up and called the vet multiple times that night to get updates and even woke up super early to get another one. \n\nMiraculously, she made it through the night and her liver enzymes started going down. Still 2Xs the regular amount but they felt confident that we had caught it in time and they had started treatment in time. They said later that day we could pick her up.\n\nWhen we went in a tech was doing the discharge and asked how she got into the gum. We told our story again and the guy goes, this is the third time I‚Äôve heard a story like that this season. \n\nShe came home and she‚Äôs back to her old self but it was quite the scare. I guess I just wanted to warn everyone about the dangers of xylitol. It‚Äôs hiding in so many things. Always double check peanut butter before giving it to your babies too. It can be in there. Double check your candies you got and make sure they are out of reach at all times. Accidents happen and this wasn‚Äôt really anyone‚Äôs fault. But it was a mistake way too close for comfort. \n\nThank you for listening, happiest of holidays to you all. Here is a picture of the naughty, yet luckiest girl on the planet. So happy and grateful to have her with us still. ",

We rushed to the emergency vet clear across the city and we might have ran a few red lights. \n\nThey were able to count the gum and wrappers, and we were pretty sure they got it all out. We weren‚Äôt able to afford to keep him there overnight. But after the supportive care he seemed back to himself, if a bit freaked out. \n\nHe just turned 13 this year, so he‚Äôs still going strong, but I check any gum or mints or candies I bring into the house now. He also doesn‚Äôt get into stuff like he did when he was younger. \n\nBut it‚Äôs no joke, xylitol is absolute poison to dogs. Time is of the essence!

    "body": "1. Sleeping with your bird\n\n-This might seem really obvious but I already directly heard from this subreddit a month ago that there bird died because of this and I also hear my friend telling me a similar story. And even if you don't sleep with your bird make sure to lock their cage door at night (or whenever you go to bed or they are left without any supervision). While you might be sleeping they could fly/climb to you, attempting to cuddle while your unconscious and you could crush them.\n\n2. Toxic Foods\n\n-avacado (The leaves of the avocado plant contain persin, a fatty acid-like substance that kills fungus in the plant. When ingested by a bird, this substance may cause heart damage, respiratory difficulty, weakness, and even sudden death.)\n\n-Caffeine (Caffeine can increase heart rate, induce arrhythmias and hyperactivity, and even cause cardiac arrest in birds.)\n\n-fruit seeds and pits (especially apple seeds)\n\n-Dairy products (Not toxic but bad for their health.. Parrots never evolved to produce lactase, the enzyme necessary to help digest lactose. Essentially, birds are highly ‚Äúlactose-intolerant‚Äù species.)\n   * Cheese (\"I want to emphasize this because lactose intolerance is just the tip of the iceberg. Because birds cannot digest dairy products, cheese can remain and accumulate in the digestive track and has caused fatal blockages in the crop and intestines. If your parrot loves cheese (and what parrot doesn‚Äôt?) you can feed vegan cheese made with nuts. I make mine mini pizzas made with whole grain English muffins, tomato sauce (Hunts brand because they use only steam, not lye in processing) and almond cheese. They love it !\")\n\n-Chocolate (Chocolate contains both theobromine and caffeine which can cause vomiting and diarrhea, increase heart rate, result in hyperactivity, induce tremors and seizures, and even cause death in birds.)\n\n-Salt (Even one salty chip or pretzel can upset the electrolyte and fluid balance in a bird‚Äôs tiny body, leading to excessive thirst, dehydration, kidney failure, and death.)\n\n-Fat (Consumption of high-fat foods, such as butter, oil, fatty meats, and nuts can result in build-up of cholesterol deposits in the walls of our arteries (known as atherosclerosis), predisposing to heart disease and stroke. Excessive ingestion of these foods also can lead to obesity and all the health problems that accompany this condition. The same processes occur in birds, and certain bird species, such as Amazon and Quaker parrots, are prone to developing high cholesterol and triglyceride levels and subsequent coronary artery disease. Therefore, just as we should limit consumption of high-fat foods, so should birds.)\n\n-Fruit Pits and Apple Seeds (While most fruit is safe and generally healthy for birds to consume in small amounts, certain fruits containing seeds [such as apples and pears] and pits [such as cherries, apricots, peaches, nectarines, and plums], should not be offered to birds without removing the seeds and pits first, as these seeds and pits contain small amounts of a cardiac-toxic cyanide compound. Without the seeds and pits, these fruits are completely safe for birds to consume. The seeds from other produce such as grapes, citrus fruits, squash, pumpkins, tomatoes, melons, mango, pomegranate, and berries, all are safe for bird consumption and can be fed without worry.)\n\n-Garlic and Onion (Many people expect that onions and garlic, like other vegetables, are healthy for birds. However, while these spicy veggies have heart benefits in people, whether fed raw or cooked, they are toxic to many animals, including birds, cats, and dogs. Onions contain sulfur compounds that, when chewed, can irritate the lining of a bird‚Äôs mouth, esophagus, or crop, causing ulcers, and can induce rupture of red blood cells resulting in anemia. Garlic contains allicin, another chemical that can cause anemia and weakness in birds.)\n\n-Xylitol (This common artificial sweetener, found in sugarless gum and many diet foods, causes hypoglycemia, liver damage, and possible death in dogs and other animals. While the effects of this sweetener haven‚Äôt been studied in detail in birds, birds have a faster metabolism than many other species and might therefore be very sensitive to the toxic effects of even tiny amounts of this chemical. Therefore, it‚Äôs best to avoid exposing birds to xylitol, altogether.)\n\nA big part of socializing a parrot is allowing your bird to come out of its cage at meal time, and offering him a very small amount of food while you‚Äôre eating can certainly make your bird feel that he‚Äôs part of the flock. Remember to share food that hasn‚Äôt been in your mouth (which contains bacteria and yeast foreign to birds) and that‚Äôs non-toxic to birds can be a great way to build trust with your pet and make him feel comfortable at home. \n\nIf your bird should ingest any of these potentially toxic items, remember to¬†contact your veterinarian immediately to see if treatment is warranted.\n\nWork Cited: https://zupreem.com/avian/toxic-foods-your-bird-should-never-eat/\n\n3. Toxic Scents\n\n-Cigarettes (Not only is the smoke toxic, but the cigarettes themselves can cause fatal nicotine poisoning. I have noticed several posts on this site which feature birds picking up cigarettes or cigarette butts. Even a tiny piece of tobacco can poison your bird. Also, if you smoke, make sure you thoroughly wash your hands before handling your bird! Residual smoke and nicotine can also poison your bird.)\n\n-Candles\n\n-Perfume\n\n-Nail Polish Remover\n\n-hairspray\n\n-Spray deodorant\n\n-air freshners\n\n-Smoke (second hand smoke + tobacco)\n\n-Cleaning Supplies (Bleach and ammonia, be cautious about using any cleaners and disinfectants around your bird, instead, look for pet-safe products.¬†Pet Focus Aviary & Cage Cleaner¬†is a great choice that is safe to use around birds.)\n\n-Nonstick Cookware (Emits harmful fumes.. Even a self-cleaning oven can be harmful for your bird.)\n\n-Insecticides and Pesticides (So avoid spraying for bugs in your bird's room.)\n\n-Carbon Monoxide (This is emitted from fires, central heating units, and automobile exhaust; the gas can be deadly to birds.

Heavy Metals  (Lead + Zinc + Copper. Metals are everywhere in our environments and are an often overlooked source of toxicity in pet birds. Metals can be found in¬† paint, inoleum, soldering, wire, zippers, twist ties and many other objects on which birds love to chew. Even some older bird toys, especially the clappers on metal bells, have been found to contain lead. Birds who may chip away over time at a lead-painted windowsill, lick a metal bell toy, nibble on the soldering of a stained glass Tiffany lamp or chew on a metal zipper are constantly ingesting heavy metals and can potentially become intoxicated. When ingested in large enough quantities, these metals can damage nerves and cause¬† vomiting, maldigestion, neurologic signs, such as imbalance and clenched toes and even seizures. Also jewelry items. Silver and gold can also cause heavy metal poisoning.)\n\nWork Cited: http://www.vetstreet.com/our-pet-experts/10-everyday-items-that-are-toxic-to-birds?page=3\n\nEdit: \n\n5. Seed Diet (Not toxic but harmful. 1 thing I also forgot to list is that if you feed your parrot seeds as the main diet you should consider changing it. Seeds contain a lot of fatty acids that should only be used as snacks. Instead feed your bird pellets as their main diet. Zupreem has a lot of different healthy varieties to choose from. And if it's hard for your bird to adjust at first you can still mix a bit of seeds and slowly reduce the amount until only a pellet diet is left. And tada! Your bird is happy and healthy.)\n\n\n6. Plants (There are a list of toxic and healthy plants that your parrot can list:\nhttps://birdhism.com/blogs/news/common-bird-safe-house-plants\nThis list shows which are good and bad. But if it is hard to distinguish if it's nontoxic don't take your chances and stay away from plants altogether.)\n\nCredit: The subredditer aloe-jello listed this in the comments. (Just want to make sure it's visible.)\n\n7. Toys: recommended by subredditor: sunshinezx6r\n\nThere are three main problems that can make toys dangerous:\n\nToxicity¬†(poisoning from chemicals or¬†heavy metals¬†in toys)\n\n\nEntanglement / Strangulation¬†(getting body parts stuck in toys, or threads wrapped around the neck)\n\n\nIngestion¬†(parts can be chewed off toys and swallowed)\n\n-Painted Surfaces (or glues that hold pieces together. There is the toxicity aspect, but even if non-toxic paints or food-grade glues are used, there is another problem that is just as serious. Paint and glues are applied to surfaces. They don‚Äôt soak into surfaces like dyes do; they dry on top of a surface. This is a part of the toy that might attract the attention of an observant parrot during play. While our fingers are not well designed to removed glue or paint, the parrot beak makes short work of it. If these chips are swallowed, they can be deadly even if they are non-toxic in nature. They can get lodged in the digestive system causing a serious blockage. Most dyes are soy based (vegetable) and are a safe colorant choice.)\n\n-Strings, Threads, Ropes, Cords (Strangulation and entanglement are common, and yet so avoidable. Keep all cords and ropes short, so that they cannot create a noose around the birds neck or get wrapped around their legs or neck. The thinner the rope, the shorter the rope / string needs to be. Fraying rope and cord are also dangerous because your bird may become caught in them, resulting in injury or in countless cases even death. There have been cases of birds separating the strands on braided ropes, inserting their heads, and strangling themselves as a result.)\n\n-Holes (Your bird should not be able to fit it's head into any holes in a toy that are small enough to get stuck and strangle.)\n\n-Links (These should be completely closed so as not to allow beaks to get wedged between the link ends.)\n\n-Metal Hardware (This should be stainless steel or nickel plated. The hardware pieces should not be removable or indigestible. Also, they should not have crevices or be shaped in ways that might get stuck on a beak or nail.)\n\n-Leather Toys (Parts should be vegetable tanned only. Tanning is a soaking process that converts animal skin to leather. It is usually done with acidic chemicals, but vegetable tanned leather is soaked in tannins made from plant matter and is free of dangerous chemicals.)\n\n-Jingle Bells (These are used in toys even home made toys. The flaps can be opened easily by parrots but sometimes they can lose their digits or be cut by the metal. If they open up the flaps the metal part in the middle is lead so can kill the if they swallow it. Also if people have stained glass that is made with lead to hold the glass together & they land on the top or pick at it, they will die.)\n\n-Plastic (Birds are known for shredding and if they eat a piece of plastic they will be prone to die or have digestive problems.)\n\n-Some China Products (China exports pet products by the tons. Cages and toys are continually found to be made from parts know to be toxic. They use paints or powder coating that contain known toxins. Sadly, they also manufacture pet foods that have been responsible for countless pet deaths. Still, their products are being widely distributed because of their affordability. This is good for the wallet‚Äì very bad for the pets. Beware of products manufactured there.)\n\n-Wood (Check if the type of would you have is non toxic and make sure that your birds are not swallowing sharp splinters.)\n\n-Fabrics, Happy Huts, Cage Coverings (some birds will eat the fuzzy coverings. If fluff is disappearing from your Happy Hut, remove it. This material can cause obstructions and death. Some birds chew holes into the material and get trapped. Any fabric items must be inspected regularly.)\n\n-Chains (Avoid Zinc coated or galvanized chains and components. Birds are very susceptible to Zinc toxicity. Avoid chain with open links as these may provide sharp surfaces and narrow opening where tongues or toes can become caught. Make sure links are properly sized for your bird and do not over a place where body parts can be caught.)\n\n -Fastners (Avoid split key ring type fastners, snap type hooks and spring loaded clips. As birds chews or plays with these they all present the hazard getting tongues or toes caught.)\n \n-Rings (Avoid improperly sized rings in which bird may get its head caught.  Also avoid toys that have multiple rings looped  together that presents an entanglement and possibly hanging issues.)\n\n-Millet Holder, Rattan Ball (Make sure these are small enough. So that your bird is unable to claim into or get stuck in these. Keep this in mind with other similar toys.\n\nWork Cited:\nhttps://forums.avianavenue.com/index.php?threads/dangerous-toys-list.37552/\n\nhttps://birdtricksstore.com/blogs/birdtricks-blog/unsafe-bird-toys-how-to-avoid-them\n\nhttps://www.beautyofbirds.com/toysafety.html\n\nhttps://www.pethealthandnutritioncenter.com/bird-toy-safe-unsafe-material.html\n\n8.

When I tell people what I can't use, they always as *well what can you use?* Here's a few things that are accessible and that I use in my own home.   \nI find specific bird-safe cleaners are really expensive. \n\nCleaners: For an all-purpose cleaner, dish soap mixed with water. If I'm NOT cleaning in the bird room I may add a little lemon or orange essential oil for smell. For glass cleaner (never use Windex), I use apple cider vinegar mixed with water. \n\nAcrylic paint is fine! If you'd like to paint a mural in your bird room (like I did) pretty much the only paint you can use is acrylic. Don't let your bird eat it, though.\n\nRust-Oleum and Krylon are good spray paints for renovating bird cages. My preference is Rust-Oleum, since the usual reason for painting a bird cage is rust. Of course, it's spray paint, so paint outside for your health and your bird's. I'd avoid letting your bird eat at the bird cage anyways, but these two paints are probably about the same as what's on the cage in the first place.",

Not only is the smoke toxic, but the cigarettes themselves can cause fatal nicotine poisoning. I have noticed several posts on this site which feature birds picking up cigarettes or cigarette butts. Even a tiny piece of tobacco can poison your bird. Also, if you smoke, make sure you thoroughly wash your hands before handling your bird! Residual smoke and nicotine can also poison your bird.\n\n3) Cheese. I want to emphasize this because lactose intolerance is just the tip of the iceberg. Because birds cannot digest dairy products, cheese can remain and accumulate in the digestive track and has caused fatal blockages in the crop and intestines. If your parrot loves cheese (and what parrot doesn‚Äôt?) you can feed vegan cheese made with nuts. I make mine mini pizzas made with whole grain English muffins, tomato sauce (Hunts brand because they use only steam, not lye in processing) and almond cheese. They love it !\n\nAgain, great list!

One could break across to here and let us know, even if the one we sent from this side can't return.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNavigator Williams' upper instrument panel had been replaced with a new blue one, but the lower, still white, appeared to be working fine despite having broken once.  It was larger in scale and highly tactile, being mostly a rack of handles and pedals that Williams could handle by touch while the upper was devoted to touch panels and visual displays.  Williams had orbit charts and trajectories up for both ends of the breakpoint, but the far end was rendered in gray, not live.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"S' true, sir,\" said Williams.  \"We have to assume it broke bad, but we don't know how. Maybe the transmitter worked and it got the message off but it was too broken to get the reply.  Or it could have heard the reply but been too broken to break back.  Or maybe it broke in a way that stopped it even sending the message. Williams shrugged, an elaborate four-armed gesture that everyone present had had plenty of time to get used to.  \"We just don't know.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Not knowing's not good enough,\" Captain Trent said.  \"How long 'til our next try?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Probably another two days,\" said Deck Officer Ngo. \"We're waiting on materials.  Those probes are delicate and take a whole lot of power to work, even though they're small.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCaptain Trent nodded. \"And that brings us to the fabbery report,\" he said.  \"Go on.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNgo shrugged. \"We're building plastics and some minor mechanical stuff, but we're stalled on major structural repairs and can't get started on more breaker probes yet.  The fabbery's waiting for raw materials from the asteroid mission.\" He gestured to Communications Officer Danae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLieutenant Danae nodded, popping up two images - one of the landing site where the shuttle was parked and people were milling around several boulders and outcroppings, and one of another jumble of rock, where four people could be seen standing around something in the middle.  \"The away team landed about three hours ago,\" she said.  \"They haven't found any signs of people or construction at the landing site, but they spotted what looks like a Cairrusant artifact on the surface about four and a half kilometers from there and sent a team to have a look.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"What is it?\"  XO Jansen asked raising her eyebrows. The darker arches contrasted sharply against the short golden fur of her forehead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"It's the wreck of a ship catapult,\"  Lieutenant Danae said. \"Tannh says it's primitive Cairrusant tech like what they used to launch their very first ships something like twelve thousand earth-years ago.  And there's some construction next to it that we'd have missed entirely but xe says was a temporary camp.  Xe dates it to between four thousand and forty-two hundred standard years old.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"How's xe being that precise about the date?\" Trent asked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Uh...  xe recognizes some of the stuff at the catapult site. It's apparently from their Tupol Empire era. The Tupol Empire had sort of a golden age of exploration for Cairrusant.  They started when they began using electromagnetic launchers and solid-fuel rockets, but really took off around forty-one hundred years ago when they finally developed liquid-fuel rocket engines.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Okay....  Check me on this but the Cairrusant don't have break technology today, do they?  Did this early civilization xe's talking about have a technological base that got lost?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"They've never had enough energy to run a breaker, sir,\" Forzione cut in. \"They never built big enough to put together nuclear reactors or the particle accelerators they'd have needed to research them.  Running a breaker, even once, would take more power than their homeworld even four thousand years later, generates in a century.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"So...  How could they have wound up on the other side of the breakpoint then?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"No clues, sir,\" Forzione told him.  \"Speaks says the story sounds familiar but doesn't remember anything specific about them.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSFC Sam Henry watched with interest as tiny bits of what looked like gravel spilled out of the hole in the rock and spun and swirled and sparkled back over to the tiny observation vessel.  The lights inside pulsed, and he heard the translator over his suit radio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Okay, I've been to the other end.  The tube is about \\[twelve meters\\] deep into the rock beyond the point where it split open.  It looks like when they released pressure into the tunnel it broke open around them.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHenry frowned.  \"That green rock is pretty tough stuff.  I mean, it's good pure olivine, with no cracks around the tunnel.  It should have held up to the stress.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"It looks like they pushed it harder than the design really allows,\" Tannh told him. \"The very first Cairrusant ships - the kind a family built for themselves in a couple of weeks and made short line-of-sight trips with - used simple compressed gas chambers.  That's what this launcher looks like at first glance, but it's from a later era.  This was middle Tupol Empire construction, and they were the first big users of reactive propellants. So this thing that looks like a pressure chamber is a chemical reaction chamber, and designing those was still a black art at the time. It was centuries before safety regulations about reaction chambers matured.  And a middle period ship was probably built for an electromagnetic launch, meaning this was somebody's emergency jury rig.  The pressure vessel looks like it was designed to hold a \\[three kilogram\\] charge, which is too much for that reduced opening, and the metal section of the tube isn't really long enough to fully collimate it. If they fully charged it, breaking that rock is no surprise.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Uh...\" said Henry. \"Three kilograms of what, exactly?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Well,\" said Tannh, \"I don't think I can tell.  I mean I know what they were supposed to be using.  Tupol Empire Ships of the previous era used \\[Xylitol Pentanitrate\\] for the first stages in a two-stage launch catapult. But this isn't a two-stage catapult.  This ... looks like somebody knew how to build a launch chamber for a two-stage launcher, but closed down the mouth opening to the diameter of the second-stage launch tunnel.    And the tools and raw materials they left lying around here make it look like they were preparing a charge of \\[Hexanitrohexaazatricyclododecanedione\\]  instead of \\[Xylitol Pentanitrate\\].\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHenry blinked three times and then very slowly started to smile.  \"Am  I right that the ship would have to have been small enough to fit inside this tube?\"  He pointed at the broken stone, where the half tunnel they could see  was about eight centimeters wide.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Yes.  I think so.\" Tannh said.  \"By the time gas reaches the end of the metal tube section the pressure is supposed to be reduced and directed enough for the rock to contain the rest of it.  But this is all naval history lessons to me, not something I've actually seen done.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHenry cut him off.  \"So... you guys thought the way we got into space was crazy, strapping ourselves to giant explosives as they went off?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"This isn't the way we got into space,\" Tannh protested, as Henry's smile continued to get wider.  \"The earliest ships were launched with simple compressed gas chambers.  But this is from the Tupol Empire era, much later, when reactive propellants...\" Xe trailed off as a spatter of light that corresponded to an incoming transmission from Trixie Charlott lit up in xer ship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCharlott waved for their attention.  \"Henry, I've known you for just a few hours and I already don't like that smile.  What the hell were they doing?\"  she said.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Our buddies here,\" said Henry with a broad grin, \"were trying to fire their ship out of a giant gun.  Xylitol Pentanitrate is plenty damn bangy, and that other thing xe mentioned - I'll bet they've got a handy easy word for in their own language but I'll just call it 'Gesundheit' for short - is even bangier.  Both of them, in fact, are way too bangy to take with us across a break.  We're talking about potential muzzle velocities of several kilometers per second but their gun broke.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"What would have happened to the ship when the catapult broke?\"  Charlott asked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Uh....\"  Henry's smile faltered.  \"Any propellant whose name starts with 'hexa nitro'....\" he trailed off. \"Nothing good. Escape velocity here is only about six hundred meters a second. If it hit pieces of the catapult there'll be nothing left to find and if it didn't, it's not likely we'd find it anywhere near here.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"True,\" Tannh confirmed.  \"From the tools they left around here it looks like this particular crew must have been from the middle Tupol empire. The ship would be mostly iron instead of mostly tungsten, made for electromagnetic launchers but theoretically capable of using gas launchers in emergencies.  But as SFC Henry says ... if the launcher failed it's not even very likely that there's anything left to find.\"   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTrixie's face went slack as she took in the forces involved. \"Oh my God. I never really thought about it but physically you guys are effectively rocks where we're effectively bags of water. You must be able to withstand hundreds of times as much acceleration as us.\"\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter a long pause, xe continued.  \"Besides, it's not the gees,\" xe said in subdued yellow.  \"Well sometimes it's the gees.  Those launches were brutal and crew often lost individual exodes even when they went right.  But if a ship actually broke up they'd be scattered too fast to pull back together, and that's the end of us.\"\n\n[ First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/uh8sad/oc_but_does_it_scale_1/) [ Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/11nij0o/but_does_it_scale_32/)  Next",

        "body": "Hexanitrohexaazatricyclododecanedione is a superlatively bangy compound that we can make and safely handle. But at the slightest hint of humidity or moisture, it breaks down harmlessly into gas without exploding.  That's not really an issue for a lifeform that doesn't get humidity or moisture and lives at temperatures usually around forty to two hundred Kelvin.  Water is a mineral, not moisture.  \n\nHonestly though, breaking down in contact with the slightest hint of moisture is a property we could probably make good use of ourselves.\n\nIt keeps coming up in the context of designing \"self-remediating\" land mines - that is, mines that are dangerous for the duration of the military operation they're intended for, but which nobody has to worry about a year later because they'll never explode. The design just has an aluminum foil barrier somewhere that will slowly oxidize and eventually expose the charge to air.  And after about a day - or maybe a week in a desert heat wave - air will cause the Gesundheit to decay into harmless stuff that won't even give goats indigestion. \n\nOf course your basic goatherd might still have objections to the rest of the mine - goats don't do well on detonators or electronics, for starters - but the Gesundheit will literally evaporate into nontoxics, so it won't be a problem.\n\nBut for some reason the people who make and use mines, across the world, have objections to mines that become inert too automatically, or inevitably, or easily.\n\nAnd for some other reason, my spell checker doesn't think it's a real word.",

The dog was fine one minute and dying the next.  \n\nMy exam led me to believe the dog was hypoglycemic (low blood sugar) so I started an IV and gave fluid containing dextrose, leading to a rapid, dramatic recovery. It turns out the dog had eaten the owners‚Äô candy sweetened with xylitol, a known problem for dogs.\n\nWhen the dog was discharged, the owners (a couple on their 40s) asked to speak with me in private. They were amazed with how quickly I made a diagnosis and fixed their beloved pet. They each shook my hand and hugged me. It was a good day.\n\nThen the man asked if I‚Äôd join hands with them and pray. I don‚Äôt like to discuss personal stuff at work, so I just said, ‚Äúthanks, but that‚Äôs not something I do‚Äù. It should have ended there, but no.\n\n‚ÄúWhat, you don‚Äôt pray?!‚Äù\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs correct.‚Äù\n‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre a Christian, right?‚Äù\n‚ÄúNo.‚Äù\n‚ÄúOh. Sorry.

My entire world was wrapped up inside the Church. To know that one of the strongest, kindest, and most honest adult's I knew, not only knew the Bible thoroughly, but had soundly rejected it, shattered something in me.\n\nI didn't ask again, but I did agonize for years in prayer because I genuinely thought harm would come to someone I trusted. Conversely, this person calmly confronted every prejudice and silly notion I presented, and gave me a reasoned responce I had to counter, but couldn't.\n\nI try to remember this when I think \"why has this never crossed your mind?\". For some, they have literally never been confronted with something that directly conflicts with thier view of the world.\n\nI know it feels like a losing battle and you just want to write people off. But every time you give a reasoned responce, or show love and kindness despite not being \"filled with the holy spirit\", you show someone that there is more to being human than what is written in ancient texts.\n\nThese things compound. You may never convince someone to leave a religion, but they will be coaxed away from fundamentalism. That alone will have a lasting impact as time marches forward. I think that is worth something.",

I've eaten almost 150 \"drops\" of poopin' juice and they're doing their job.\n\nAnyways, back to the task at hand.

By doing this it means the sugar becomes hydrogenated, changing the chemical makeup of the sugar. Usually hydrogen atoms and at least one carbon atom is added to the mixture through this process, making it similar to table sugar, but not quite the same. \n\nThe result?  A sugar that has 70 percent of the sweetness, but little to no calories and a similar taste. This sugar also has minimal to no effect on your blood sugar depending on the kind of sugar alcohol you ingest. \n\nHow does this work? It works by making itself indigestible, you can't really absorb it. Sugar alcohol generally passes straight through your body. It is for this reason that sugar alcohol gives you the runs, and an upset stomach if you consume too much of it in one sitting. \n\nFortunately sugar alcohol contains no adverse health effects. In fact it is considered a healthy alternative to sugar. Bacteria in your mouth don't like it, and it has negligible to no effects on your glycemic index.

He's acting kind of skiddish I shrug it off and hop in the shower.  I get out and hear a gurgling growl in my kitchen and go in to see Duke appearing to be seizing in my kitchen floor.\n\nI call the vet and begin to pick all 110 lbs of pitbull up and get him into the car .We get to the vet dukes still seizing and the vet draws blood and tells me he looks like he's been poisoned do I have any poison in the house etc. I had called my wife and told her what was happening and told her to get home and check on our other pits as the vet believed he had been poisoned. My dogs live inside and go outside to a privacy fenced in property when we are home only !\n\nSo vet draws blood and says it's gonna take 15 minutes to get results meanwhile I'm freaking out my boy is dying !  Wife calls me back and tells me she found what he got into it was sugar free mentos gum my daughter had on a top shelf in our dining room . \n\nApparently sugar free gum (Xylitol) is highly toxic to dogs . Vet asks how many were in the pack and I believe it was a 100 count of gum but it had been opened . \n\nShe immediately gets Karo syrup adds some to his IV and puts these pills in his eyes to make him vomit , and she told my wife to give our other dogs some peroxide just in case they got any .\n\nWithin 5 minutes he was out of the seizure , which come to find out was his blood sugar , his sugar was at a 38 when she tested it .\n\nFew minutes later he vomited 36 pieces of gum. We had to take him an hour away to stay at an over night vet , pick him up the next day and take him back to the vet to be monitored all day .\n\nWe left the next day with some liver medication he had to take for 9 days . Luckily the vet said it's all about timing with Xylitol and we caught it fairly quickly . I've banned it in my house now and told all dog owners I come into contact about it as it's apparently 100 times more toxic to dogs than chocolate and one piece can kill a dog . I apologize for the long read but just wanted to get the word out . Xylitol is in a lot of things and if your pits are like mine they will get ahold of anything .\n\nI have no idea how they got it I don't know if they were playing and knocked it off or if it fell or even if he jumped up and got it.  As for Duke he made a full recovery with no issues but it was just luck really that I was home when it had just happened .\n\nPlease tell anybody you know that has dogs, the ingredient in a lot of \"sugar free\" products is Xylitol and to take caution to keep it away from dogs . This incident cost me a hefty sum but anything for my dogs. The thing is I've told everyone I know that has dogs and no one has known about this before I told them . Be careful folks .\n\nEdit : Forgot to mention that the vet also recommended we keep Karo syrup on hand just the clear kind . It was the same they put in an IV to get his sugar back up . It's by no means going to save your dog on it's own but if you find your dog in the condition mine was in or they ingest a small amount rubbing the syrup on their gums may keep their blood sugar high enough until you can get them treated . Since Xylitol makes the dogs sugar drop in recovery if the sugar drops then the syrup can keep them from going into shock like my Duke did .",

    "body": "Hi all, I've put this off for too long but I'd like to help anyone I can to save their teeth. I spent a decade in restaurants before going back to school to become a dental hygienist. I work in public health, in a community health center and many of my patients are restaurant workers. \n\nI've combined my experience in the kitchen with my training & experience to target specific risk factors you should look out for. Please be aware, the nature of kitchen/restaurant work places you at far higher risk for dental disease than most other occupations. This, coupled with the fact that people are rarely provided any sort of benefits or even decent pay to see a dentist regularly, means you will always have an uphill battle here. \n\nThere is little you can do to prevent dental disease in this industry, but hopefully if you follow my advice, you can drastically reduce your risk by being aware of your habits. In order to so, you have to understand what dental disease actually is. \n\nDecay and Cavities\n\n* Your teeth are living crystals, with the outermost layer known as enamel which is non-vital, the bulk of the tooth dentin which is more organic, and the pulp which is fully vital nerves. They're formed by cells from the outer surface > inwards. These cells then die. There is absolutely no way to regenerate enamel, once it is gone it's gone forever. Dentin closer to the pulp has a very limited capacity to regenerate. If anything happens to the pulp, the tooth is not salvageable, necessitating a root canal or extraction.\n* Decay is the process that leads to cavities. Our mouth is full of bacteria, they're part of us, and there's no getting rid of it. With good hygiene and good dietary habits, it's relatively well controlled. When you consume almost ANY sugar/carbohydrates, the bacteria in your mouth use this as energy to proliferate and spread. The waste product is acid. This acid breaks down the outermost layer of your teeth, whether that be enamel or dentin, causing a demineralized state. This state lasts for up to 45 minutes PER exposure before your teeth surfaces begin to remineralize from the minerals present in your saliva. This is a normal process and it only becomes a problem when the demineralized periods exceed the resting periods and your saliva can't keep up with the acid attacks. Cavities happen when decay breaks down structure to the point that it can't be remineralized any longer and you have actual holes in your teeth. This is a rapidly progressing disease once it gets to this point, eventually making it's way to the pulp if unaddressed. You will not always feel pain from this, even in a late stage, so it can often go unnoticed for years. Some are more susceptible to pain/sensitivity, but everyone is different. \n\nGingivitis and Periodontitis\n\n* They are both different stages of gum disease. Gingivitis is basic inflammation of the gums that hasn't progressed to permanent damage. Gingivitis is your body's immune response to excessive/aggressive bacteria around your gums, producing bleeding/heat/pain/swelling. There are varying degrees to this, from mild & painless, to excessively profuse pain/bleeding/swelling. Periodontitis is what happens when gingivitis progresses to a point where your body responds to the irritating factors by destroying the bone/ligaments that hold your teeth in place. This is usually a slow process but certain cases can progress rapidly under the right conditions. This is the #1 reason that people lose their teeth completely. Poor hygiene is the primary cause for this, but other factors that are important are stress, both physical and mental, genetics (though not how you might think), etc. \n\nBruxism/Grinding.\n\n* This deserves special mention as it is especially stress induced. Teeth clenching/grinding can/will wear out your teeth with symptoms that often extend beyond the mouth, affecting your temperomandibular joint (TMJ), resulting in temperomandibular disease (TMD) in more severe cases.\n\nWhy are restaurant workers more susceptible to disease than others?\n\n* Every position in a restaurant has heightened risk due to their normal duties. Front of the house and management is no exception, everyone must practice heightened prevention measures.\n\n* Tasting. Tasting is the biggest culprit/cause of cavities and it's practically unavoidable. Every time you taste something that has even a modicum of fermentable carbs/sugars, it instantly feeds the bacteria in your entire mouth. This is unavoidable. That little spoonful of tasting a sauce, a piece of something, etc. kickstarts that 45 minutes demineralization cycle. Every single time. Most cooks are going to be tasting throughout their entire shift meaning that the acid cycle **NEVER STOPS**. This applies to a lesser, but still significant extent to servers/runners. But it also applies heavily to bartenders that are always tasting drinks that are full of sugar/liquor. There's almost no way to avoid this while still being able to do your job.\n\n* Drinks. Try to only drink water when you're working on the line, or running plates, on the bar, etc. If you must drink something like a soda, try to only drink diet so that you don't have sugar that'll feed the bacteria in your mouth. **NEVER, EVER, EVER PUT LEMON/LIME/ANY CITRUS IN YOUR WATER.** This turns the entire drink into an acid bath and it WILL erode your teeth causing permanent damage over time.\n\n* Stress is something we all experience in the kitchen, and I argue that it's far higher than many other occupations because it's both mental and physical. Physical stress is multifaceted. Being in a hot kitchen for 12 hours with little time to actually sit and eat, so all you do is pick/snack. Stress when countless tickets are firing and you're rushing through everything, you clench your teeth, your body is in a rush, etc. This stress increases inflammation reactions in your body. Gum disease becomes worse. Stress from getting home tired. Not getting enough sleep. Not making enough money. All of this is a burden on your body and weakens your immune system. Gingivitis/periodontitis respond and become worse rapidly with stress.\n\n* Time. When you're working doubles, two jobs, doing everything you can to stay afloat, one thing you just don't have the luxury of is free time. Time to relax is important. Time to go see the dentist is scarce when your shifts overlap with normal office hours, if you can even afford to go. What little time you have is spent so hard on recuperation that sometimes you don't even have the willpower/energy to take care of yourself properly.\n\n* Coverage. Those blessed few workers who have insurance, likely have awful insurance that may not even cover dental. But the true joke is that dental insurance is barely adequate for what you may need. Calling it insurance is practically a lie, it's more of a discount program that often pigeonholes you into just a few clinics that accept it.\n\nSo what can you do?\n\n* Basic homecare is something that we can all do, you just have to find the time and energy to doing so. You have to make yourself do it. Not doing so will cost you far more than anything else. \n\n* Brushing. [Watch this video for proper brushing technique.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm9c5HAUBpY) It's so simple and yet, so simple to get wrong with the wrong angle. One thing this video fails to mention and nobody ever seems to know is that when you're brushing your upper molars, the side facing your cheeks, you must keep your mouth mostly closed. The wider you open, the more that your cheeks will become taut and actually block your brush from reaching the furthest areas. This is one of the most common spots missed. Use a soft toothbrush. If you can afford an electric toothbrush, get one. I don't care how good of a brusher you think you are, it's always better. [This is an excellent brush that isn't too expensive. There isn't very much special about pricier brushes.](https://www.amazon.com/Oral-B-1000-Rechargeable-Electric-Toothbrush/dp/B003UKM9CO/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?keywords=oral+b+professional&qid=1579563702&sr=8-2-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExWFVaRkFWNjZWMyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRJZD1BMDM4NjUxNzFPTUtTMlI5RkxZTVUmZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDUwMTQ1NDFERVdHRkVPWlczSUImd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl) \n\n* Cleaning in between your teeth is not exclusive to floss. In fact, I rarely recommend floss anymore unless I'm confident that the person can do it properly and is willing to do so. It's very technique sensitive, and I would say most people hate to do so. There are lots of options, many of which are just as good as if not better than floss. My two most common recommendations are [interdental brushes](https://www.amazon.com/Interdental-Toothpick-Flossing-Hygiene-Cleaning/dp/B074M3Y38N/ref=sr_1_6?crid=2Y8G0WWYMUBRF&keywords=interdental+brush&qid=1579564036&sprefix=interdental+b%2Caps%2C143&sr=8-6) and [GUM softpicks](https://www.amazon.com/Soft-Picks-Dental-Picks-Advanced-Count/dp/B06ZZYMXMW/ref=sr_1_3_sspa?crid=MW8B7821TWSC&keywords=gum+soft+picks&qid=1579564104&sprefix=gum+soft+picks%2Caps%2C140&sr=8-3-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyTE9HOFdHUlpSTlRDJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMjgxNTM3TzhJM0o1MVkwMUk1JmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAxNjk1MzcxVEdER0ZDMUpLQVFMJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==). Both of these are reusable until they warp/break. I often recommend that you separate brushing and using these or flossing. Keep these, or floss, where you relax at home. If you're on the couch watching TV, keep it right there. If you're on a computer, keep it on your desk. You don't have to brush and get in between your teeth at the same time, so long as you actually do it. If you keep it where you're relaxing, you're more likely to do it and less likely to rush through it. Waterpiks are also a decent option, but people tend to stop using them eventually and they collect dust under a sink. They do work though.\n\n* Toothpaste. Always, always, always use a fluoride toothpaste. Anything negative you've heard about fluoride is likely misrepresented, grossly exaggerated, or an outright lie. There is NO reason not to use a fluoride toothpaste, absolutely none. I won't entertain any troll/conspiracy comments about it either, so please do not attempt to spread misinformation. The way fluoride works is it strengthens the outermost layer of your teeth and makes it more resistant to acid. This is the single most important thing next to proper hygiene to prevent dental disease. Fluoride toothpaste alone reduces your risk of getting cavities by about 35%. You need every bit of help as a kitchen worker, so don't set yourself up for regret by using some kind of alternative, they DO NOT work. Most fluoride pastes are basically the same, so don't fall for marketing hype. If your teeth are sensitive, use a toothpaste that says sensitivity on it. These have a ramp-up of two weeks and you must stick with it, or the effects wear off after two weeks. Don't get sensodyne, it's overhyped garbage. Arm & Hammer sensitive is the best deal. \n\n* Mouthwash on it's own will do nothing for you if you're not brushing & getting in between correctly. For the most part, all it does is keep bacteria less populous, temporarily. However! A good fluoride mouthwash can be your best friend as a cook. It's something you can do quickly, you can even keep a tiny bottle in your pocket and rinse with it periodically throughout your shift without stopping what you're doing and spit it into the garbage. This does have the unfortunate side effect of taste alteration. Most toothpaste and mouthwashes contain sodium lauryl sulfate, which blocks sweet flavor reception on your tongue. This can be a big deal, and it lasts for about half an hour or so after rinsing, so do so with caution. (This mouthwash is a bit pricey at about $10 per bottle, but it will neutralize acid, remineralize your teeth, and it won't alter your taste perception so it's probably the best option.)[https://www.amazon.com/CloSYS-Silver-2-Count-Fluoride-Mouthwash/dp/B01M347XMA/ref=sr_1_1?gclid=Cj0KCQiAvJXxBRCeARIsAMSkAprJPvFxrCbKpqYwHRDAQdDLJMwpU_Xjl4kmSg-amPmfXpKSwlHK06MaAjTEEALw_wcB&hvadid=177572987460&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9004333&hvnetw=g&hvpos=1t3&hvqmt=e&hvrand=4663112191069579555&hvtargid=aud-836690481282%3Akwd-280789591650&hydadcr=28226_10142495&keywords=closys+silver&qid=1579565311&sr=8-1]\n\n* Xylitol chewing gum or mints are another great thing you can have in your pocket to reduce risk throughout the day. You want to have at least 5 pieces per day, but it's usually good to have one after any tasting session, snack or meal is done. Any brand works so long as it's primarily sweetened with xylitol. This sugar kills the bacteria that causes cavities and the chewing/saliva flow will help clear out acids faster. If you're having too much of it right away, you might get the shits. Slow it down a bit and you'll get used to it in about a week with no further complications. \n\n* Coverage. Like I said earlier, few people have decent insurance, let alone dental insurance. That doesn't mean you shouldn't see the dentist. There are a number of great options for getting your dental needs taken care of that can be very cheap. There are clinics similar to mine are sponsored by federal government to provide affordable care to anyone in need. They're called Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers. You can go there if you're uninsured, on medicaid, etc. Some take limited private insurance. If you have uncovered services, you will be charged a fee according to a sliding income scale. In my clinic, uncovered services are free of charge if you make up to 110% of poverty level income, and scale upwards from there. There is no obligation to pay up front so you can always receive care. You can search for these clinics easily by looking up keywords like \"FQHC, community health center\" in your local area and find one that has a dental clinic. There are thousands throughout the country. Dental schools are considerably cheaper than private dental clinics. There is also the relative assurance that you are not being exploited or lied to about what you need, you can almost guarantee an unbiased assessment at a school. Dental hygiene schools are another option, you can get preventive treatment and xrays for very small sums of money. You can't however get restorative treatment like fillings/etc. there.  It's mostly for cleanings, gum disease treatment, education and referrals.\n\nIn conclusion, while you might be at a very high risk, much of these factors can be somewhat controlled with some conscious effort. Spend that little bit of extra money to save you more down the line, invest in yourself early. No job is worth sacrificing your health for, so don't feel an obligation to put the kitchen before your own health and sanity.",

        "body": "Good read.  A few thoughts from a non-dentist/non-chef I'd like to add for your consideration and potential revision though:\n\n1. Manual vs Electric Toothbrush:  The health of my teeth went way up when I made this switch, but it also resulted in gum recession for a half dozen teeth.  Obviously, this comes down to technique.  Since you recommend an electric toothbrush, I'd strongly encourage your giving a video technique that corresponds to that, as opposed to a manual toothbrush technique.  Understanding the right level of pressure is non-intuitive for those uneducated in the manner, as I had been.  At the very least, adding a line that aggressive brushing can cause gum recessions, leading to potential surgery, is certainly worth pointing out.  As for the manual toothbrushes, mentioning getting a \"soft\" one replaced every 3 months would be good, too.\n2. Mouthwash:  You may wish to add a couple sentences on non-alcohol being preferable, as well as notating the added value of acidulated phosphate (e.g. sodium/disodium phosphate), which aids in the reuptake of fluoride into the enamel.  Without other changes, adopting ACT rinse on its own actually showed an improvement in my X-Rays, due to enhanced fluoride mineralization, meaning my fluoride toothpaste wasn't quite cutting it, even though I'm not a snacker (i.e. 2-4 meals a day)!  (possibly because I drink almost exclusively bottled from a region that doesn't add fluoride)  To be clear, I'm not claiming to have uncovered some holy grail of re-building enamel; I'm merely stating this had a significant enough of an impact in my personal fluoride exposure/aborsption to actually be observable by my dentist via X-Rays (I'd been getting X-rays annually for years with this dentist and out of the blue asked how I improved my teeth, before she even took a look in my mouth)\n3. Waterpik:  Don't knock it so quickly!  I've tried floss, interdental brushes, and gum soft picks.  None of them worked for me, due to poor compliance on my part.  Once I discovered waterpiks I became a changed man!  3 years strong and the only days I've ever missed was when I was on vacation and didn't pack it!  Part of the reason I also find this habit easier to form is I put a cap-full of ACT rinse into my waterpik and use it before heading into work (so no risk of my eating and having altered taste buds).  That said, I agree with you, waterpiks wouldn't be the first thing I recommend to others, nor traditional floss.  Those with \"permanent\" retainers will also much prefer waterpiks, btw.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuestion:  Why do you state sensodyne is garbage and instead recommend Arm and Hammer for sensitivity toothpaste?  I recently posted in this subreddit asking about this, so am very curious as to your thoughts!",

Her limping has been breaking our heart and we're eager to get moving on fixing it, although nervous for the healing and the expense process. We want her back to normal, though, so... whatever it takes.\n\nShe does the chill protocol prior to big vet visits due to her fearfulness. For those unfamiliar, the chill protocol is a mix of Gabapentin, Melatonin, and some other mild tranquilizer I believe, that you do in the hours leading up to the appointment -- 2 gabapentins at night, 2 more in the morning, followed by the melatonin. Regular human melatonin is (USUALLY, I've just learned) fine for dogs -- you don't need to go out to the pet store and buy a dog version. \n\nI myself take melatonin often due to sleep issues. My husband does not. He's the one who has been administering the meds, and he's done the chill protocol before with her, using my melatonin. Normally I take the standard 5mg NatureMade brand of melatonin. However, the store was out last time, so I ended up buying a different one -- Natrol 5mg melatonin pills, with a (pretty gross, might I add) strawberry flavoring.\n\nSo my husband is getting her pills lined up in the kitchen and I had, thankfully, chosen to work at the kitchen counter today rather than my office. So I saw my bottle of melatonin out.\n\n\"Wait -- you're giving her that?\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's the 5mg she always gets.\"\n\n\"No it's not. That's new for me. Let me see it.\" I remembered that it had a sweetener in it.\n\nFlip the bottle and lo and behold, first Other listed ingredient: Xylitol.\n\nShe's 50 lbs, so maybe she would have been totally fine. Or maybe not. Either way, it's scary to think she almost received something that a quick google would say \"yep that's safe for dogs,\" when you actually REALLY need to read the label. So just a reminder: read labels. Double check ingredients. Xylitol is in a ton of things and it can be absolutely deadly.",

My dog Aegon got into the kitchen and onto the counter last night and got a full bottle of chewable B vitamins and ate 50 of them. They were full of xylitol. My partner saw him puking a short time later and the pills were in the vomit so he rushed him to the ER. Xylitol can cause hypoglycemia (more easily treatable at the vet) and also liver failure (not so easily treatable). We are waiting for his bloodwork to see how his liver is doing. I‚Äôm so mad at myself for bringing those pills into my house but I didn‚Äôt even check to see if they had xylitol. Anyway, if you have a dog don‚Äôt have anything with xylitol in it. The vet said a Pomeranian died there last week from one stick of gum. A massive lab died from one cookie made with it. It‚Äôs not like chocolate, there is no ‚Äúoh he only ate a little, he will be fine‚Äù with xylitol. If your dog gets into it, take him to the ER as soon as possible. ",

    "body": "üôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Skin background:**\n\n\nDry, sensitive skin. Acne, fungal acne and eczema prone. Easily congested.\nI have PIE and redness, but I don't have much dark spots or discoloration (aside from what's left behind after eczema flared ups) \n\nAlso I live in a dry, hot climate where the sun is really harsh.\n\n\nüìà **About the charts (slide 2 and 3)**:\n\n\n0 means least of the \"title\" and 5 means most of the \"title\"; like \"thickness\" is rated 1 means it's not a thick toner, and is really watery.\n\n\nüß¥ **Coming to the product:**\n\n\n- Name: Skin1004 madagascar centella tone brightening boosting toner.\n\n- Period of usage: 1 month\n\n\n- I use it in the morning in this routine:\nCleanse (Benzoyl peroxide cleanser) > Toner 1 (isntree green tea fresh toner) > Toner 2 (this skin1004 toner) > Moisturise > Sunscreen\n\n\n> Ingredients: Centella Asiatica Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Propanediol, Betaine, Allantoin, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Prunus Mume Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Fruit Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Water, Glucose, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n- Fungal acne safe: YES ‚úÖ\n\n\nüí≠ **My thoughts:**\n\n\nWhen I first saw the product the ingredients list looked promising, but i couldn't find much on reddit about it. I use skinsort a lot though (it's an app where you can check whether a product is fungal acne safe or not) and I looked up this product there and the reviews were really good so I ended up ordering it!\n\n\nThis did not disappoint! I think you can get a fair idea of how I feel about the products through the charts that I have attached, but it's really good and it suits my skin well. It's hydrating, soothing, quick absorbing and it works. Also, it mildly exfoliates the skin but it's not too much and in my opinion it's safe for everyday use! \n\n\nI have used skin1004's tone brightening ampoule too, and I like it but I like this toner WAY more than that ampoule, and in my opinion it works better than the ampoule. Plus if you look up the ampoule on reddit many people have said it broke them out, and I suspect the ampoule was breaking me out too, but I didn't have any such issue with this toner.\n\n\nOverall, I would rate it 4.5/5, will keep repurchasing it. Also, i can tell this will last a while because I have been using it almost everyday, and I layer it twice, but I've only used up the amount you see in the picture so üëÄ\n",

    "body": "I think it's safe to post this; I've been SIBO clear for about a year and a half. \n\n## Pre text (can be skipped)\n\nBefore that I had complications that spanned around 10 years; I've been a poster here for just under that. In that time I've been exceptionally confused; seen 4 'top gastroenterologists' and 2 renown dieticians as well as countless other doctors. I've tried all main orthodox treatments of SIBO including; rifaximin, herbals, elemental diets, carnivore, fasting and probiotics. I've been considered to have had Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Fibromyalgia, Major depressive disorder among other things. I've 100% considered taking my life many many times, some out of despair and knee-jerk, many others while sober calculative and rational. \n\nIn short; I've been through what I believe to be (having been here for a while) the absolute worst SIBO can throw at someone. I've had the 'full' SIBO experience. And now I'm on the other side. My ENTIRE life has been absolutely governed by these health issues and it has taken my best years. Anyway enough dramatics - I just wanted to paint the picture of the severity of my issues with it so that I may offer those who'm have had the worst of SIBO some hope.\n\nJust to be clear; I have no concrete answers (and would challenge anyone who claims to) but I have an anecdotal 'pseudo-informed' explanation of my fall into SIBO and eventually climb out of it. I've taken special effort to highlight genuine significant tips that are likely to help others.\n\n## Context\n\nDuring many breath tests that spanned 6+ years I had mostly hydrogen positive results but also had 1 methane positive result. \n\n## How I got SIBO\n\nThis is disputed and no medical professional has given me an explanation. However I have a high confidence that I got SIBO during taking prolonged antibiotics whilst backpacking. I was prescribed Doxycycline as an anti-malaria pill to take before during or after my trips. I did 3 stints of 1 month trips in the space of 3 years and that's when my symptoms started. Additionally; it's very possible that I had food poisoning on one of the trips. So; main likely-hood is that I got SIBO from either *food poisoning* or extended *exposure to antibiotics*. I would now categorise it as 'irresponsible exposure to antibiotics' from negligent medical professionals who wiped out my gut flora.\n\n## Symptoms diagnosis and tests\n\nSkipping the storytelling rhetoric; the main facts are that I saw about 5 doctors who'm all I would describe as hugely uninformed on intestinal issues; all of them concentrated on my symptom relief and none of them had any concept of exploring a functional explanation. Two exceptions to this were Chrons and Coeliac disease. These were two worthwhile tests that were 'negative' on both a stool and stomach biopsy.\n\nAdditionally I had either myself or from a healthcare professional entertained about 5 or 6 other different diagnosis before SIBO was considered. That's obviously a huge time waste. \n\nMostly though; I found out about the fairytale concept of 'IBS'. Remember I'm just some idiot on the internet but controversially I don't think IBS exists and I think the term is used by doctors who have no idea what the issue is that they're being presented with. If a doctor ever used the term 'ibs' with me I would significantly reconsider the value I put on their expertise. \n\nMy second gastroenterologists eventually considered SIBO and I blew positive on a hydrogen breath test after consuming lactulose.\n\nOther tests I underwent were ultrasonics; MRI to check upper bowls, flexi sigmoidoscopy (large bowl colonoscopy), masses of stool and blood too. None of them have anything to note really. \n\n## Symptoms\n\nI will list my symptoms so that those of you with them can decide how much use my anecdotes on my journey to remission is. \n\n# Experienced mostly but not limited to roughly 1 hour after meals\n\n* Significant brain fog\n\n* Significant lethargy \n\n* Muscle weakness and strain predominantly in neck and shoulders\n\n* Bloating\n\n* Sudden onset of powerful depression/anxiety \n\n* Sugar cravings/desire to eat more/sense of not being full\n\n* Hot/uncomfortable \n\n# Experienced in general such as outside of meals\n\n* Constipation/diarrhea  \n\n* Continued fatigue/lethargy and muscle pain/strain/stiffness \n\n* Continued anxiety and depression\n\n* General discomfort usually accompanied by sense of being too hot \n\n* Spells of night-sweating \n\n# Experienced at some point but not long standing over the years\n\n* Overwhelming spells of panic attacks or adrenal crashes\n\n* Constant muscle stiffness \n\n* Spells of muscle pain or lymphatic pain in shoulder/neck region that lasted days\n\n* Noticeable sense of dread or mortality and general dissociation \n\n**Let it be duly noted I consider the majority of these symptoms to be associated with food sensitivities** or other 'knock on' illness from SIBO in the body and not necessarily direct SIBO symptoms. \n\nAlso of significant note; I very rarely ever had any pain in my stomach. There was a time I considered if my shoulder/neck pain was 'referred pain' but that's extremely speculative. \n\n## Related illnesses\n\nI consider SIBO to be the tree trunk in a wider map for those who'm have become chronically ill from it. To continue the analogy there's many branches of second-hand illnesses caused by the SIBO and those branches have their own symptoms but also have their own branches of related illness. \n\nI strongly believe this is why so many of us have such specific individual symptoms and cures. I would like you to consider; if you listed all your symptoms; that many of them are symptoms from secondary or tertiary illness and not all from SIBO. \n\nAt this point another significant note is **I continued to feel extremely bad symptoms whilst being clear from SIBO**. That is to say; I would be negative for SIBO on a breath test and then hours/minutes/days later I would feel symptoms and even be more symptomatic. \n\nAnother significant note is that **secondary/tertiary illnesses from SIBO likely contributed to getting reoccurring SIBO again**. To be clear; I believe it can be as it was with me that some of the related illnesses can make you get a bacterial overgrowth again.\n\nThis explains my and many others 'chicken and egg' cycle of reoccurring SIBO. It can also explain why no single cure works for everyone. \n\nHere is the list of related illnesses I had at one time or other from SIBO. \n\n* Intestinal permeability \n\n* Chronically slow motility\n\n* Multiple food intolerance \n\n* (I didn't get it, but SIFO is a popular one) \n\n* Gluten sensitivity \n\n* CHS (chronic fatigue syndrome) \n\n* Gut Dysbiosis  \n\n* Vagus nerve dysfunction \n\n* Adrenal fatigue \n\n* Autistic behaviour and ADHD spells \n\n* Nutritional deficiencies \n\n\n## Functional timeline; Tree of Weeds\n\nThis section is my best guess at what functional illnesses I had which best described by symptoms during the long journey of illness. With explanations to how they relate and in the next section - how I identified/managed and attempted to cure them. \n\n1. I believe I got SIBO from either antibiotic abuse or food poisoning. Side-note: *I earnestly believe that normal people sometimes get a SIBO issue but find it goes away naturally and they never knew any better. More technology and information with products like food-marble and other shit will probably dis/prove my hypothesis. But I also earnestly believe if I had known about SIBO and treated it with rifaximin with responsible diet and re-introduction of gut flora I could have lived a drastically different life and that would have been the end of it.*\n\n2. With a SIBOvergrowth I believe due to a compounding bad diet of high fodmaps and sugar it blew into a bad case. \n\n3. I believe that at this stage I started to damage the integrity of my intestinal wall.\n\n4. With a damaged intestinal wall I believe food and/or toxins fed through into my body and an allergenic or immune response took place. This is referred to as Leaky Gut or Intestinal Permeability. This is where I believe I got multiple food intolerances.\n\n5. With further exposure to both fodmaps and sensitive foods I believe I started to onload a) *gut dysbiosis* b) *inflammation* c) *chronic stress* into my body\n\n**5a. Gut dysbiosis** This is a very controversial area to say anything with any surety about. In short; the stools harbour uncountable strains of various bacterias with nuanced balances and measurements. There's a fallacy that we eat stuff, digest it and absorb it. In reality we digest food into smaller bits we may absorb some of that but a great deal of it isn't and is absorbed by the bacteria and the bacteria in part feed or benefit us. \nThat is to say *when we eat; we feed the bacteria in our gut and our bacteria then feeds us*. \nGut dysbiosis I believe is a wide open gateway to general chronic health issues. The reason I believe that is the jobs these bacteria are doing are so essential to modern day humans and modern diets that without them we can be reduced to slithers of normality with links to autism, attention disorders, mental health and performance as well as general regulation of nutritional nourishment that plays vital roles in providing VITAL bodily mechanisms such as enzymes with the co-enzyme ingredients to undertake fundamental bodily processes. \n\nIn simple terms; with gut dysbiosis one can quickly evolve nutritional deficiencies which no longer provide key bodily processes the ability to do their jobs. One example is; magnesium, zinc and b vitamins are known to be heavily reliant on intestinal health in order to absorb into the body. Without those key nutrients mental performance can nose dive, mental health too and basic detoxification that your body relies on for things like air-polution and food exposure to toxins. Additionally Gut dysbiosis can lead to low/absent levels of KEY bacteria that is solely relied on to break down food matter. For example; most vegetables have novel defence mechanisms to stop predators eating/digesting them. One such mechanism is **'Oxalates'** which are razor sharp crystals that harm insects mouths and tear soft matter apart. Our intestines have bacteria which stops this happening but in my case I had dangerously low levels of it and had oxalate build up issues. Gut dysbiosis is so harmful that one could do a series of posts on it so I'll stop here. IT'S BAD. \n\n**5b. Inflammation** due to exposure to all kinds of toxins or food matter that you wouldn't usually be and in the amounts you usually wouldn't be; as well as general dysbiosis and the inability to safely absorb food matter that's anti-inflammatory.. You can find yourself with chronic inflammation. \nThis is incredibly nuanced and specific to the individual. But one thing medical professionals do agree on is that chronic inflammation can be and is the cause for many chronic illnesses. If you have prolonged inflammation you are opening the door for the majority of illness or disease. In my case I found that it would cause me joint pain and ache and/or nerve pain. A clinical psychologist also evaluated me over 6 months and was genuinely considering inflammation in my brain as the main mechanism for my sudden major depressive disorder symptoms.\n\n**5c. Chronic Stress** sorry but I need to give a personal anecdote here. Before I was ill I was a young professional who'm ran marathons, went backpacking, climbed my profession quickly and read quantum physics books, had 15+ hobbies in sports, art and academia. I meditated regularly, created websites threw myself into any challenge and usually always exceeded in it. I was no special person or gifted individual specifically but I had an energy and drive to go after all my various interests and disciplines with an energy that saw me generally thrive as a person. A part from a healthy dose of of emotions and self therapy I did all of this with minimal overhead and even coasted in many areas. The reason I boast all this is that 'stress' wasn't a problem. Yeah I felt stress but I was also so good at self therapy intuitively and had such good emotional intelligence that I had healthy and effective coping mechanisms for stress. Life was a cake walk. \nI now know that Chronic Stress isn't just subjectively 'how we feel' but it's also a functional aspect of the body too. This is all relevant to SIBO because when your body is doing stuff like detox, immune responses to food sensitivities, digesting, healing or dealing with dysbiosis etc. All of these things put functional stress on the body. During this you may feel fine but your body is in overload mode. \nOne of the things that the body does related to stress is the nervous system. Without going into detail I'd basterdise anyway; our body induces stress and reduces stress, on purpose using functional mechanisms such as the adrenal gland and thyroid among others. For these systems to work; nutrition is required, for example adaptogens are useful for the adrenal gland as well as b vitamins and probably other core vitamin/minerals and iodine and other stuff is used by the thyroid. Obviously; without proper access to those ingredients as can be the case with SIBO or dysbiosis, those systems aren't in good shape. Additionally; whilst having those systems in place; it's still possible to overwhelm them and that can be the case especially with the adrenal gland. \n\nNow I'm writing so much text here so I'm going to skip over the thyroid but it's one of the most known and checked organs by doctors when you present with fatigue or energy issues so I don't feel I need to deep dive further than your own google search. But Adrenal Fatigue is a much more controversial concept and with a much more tenuous link to SIBO that I will focus on that. SIBO and dysbiosis and intestinal permeability (leaky gut) ALL out the body under significant stress. Personally I had periods where I had genuine car-crash powerful adrenal crashes and attacks. You can google those terms but the chances are if you've ever felt wounded and beaten and exasperated and mortally concerned with a state of experience you're in, you've had adrenal issues. Adrenal issues can be managed with adaptogens and making sure you manage nutritional deficiencies. I only want to advertise the concept here because I genuinely believe it could make someone with SIBO feel isolated and tempted to kill themselves. Please look into it if this rings any truth with you and get help.\n\n5c. .. Chronic Stress **Continued** there's two major nervous systems that are important for motility and stress. *The sympathetic system* controls ‚Äúfight-or-flight‚Äù responses. This turns us into a 'full power mode' that provides short term higher ability but at a cost. The parasympathetic system regulates ‚Äúrest and digest‚Äù functions, again at a trade-off that we're more relaxed and sedative. The hot take here is that **prolonged adrenal issues compounds motility issues**. Sibo causes bodily stress, bodily stress slows motility, gut issues get worse, more stress is added. Sound familiar? \n\n6. Going back to my tree analogy you can see now that from chronic stress, intestinal permeability (leaky gut), inflammation, and gut dysbiosis ... I now had various thick branches on the tree that themselves had their own symptoms and smaller branches. All in the tree of dis-ease. Some of these branches became cyclic and the point I want to make here is that I believe even if I was treating SIBO whether it be rifaximin, prolongued low fodmap diet, herbals or whatever. I would easily create another overgrowth and the entire time my feedback loop of 'treating sibo, ok now I should *feel better*, but I don't' was out of whack. This confused me and also my doctors. How can I blow a clear breath test and still feel very very unwell? It was because of the other branches. \n\n7. Detoxing and Sibo. Sibo just creates a lot of load on detox pathways in the body. Even a normal person eating a normal diet will be using their detox pathways to remove bits of bacteria or toxins from normal food drink and air. When you have SIBO, your food, overgrowth and diet will be creating toxins. Those toxins will more easily enter your system through compromised gut walls and cause an overload to your detox pathways. In addition, in the case of dysbiosis, different strains of bacteria are dying and releasing further toxins. And lastly as the overgrowth dies (normal bodily functions such as bile, motility etc kill SIBO cells as well as any antibiotics or herbals) those bacterias when dying will release up to 72 different toxins. \n\n[There's two major detox pathways Phase I and Phase II](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59497143b8a79b44531a340f/1498691478811-SFU0IY1CUA117VAKHUXI/image-asset.jpeg). These are bodily functions that, like other functions can be overloaded but also require nutritional ingredients to fuel their enzymic actions. So, b12/folate which is normally low in SIBO people as well as sulphur which is low (provided you don't have hydrogen-sulphur SIBO or not). Additionally, a lot of people have natural genetic inefficiencies that affect their phase I/II detoxification which otherwise wouldn't be such a huge problem - but having SIBO can exasperate. I already feel like I'm dishing out an irresponsible amount of pseudo-science so won't go into detail but things to check are MTHFR, sulphur-pathways and 'active-b12'. Detoxing and SIBO go hand in hand and it's essential that you have a healthy detox pathway. \n\n8. Nutritional deficiencies can and will pop up with low fodmap diets and gut dysbiosis in general. At this point it's possible that you're lacking pivotal nutritional vitamins or minerals. As sporadically referenced these can cause further issues. In general the things to watch for are Zinc, Magnesium, active b vitamins, D3, K2, E, molybdenum. \n\n## Functional Timeline; Cutting the tree\n\nIf you're one of the individuals who's got themselves a toxic tree formed, there is a way out. The overwhelmingly annoying thing is; it will take time and energy and it will require you to formally commit to tackling it. When it comes to complex reoccurring SIBO for over 5+ years you can't half-ass the way out. The good thing is, if you're in a dire situation as I was, you wont be lacking for motivation. Energy and time (and cost) though can be hard to come by. Taking one step at a time can help you and doing a little bit for each tree can too. I will try now to provide you with tools, tricks and outright solutions that I employed to functionally get myself in a better place and I 100% have done that to a significant measure. So there's hope.\n\n# Diet is ABSOLUTELY key. \n\nThe main problem with diets I fell into, it I would try one at a time and not feel any real benefit. It was only after I was informed of most of them and painstakingly tried various things did I find out that in the end I could take facets from different diets and in addition, use them at the right time. \n\nThe obvious strategy on going 'low fodmap' is the least controversial diet tool. But, despite that is still very controversial. Long term low fodmap diets are bad for you and can result in gut imbalances. Additionally, Mayo Clinic, one of the top formal bodies in SIBO advise not to make diet changes because it can *\"result in a situation where a patient has avoided most foods and will have trouble adding them back in\"* I personally disagree. I believe short term dietary changes can be used to great affect and in some cases the alternative isn't possible. Who you going to believe, a world renowned health body or an internet stranger?\n\nEither way having a low fodmap diet will result in symptom relief yes. But relying on it; or lazily using it while you \"hope SIBO will clear\" isn't going to be useful for you long term. I strongly suggest you treat FODMAPs like a wave in the sea. Stand on the beach with no FODMAP exposure to get a 'baseline understanding' of your symptoms and if there's any relief. It's also a good tool to prevent rampant overgrowths. *Then* while curing SIBO whether it's Rifaximin/Neomycin or herbals.. try to incorporate FODMAPs by wading into the water a little bit and seeing how it feels and then wading in farther in/out depending on the type of FODMAP and all the while paying acute attention to your symptoms. \n\nHowever **low fodmap is NOT the only dietary tool, not by a long shot**. As well as fodmaps directly fuelling fermentation there's some key natural food chemicals that make up our food. Understanding these groups is **fundamental to anyone with food sensitivity issues or chronic illness**. This single paragraph I think it's the powerful paragraph that SIBO practitioners and patients need to read. There are 3 main food chemicals that your body can form sensitivities to through large exposure of which is typical with intestinal permeability. **Salicylates, Amines and Glutamates**. If you have chronic symptoms of SIBO or have had it for a long time, or have reoccurring SIBO or are symptomatic after SIBO or find low fodmap diets don't help... You are likely sensitive to one or more of these groups. If you're in the worst step and are sensitive to them all; which I think is unlikely, a carnivore diet for a few days to find a baseline and then introducing one at a time is useful. But if you're in that situation I honestly think you need help from a knowledgeable dietician. [Google each one](https://alessandraedwards.com/foods-high-in-salicylates-amines-and-glutamates/), find the foods that each one has and you will likely find that you'll notice the one the you have most problems with. The best way is to research one at a time and find the food list associated with each. Just going through salicylates made me realise that was the chemical I had a problem with. It's likely that just removing that one food chemical from your diet can as of tomorrow significantly improve your life. Food sensitivities I believe are rampant explanations for many syndromes, chronic illnesses or other unknown issues that no one has thought to link. Following a 'specific carbohydrate diet' with special attention to the 3 food chemicals and using 'carnivore' or some other baseline diet is the best advice I can give here. As well as that, Elemental diets can permit these food groups so if you've done an elemental diet and still felt symptomatic that could be why. \n\nMany 'healthy foods' or SIBO tools are high in food chemicals (Salicylates, Amines and Glutamates). Bitters, turmeric, ginger, herbals are all high in different ones. The most safe over the counter pro-kinetic is magnesium citrate. \n\nIn my case, *the underlining reason I felt symptomatic and kept getting SIBO over and over was due to a sensitivity to one of these chemical groups. Removing it stopped my SIBO coming back, removed 70% of my symptoms and greatly increased the quality of my life.*\n\n# A GI Map was useful to me\n\nA GI Map is a detailed report into the different strains of bacterial. Mine allowed me to see specific strains and gave me vital information. It told me I had high Zonulin levels which is linked to intestinal permeability, it told me I had missing Butyric Acid creating strains, missing oxalate-killing strains and it generally gave me a targeted probiotic regiment. Now you'll find whether it's this subreddit, or the various other gut related ones, a room full of dieticians, doctors or even functional doctors. No one agrees on whether probiotics are good or bad for different things. I can say having extensively experimented with them that s.boulardi is the only safe one I tried and that depending on the strain I found specific use in specific ones and also found that too much would be bad. I wont give specifics but my GI map showed me that I had some strains missing, finding specific supplements for those strains helped. Whilst avoiding the 'full spectrum/complex' ones I was able to target specific strains and in that was I was able to do what I call do 'targeted responsible supplementation'. My functional road to recovery was so nuanced and messy it's hard to know whether doing this helped me or not. If I had to decide I would say it did help me but there was no smoking gun. With the exception of s.boulardii I think the only other simple strain that helped me as an individual who was lacking in it is lactobacillus longum. But soil based/spore based, reuteri, symprove, bio-kult none of these helped me significantly. \n\n\nIf you have the access, resources and time. A GI Map with a knowledgable dietician is probably going to help you. I didn't have that, I was able to self fund a GI Map and by supplements.\n\n# Chronic Stress and the Vagus nerve \n\nI personally had adrenal fatigue due to overwhelming stress on my body. I got out of it with light exercise, yoga, a cocktail of adaptogens and regular mindfulness. It was VERY annoying and boring. I had to cut out stressful or stimming activities (fast paced gaming) and I had to learn to breathe from my stomach and activate my diaphragm. I had to identify and habitually remove unconscious muscle tensing and stimming. I had to be very responsible with caffeine and I had to be patient. It was very time consuming and a commitment but I was in such a bad state that I simply had to do it. I ended up with a very useful set of simple tricks.\n\n1. [This video](https://youtu.be/zUx5kLFyx-M?t=430) pushing the belly button. \n\n2. Closing eyes and looking fully right \n\n3. Making sure I got high quality sleep by using magnesium glycinate\n\n4. Breathe out longer than I breathed in\n\nNumber 1 in particular but many of these things would audibly reward me with gastro activity. I could feel my parasympathetic nervous system telling my body to engage motility. \n\n# Supplements\n\nBecause herbals are full of food chemicals that one could either get too much exposure to or already is sensitive to, I can't earnestly recommend them to anyone who has even the faintest suspicion they have leaky-gut/intestinal permeability. Though, I tried them, all the best ones. I did multiple courses and none of them were as effective as Rifaximin for me. Though, I believe to someone who has light SIBO and is sure of no leaky gut they may be useful. But food sensitivities to chemicals happen when you overexpose your self to them with leaky gut (citation needed). So be careful with them.\n\nThese supplements have been essential to me;\n\n* s.boulardii\n\n* tributyrin and phosphatidylcholine  \n\n* vitamins (d3, k2, active-b-complex), high dose active thiamine TTFD\n\n* minerals (zinc picolinate), magnesium (malate for dietary, citrate for motility, glycinate for sleep, I used sporadically) \n\n* milk thistle, glutatione \n\n* Omega 3\n\nBut most of all by a significant stretch MSM (sulphur) (methysulfonlmethan/domethysuffon) \n\nThis changed my stools from soft to formed and improved my wellbeing. There's a huge caveat here that if you supplement sulphur you need to make sure you don't have hydrogen sulphate SIBO. MSM might be so useful to me because I have a salicylate sensitivity and sulphur is an ingredient that helps create the enzymes that break down that food chemical. \n\nS.Boulardii was well tolerated by my body even during the overgrowth. None of my gastroentogists advised against it as it's non-collonising. It supposedly helps dysbiosis, motility and intestinal permeability.\n\nThe vitamins are there to make sure I had enough because we don't get enough from out diet if we have dysbiosis and SIBO. Blood tests help inform me; in my case I needed active B supplements because I am 1/3 people who have a MTHFR mutation. Please visit the /r/MTHFR subreddit before private messaging me about it, or if you don't mind searching my history. B vitamins in particular are going to be super useful because you will lack energy and you're be under stress in your detox pathways as well as your liver. Active b vitamins are a great tool for these. \n\nZinc helps intestine health and leaky gut. \n\nThiamine TTFD can help symptoms of fatigue and is an important coenzyme for bodily processes that fight chronic illness.\n\nMSM has a wellness quality of life effect for people with chronic illnesses I don't know much about that other than supporting sulphur pathways is essential for detox. But I personally took MSM for theory I had that I was lacking in intestinal mucous and boy, as much as I could have hoped to be proven right, I was. I immediately noticed more formed stools and I have a lot of stools that passed without needing to wipe. I think there's a special connection to MSM for sibo people so I am interested in your anecdotes if you've tried it. I've not seen it once mentioned for SIBO on this sub or anywhere else. \n\nTributyrin was the best form of butyrate acid I found worked for me. For those that don't know, Butyrate is the holy grail of intestinal health and wellbeing. Unfortunately it's really hard to deliver it to your intestines intact, for that reason it's essential you find a good supplement I personally found Tributyrin 350 from Apex Energetics was good. However in theory if you have good intestinal flora those bacteria will generate the butyric acid for you. \n\nOmega 3 is one of the only anti-inflammatory supplements that I can tolerate with food sensitivities. \n\n## Tree cut summary\n\nPutting everything together then. I would have a course of rifaximin with s.boulardi then I would stay on a low fodmap diet. I would then take targeted probiotics based on my GI map but not vitally important. I would then be very open to any bodily changes or 'poisonings' and I would check the food chemicals and find out that I had a sensitivity. If I needed to return to a base, I would jump onto carnivore for 3 days to stop the potential fermentation before it got big. I would avoid the food chemical glutamine/amine or salicylate that triggered me and then only after a good period of good health look to SLOWLY introduce it. I avoided sugar but reintroduced later, I incorporated dietary fibre in bananas, safe vegetables and grains like sorghum or even PHHG to stay regular. I would only take magnesium citrate if I felt constipated. For me, all the branches became manageable once I starved them of the overgrowth *AND* food chemical I was sensitive to. Doing only one or the other didn't work, I needed to do both. This is how I've been SIBO clear for a year and a half. \n\n## Current state\n\nI was so bad with sibo and my chronic tree that even a year and a half later I am not healed. And I can tell that my situation is still precarious. But I am armed now with the previous paragraph where I can stop an overgrowth forming (or at leas that's how it feels) by slamming on the breaks, avoiding specific foods and keeping my motility up. Utilising the belly button pressing technique and staying healthy with exercise and eating as diverse a set of foods as I can with the options I have I am able to live a healthy life. My body is still healing and it's hard to sit here even with all the hard work and steps given to tell you that but the truth is; if you get yourself into the state I was in it just is that bad and will take time. \nThere's a plethora of bad habits and coping mechanisms that I used to get through the bad times and now it's hard to shake those. I feel like Red in Shawshank redemption where he's finding it's hard to integrate again with normal society having been in such a dark and controlled place. My quality of life is still low but it's absolutely much much better. For me the food chemicals and supplements knowledge was the smoking gun. Only with those was a Rifaximin course successful. Gut health has many facets, you can't fix only one you need a holistic approach. The problem is, the professionals helping you are specifically looking at once branch at a time. The missing link is you, or a guide like this one but written specifically for you. \n\n## TLDR\n\nCheck for sensitivities to salicylates amines and glutamates by checking the foods and seeing if your [list of trigger foods](https://alessandraedwards.com/foods-high-in-salicylates-amines-and-glutamates/) align to one of them. Assume Leaky Gut is real and supplement for it, check my supplement section. Poke your belly button 50 times deep enough you feel it hit a tender nerve, keep a mental food diary.\n\n## Takeaways \n\n* I consider the majority of symptoms to be associated with food sensitivities or other 'knock on' illness from SIBO in the body and not necessarily direct SIBO symptoms. \n\n* Secondary/tertiary illnesses from SIBO likely contributed to getting reoccurring SIBO again\n\n* Prolonged adrenal issues or stress from food sensitivities compounds motility issues and compromises intestinal walls. Food sensitivities linger after SIBO is treated and cause havok to the intestines making them prime for another overgrowth. It is ESSENTIAL to have high confidence you know you can safely include not just FODMAPS but other food chemicals in the next point.\n\n* Understanding if you have food sensitivities to [Amines](https://naturopathlife.com.au/education/nutrition-perth/amine-sensitivity/), [Glutamates](https://www.webmd.com/diet/high-glutamate-foods) or [Salicylates](https://www.dietvsdisease.org/salicylate-intolerance/). Go through the list of foods by clicking each one and seeing if you see trigger foods.\n\n* My additive safe list is Stevia, guar gum, phgg, very limited xanthan gum (especially in liquids), limited Aspartame\n\n* My additive avoid list is corn syrup, sorbitol, xylitol and erythritol.",

Also take creon because stool test also showed very low enzymes production. \nSo diagnosis is hydrogen sibo, very low enzymes, possible Lyme (some positive bands) , hoshimoto thyroid. \nSo do you think it was a mistake to stop the xifaxin and is it save to start it again?

I can't handle any stress and became recluse. It morphed to dizziness and burping. Which stopped when estrogen declined. I don't have the shoulder neck muscle tension since my 50s so hormones are part of this high unchecked estrogen. Use progesterone to offset high estrogen. High estrogen causes sluggish liver gallbladder and bile. My diet shrunk to raw organic plant foods and it seems to not cause the balloon air gut. I just learned from Biomesight that i have bilophilia wadsworthia oxalates and leaky gut so probably hydrogen sulfide sibo. Just want to mention people do a stratgene report. I found out I am PEMT ++ which means i need choline. Without enough choline your liver will not function and could be a big part of the problem.  So I take sunflower lecithin phosphatidlyl choline. Also check methylation folate and B12. My b12 always sky high not getting into the cells maybe.

This enzyme pathway you are talking about is called the Phenolsulfotransferase Enzyme Pathway or PST Enzyme Pathway for short. It‚Äôs a Phase 2 Detox Pathway. Where we metabolise Salicylates/Phenols/Sulfur along with other things. It has different stages, the part you mostly talk about is called ‚ÄúSulphation‚Äù. Where we turn our Sulfur into Sulfites then into Sulphate. It‚Äôs the Sulphate part that we end up lacking and it impacts our guts. We need enough Sulphate for our gut lining so we don‚Äôt get leaky gut and to make enough digestive enzymes.\n\nSounds like you didn‚Äôt have a problem in converting your sulfur to sulfites then to sulphate but maybe just needed a lot more sulfur using the MSM. For the ppl that have problems with sulfur intolerance symptoms and converting their sulfur into sulphate which may make you react to the MSM Epsom Salts are useful as it has a Sulphate component. I‚Äôm talking about bathing in it or putting your feet in a bucket of water with it, not digesting it. It'll give you diarrhoea. This can bypass the fault and deliver some Sulphate directly. This won‚Äôt work for everyone, some ppl are really sensitive. You start low and slow.\nYou need enough Sulphate to metabolise Salicylates and Phenols.\n\nAnyway great post, just thought I‚Äôd add some more light to it for ppls research purposes.",

    "body": "I have **combination skin with an oily T-zone and dry acne prone cheeks laden with PIH**, an aftermath of 2020 and some wrong skincare choices. Since I am acne prone, I try to avoid perfume/fragrance, alcohol and essential oils in my products. \n\n*Processing img thx4k3izjnf61...*\n\nI have tried a bunch of sunscreens and these are the **best ones** I have settled on after a long 2 years of trial and error and time/money/effort invested. I have tried to include the swatches of all the four sunscreens and the white cast whereever it was possible (suncros) for the camera to capture. Lets begin.\n\nProduct Name: **Suncros Soft Matte Finish Gel, SPF 50, PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rave\n\nAvailability in India: Easily Available in India, offline and online.\n\nIngredient list: Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nSunscreen type: Physical / Mineral \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3zgtf9w6knf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0796b78286edcc7126df7421f34ae34c3ae1c7c8\n\nExperience & opinion: I have been using this sunscreen since almost one year. I used to use UV Doux before this for as long as I can remember, but had to stop using it as my skin got really sensitive and I had damaged my skin barrier. \n\nYou definitely cannot use the recommended two fingers of sunscreen with this one as it gets really heavy and suffocating. I tried layering it in small amounts (maybe just one fingertip at a time), let that settle and then apply another fingertip. I could only do two fingertips with this one. It did work for my extremely sensitive skin at that time and miraculously it was even calming and healing for my active acne and the PIH post acne was really minimal. The texture is in between a cream and a gel as can be seen in the picture. I totally understand why people detest it so much, the heavy suffocating feeling is a put off. I am not going to lie, it is heavy, feels like a suffocating layer on your face and is uncomfortable but you get used to the feeling once you see that its actually working for your extremely sensitive skin when nothing else does. You have to properly blend it in, take a minute or two to actually spread it on the skin. I have tried to photograph the white cast this one gives immediately post application. but once it settles in 30 minutes or so, the white cast is almost negligible and gives a primer finish (I am NC 43-45 for reference). I don't use makeup so I don't know how it would perform under makeup. The reapplication is difficult. I blot my face a lil before I apply this and again it takes a while to settle which is irritating if you are out and about. I could never reapply this more than once. It is sweat proof, tested it in peak of summer. This is the only zinc oxide based sunscreen that did not dry out my cheeks. \n\nAll said and done, I can't seem to make it work as my stand alone sunscreen as two fingertip amount is just not going to cut it when you are on all sorts of actives. Hence, since I have healed my skin barrier now and can use chemical sunscreens again, I use it over my cheeks (an area where my PIH is the worst) layered over my chemical sunscreen, after it completely dries. It's the perfect sweet spot for me and helps with PIH.\n\nRepurchase Status: Holy Grail (HG). Already repurchased twice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **Bello Photostable Emugel Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rave ‚ù§\n\nAvailability in India: Easily available offline and online.\n\nIngredient list:\n\nKey Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol, Ethylhexyltriazone Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyltriazine, Diethyl amino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate.\n\nOther ingredients: Purified water, Dimethicone and Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl phosphate, Ceteth-10 phosphate, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Myristyl Myristate, Octyldodecanol, Caprylic Triglyceride, Pentaerythirtyl distearate, Phenyl trimethicone, Vitamin E acetate, Carbomer copolymer, Disodium Edetate, Trolamine, Sodium polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Methyparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben, Isobutylparaben\n\nSunscreen type: Chemical\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dr24pvoaknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f726d323339bee404855990ab043e2a3b051acc2\n\nExperience & opinion: I have been using it everyday since approximately 4 months. The texture is creamy and you have to work it in for like 2 minutes into the skin. Immediately post-application, the sunscreen feels greasy to touch and looks oily but it gets absorbed into the skin in about 10 minutes and leaves a dewy finish which never goes away. I really like the dewy healthy glow it gives me. I can actually use 2 finger amount of sunscreen and it doesn't leave a white cast on my dark skin tone. If it gets into your eyes, it does sting. I can assume that dry skinned people would loooooove this in the winters. If you are combination or oily, I feel you can completely skip the moisturiser step when using this in summers. Would be perfect for inclusion in a minimal routine in the AM. On reapplication, it does leave a little bit of white cast on the sides of the face where we tend to have the peach-fuzz which will go away with a little bit of rubbing. Overall, this is the best budget sunscreen easily available in India which doesn't make us look like we have dressed up for a meme.\n\nRepurchase Status: HG, WRP. Already repurchased thrice. I will be trying out Photostable Gold SPF 55 in the summer, maybe it will replace this one. If not, I will always come back to this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **Biore UV Smooth Kids Milk Spf 50 PA++++**\n\nReview Type: Rave ‚ù§\n\nAvailability in India: Availability is a serious issue. Used to get it from Dokodemo pre-pandemic. Haven't been able to source since.\n\nIngredient list: Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Glyceryl Behenate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Distearate, Sodium Acrylate/‚ÄãAcryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Paraffin, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Ceresin, Isohexadecane, Arginine, Lauryl Methacrylate/‚ÄãSodium Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polysorbate 80, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Dextrin Palmitate, Agar, Petrolatum, Succinic Acid, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, BHT.\n\nSunscreen type: Chemical\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gjsnx8acknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e3e74e3ba70e6471b63c4d83bd3d41c2e876eab\n\nExperience & opinion: I had been using it everyday in dry summer days. Where I live is not very humid and that's why I think this one works so well for me. The texture is very aptly described as milk since it feels like a thick emulsion and spreads into nothingness into the skin. I can use the recommended amount of sunscreen with this one and it doesn't leave a white cast at all. It gets absorbed into the skin within 2 minutes and leaves behind a comfortable breathable layer of moisture on your skin. It does not dry down matte. It doesn't irritate my eyes. Its just so perfect for my combination skin even on my oily T-zone in peak summer days.  Reapplication is such a breeze. I have reapplied it in a taxi, in my office, before a meeting without any downtime. I just absolutely love everything about this sunscreen except that I think it has been discontinued and I am crying over the loss of my only true HG sunscreen. If anyone from Biore is reading this, please accept my plea and bring this back into production!!!!!\n\nRepurchase Status: HG forever. Although on the look out yet again for something that would match this one's status!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **The Blessing Tree Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50 PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rant\n\nAvailability in India: Available on Amazon.\n\nIngredient list: \n\nKey Ingredients: Octyl Methoxy Cinnamate, Oxybenzone, Titanium Dioxide, Octocrylene, Avobenzone, Zinc Oxide.\n\nOther ingredients: Aqua, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Diisopropyl Adipate, 1, 3, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Acrylates /‚Äã C10-30 Alkyl Acrylare Cross Polymer, Propanediol, Diethylhexyl Sryngylidene Melonate, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Xylitylglucoside (and) Anhydroxylitol (and) Xylitol, Niacinamide, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Perfume.  That was a task to type!!!!!\n\nSunscreen type: Hybrid\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/52ec0gwdknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8dd848f71d4a3939aa1b3ea6f13df4428170a9b\n\nExperience & opinion: I have had this for around 1 1/2 years now. But I never had the courage to put it on my face due to the infamous \"perfume\" in the inci list as I had a compromised barrier and could tolerate only physical sunscreens. All said and done, this has served well as an excellent body sunscreen which doesn't break the bank and provides me excellent protection. It is non-greasy unlike the other body sunscreens on the market. The white cast disappears within 5-10 minutes and you are good to get dressed and head out of the house. I apply it on all the exposed areas of my body - neck, upper shoulders, arms, hands (I don't feel guilty reapplying it even with the frequent hand washing as its relatively affordable + acts as a moisturiser for me) and feet. \n\nHowever for the sake of this review, I mustered all the courage I had to try it on the face but alas it did not suit me and caused me CC's by evening. It spreads well, leaves a white cast on skin which disappears in about 5-10 minutes, although the white residue along the hairline just doesn't disappear. I had to rub it excessively, almost rubbed it out to get it out of my peach fuzz! The finish on this sunscreen is not ultra matte and nor is it dewy to touch, its almost in between which is comfortable for combination and oily skin types. I was worried that this might get drying on my cheeks as the day progressed due to the zinc oxide content but it did not get dried at all. While I was typing the inci list, I realised it has Niacinamide in it!!! Yet another amazing ingredient to be present in this sunscreen. All in all, I would say if you don't have sensitive/sensitized skin and are okay with the \"O\" sunscreen filters, this is an excellent sunscreen.  \n\nRepurchase Status: Might repurchase for body. Not suitable for my face.\n\nThis review took me almost a month to write and photograph, but I am ultimately happy with the final write-up. I sincerely hope you enjoy reading this! I have tried to include everything based on the rules of this sub, but still if you have any questions, do hit me up.\n\nI will make another post of the sunscreens which didn't work for me and would include the likes of Cipla Rivela tint sunscreen, Hada Labo UV Perfect Gel, Skin Aqua UV Moisture Gel, Photostable Insta,  Aroma Magic Mineral Sunscreen and The Mom's Co. Mineral Based Sunscreen.",

Oh well...\n\nAfternoon: Girlfriend thought I was \"grouchy\" for being tired, because trying to just say I didn't want to share her lunch (literally pasta with potato's -_-), and I told her I had a bad day so far. Had a small argument, during which I didn't even say anything, just tried to calm her down. Now she's pissed, and went off to her mother's house.\n\nNoon: Work zoom meeting cut off randomly, boss got pissed.\n\nEvening (so far): Dog ate a xylitol muffin. Had to take him to the urgent care center to get his stomach pumped. I'm sitting in the ER right now\n\nSo far I've aten: 3 quest bars, 1 keto bar, and an egg roll in a bowl. (1/3lb of pork, 1/3 lb of cabbage, a bit of onion, lettuce, leftovers). Is it a GOOD diet? No.\n\nBut I'm under 20g of net carbs. I'm so tired, close to crying for the first time in years. But I can get through this. And if you ever have a bad day, so can you.\n\nEdit: just got the news. He... Didn't make it. I discovered him too late.

I was using the cicabio cream everyday for my rosacea and one day they sent me the new one to try ( i only thought it would be like a new name and made one new ingredient or something...). The new one is white, absorbs completely into the skin, no more of the good stuff like copper, zinc etc and i also used to love the color be used it would cover my redness a bit! Im sorry about my English, ill do my best to explain but, their \"philosophy\" is to make products with ingredients that \"mimic\" the skin's natural way of working, in French its cold \"ecobiology\", so by removing antibacterial agents and other stuff, the new formula is more \"alligned\" with their way pf thinking. They want to make products that help the skin do what its supposed to do. I hope that made sense üòÖ. I still am pissed about the reformulation anyway. I haven't found a replacement in the french pharmacy so far",

Anyway, we walk in and there are THREE MASSIVE COCKROACHES crawling over the kitty litter boxes, along with a lot of tiny bugs.  Absolutely disgusting.  This is weird item number one.\n\nReally crazy item number 2.  We board our plane to the west coast.  We're in row 9 (one row between us and first).  First hour of the flight all is great and good.  Have another 1.5 hours to go.  My SD is staring at me, as I'm finishing a movie.  She has the look in her eyes of \"I need to go potty\".... BUT, she's obsessively drooling.. Her beard is wet wet (as if the's been dunking in water).  She then proceeds to throw up her dinner from two hour prior.  And continues to drool and then her bladder releases.  She's staying calm and sitting in one place, but high anxiety and pleading look in her eyes.\n\nWe land and I assume she needs to go potty BAD.. we walk/run through the airport to go outside.  She run/walks fairly normally.  However, once outside, she pees and poos.. And then it's clear.. she can't walk normal.  She's falling on her back legs.  She's falling sideways.  She throws up a lot of white foam and what was left in her tummy.  She walks around in a few circles, falls over like she's drunk.  Clearly distressed.\n\nWe take a Lyft to a Emergency 24 Hour Vet ER.  And we spend the next 5 hours there.  They run drug test, blood tests, etc.  They assume that on the plane that she injested some sort of drug that someone had perhaps dropped between seats and couldn't pick up (or they lost it).  It was a hellish night as well.\n\nAll is good today though, she's back to normal and it was clear that she OD'd on something.  What we don't know.\n\nUPDATE: I ran all her symptoms and the entire situation with ChatGPT. Here is what it came back with.  My guess is that she ingested a candy or a tobacco mouth pouch (that someone spit out).  \n\n# ChatGPT's best-guess ranking based on everything you wrote:\n\n|Rank|Substance|Why|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Xylitol|Fits the drooling, vomiting, loss of motor control, and would not show up on a drug panel.|\n|2|Nicotine|Strong possibility ‚Äî fits drooling, vomiting, weakness. Dogs are very sensitive.|\n|3|Trazodone or other sedative|Fits the drunk-like behavior and head-drooping.|\n|4|MDMA|Less likely, but still possible.|",

I tried to get her to take a dump, so to speak, but she said no bueno.  \n\nSince she had already done a #2 in Chicago, I figured she was good to make it home.  So off we go to the American Admirals Lounge for the layover.  The nightmare started when she suddenly stopped and let go with diarrhea in the entrance hallway‚Ä¶.i used a bunch of poop bags,  but on a polished stone floor, it more like finger painting.  I managed to find paper towels while the AA staff sent someone to clean up the mess.  As embarrassed  as I was, I refused the help and told the nice lady, my dog, my mess.  I cleaned everything up, poor Charlie knew it was bad all around. She‚Äôs a good dog, and like you, I suspect she ate something off the floor at either O‚ÄôHare or under the seat on the flight to Charlotte.  \n\nIt was the first time in 9 years she‚Äôs had that happen, and for my own sanity, I hope it was the last time.",

I'm a frequent business traveler that cares a lot about the tools and gear I use. Earlier in my life, I was in to ultralight backpacking and have applied that enthusiasm to work travel. I'm a strong advocate of traveling with a single, non-wheeled travel bag and currently use the **Minaal Daily Bag** that I wish I got in grey because the black fabric shows entirely too much lint/dirt. As you can see from the volume of stuff I bring, this get's fairly stuffed, but I love the ability to be able to slide it under the seat in front of me when flying. As I typed this out, there were a number of items that I realize I don't use as much as I initially thought, so there's always opportunity to reduce weight/volume. \n\n1. **Packing cube for my clothes** \\- I have a handful of these that are so old that I don't know the brand, but two things matter: 1) it's small enough to fit into a bag designed for daily use and 2) the zipper fully goes around three sides of the fabric, allowing one to fully open it. This just makes it easier to pack for me. I could write a whole post on what clothes I use, but I currently prefer Mizzen and Main dress shirts, Aviator lightweight travel jeans and then wool stuff from Icebreaker. I have a small pair of shorts from Reebok as part of my workout kit, but don't feel strongly towards them. They are rolled into three sections (two dress shirts as a roll each with one roll for workout stuff) and that's enough to get by for a few days to a week.¬†\n2. **Hip band** \\- I bought an off brand one from Amazon a couple of years ago after reading about them in a few places, most notably Dan John's newsletter. Since I can get low back and hip pain after being stuck on a plane for a long time, doing a ladder of reverse clamshells and hip thrusts really help relieve this for me. Sometimes I'll do a superset of air squats followed by pushups as a quick hotel room workout. \n3. **Theraband** \\- I might stop bringing this, but used to use this for shoulder rehab exercises. Lately it's just been sitting next to the hip band. \n4. **Wool buff** \\- besides the bag, the first thing on this list that came as a recommendation from Tynan's blog (well technically Tynan, but since he has no idea who I am, I feel odd making it sound like he recommended it to me personally). It is an excellent replacement for a knit hat or acts as a mask in a pinch. I still carry my own eye mask, but I guess you could use it for that as well. It weighs next to nothing and doesn't smell if you work out with it.\n5. **Nubby massage ball** \\- If I'm having trouble getting to sleep, rolling this under my feet for a while helps wind me down. I also generally have pretty tight arches so it just feels good. \n6. **Matcha tea and decent instant coffee** \\- I've traveled a fair bit with a travel sized Aeropress, but it just doesn't feel like it's worth the space for me right now. Most of the time I will either buy coffee or make matcha. Every now and then when I'm desperate, I make hotel coffee. That mushroom coffee is surprisingly tolerable, but I probably won't buy it again.\n7. **Random flight toiletry bag** \\- I've grabbed a few of these over the years and this one works great for what I typically need. Discussed more below.\n8. **Dell XPS 13, maxed out** \\- while I'd love the X1 Nano with LTE or a snazzy M1 Macbook, the Nano didn't have the cellular card available to purchase and I have to do too much work in Windows to allow an M1. The XPS is great. It's small, battery life is pretty good and it's plenty powerful for my work.¬†\n9. **Logitech Keys to Go** \\- this keyboard brings me joy. It's 1/4\" thick, has great battery life and allows me to type quickly on my phone while on a plane. Paired with 23, it's a fantastic lightweight way of being able to type with more than your thumbs. I stumble a little bit when starting to type on it each time, but get used to it quickly. The only things I'd ask for with this is a full size version for my large person hands, coupled with the ability to pair to more than one device. I'd be psyched to use this with my computer if it were full size.\n10. **Xylitol gum** \\- sometimes I try to diet while traveling, sometimes I just like to be able to chew xylitol gum after eating. Either way, its great. Spearmint is my favorite. \n11. **Levenger Pocket Briefcase** \\- I use this to keep track of daily tasks and to take notes when it feels like a full size notebook would be obtrusive. After a few months of using it, I really like the footprint, but I‚Äôm wondering if I would have been better off getting a cover for small Field Notes sized notebooks. We‚Äôll see if this lasts to next year. \n12. **WD 1TB USB C SSD** \\- I‚Äôve had this for several years now and while I don‚Äôt use it often, it still feels wild that something so small can hold 1TB and be so fast. \n13. **Carbon Fiber Money Clip** \\- after iterating through Tyvek wallets, phone cases with card sleeves and the ever classy rubber band, I finally bought one of these that Tynan had been recommending for years. It‚Äôs nearly perfect. Light, stiff, adequate stiffness/spring. \n14. **Rhodia mid sized (A5) notebook** \\- I love Rhodia paper and have iterated through multiple types of their notebooks. I like the top wound because I‚Äôm a lefty and don‚Äôt have to write backward in the notebook for it to feel normal. I thought I‚Äôd like the ability to remove pages more than I actually do. \n15. **Vivobarefoot Primus Lite Running Shoes** \\- Since I‚Äôm almost always wearing my Vivobarefoot Ra II leather shoes for work stuff, I want the smallest possible workout shoe for my bag. This is the best I‚Äôve found unless I just wear Earth Runners in the gym. I‚Äôm quite happy with these shoes so far, but am always wishing for thinner/lighter. \n16. **Small Thermos from Taiwan** \\- about ten years ago, I used to travel to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Shenzhen for work. I *think* I bought this in Taiwan at a small store, but it could have been somewhere else in Asia. It‚Äôs still perfectly functional and has a lot of sentimentality every time I use it, but it‚Äôs heavy and I‚Äôve come very close to buying Snow Peak‚Äôs titanium thermos many, many times.\n17. **Medium sized original pack towel** \\- I keep this with my coffee/tea kit, but don‚Äôt use it as much as I thought I would. It‚Äôs utility keeps it in the bag. \n18. **Electric 300W water heater** \\- I had the smaller size version for a few years, but stopped using it because it took so long to boil a cup of water. This one is bigger, but works significantly faster. I am so used to having it with me on trips that I forget that not everyone has one! As Tynan notes on his blog, you need to make sure the heater is in water before you plug it in. The heat transfer is significant, so if you don‚Äôt have a thermal mass around the heater, it destroys itself very quickly. \n19. **Another airline toiletry bag** \\- Used as my ‚Äòsleep bag‚Äô discussed below.\n20. **Microsoft Arc Mouse** \\- This is a new addition this year and I‚Äôm very pleased with it. I love that it folds flat for travel. I love even more that is what turns the mouse off. The Apple Magic Mouse is still lovely, but this thing actually brings me joy to use. \n21. **10k mAH Wireless charger/battery** \\- another recommendation from Tynan. It‚Äôs great and I didn‚Äôt know how convenient wireless charging was until I bought this. It has a little phone stand on it too, so I technically could get rid of 23. \n22. **Passport/COVID vaccination card** \\- to prove my legitimacy.\n23. **Cheap iPhone stand** \\- paired with the Bluetooth keyboard, I can write to my heart‚Äôs content in any airplane seat. I‚Äôm not crazy about this stand, but it‚Äôs adequate, light and was cheap. You can find these in many places on Amazon.\n24. **AirPods Pro** \\- a lot of the internet has sung their praises. They are wonderful if you have an iPhone. I‚Äôd imagine they were great with a Mac as well, but the iPhone AirPods combo is the best. I use little foam tips to improve fit and sound isolation.¬†\n25. **Pens!** I carry two Lamy Safari fountain pens (blue and green ink), as well as a few Pilot G-TEC-C4 ultra fine pens in black and blue. The Pilots have replaced Muji gel pens for me and I‚Äôm new into the fountain pen game, but find more joy in them than I was expecting. I suppose that means I‚Äôm getting old. The G-TECs are wonderful for detailed writing.\n26. **Aukey Omnia 65W 2 port charger** \\- GaN charger that works great, but looks like it‚Äôs gone from Amazon. I was just looking for the smallest full power charger for a USB C computer that had an extra USB port. This continues to work great. I leave a USB C and a lightning cable plugged in.\n27. **Plantronics Voyager Headset** \\- If you‚Äôre looking for the best noise cancelling microphone on a headset, this is your ticket. That said, I find myself using this less and less because the AirPod Pros are just so good and convenient. I leave this in my bag if I have to join a call from my computer. I also really like that there‚Äôs a mute button on the mini boom. I didn‚Äôt like the stock earbuds, so I added this adapter to fit a better bud.\n28. **My Frankenstein earbuds** \\- these are Etymotic ER4P earbuds, connected to a Bluetooth driver with these little adapters. While active noise cancellation is badass and the AirPod Pros are wonderful, they can‚Äôt touch the noise isolation of Etymotic earbuds. I‚Äôve had a few pairs of lower end Etymotics over the past few years and they are perfect for my use case. Small and light, but excellent isolation. I spend most of my time listening to podcasts, so while the headphone quality is nice to me, the isolation is more important. I put these on when flying or when I need to tune out the outside world. I converted to wireless and love them. \n29. **Cables and dongles** \\- I carry a few. USB-C to HDMI, lighting to HDMI, lighting to USB, micro-USB, a tiny Apple Watch charger, a tiny flash drive and a USB to UCB-C adapter. I don‚Äôt use the lighting ones that much anymore, but when I need to get an iPad screen up on a projector, this is literally the only reasonable option.\n30. **Foam eye mask** \\- These are cheap and break down over time, but I like how the foam structure keeps the mask off of your eyes. Hotel rooms and planes always have light creeping in somewhere. These help me block that out. \n31. **Laser Lite Foam Ear Plugs** \\- I‚Äôve tried fancier or semi custom fit ones, but keep coming back to these foam ear plugs. If I want to block out the world and get some sleep, the combination of the eye mask and these plugs make all the difference. Actually read about how to put them in and they are far more effective. \n32. **Small deodorant** \\- I like this brand, as well as Smith‚Äôs Charcoal deodorant in the travel size.\n33. **Magnesium, melatonin, vitamin D and electrolytes** \\- who doesn‚Äôt like carrying powder and pills with them? The electrolytes are for the morning and everything else is for night time.\n34. **Bronner‚Äôs toothpaste** \\- apparently I only like my toiletry products in blue, but this toothpaste works fine, doesn‚Äôt have SLS and comes in a small package. Sometimes I mix it up and get the cinnamon kind.\n35. **Lip balm** \\- rarely used, but if I do need it, I want it in there.\n36. **Sawed off Dollar Shave Club razor** \\- this is my smallest solution for needing to shave. I‚Äôll bring one of the razor cartridges, the sawed off and then just dry shave on my work trips. It‚Äôs not the most luxurious thing, but it‚Äôs small and light.\n37. **Knock off ultra slim nail clipper** \\- I‚Äôm not crazy about this, but I don‚Äôt want to bother with carrying full size nail clippers. \n38. **Tweezerman scissors** \\- Same situation as the nail clippers. I donated a pair of these at an airport in Botswana as I was going through security, but the rest of the time it‚Äôs been fine. \n39. **Assortment of medication in a travel Advil container** \\- I have some ibuprofen, Sudafed, Benadryl and things like that stored in the little tube. I rarely use it, but it‚Äôs very nice to be able to get to ibuprofen quickly if you have a crappy headache while traveling.\n40. **Travel toothbrush** \\- sometimes I‚Äôll travel with my Sonicare, but the size just bugs me. Most of the time I bring one of these folding brushes. Between that and the flossers, I feel like I‚Äôm doing a decent job of taking care of my teeth. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Entirely too large picture of an eye mask](https://preview.redd.it/w2ba7a8jqu871.png?width=2056&format=png&auto=webp&s=64f3523b23e82d6439dc70a09f59fcc9757f2f57)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Toiletry bag](https://preview.redd.it/k63l0rvmqu871.png?width=2214&format=png&auto=webp&s=eeee3acac200a46932f7a2fb896018efc2bc7b5a)",

        "body": "Review: After my surprisingly successful I had with the majority of the Skin1004 Madagascar Centella line promptly soothing a massive hives attack I had last week while  on a business trip, I was curious to try more  of their products.\n\nJust as I was leaving the conference venue, I happened to see a TJ/TK Maxx equivalent with a K-beauty display in the window. And there was this product, at a 20%-off introductory price. So I read the INCI, liked it, &  bought it.\n\nIt was a cloudy day with a stiff chill wind in Northern Europe, temperature 8¬∞ C/ 46¬∞ F. I definitely felt the cold wind on my face! My lips & cheeks took the brunt for sure. \n\nI rushed the 5 blocks to my hotel room & saw how the wind had affected my Jung Saem Mool Essential Nuder cushion foundation. So I took the plunge and gave my face the recommended 2 spritzes.\n\nFirst of all, the mist sprays in a wide soft, cloud, exceedingly fine & weightless. At first I wondered if any had hit my face at all! I didn't feel \"water\" or \"droplets.\"  Nor did I notice  any particular scent. \n\nThis is certainly unlike my other Western mists, such as the Nuxe Rose Mist, which offers medium size, wet  droplets; the Mario Badescu lavender mist, which sprays heavy and very wet, so wet it can run down your face!; and even the lovely Caudalie Grape Water, which has a fine mist, but can definitely be felt on the face.\n\nWell, the Skin1004 mist does in fact feel like walking into a gentle fog, so I get the \"cloudy\" description.\n\nAfter a minute I want to my bag to grab my Sisley Phyto-Rouge Shine (I love this highly moisturizing sheer balm/lipstick/gloss BTW) and as I put it on I notice the feeling of wind-dryness from my walk had vanished. \n\nMy face looked revived somehow, even though I'd been wearing the cushion for about 8 hours. I just suddenly looked a bit plumper & less tired? \n\nSo I've been using it the whole week now, several times a day. When the stuffy hotel room felt hot, the mist  felt somehow pleasantly cooling. When I felt red from the cold wind, I was soothed. I just love it. \n\nAnd even tho it's made for normal, sensitive & combo skin, it felt perfect on my sensitive & dry skin as well. \n\nMy big con so far is the size of the bottle I have.... not purse friendly!",

I'm probably not the only one who has a dog that likes to lick lotion off of me.  \nXylitol is extremely toxic to dogs and also NOT usually found in lotion.   \nThe alternative to the lotion is a set of essential oils, which includes an orange oil. My vet advised me that some citrus oils weren't great for dogs, either (and citrus oils are really bad for cats, too). I emailed FFF because both choices suck if you have four legged friends. \nEdit: I will post their reply here if/when they respond.\n\n-----\n\nFrom [Anthropologie's page](https://www.anthropologie.com/shop/mer-sea-co-body-cream):  \n\n> Water, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Sea Whip Extract, Tocopherol, Sea Salt, Maris Limus (Sea Silt), Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Dicapryl Succinate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Parfum (Fragrance), Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Phytate, **Xylitol**, Glyceryl Stearate, Maltodextrin, Caprylic Acid, Alcohol (Denatured), Sorbic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Benzoic Acid, Dehydoacetic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin\n\n-----\nFrom /u/stereofailureohno, on why Xylitol is added: \n\n> Never in a million years would I have expected to see Xylitol in a body lotion!\nOut of curiosity I looked a little more into it, different sites list it as everything from a moisturizer, humectant, thickeners/emulsifiers, to slip agent. Apparently it does have some merit as a skin care ingredient after all?\nAs a dog and cat owner I am very disappointed that I have no 'good' choice out of these items.\n\n\n",

And I even had a good time! \n\nI took one commenter‚Äôs advice and upgraded to an N95 (an [Aegle](https://www.armbrustusa.com/products/aegle-sts-f100-n95-foldable) from Armbrust American ‚Äî I remembered I‚Äôd gotten an Armbrust sampler a while back and am so glad I tried the Aegle in time!). I kept it on the entire day and it was COMPLETELY FINE. No weird looks or comments and the Aegle mask was super comfy. I ordered a 20-pack the next day lol. If Powecom KN95s fit you well, definitely try these ‚Äî they fit my face perfectly! \n\nWhen we went to restaurants, I got my order on the way out or asked for it to be wrapped and brought out with the check and then ate/drank water as we walked to our next destination (or, in the case of our last location, brought it home to eat there). No one complained or made comments and one girl even said ‚Äúoh, that‚Äôs so smart!‚Äù when my dinner-to-go arrived with the check. I used an iota-carrageenan nasal spray between venues (and Pur xylitol mints, not sure if they really helped but oh well) and mouthwashed when I got home (and for a few days after). And although I was the only one masking the whole time, a few others (including the bride) did mask here and there, which I really didn‚Äôt expect but was great to see! \n\nTo the commenter who suggested lactoferrin, I didn‚Äôt end up buying supplements because the brand you recommended wouldn‚Äôt have arrived in time, but I remembered I had a tub of Greek yogurt in the fridge so I ate about a cup and a half of that every day for the week leading up to the party. Not sure if that has the same effect but I figured it couldn‚Äôt hurt. Thank you for the tip!! \n\nTLDR, I went and took all my usual precautions and had a great time!

    "body": "7mo Doberman girl. Ate a large amount (~7 sticks) of xylitol containing chewing gum this morning out of my husbands bag. He didn‚Äôt know it was poisonous. He‚Äôs beside himself saying if it had been chocolate he never would‚Äôve left it in his rucksack on the floor and if he‚Äôd known about the toxicity of xylitol he never would have even bought it. She was fine all day, about twelve hours, then violently and copiously vomited all over the floor to the point that we started worrying, although she is sick from time to time, usually from eating grass. That‚Äôs when he mentioned the chewing gum, worrying that maybe it had caused a blockage, and on googling find out about the xylitol. We rang the emergency vet who said obviously the window for inducing vomiting, activated charcoal etc has passed, and we could monitor her overnight or bring her in. Obviously he‚Äôs taken her in, even if god forbid there‚Äôs nothing they can do we‚Äôd never forgive ourselves if we didn‚Äôt do everything we possibly could.\n\nShe‚Äôs really become so central to our lives these past 5 months and she‚Äôs the kids‚Äô world. When they went to sleep everything was fine and I‚Äôm terrified of having to give them the worst news when they wake up. I‚Äôm terrified for myself because I don‚Äôt want to lose her, devastated for my husband and how he‚Äôs feeling right now and all his guilt, but my overarching fear is for my kids. You know and accept when you get a dog that one day they will break your heart. But not yet. My kids are 8 and 4 and I can‚Äôt bear the thought of them having to potentially deal with the utter heartbreak and grief of losing her.\n\nShe seemed so fine going out the door, excited to be going out, wagging her tail as we put her collar and lead on. So scared I‚Äôll never see her again. I don‚Äôt know just how bad this is but I know it‚Äôs bad and I know that if she has liver failure then the prognosis is very poor.\n\nDon‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much advice I can seek right now but it‚Äôs 2am and I needed to talk.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-\n\nUpdate: I did try to update this post at 3.30 but it said failed, let‚Äôs see if this works now. They took her blood and said everything was normal except for one value which was high, to bring her home and watch her overnight then take her back in the morning for more tests. My husband said the vet ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt seem too worried‚Äù but I have less faith than him that she wasn‚Äôt just being kind and trying not to panic him while there was nothing he could do for the night.\n\nIt‚Äôs 8am and no more vomiting, no seizures etc. I took the spare bed so she could have the bed with my husband and therefore wake him up straight away if anything. Will update further when I know more.\n\nThank you so, so much to everyone here for all your kind words and support, helped immensely\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-\n\n2nd update: Lily has normal blood results except for a borderline high liver enzyme. The vet said this particular enzyme was very mobile so it wasn‚Äôt hugely concerning at this point that it was quite high. She is going back in 48 hours for more bloods, which will be the magic 72 hour mark and if she‚Äôs still fine then we can say we‚Äôre out of the woods. ü§éfor now, very cautiously relieved, lots of cuddles and treats (NO GUM!!)",

We found the outer box but the contents were missing. He ate around 36 grams of cocoa powder since he ate most of the cake mix. He's 21 kilos. \n\nXylitol is relatively unknown but slipups happen, especially when your cat and dog work together. Thankfully we managed to get him in about 90 minutes after he started showing symptoms so he took the charcoal just fine. He's still jittery but nowhere near the panting, pacing mess that wasn't acting right yesterday. \n\nIf your dog is relatively bright and alert, they should do much better than if you waited. That's what my vet said anyways. My dog was 90% normal when I took him in but it was little things like twitching and seeming off balance and not screaming like a banshee for the fact he was getting a car ride.\n\nI really hope your pup does well.",

Maybe it had something to do with wearing a mask up to 8 hours a day because of work or maybe it had something to do with the pneumococcal infection that was cured with antibiotics 2 years ago I don't know.\n\nI felt how mucus builds up deep inside my sinuses but I was not able to clear it. When I was in bed I felt how the stuff was running from one side of my sinuses to the other depending on which side I was  but still no chance to get it out neither with blowing it out or \"snorting\" it up. The mucus build up kinda felt like a foreign body inside my head. I visited 2 ENT specialist but none of them could diagnose anything Im pretty sure they did not believe my symptoms for whatever reason. They just looked inside my nose and said something like \"nothing to see it is fine\" but they did not look at my sinuses or ordered x-ray, ct or whatever. Maybe I was bad in explaining my symptoms.\n\nOver the 2 years I tried different things I started substituting Vitamin D (it actually improved my quality of life and overall health) but I still was unable to clear the deep mucus.\n\nI tried nasal sprays based on sea salt and medical ones with Xylometazoline. The nasal spray helped me with breathing but I still was unable to clear the mucus and breathing never was a real issue so I stopped using it. I bought a neti pod and did saline rinses but I still was not able to clear my deep mucus.\n\n4 days ago my symtpoms worsened a bit so I decided to try something else again and I read about Xylitol in this subreddit and also read different scientific studies with good outcomes about it after so I decided to give it a try. I bought Xylitol at a supermarked and added around 4 grams (1tsp) of xylitol to my saline nasal rinse.\n\nAfter all the things I tried my expectations were kinda low and after I finished the first Xylitol nasal rinse it did not feel like a lot is happening.\n\nHowever when I went to bed at night I felt how the deep mucus inside my sinuses is kinda losing up and I was able to clear a lot of that disgusting deep stuff for the first time since 2 years !\n\nThe next morning my nose was running like crazy and I had to sneeze a lot. And I mean like really damn crazy ! I still can't believe how much shit can accumulate in my sinuses ! It is pretty amazing. The last 3 days I had to blow my nose like every 5 minutes.\n\nIm not a doctor by the way but I think I had a biofilm/chronic infection problem because my mucus consistency was pretty damn weird the last 2 years. When ever I was able to clear small amounts of deep mucus it had a very strange consistency like rubbery or something like that and it sometimes smelled pretty weird too but it definetly was not \"normal\" mucus based on my life experience. I did not feel really sick but neither really healthy for the last  2 years.\n\nIm still clearing big amounts of yellow greenish deep mucus especially when Im in bed however it starts getting less and I don't feel the stuff going from one side to the other and I don't have the feeling of a foreign body in my sinuses anymore.\n\nI actually feel great right now. My general motivation and energy levels are getting back to normal like for the first time since 2 years.\n\nIf you have similar problems like me maybe give it a try. You can mix it yourself like I do or buy premixed bags with Xylitol and salt. There are also nasal sprays with Xylitol I did not try these but maybe Im going to buy one for the future when I feel like I don't need rinses anymore because once you build up a proper healthy mucus you don't want to flush it away everyday.\n\nI read a bit into the biology and if I am correct the Xylitol inhibits bacterial growth because it is based on 5 carbon atoms while other sugars like glucose have 6 carbon atoms. Different kind of \"bad\" Bacterias try to digest it but it is not digestible so they try to get it out again and they are bad in getting it out and lose a lot of energy in this process weakening the bacterial culture/biofilm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck to everyone and best wishes to get well soon !\n\n<3",

        "body": "Yes xylitol really helped me. I've sinus problems for many years and after catching covid a couple months ago, I had the worst sinus infection ever. I tried antibiotics, decongestants spray and pills, steriod spray, antihistimane pills/spray, nasal rinse and oral steriod etc etc but the congestion didn't ease up and I could feel my noae was hyper sensitive. In fact they seem to dry up my nose and thicken the mucus and made me even more congested. Finally I read about xylitol spray and ran out to get one. After the first day of using it I can actually clear out some mucus and feel the congestion easing up a bit. Then I stopped using everything else.  I added xylitol to my nasal rinse solution and used it twice a day. Slowly the mucus thined out as my congestion eased. now I am 90% better after 2 months of hell and was thankful that I finally found something  that works for me. The best thing is it has minimal side effects and is much cheaper than all those expensive nasal sprays. Hopefully it will continue to work for me. Keeping my fingers crossed.",

        "body": "Hey! My ENT advised me to do the xylitol rinses daily for a month because of thick post nasal drainage that started 15 months ago and never stopped. I'm amazed just like you, thick mucus globs are being dislodged from deep inside my nose/sinuses since I started rinsing. Damn. Feels so good. And just like you, afterwards I started sneezing and I'm having a bad cold right now actually. But it feels so good that mucus is finally coming out the front of my nose instead of draining in my throat. Anyway, I'm still in the middle of finding out if this cured my post nasal drip forever, too early to tell. But my theory for now is that the mucus globs may have blocked normal drainage the whole time and now for the first time in over a year, mucus can drain normally. Because since starting the rinses I haven't noticed anymore thick post nasal drip... How are you doing now? Still managing with doing a rinse every few days? I don't dare to keep my hopes up already that this is a fix for my problem, too afraid that it'll come back.. But I feel like a new person, or like the old me :).",

Since then my sinuses have been extremely sensitive to weather changes, surfing, allergies, etc. Symptoms generally persist for 1-3 days and it's always worst in the evening. I'll wake up in the middle of the night and the only thing that seems to allow me to get back to sleep is taking a warm bath which does allow me to breathe again. I'm tired of it and will try anything at this point. \n\nI've tried saline rinses via a neti pot which do help alleviate symptoms most of the time but other times it seems to worsen symptoms. Also gone the allergy medicine route which seems to slightly help. Hoping adding xylitol to the equation will help nip this in the bud.

I had a sinus operation in 2019 due to the severity.It was ruining my quality of life & mental state.\nIt got so bad that I had tonsillitis 6 or 7 times come mid-2022, so my ENT removed them. Recovery was brutal. My ENT said never again that he would do a tonsillectomy in an adult as it was apparently difficult with regards to me.\nThings were fine for a while in 2023, but then it was 8 sinusitis infections from April to December. \nMarch this year, after 2 sinusitis infections, I had a scan, s mass was found & another operation. \n\nPost op my ENT said it's a bacteria, antibiotics couldn't do anything.\n\nHe advises in April adding xylitol to my nasal rinse. Here in South Africa, we have a brand of nasal rinse called salex that comes with the kit.  I rinse twice a day, with water that was boiled & cooled over a few hours, then adding 1 sachet salex & the rinse solution & 1/2-1 tsp xylitol to 200ml water. Shake and rinse. It's been brilliant. Apparently, viruses & bacteria can't stick to cavity or bread with it present?\nThis has made a huge difference,  but I now have had 2 infections in 2 weeks , and I pray it's just a minor setback.\nI do have questions for those more knowledgeable or experienced.\n\nDo you use xylitol twice a day? If not, what's better morning or night?\nHow many times do you rinse a day?\nHow much xylitol per rinse has been recommended to you?\nHave you noticed any negative side effects, especially short-term?\nDo you suck it into the cavity as you rinse, or just rinse. Does it matter? I can taste the xylitol if I sucknin the rinse as doing it.\nCan I continue with this indefinitely as I feel it's made a huge improvement on my quality of life.\n\nApparently, the mask wearing & I assume the reaction of sinuses to hand sanitiser  from covid has had an effect on us.

UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* : ¬†Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin‚Äôs DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin.

I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae](https://preview.redd.it/04x8cx1jvsy81.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db29ff28ad9fbcd3ff56a158d60e872ed63cb538)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco.

I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier ü•≤. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( .

I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise!

I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai ü•≤\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this üòñ somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao ü§° maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see üëÄ / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\nand that's all from my side! I know its not much but then again kangaal haalaat mein kharidaari mushkil hai üíÄ. anyway, here's a list ss that I do want to try once this lot is finished:\n\n* sunscoop sunscreen serum (only if dermaco doesnt work lmao. really intrigued)\n* Face shop sunscreens (itne variants . ek try karne ka mann hai üòñ)\n* beauty of joseon rice ss (stock mein aaja bhai üò´)\n* missha sun aqua gel and essence (bas aise hi lol)\n\nI've also tried the neutrogena ultra sheer, episoft , a few banana boat ones but way long ago so I don't clearly remember them to give the verdict on them. just if I haven't repurchased them, consider that they didn't work well for me.\n\nhope this was informational and you guys enjoyed! if you still have any other questions related to the product above, feel free to comment!",

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as¬†caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as¬†green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

    "body": "Yesterday I lost my sweet 4-year-old boxer mix Ryker because of my own ignorance of the deadly effects of XYLITOL, a common ingredient in so many products, especially sugar-free gum. It can also be found in many other products including peanut butter! https://www.medvetforpets.com/important-sources-xylitol-dogs/\n\nOn Friday evening, Ryker got into a bag that contained Extra Polar Ice Refreshers. My dogs had gotten into packs of gum before, but never had any reaction so I didn't think much of it. Within 30 minutes though, Ryker began to have seizures. I rushed him to the emergency vet and from there, called poison control and told them what he had eaten. I learned that different brands and even different flavors of gum have varying amounts of the deadly toxin, xylitol. Worse, the majority of xylitol is present in the coating of the gum, so inducing vomiting has little effect because so much has already been absorbed.\n\nEffects of xylitol poisoning can take as little as 30 minutes, or as much as three days to appear. The first sign may be vomiting, or in my dog's case, seizures - mostly caused by a sudden drop in blood sugar. But the main issue is the effects on their liver. \n\nRyker underwent multiple plasma transfusions and other treatments, but in the end, his little body couldn't take it. I held him in my lap and stroked him through the end. It broke my heart to let him go. He was the best cuddler ever.\n\nRyker was 100% dopey, 100% joyful, 100% loving, and 100% loved by his family. I've had many dogs but none as absolutely sweet as my Ryker. Waking up to his happy excited little wigglebutt was the best part of my day. His nickname was Ryker-Roo for the joyful way he leapt when he was chasing a thrown toy or anticipating his breakfast or dinner. I am beyond thankful for the few short years he was with us and his absence will leave a hole in our hearts that will never be filled. \n\nPlease, please, PLEASE share this post so that no one else will have to feel the profound grief and suffocating guilt that I am feeling right now. Also, please look into this and other potentially deadly poisons that you may have around your house. If this post saves even one pet, then maybe there can be a shred of meaning in my beloved Ryker's death. https://www.aaha.org/your-pet/pet-owner-education/ask-aaha/Household-Toxins/",

        "body": "You've gotten a lot of good answers already, but let me add my two cents.\n\nHerra Hakkarainen is a somewhat large compressed tablet without any surface treatment, so one can easily break it into smaller pieces, if needed. Now, exposure is key, so gum is a really good vessel to get one's xylitol, but studies have confirmed that e.g. lozenges and tablets are indeed as as good a delivery mechanism, as long as one tries to keep it in the mouth for about a minute.\n\nDental health is indeed what these are for. Nothing beats brushing your teeth twice a day for about two minutes with fluoride toothpaste (unless you live in a region with highly fluoridated ground water), but xylitol is a good additive to one's oral health routine. It's especially good to use for children with primary dentition and when the permanent teeth are coming in. In adults xylitol doesn't seem to have that much of an effect on crown caries, but it would seem to lessen the incidence of cervical caries.\n\nXylitol is a polyol, i.e. a sugar alcohol, and it has several mechanisms that promote better oral health. Biofilm bacteria try to use it as sustenance, but cannot, so it helps starve the bacteria and render them unable to excrete polysaccharides and acids, which are a major factor in biofilm formation and how caries develops. The oral microbiome is slightly scary since it can learn how to utilize other sweeteners besides sugar as an energy source, but xylitol has been proven to be completely safe in the long run.\n\nErythritol is a slightly smaller molecule and is has also the same oral health benefits as xylitol. Studies would actually suggest, that erythritol is actually more effective than xylitol, and erythritol has the added benefit of not breaking down in the gut, so people with GI-troubles are usually not bothered by ingesting it, unlike xylitol. That's why it's recommended to use product with as a high as possible percentage of the products mass of either one of these two, and without any additional sweeteners. I think Finland went with xylitol, since it's a byproduct from cellulose production, and with our forest industry it just makes a lot of sense.\n\nDosage is everything. Studies suggest that it doesn't matter if you eat the daily dose in one go, or if you break it up into three times a day. Breaking up the daily dose into more than that seems to negatively affect efficacy. For some reason 5 g is the recommended dose, but I have not found evidence for that. It's based upon a study done in the 90's, and unfortunately I could not get access to the full paper. Later studies have suggested that the best range is somewhere between 7 to 10 g per day, more than that doesn't bring any additional benefits. So I suggest 7 g a day. 10 Herra Hakkarainen tablets contain 5 g of xylitol.\n\nJenkki is a very trusted brand, but it's not the only one. Fazer also make high quality products, and my favorite (that unfortunately doesn't ship abroad) is Hammaskeiju. But keeping in mind the guidelines that the product should only be sweetened with xylitol and/or erythritol, and should be as a high percentage of the product's mass as possible, one should be able to use whatever brand one can find.\n\nSoure: I wrote a whole-ass thesis on xylitol. But as always, take anything strangers on the internet tell you with a grain of salt.\n\nTL;DR Xylitol and erythritol are good. Use at least 7 g a day. Brush your teeth twice daily.",

It says that this new 50 milloin factory produces xylitol from oat husks (first in the world to source xylitol from oats) and that 90 percent of production is exported.\n\nSo from 90 percent export rate you can guess that in this country there is a big surplus of xylitol. So most likely xylitol for all Finnish producers come from this factory.\n\nIf it is really from there, you can guess that it is not organic since there likely is not enough organic oat husks to feed such a big factory. On the other hand, it is likely non-gmo since there exists no gene manipulated oat cultivars in the world.\n\nhttps://yle.fi/a/3-12421813?utm_source=social-media-share&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=ylefiapp",

Pictured above.\n\n**Fragrance:**  ~~Yes. An extremely artificial flowery scent. Dissipates, but I find it slightly annoying while applying.~~. None. \n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:** Got this when my previous gel moisturiser got over. I had already used the other 3 and I started using this with fairly high expectations. And I was / am disappointed. **It's not bad. It moisturises**. But I was expecting a jelly like moisturiser that sinks in easily while still packing a moisture -filled punch. And this is not that. It takes way longer than I'd like to sink in.  I either have to compromise on the quantity I use and the moisturised feeling or go around feeling oiler than I would like. It's the kind of product that does everything to some level, but none of them spectacularly or to an above average level.\n\nAs far as healing for barrier damage is concerned, I get way faster results from the other three Bioderma moisturisers and I pretty much never touch this for that purpose after the initial trial period.\n\nThis does have a few de-pigmenting ingredients, but so far I've not been able to see anything results that I can directly attribute to this product.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:**  Moisturised feeling. I've used this with actives that are known to cause dryness and faced no issues. It can handle drying actives. No glow noticed. No standout effects.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:**  Can't think of anything. If you start using this with low / zero expectations, you'll probably like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status:**  Jury's still out, haven't decided. But as of now it's a **Will Not Repurchase.**\n\n\n***Additional Notes on whether the product is fake****\n\n**Tl;dr: Old tube is genuine, NOT FAKE.  Confirmed by brand too. Review still stands**\n \n\nOn 24th October 2023\n\n1. Some people's experiences does not coincide with mine in important ways such as fragrance and I'm now wondering if mine was a fake, I contacted Bioderma but haven't received any info yet. But I'll update and or delete the review when I do get it. \n\n2 Of 5 people, 4 can't smell anything from their product and 1 can (but doesn't sound similar to my description. & Bioderma still hasn't replied :(\n\nOn 1st November 2023\n\n1. Bioderma replied on Instagram that my moisturiser is genuine, By the time they replied, I had already repurchased another tube from Tira, to check for myself. The new tube has already arrived and they are identical in all ways. Including from the same batch üòÖ. \n\n2. New tube arrived with bioderma samples, which jogged my memory. Old tube had also arrived with samples. Two of which I still have unopened. So chances of old tube being fake is 0.\n\n2. But the smell was still different. My old tube smells like a flower. My new one doesn't smell of anything, unless I put copious amounts on my arm and put my nose in it and even then it smells like a teeny bit chemically, Thats all. I can understand why most people say it smells like nothing, because that's what I would have said too, if I wasn't looking that closely. \n\n3. Anyway, I was breaking my head trying to figure out why my old tube is has that smell, And then it struck me. I had a perfume leak incident in my travel kit many months ago. Most of the stuff is replaced and I don't still have that perfume, so I'd kind of forgotten. The tube was new then and I didn't use it enough to note the frag or lack thereof. I think the gel or top of the packaging still smells of the perfume and that's why I was mistaken. \n\nSo that was much ado about nothing, apologies. \n\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Atoderm Intensive baume\n\n**MRP:** 786 for 75 ml.

It doesn't smell exactly like grease but it reminds me of grease. It's a dusty, chemically smell that I associate with Bioderma moisturisers. Like if you've smelled any of the Bioderma moisturisers, all except the gel-creme have the same DNA, though they are not exactly the same. It's not repulsive, but it's there. Does dissipate after a minute or so.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  I bought this on a whim after a few friends raved about it. They were so so so right. This was the second bioderma cream moisturiser I used, so I knew it would help with barrier issues but it does so much more. When I first used this, I had oily to combination skin and I never ever used cream moisturisers by choice. I had a misconception that since I was an acne / clog prone, oily skinned person, that I need to stay as far away from cream moisturisers as possible. This is the moisturiser than changed my mind.\n\nIf I want a one and done PM product when I'm too tired or too lazy or too whatever, I reach for it.\n\nIf I want a one and done travel moisturiser, this is the only one I pack.\n\nSuper dry climate, this is it.\n\nAirplane dryness, this is it.\n\nSlight tingling, or signs of barrier damage incoming, this is it.\n\nBarrier damage, this is it.\n\nDerm procedures, this is it.\n\nBut in even other scenarios such as humid climate or AM routine, where this is NOT my ideal or go-to product, it still does a decent job. It holds its own. It can be greasy but hey it can be worked with. It does an amazing job moisturising without clogging pores for me.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:**\n\nMoisturised feeling.  Super soft skin. Heals Barrier overnight depending on damaged your skin is. It's my tried and tested barrier recovery product.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The heaviness, I guess. Upto combination skin or barrier-damaged oily skin, it's fine. Very oily skinned people may want to avoid this for general use.\n\n**Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** Have repurchased 3 or 4 times.

Heavy feeling on the skin.\n\n**Ingredient List :**  [Aqua/‚ÄãWater/‚ÄãEau](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum)](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/paraffinum-liquidum), [Beeswax (Cera Alba)](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cera-alba), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Cetyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-alcohol), [Glycyrrhetinic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycyrrhetinic-acid), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [Palmitic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/palmitic-acid), [Stearic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/stearic-acid), [Sorbitan Sesquioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitan-sesquioleate),[Tocopheryl Acetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tocopheryl-acetate), [Mannitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/mannitol), [Xylitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/xylitol), [Rhamnose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/rhamnose), [Fructooligosaccharides](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/fructooligosaccharides), [Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laminaria-ochroleuca-extract), üåü[**Allantoin**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/allantoin)**, üåü** [**Sodium Pca**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-pca), [Caprylyl Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylyl-glycol), [Caprylic/‚ÄãCapric Triglyceride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylic-capric-triglyceride), [Pentylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentylene-glycol),[1,2-Hexanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/1-2-hexanediol), [Carbomer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/carbomer), [Triethanolamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/triethanolamine)\n\n**Fragrance:**  Yes. A different version of that greasy smell.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  This was first prescribed by my then dermatologist for application after a MNRF session. And since then till Atoderm intensive baume came into my life, this was a re-buy. **Slightest irritation, and I used to apply it**. I have urticaria, this helped with many of my allergic reaction episodes. **Skin will feel greasy, but it was soothing at the same time.** As soon as the greasiness disappeared, I used to reapply. **This was never a daily use moisturiser for me.** I kind of used it like medicine. As and when needed, at the quantity, I needed. However the soothing it provides does overlap with the Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume and I've not repurchased this in more than a year. I simply use that, wherever I previously reached for this. I have a feeling this is a gold standard product for certain sub set of people who need a rich, soothing moisturiser, but for most of us, this can be a pass.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:** Moisturised feeling. Very soothing on irritated skin.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The heaviness, I guess. Upto combination skin or barrier-damaged oily skin, it's fine. Very oily skinned people may want to avoid this for general use. And the price. Damn expensive for 40 ml.\n\n**Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** As of now, I don't miss it in my routine, so **WNRP.** Considering the price and the benefit from the others, unless you have sensitive skin or are advised by your derm to try this out, I'd skip it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Cicabio Cr√®me\n\n**MRP:** 1399 for 40 ml\n\n**Texture:** Green tinged Lotion.  Pictured above. Feels heavy for a lotion.\n\n**Ingredient List :**[Aqua/‚ÄãWater/‚ÄãEau](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Fructooligosaccharides](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/fructooligosaccharides), üåü[**Zinc Oxide**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-oxide)**,** [Sorbitan Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitan-stearate), [PEG-30 Dipolyhydroxystearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-30-dipolyhydroxystearate), [Butylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butylene-glycol), [Polyacrylamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyacrylamide), [C13-14 Isoparaffin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c13-14-isoparaffin), [Laureth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-7), [Copper Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/copper-sulfate), üåü [**Mannitol**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/mannitol)**,** [Sodium Hyaluronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-hyaluronate), üåü [**Xylitol**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/xylitol)**,** [Zinc Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-sulfate), [Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Vine Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/vitis-vinifera-vine-extract), [Rhamnose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/rhamnose),[Laureth-3](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-3), üåü[**Asiaticoside**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/asiaticoside)**, üåü**[**Madecassic Acid**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/madecassic-acid)**, üåü** [**Asiatic Acid**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/asiatic-acid), [Hydroxyethylcellulose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethylcellulose), [Acetyl Dipeptide-1 Cetyl Ester](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acetyl-dipeptide-1-cetyl-ester), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Caprylic/‚ÄãCapric Triglyceride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylic-capric-triglyceride), [Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laminaria-ochroleuca-extract)\n\n**Fragrance:** A subtler version of that greasy smell, a teeny bit herbal, to be this dissipates the quickest of all the bioderma moisturisers.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  üòç I love it. I love it only slightly lesser than Atoderm Intensive Baume and mostly because it's comparatively way more expensive. üòÖ.  I wouldn't use this daily, there's no need, but definitely a barrier saviour product. I wake up with such soft glowy skin even when it's damaged, like the healthy part of my skin feel look glowy even if skin damage texture is still there to an extent.\n\n***Comparing with baume, since I use them both for similar reasons :*** I originally had the impression this was heavier than Atoderm Intensive Baume and that it forms a suffocating seal on the skin. This isn't true under normal circumstances. It does feel suffocating when barrier is SEVERELY damaged but not otherwise. I applied this on half and the baume of half my face to check if there's any major difference and no. **No functional difference noticed.**\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:** Soothing, Healing, Moisturising, it does it all.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The price. And for a lotion consistency product it's quite heavy.\n\n**Repurchase Status**: When I started writing this review, this was going to be a WNRP, because between all of them, I'd only repurchase Atoderm Intensive Baume, but ngl, the more I thought about it, I find myself wavering. **This is a WRP.** I don't know when, but I'll probably come back to this at some point.\n\n# \n\n# Comparision\n\n***Ranking based on Use Case***\n\n||1st Choice|2nd Choice|3rd Choice|4th Choice|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|As an AM Moisturiser|None of them|Intensive Gel-creme|Intensive Baume|Sensibio Forte|\n|As an PM Moisturiser|Intensive Baume, Cicabio, Intensive Gel-creme, Sensibio Forte||||\n|Time taken for Healing|Cicabio|Sensibio Forte, Intensive Baume|Intensive Gel-creme||\n|Versatility (Can work for any of the above use cases in a pinch)|Intensive Baume|Intensive Gel-creme|Cicabio|Sensibio Forte|\n\nI've ranked them after considering the following factors (these are the most important deciding factors for me personally).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***As  AM Moisturiser:***\n\n**I would use absolutely none of them as an AM moisturiser.** That doesn't mean they can't be used as such. it's just that none of them absorb in minutes or 'set' when you use a normal amount or slather it on. They're all occlusive but not the matte kind. Intensive Gel-creme is the easiest one of them to use as an AM moisturiser.\n\nThis gif will show you how long it took for them to sink into my arm, which is way dryer than my skin. But caveat is that I don't always use a AM moisturizer (infact I very very rarely do), but i when I do, I slather it on like below. If you use a teeny teeny weeny bit, you might not face this issue. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/isq9941kddwb1.gif\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***As PM Moisturiser:***\n\nI can't actually decide I love them all. Atleast I love Intensive Baume, Sensibio Forte and Cicabio, but there's nothing to complain about the gel creme either. ‚ú® **Skin just looks so nourished with all the Bioderma moisturisers.** ‚ú®  If you use only a tiny amount, all of them will sink in by morning. I like to slather them all on. And how much is absorbed by morning completely depends on how damaged my skin is. If I catch signs of barrier damage early and use them, they'll sink in. If I've completely wrecked my skin, there will be residue when I wake up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***On healing***\n\nTime taken for healing: shortest to longest, ranked above. But honestly, most people don't need a moisturiser stronger than Intensive Baume even for barrier damage.\n\n**Note on the likeliness of clogging pores and causing acne: I've personally not had breakouts from any of them. None of them caused acne for me.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nüëâüèæ All 4 moisturisers are good.\n\nüëâüèæ For most people Sensibio Forte & Cicabio is not necessary. Unless you have facial wounds, surgery on your face, intensive derm procedures, very bad rosacea and are prescribed or recommended these, I'd say skip them.  People with sensitive skin may like them though.\n\nüëâüèæ If you have oily skin, you might like Bioderma Intensive gel creme.\n\nüëâüèæ Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume has ceramides, fatty acids and cholesterol. Ratio unknown, will link if I can find anything.\n\nüëâüèæ I've seen a fair number of people mention that baume is heavy and breaks them out in this sub. Something to be aware of.\n\nüëâüèæ  If I had to suggest only one product, from the above, hands down it'll be Atoderm Intensive Baume and it's best cost - benefit wise too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Im going to buy the cica +arnica to try out next. The Atoderm Creme Ultra doesn't seem interesting enough to me to want to try. If I can get a mini or sample somewhere just to update this post, I'll do that.\n\nETA2: After writing so much I still like left somethings out , so I'm editing to add them. Apologies üôè\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs with any other review, YMMV",
