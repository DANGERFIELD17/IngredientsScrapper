And it‚Äôs exciting to me be able to translate designs in basic PLA on an A1 Mini into more robust materials like concrete and rammed earth. \n\nHowever, one of the drawbacks of prototyping in concrete, cement, plaster, or stabilized earth is that your prototypes are inevitably going to be unusable in one manner or another AND made of massive, non-recyclable materials. The experimental process creates heavy trash.\n\nAlong the way I realized that I could experiment with multipart mold designs while making bars of soap instead. By using ‚Äúmelt and pour‚Äù bulk soap on Amazon I could find what works and what needed further optimization before designing for silicone or concrete. \n\nObviously, I‚Äôm not making concrete bars with the same mold designs. But, the lessons about layer line transfer, overhang design, planned post-processing operations, and relief zones translate.\n\nOther positive results:\n-each casting costs less than a Dove bar\n-materials don‚Äôt need to be purchased 90lbs at a time\n-it can be used for its intended purpose whether it turned out perfectly or not \n-it literally lets me wash away the sins of prototyping \n\nThought I would share in case anyone else was curious about mold making but was intimidated about starting. \n\nThe dots in my bar of soap are oven-dried cold brew coffee grounds for exfoliating and I added a 1/4 teaspoon of lavender essential oil in case someone wonders.",

I don't remember anything about lavender in the ingredients, and I've read through that ingredients list plenty of times during yesterday's discussion. So I look at the back of the bottle.....and [surprise surprise! Lavendula angustifolia hydrosol is the first freakin ingredient!](https://imgur.com/a/ctlJeOp)\n\nSo at this point I feel like a crazy person, because I specifically remember Aloe Leaf Juice being the first ingredient. Well...it is. On the ingredient list on the website. [Right above a handy disclaimer that I conveniently missed stating that \"Due to long lead times for production of our packaging, the ingredients listing on the package may not reflect all current ingredients...\"](https://imgur.com/a/AC58dv8) and to refer to their website for the correct ingredient list ü§î Except I'd bet my first born that there's absolutely no way lavender anything is that far down in the ingredients of this product. It smells a lot like my first college roomie who was a little way too much into essential oils and smelled like she bathed in lavender essential oil in a futile attempt to cover the smell of weed and black n milds. Good times.\n\nLastly, [my bottle says it is made in China](https://imgur.com/a/Hc55AD5)....which while wasn't a part of my concerns, is pretty surprising. After further research, I saw a review on Amazon saying that the one they've gotten on Amazon say \"Made in China\" while the one they've gotten from MTB website said \"Made in USA\"....Except, I got mine directly from their website....dafuq?\n\nSo now I have no toner, I've wasted too much of my life on this quest and I'm thoroughly annoyed. I also can't believe how this product has 4.8 stars on the website....unless every customer has lost their olfactory senses in some tragic accident.\n\nUPDT # 2: [Customer service confirmed the toner is made in China along with several other products.](https://imgur.com/a/OO2IfqR)\n\nUPDT # 3: [LOL the customer service rep literally just regurgitated the paragraph off their website to me about long production times for packaging...](https://imgur.com/a/gN20cmi) so no, the ingredients IN my bottle, are not what's written ON the bottle...\n\nAt this point this is comically bad. I will obvi be returning this \"toner\" and washing my hands off this company and any \"influencers\" that promote it ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå",

Here's some of the advice given - \n\n **You should avoid direct contact with affected water in Lake Bolac.**  \n**Do not swim in affected areas or use water for cooking, drinking, washing or showering. Boiling the water will not make it safe.**¬†  \n**What you should do:**\n\n* Visit the [Parks Victoria Website](https://parkweb.vic.gov.au/about-us/news/blue-green-algae-warning-for-lake-bolac2) for more information.¬†\n* Observe information signs posted at the lake.¬†\n\n**Protect your health:**\n\n* Direct contact with water affected by blue green algae can cause skin irritation, sore eyes, ears and nose. If swallowed it can cause cramps, nausea and vomiting.¬†\n* If you do come into contact with affected water, wash your skin immediately in clean cool water.¬†\n* Boiling affected water does not make it safe to drink. Boiling water bursts the blue green algae cells and releases toxins into the water making it more likely that you will experience symptoms.¬†\n* If you are experiencing any health issues after contact with affected water seek medical advice from your local doctor or [Nurse-On-Call](https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/primary-and-community-health/primary-care/nurse-on-call)",

    "body": "In the wake of the announcement of the opening of Mass GeNP, the worlds first NP-run hospital, tensions were at an all time high. The aroma of lavender essential oil enveloped the ether of the call room, my dojo and safe space. I reached into the pocket of my long white coat draped over my linguini legs sprawled out on the call room couch. Two melatonin gel caps touched my tongue before disappearing into the abyss of my esophagus. 2029 had been a hell of a year, and 2030 brought new challenges with my newly appointed position as Vice President of the AANP. My yoke was heavy. But I couldn‚Äôt let my profession down. All of my years of practicing healthcare hadn‚Äôt prepared me for the atom smashing pressure I would face in this new year. But that was fine. Diamonds are made under pressure. \n\nAs I drifted into REM, my pager reminded me of my duty to humanity. ‚ÄúDr. Karen NP, this is Dr. Holly, Nurse Infectious Diseasologist. I have a 19 year old college student with sudden onset high fever, photophobia, and stiff neck. Any thoughts?‚Äù How could she be so asinine? But I had to respect my colleague‚Äôs rigorous one month online fellowship. ‚ÄúLyme‚Äôs disease. Find the tick. Flagyl 200 mg IV BID. Keep her on 50 mg for long term prophylaxis against chronic Lyme‚Äôs.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre amazing Dr. Karen!‚Äù I hung up. \n\nJust then, the overhead pager blared. ‚ÄúDr. Karen NP, please report to Endo suite 69 stat!‚Äù I slipped on my leopard print danskos and adorned my long white coat as I graced the hospital with my clinical expertise. I punched through the endo suite doors and promptly pushed the circulator nurse nurse out of my way. ‚ÄúI was summoned.‚Äù \n\nThen, we locked eyes. ‚ÄúDr. Karen NP! I‚Äôm Dr. Jared, nurse gastroenterologist. This 42-year-old patient‚Äôs blood pressure is dropping and abdomen is becoming more distended. I was performing her annual follow-up colonoscopy for solitary rectosigmoid polyp with possible ERCP when she started decomping.‚Äù ‚ÄúGet a stat KUB with AP chest,‚Äù I retorted. ‚ÄúAlready did. The report from Dr. Melissa, nurse radiologist read ‚ÄòPatient appears constipated. Blackness noted at costco-phrenetic angles. Cannot appreciate or rule out acute findings. Correlate clinically.‚Äô‚Äù I knew immediately. ‚ÄúStart IV sulfasalsazine and a 50000 unit vitamin C drip. She‚Äôs having an acute leaky gut attack.‚Äù All of the nurse nurses began clapping. ‚ÄúYou saved the day again Dr. Karen NP.‚Äù I paused for emphasis ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù Our eyes locked once more before I sauntered out of the endo suite, head held high. More often than not, a hero‚Äôs most epic battle is the one you never see. It‚Äôs the battle that goes on within themself.\n\n[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/i6vjc1/chronicles_of_dr_karen_np_part_i/)\n\n[Part II](https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/i7aljg/chronicles_of_dr_karen_np_part_ii/)\n\n[Part III](https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/i844e4/chronicles_of_dr_karen_np_part_iii/)\n\n[Part aVF (IV)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/i9pqh5/chronicles_of_dr_karen_np_part_avf_iv/)\n\n[Part V](https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/igkybv/chronicles_of_dr_karen_np_part_v/)\n\n[Part VI](https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/iupxyq/chronicles_of_dr_karen_np_part_vi/)\n\n[Part VII](https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/jbz0pb/chronicles_of_dr_karen_np_part_vii/)\n\n[Part VIII](https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/jw2qom/chronicles_of_dr_karen_np_part_viii/)\n\n[Part IX](https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/mvrhq2/chronicles_of_dr_karen_np_part_ix/)\n\n[Part X](https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/n5mdvt/chronicles_of_dr_karen_np_part_x/)",

Neither of us are experts (he does some coding for his engineering job; I barely passed one CS class in college) but it turns out that [people who know much more than we do](https://minimaxir.com/2019/09/howto-gpt2/) have been working to make artificial neural networks accessible, and it actually wasn't too bad.\n\nTo train a computer, you need data. Lots of it. Thankfully, this sub came through for me, with [this spreadsheet of over 1500 perfumes](https://reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/27whdj/sharing_my_labor_of_love_i_am_compiling_a_master/) compiled by the amazing u/vanityclaire (Sadly it's outdated for shopping, but still good for this.)\n\nThen we had to train the ANN. We thought we had an instant success when it began giving us names like \"Banana Peel in a Graveyard,\" but it turned out we were simply underestimating the [enduring weirdness of BPAL names](https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/neil-gaiman/the-graveyard-book/banana-peel-in-a-graveyard/).\n\n(Incidentally, I think BPAL should release a perfume called The Enduring Weirdness Of BPAL Names. Just for fun.)\n\nHowever, eventually we succeeded. We found that the models that generated creative names were mostly the ones that generated boring descriptions and vice versa, so I'm giving them mostly separately. Feel free to match them up, or suggest names or notes for them :)\n\n#CGI Names\n\n* The Hummingbird of Love\n* Brimstone and Broom\n* The One Under The Bed\n* The Last Basilisk\n* The Poorest Florist\n* Unmuffled Whispers of Nature on Musk And Wood With White Musk And Blue Musk And Black Musk And Blue Musk And Woods And Carcass (according to the generated notes, it smells like apples and has no musk!) \n* Shadower\n* Midnight Vaporize\n* Black Bee\n* Spiced Tomatogram \n* Barked Potato \n* Scandal of You\n* Normally Spiced Nutcrack \n* Radical\n* Blackburn's Bowmaster\n* Blackburn's Beer Float \n* Bubbled Cranberry \n* Window of Doom\n* Leatherndress\n* Lament of Three\n* Lush Guano\n* Killer Kitten\n* The Last of the Wild Boars\n* House of 1000 Corpses\n* Take Me Apart By Myself \n* Calla Her\n* Fairy Curd\n* The Rise & Fall of Sun Quan\n* Chamomile & Mushroom Mist\n* Jack & The Divine Jam & Mallow\n* Salty Beer\n* Disney Tuna\n* Tea Cotton & Bark\n* Silent But Deadly\n* Hivemind Tea\n* Gelatin Spice Latte \n* Louis III and Eric\n* Ex-Human\n\n\nAnd finally, the computer would like to suggest that if there are Rose Mallow, Violet Mallow, and Cocoa Mallow perfumes, then there is no good reason not to create Cherry Mallow, Banana Mallow, Cobalt Mallow, and Python Mallow. Obviously. \n\n#CGI Descriptions\n\nAnd then there were the descriptions, which ranged from normal to......I have no idea what some of these are about. Here's a selection:\n\n* \"Dab a bit of black pepper on your hand, and voila! You have now mastered the art of pepper playing pranks on your fellow man! You can wear this one as a necklace or carry it as a wild card in your life (there is no telling which way things will turn out from here)\"\n* Alienation, torture, and the horrible, dark arts. Inspires vengefulness, patience, kindness, and a deep awareness of one's fellow man. \n* \"In honor of the official patron Goddess of Foodies and Foodies, I am proud to present to you The Saint of Food. The scent for my fantasy girlfriend would be one with no name, no place to be, no idea how she is supposed to look or behave. Divinely sophisticated and perfect for a night out at the opera in the heat of summer with friends, followed by a long (but not uncomfortably romantic) nap.\" *(It's like a perfume/witchy/niceguys crossover!)* \n* \"A tart, romantic dupe of Earl Grey Tea: red currant, black cinnamon, and sweet patchouli.\"\n* Evil incarnate: this is a perfume sacred to the satyrs ‚Äî ravens, storks, moths, and locusts. Their scent is a blend of ancient Egyptian and Greek Myrrh, with a touch of bright, crisp linen.\n* An intoxicating blend, a game of musical chairs: plumeria, orange blossom, orange blossom, pear, orange blossom, orange blossom, and anise.\n* Roll-ups, mildewed raincoat, and duct tape.\n* The ultimate, audacious, and incredibly risky scent. The blackest of the blackest of the black. *(Is it patented by Anish Kapur?)*\n* Hair of the Dog, feline and canine.\n* Fizzy pear, peach and/or coconut.\n* Molly - A true wet martini waiting to happen when you drop it into the black stream bubbling beneath the surface. Like sipping on a forest fire and smelling the forest for the first time you realise why it was there in the first place and that's the 100% real forest smell. Wettest of all to those that have smelled the effervescent hazelnut you instantly know how to behave when you are at a 10% ABV gathering. Very very very pretty and not very foody.\n* \"Alfred Hitchcock's Texas Chain Saw Massacre is both a psycho and a horror story. A plantation romance, the couple is accused of murdering one another and stealing bride and dance from the beautiful, innocent, innocent, beautiful, little-known \"Red Woman\". They are said to be close to reconciliation, but their troubles are far from over. They have one more thing in common: they both starred in horror films. (Cameo by dandyboy1911. An elegant blend of elegant chamomile, bay rum, and attar of rose.) \n* Amelesia - Fabulous layered citrus and musk, full of citrus, and musk given the edge of life. Amelesia is freckled, gaunt, and suffering from the effects of post-traumatic stress with long slow comings and goings.\n* World War Z - California, dust, and jelly beans. This is what World War Z smells like. Scent and rampaging madness.\n* Celadon Noir - Deep mucus and golden violets.\n* An immaculately scented blend of Vanilla, Sandalwood, Amber, Tonka Bean, Fragrant Remains, and a tiny hint of Kosher Hieroglyphics.\n* \"A delicate, enchanting blend of delicate pekoe tea cakes dipped in warm, juicy cherry pie.\"\n* Winters Whore 1 - This fragrance embodies a scent of the cold, winter air sweeping over dark alleys and winding through the backstreets of the poor women. A warm scent with a delicate hint of green and a wild note that you could swear was frumpy but was actually made to match your scent, it was the scent of the coldest and most beautiful winter decorations that was placed down at night on the front porch. Named for the woman on whose house it was placed, who was murdered by a rich, powerful man and who was buried with his wealth as an inheritance. Upon seeing it appeared, the man went into a rage and threw the pillbox in a dumpster, the lady who was with him sped away in a carriage with her children and was strangled to death by her own husband, and the children were taken and made into an act of prostitution and the rich man was hung and after being shot and killed by a gang of gallows men. Upon his hanging, the ex-potentate declared that the flower should be used as an aphrodisiac and the bullet should be placed in the flower, after which the balloon should explode with the rich man's name written all over it, and he would be granted a new life. The original recipe said that the flower should be used for seduction and that the bullet should be placed in the flower, but with the old lady's body being strewn with flowers, that hasn't worked out so well, and now it's just used as perfume for the sheer loveliness of it all. This elixer base is made with a tea rose accord and consists of: (1) 100% pure tea resins and leaves (2) tea rose essential oil \n* Vamp - A sharp, dirty scent: black musk, tanning lotion, grapefruit, tonka bean, balsam pine, tobacco flower, amber, and soot-covered black armpit.\n* Shadower - A scentedored variation of the standard shantymaker's scentedored variation of \"bathtub gin\". A lavender fougere, a hint of lilac, and a touch of lilac persimmon.\n* GRAPE SODA - crunchy black agar & crisp white peppermint\n* Dirty Laundry: The scent of a laundry-free home, in addition to the scent from your favorite brand of laundry detergent.\n* Dirty Laundry 2: A full moon, a rich oud wood, and a few wildflowers. It is the perfect fit for any day of the week.\n* Under a thick layer of black licorice, a layer of purulent, rancid skin ‚Äì pure and lovely. Underneath, a layer of frankincense, a layer of myrrh, and a tiny drop of patchouli.\n* This is a blend of my personal scents, very bright. It's very floral and earthy, very perfect. Just perfect for fall. *(If Trump were a perfumer)*\n* Chypre which isn't chypre, but a blend of chamomile, chamomile, lemon peel, chamomile, honey, and vanilla \n* The Holy Roman Empire, also called the Byzantine Empire, was a geopolitical entity in Europe and Asia, spanning the Eastern Mediterranean, Central Asia and the Arabian Peninsula. Its princes and administrators ruled over empires, trading centers, and slave markets. Their spices, town flowers and incense were the principal sources of pleasure in their households. Sweet Arabia was the dominating sweetener in their oude and they used it in their legal codes and official documents, too. Although technically the same product, Holy India is a very syrupy blend of subtle Himalayan and African fruits and spices that have been oxidized and given a thick, refined taste. Although the Eastern Orthodox Church historically used the spice in their liturgy, it is in no way a synonym for the Greek word \"Christ,\" and it is not a synonym for the Roman numeral \"one,\" either\n\n#CGI successes? \n\nAnd then there's a few that I think the computer got more or less right! I bet these would sell:\n\n* A deliciously perverse and sinister blend, imbued with power and grace. The scent of a perfect lover, a scent that has no equal. Thick black currants with a hint of leather and ginger, spiced with vanilla, cinnamon and allspice.\n* The scent of an elite assassin, trained to such a degree that only a mere mortal would dare approach. A virginal, sweet scent, imbued with power and grace. *(Okay, this doesn't have notes, but it should. I vote for florals and resins.)*\n* Tsunami is the scent of an oceanic treatment. The ghostly and sorrowful beauty of submerged coral, and a warm tingling of citrus. The exotic and the familiar on the verge of dissolving into each other. The crisis and the triumph of hope.\n* Crimson and Black - This is the scent that earned the Grim Reaper his reputation as the most terrifying man in history. This is that scythe-wielding, black-clad Grimm who roamed the land as a wild scent. Crimson and Black musk blends with frankincense, cedar and oakmoss to create a haunting and sultry blend reminiscent of a haunted cemetery. A piquant yet comforting, comforting and comforting.\n* Hellfire and the Dark Side of Evil: A long dead and powerful blend of three potent and deadly opiates: opium resin, honey, and smoke. *(Yeah, pretty sure I'd buy this!)*\n* White Tea, Mandarin, Lemon, Orange-Juice, Opium, Rich with Sheng Pine Tar and Ghost bamboo. *(This too! Anyone have a dupe?)*\n* Pure, sweet, and ferocious. A malevolent yet charming blend of Vanilla, Sandalwood, Amber, Lavender Bergamot, Lavender Essential Oil, Lavender Cauldron Smoke, and a Vanilla Accord *(okay, the notes need adjustment, but Lavender Cauldron Smoke sounds amazing)*\n\nSo. That's the post. Favorites? Least favorites? Any that you want to make up notes or names or descriptions for?\n\nAlso, you can find the unfiltered dump of all our results [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r6cDaJcsbe1nJKs9_JeNYlWD0gysuzZdvbdTByeS1do/edit?usp=drivesdk) - feel free to go looking at everything I didn't include!",

The tea, the rocks, the soil, the dark green leaves, the sharp exhale of freshly cut dark green grass...all the elements of cataclysm. What more could you want? myself a cat lady, and you can bet I am not the only one who is secretly in love with a cat. This is the most decadent, sexiest, richest, most musky scent I have ever created, and it is only available in hard cider, not a shot of tea. Amber, exfoliating lotion, a dab of soapy body, softened with musk and silk. This is the end result of many hours of in-betweened, skin-cleansing research and crafting. I am extremely proud of it, and if you could only have one of the following, what would it be? Cetacean, Cat, Werewolf, etc... I would pick Cat, as it is the largest of the cats and has the most of the flavors. A decadent, sophisticated, musky scent, like the sea creatures that inhabit it. Unfortunately, there is no fur, so there is no sticker shock, but I thought you would like it anyway. There are a number of versions of Cat out there, and the price varies widely. This one is the larger of the two, so it is a bigger scent, but it is one that I have put on my skin anyways, and it is one that I would wear regardless of what the others were. Very beautiful, very pretty, good for summer, timeless.* ‚Äú",

I would like to agree with the computer that we do, in fact, need a cherry mallow and a banana mallow since we have a rose mallow and a violet mallow and chai-mallow, mocha-mallow, and a MOON-mallow. Cobalt mallow sounds interesting. Python mallow scares me. Get on it, Hex/SS.\n\nThe funniest ones I saw were: \"GRAPE SODA - crunchy black agar & crisp white peppermint\" and \"A tart, romantic dupe of Earl Grey Tea: red currant, black cinnamon, and sweet patchouli.\" Computer has never tasted grape fanta or earl grey, and has come up with some...very interesting interpretations. I can tell the computer's been spending too much time with Possets and BPAL. I wonder if some houses will see this and be inspired by some of these names/descriptions though - \"Take Me Apart By Myself\" sounds like half of a D+F perfume name. \"Hivemind Tea\" screams BPAL.\n\nAnd then there's this:\n\n>Crimson and Black - This is the scent that earned the Grim Reaper his reputation as the most terrifying man in history.

It took much longer than other lists because of all the info I had to gather. That and me rage quitting for a while after computer decided to delete all the ingredient lists I typed out.  :I***\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**General Info (That I got questions about):**\n\n*The reason I typed out some of the ingredient lists is bc I can't find the list in English online that I can easily copy and paste, or the ingredients aren't up to date.*\n\n*I bolded some ingredients that are helpful for skin/skin-identical for healthy skin barrier.*\n\n*The dollar cost is the converted retail price of what it would cost in Korea, without sale/promo.*\n\n*I also looked up all the common plant names from their scientific names because it annoys me when I look at ingredients and I have no idea what that plant is..*\n\n***PEG -*** *something* *means something has been altered or made to be water soluble. It is useful for that but some people avoid it due to microplastics (I don't know a whole lot about it, but have heard people say this).*\n\n[***You don't need to be SUPER DUPER concerned about visible light/blue light protection***](https://labmuffin.com/blue-light-computers-phones-damage-skin/) ***and whatnot, even though some of these products claim to protect against them.***\n\n***TINTED sunscreens are lightly tinted usually in beige or peach color.

As always,* ***YMMV.***\n\n*Many of these companies* ***claim*** *that their product is the* ***gentlest*** *for the most sensitive skin because of EWG (Environmental Working Group) rating of 1, but* ***EWG is NOT a reliable source, especially for sensitive skinned folks***\\*\\*, *as they can be very biased and promote skin-sensitizing things just because an ingredient sounds more \"natural\".\\** ***Natural*** *things usually contain much more possible* ***skin triggers*** *than lab-isolated,* ***single*** *ingredients.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Potentially Irritating Filters (From Lab Muffin Beauty Science Blog)***\n\n>**Avobenzone** is a common irritant and allergen, so it tends to be unsuitable for sensitive skin, and you‚Äôre left with inorganic sunscreens only.  \n>  \n>If you‚Äôre elsewhere in the world, the newer UVA1 filters aren‚Äôt particularly irritating or allergenic.  \n>  \n>A few other organic sunscreens also tend to cause allergic and irritant reactions: **octocrylene, oxybenzone, avobenzone, PABA, Padimate O and enzacamene.**\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SUNSCREEN**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1.\\[A24\\] Premium Sun Protection Cream -

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

I just need to write this here so I don't end up writing it in the Young Living rep's comments on Facebook where it will lead to me getting fired, since my boss is one of her \"oily\" idiots. How can educated people be SO DAMNED STUPID?! \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nNo. You are not correct. You're actually risking your daughters' lives with your ignorance and fear of big words. Just because you \"can't pronounce something\" does not mean it's harmful. I cannot pronounce \"Worcestershire\" but that doesn't mean the sauce is harmful. It just means I can't wrap my mouth around the word.\n\nI know far too many people who are into essential oils because they are \"all natural\" and protects them from \"chemicals\". I am so incredibly sick of watching people think this.\n\nFirst off, chemicals are not inherently bad. Every single thing around you is made of chemicals. YOU are made of chemicals. I'm so tired of people saying, \"I won't eat anything I can't pronounce!\" [Here is a list of the chemicals making up a number of all natural foods.](https://io9.gizmodo.com/what-if-natural-products-came-with-a-list-of-ingredient-1503320184) If you really could not eat anything you couldn't pronounce, you would starve to death. Quickly.\n\nSecond off: Just because they are \"natural\", does NOT mean they are harmless. Essential oils can ABSOLUTELY harm you if you use them wrong. If you are not a licensed aromatherapist from an institution specializing in the study of essential oils or under the direct care of someone who is, you should 100&#37; NEVER be ingesting them or using them on children. Never.\n\nAlso, your MLM does NOT have the expertise I'm talking about. The woman giving your seminar? She learned from someone else who knew only what the company told her. If she says that \"therapeutic grade oils\" are a thing, she's full of shit. There is no independent agency grading oils. The companies grade themselves, and then mark up the prices based on what they tell you. It's exactly the same as if I baked a load of cookies, then sold some of them to you at $1 a cookie, and then labeled a few of them as \"therapeutic grade cookies\" and sold them at $5 a cookie.\n\nIn addition, essential oils are SO concentrated and manipulated, that many people who work closely with their biochemistry do not consider them to be \"natural\" at all. One drop of essential oil can be the equivalent of DOZENS of boxes of tea. That strength is completely manipulated and no longer \"natural\".\n\nAlso, just because something is \"natural\" does NOT MEAN IT'S HARMLESS!!!!! My God, I am so sick of hearing \"oilers\" say EO's are harmless because they're natural. Poison ivy is natural. Arsenic is natural. SEWAGE is natural.\n\nOver exposure to lavender essential oil can cause abnormal breast growth in boys. Rosemary EO and eucalyptus EO are both seizure triggers. A number of the citrus oils are photosensitizing, which means they can put you in danger of chemical burns when exposed to direct sunlight. A number of essential oils can either cause cross reactions or directly affect the absorption of certain medication/medical treatments or procedures.\n\nEssential oils CAN be useful, but only if you know what the hell you're doing. If you're diffusing more than a couple hours a day, or constantly slathering oils on yourself or your poor child, or ingesting them (or God forbid, making your poor child ingest them), you do NOT know what you're doing.

The silverfish come out of the trees and get onto your roof and then in your attic. Once in your attic they tend to hang out in areas of high moisture like above bathrooms. When they get into your bedroom/bathroom they're escaping from the attic around any opening in your ceiling, such as can lights, exhaust fans, skylights etc. To get rid of them you'll need to cut the trees back away from house and then do a treatment in attic with a bug bomb and residual insecticide to kill whatevers in there.",

There was so much moisture in that apartment (the windows leaked and there was mold growing in the wall).  We reported that as well and it never got fixed.

        "body": "OP I don‚Äôt blame you for reacting that way. \n\nSo a few weeks ago my husband and I went on a road trip for about a week. We tend to do a ton of driving at one time as opposed to breaking the drive up into chunks, especially if we‚Äôre heading back home, so when we get back we‚Äôre usually always ready to fall asleep as soon as we get our belongings in the house and say hi to our pets. \n\nWell this night was no different, except for the fact that we brought all three of our dogs with us so we were extra exhausted after getting them all situated at home again. After we brought them in we went back out to get our things. I decided to go out alone first, and because it was pitch black out I turned on my phones flashlight. To my horror, there were hundreds of cockroaches EVERYWHERE, between both ends of my block and everything in between. I‚Äôm not proud of this, but I‚Äôve got a very huge fear of most bugs, cockroaches being the worst for me.   I ran back in the house the way a child would if the monsters they dream of came alive and started chasing them. I grabbed every can of cockroach spray we owned and I went back out and sprayed every single one I saw. I used up 2 large cans just from the walk from my front door to our car and back. \n\nI was more afraid to go back into the house at this point. I was terrified that since there were hundreds of them out here, there were probably hundreds more in our house, but there‚Äôs no where to run in our house except outside. I stood by our car slowly moving in circles spraying each one I saw, while my husband checked every corner of the house. I‚Äôm so thankful he has no fear of these things or else I wouldn‚Äôt have slept that night. Fortunately, I had one last dose of some prescription sleep medicine of mine I had been saving for a rainy day. _This was a rainy day._ The relief I felt when I realized that I _had_ saved a dose was insane, because I would not have slept that night otherwise. I wasn‚Äôt crying but I was definitely panicking for a while before I finally fell asleep. The roaches where I live typically don‚Äôt come out till late at night so I knew I‚Äôd be safe the next morning. I went outside with my husband and he discovered that someone had dropped a f*ck load of food on the sidewalk, and the roaches were out that night because they were feasting on it. I live in a very busy metro area with a lot of restaurants and foot traffic, and sometimes the visitors we get are inconsiderate and will use the neighborhood as their personal trash can. We‚Äôve been here a year and hadn‚Äôt had anyone drop their food on our block till this time, and now I know what happens when someone does that. I‚Äôm getting chills just thinking about that night. It was so bad. I know what it‚Äôs like to wake up feeling like something is crawling on you, only to find that there was indeed something crawling on you. This didn‚Äôt happen that night as there weren‚Äôt any roaches in the house afterwards, but finding a roach in my bed with me a decade prior had me just slightly traumatized lol. I don‚Äôt blame you for reacting that way.",

I‚Äôm planning on really checking my stuff as I pack but I‚Äôm really worried I can bring them into a new place and still deal with it. My current building definitely has moisture issues and likely mold as another unit has had that issue. Besides the fact people have experienced flooding in their apartments during rain storms.

I feel confident with my knowledge of the store items except the vitamin/HBA section.\n\nCast: \nME: myself\nC: Customer\n\nThis happened months ago, but still sticks out to me. A customer was searching the vitamin/HBA section with a confused look on his face. My line was non-existent so I came over to offer him help. \n\nME: \"Pardon me, sir. Do you need any help looking for something?\"\n\nC: *looks down at the smudged writing on his hand* \"Yupp, do you guys carry essential oils?\"\n\nME: \"Yes, they are over in the aisle to the left near the soaps.\"\n\nC walks over to the essential oils, and I go back to my register and feel accomplished for helping him in the section I know the least about.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, C makes his way to my line and I smile at him. He still looks confused. \n\nME: \"Did you find what you were looking for?\"\n\nC: \"Yupp, my doctor told me I needed Lavender essential oil to help me focus. I have ADHD and need all the focus I can get.\"\n\nME: \"Small world, I have ADHD too! I just take a medicine and do behavioral modification for mine.\"\n\nC: \"My doctor said stimulants don't work, so she said I should rub this stuff (lavender essential oil) on my temples and *BAM* focus!\" \n\nME: \"I hope it works out for you.\"\n\nC: \"So if I just drink it, I should be able to focus even more, right?\"\n\nME: \"Are you being serious?\"\n\nC: \"Yupp, I really need to focus. Is it safe to drink it?\"\n\nME *genuinely dumbstruck*: \"I don't think it is wise to drink essential oils, plus didn't you say the doctor wanted you to rub it on your temples or something?\"\n\nC starts to look disappointed. \n\nC: \"Oh, I thought that would cure it....\"\n\nME: \"Just rub it on your temples, please don't drink it. If you want to drink some lavender, we have some teas with it in the 7 aisle.\"\n\nC puts the lavender essential oil BACK UP and grabs 10 boxs of teas with lavender in them. I really hope he was able to focus and if he finds the real cure for ADHD, I hope he shares it with me.\n\n\nTL;DR  A customer honestly thought he could cure his ADHD with drinking a lavender essential oil. I told him that may be dangerous. He bought 10 boxes of tea with lavender instead.",

    "body": "Hello everyone, this is my first post here (a pretty long one as this was neither easy nor a shortcut) and I wanted to share my experience of overcoming sleep anxiety-maintained insomnia (the most common type).\n\nNone of the below is medical advice and is for information purposes only.\n\n**Back in my insomnia days, if your experience was anything like mine:**\n\n* Your nights are filled with desperate, futile attempts to make yourself sleep.\n* The consequences of awful sleep plague your days: exhaustion, brain fog, and anxiety about the night to come.\n* You stress over how you can have a good life in the future when you are consistently sleeping poorly.\n* Sleep and insomnia weigh heavily on your mind, and you worry about the long-term health effects of living like this.\n* Your sleep problems leave you feeling enormously frustrated, alone, and overwhelmed, and you feel like you‚Äôre ‚Äúnever going to sleep again.‚Äù\n* You keep trying to force sleep to happen, which puts an incredible amount of pressure and makes the situation even worse.\n* You think your insomnia is ‚Äúunique‚Äù and something ‚Äúmust be wrong‚Äù with you.\n* Insomnia has made it hard to be the person you want to be.\n* You obsessively google for ‚Äòthe solution‚Äô only to find unhelpful articles and feel like a ‚Äúfailure.‚Äù\n* You feel trapped in insomnia and are unsure if there is hope for you to move past it because EVERYTHING you‚Äôve tried has failed.\n\nOne common concern I had was about health, so I wanted to spend some time on that first.\n\n**Insomnia Won‚Äôt Kill You‚Äîor Ruin Your Health\\]**\n\nThere is a lot of misinformation on this issue‚Äîand many sensationalized headlines that don‚Äôt represent the facts.\n\nFirst, let‚Äôs discuss the lack of evidence that insomnia increases your risk of death.\n\n**A 2018 meta-analysis of 17 studies examined chronic insomnia and mortality, spanning almost 37 million individuals who were checked on for an average of 11.6 years:**\n\n[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2018.10.004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2018.10.004)\n\nThe meta-analysis found no difference in the odds of mortality for individuals with insomnia symptoms compared to those without.\n\nThere are many reasons to be skeptical of correlation studies making claims about the health effects of insomnia.\n\nFirst, correlation does not prove causation.Insomnia has never been shown to cause any health problems.\n\nThere are some correlations between insomnia and conditions like cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer‚Äôs‚Äîbut correlation is not causation.Just because two things may happen together does not mean one caused the other.\n\nRather than insomnia causing certain diseases, it is reasonable to imagine that people with Alzheimer‚Äôs or cardiovascular disease may have more trouble sleeping because of those conditions, not because poor sleep brought on those diseases.\n\nFurthermore, sleep research often relies on inaccurate self-report data, small sample sizes, or low thresholds of statistical significance that make reproducing and validating the findings difficult.\n\nFor these reasons, it is worth taking sleep research with a grain of salt.\n\nThere is no final answer on the exact links between sleep and health; however, there is plenty of reason to believe that it‚Äôs not as bad as headlines make it out to be.\n\nWorrying about the health impacts of poor sleep makes it even harder to break free from insomnia and have a calm nervous system at night.\n\n**Next, I wanted to talk about something I call \"Sleep Efforts\" - anything we do to \"try\" to make ourselves sleep.**\n\n\"Trying to sleep‚Äù is the problem in the first place.\n\nTo control the process of getting to and staying asleep, we try all sorts of strategies like medication, supplements, bedtime teas, relaxation rituals, sleep hygiene, and more.\n\nSleep Efforts ends up backfiring and making our situation even more frustrating.\n\nWhy?\n\nSleep is a passive biological process that is not controlled by will.\n\nThink of your heartbeat - can you control that?\n\nAttempting to use willpower to force yourself to sleep when you experience wakefulness ends up getting in the way of sleep.\n\nThis is because all that effort signals to your body and mind that there is a threat each night.\n\nEven if certain sleep efforts seem to help in the short term, they never address the root problem of the fear of not sleeping, so they don't work long-term and can't fix insomnia.\n\nIf you ask someone without insomnia what they do to go to sleep, they would likely say something like:\n\n**\"Nothing, I just lie down and fall asleep.\"**\n\nWhen you withdraw from social activities, cut out all caffeine, do nighttime meditation or exercise with the intent to sleep that night, all that does is create more anxiety and anticipation around sleep, which has a stimulating effect on your nervous system.\n\nThis amplifies the vicious cycle of insomnia by making sleeping even harder.Ultimately, we must keep living our lives normally so insomnia doesn't control it.\n\nRemember that you were never in control of this process before you had insomnia.\n\nYou didn't have the hyperarousal and the perceptions, reactions, and behaviors that have made sleep so much more difficult.\n\n**Here are 8 ways we are sabotaging (myself included back then) our sleep during insomnia with Sleep Efforts:**\n\n**1/ Medications, Alchocol, Cannabis etc.**\n\nOne side effect of alcohol, THC, and sleeping pills is that they can interfere with the natural processes in various sleep stages that help you feel restored.\n\nPills and substances also undermine the possibility of you developing confidence in your natural ability to sleep [unassisted.As](http://unassisted.As) long as you are taking these, you can't fully come to believe that sleep will happen to you without any special effort on your part.\n\nThey become a physical symbol of your fear of not sleeping and a reminder of how attached you are to your sleep going a certain way\n\n**2/ Spend extra hours in bed or napping during the day**\n\nYou might try to scrape together some extra sleep by going to bed an hour early or staying in bed after you usually get up.\n\nSpending too long in bed at night sabotages your sleep drive for the next night and interferes with your long-term ability to overcome insomnia.\n\nMake sure to wake up at the same time every day and have an appropriate sleep window of 6.5 to 8 hours (depending on your unique situation).\n\nAdditionally, napping during the day takes away from the sleep drive needed for the night to come.\n\n**3/ Relaxation and Imagination Exercises**\n\nWhen you can't sleep, you try breathing techniques, relaxation exercises, meditation, or imagining a vivid scene.\n\nIf you use any of these intending to force sleep to happen, they won't work.\n\nThere's a fine line between using Mindfulness Meditation in bed to calm the nervous system and relaxation/breathing exercises to \"make yourself sleep\".\n\n**4/ Rituals Before Bed**\n\nYou may have tried a carefully timed bath to drop your body temperature to induce sleep.\n\nOr you could have an evening cup of herbal tea, smell lavender essential oil, or use relaxation techniques for a certain amount of time before bed.\n\nAll these rituals hold you back because they undermine your faith in your natural ability to sleep without effort.\n\n**5 / Avoiding Blue Light**\n\nIf you have insomnia and hear about this rule, you might stop looking at screens several hours before bed and feel pretty uneasy being around screens or lights in the evening.\n\nWhile intense blue light exposure could slightly delay your circadian rhythm, many normal sleepers use screens before bed without negative outcomes.\n\nUltimately, it is not looking at screens at night that is causing your insomnia; it is your anxiety about not sleeping.\n\nIf you use screens before bed, I would suggest not exposing yourself to stressful or overly stimulating content, such as horror movies or news that causes you anxiety.\n\n**6/ Withdrawing from Social Life**\n\nWhen insomnia feels crushing and out of control, it's common to start giving up things in your life to maximize your chances of sleeping.\n\nYou might also feel like you can't handle your life anymore due to fatigue.\n\nHowever, the more you sacrifice parts of your life to manage your insomnia, the more insomnia becomes the center of your life.\n\nThis can leave you feeling even more frustrated, powerless, and anxious.\n\nPutting your life on pause to try to get your insomnia under control increases performance anxiety around sleep because when your life is paused, there are even higher stakes on sleep.\n\nHowever, the situation starts to change as you gain faith that there is a path to overcome insomnia permanently.\n\n**7/ Blaming your inability to sleep on the presence of anxious thoughts and trying desperately to fight or challenge these thoughts.**\n\nIt can be helpful to challenge anxiety-fueling thoughts that may not be realistic.\n\nHowever, if you approach Thought Challenging with an inflexible and desperate intention, thinking that you must make these thoughts go away or your night will be ruined, Thought Challenging might not help calm you down.\n\n**8/ Stopping liquids, avoiding certain foods, exercising to death**\n\nYou may also have rigid rules, such as not drinking water for many hours before bed to avoid waking up to use the toilet at night, or you might avoid certain foods in the evening that you've read \"may\" disrupt sleep.\n\nAnything special that you're doing before bed to prepare for sleep that you wouldn't be doing if you didn't have sleep issues could be considered an unhelpful sleep effort.\n\nAnother common daytime sleep effort is exercising with the sole intent of helping you to sleep later.\n\nWhile exercise is healthy and can promote sleepiness, if you take up a whole new exercise regimen with the intention of it putting you to sleep, you increase the pressure on yourself to sleep.\n\n**Next, I'll describe the framework I used and then the 6 core steps I follwed.**\n\nThis framework can be summed up in a simple way - increasing your **Sleep-Starting Force** (building sleep drive) and decreasing the **Sleep-Stopping Force** (reducing sleep anxiety).\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\n**The Fundamental Importance of the Sleep-Starting Force and the Sleep-Stopping Force**\n\nSo how does sleep work? It‚Äôs actually pretty simple.\n\nThere are only two factors that create sleepiness and allow you to fall asleep and stay asleep.\n\nBoth are biological systems in your body.\n\nThey are the sleep drive and the circadian rhythm.\n\nTogether, they make up what we call the sleep-starting force.\n\nThe first component of the sleep-starting force is the sleep drive.\n\nThe sleep drive is your body‚Äôs natural sleepiness that builds over time the more hours you are [awake.It](http://awake.It) is at its highest point before you go to sleep and then decreases as you sleep.\n\nThe only way to lower your ever-growing sleep drive is to sleep.\n\nSleep is a core biological need that must be met.\n\nNo matter how much you might subjectively struggle with sleep, your sleep drive will not allow you to go without sleep for long periods of time.\n\nThe second component of the sleep-starting force is the circadian rhythm.\n\nThe circadian rhythm is an internal body clock that regulates the sleep-wake cycle and repeats every 24 hours.\n\nYour circadian rhythm helps regulate when you feel sleepy and awake in a predictable manner. It is primarily regulated by when you get up each day.\n\nThis rhythm keeps the body clock consistent.\n\nIt helps you to feel sleepy and to wake up at regular times based on past experience so your body can be prepared.\n\nOnly the sleep drive and the circadian rhythm that make up the sleep-starting force can create sleepiness and allow you to enter into sleep.\n\nNothing outside of you can make you sleep.\n\nNo pills, no tea, no meditating can \"create\" sleep, only these two biological systems can.\n\nThe sleep-starting force puts you to sleep without conscious control over the process.\n\nThat‚Äôs why if you ask someone without insomnia what they do to fall sleep, they often say ‚Äúnothing.‚Äù\n\nFor a little more context, the sleep drive and the circadian rhythm work together to manage your sleepiness.\n\nAs your sleep drive increases during the day, the circadian rhythm helps keep you awake and alert until evening.\n\nAround bedtime, the circadian rhythm and the sleep drive synchronize to create a high level of sleepiness.\n\nThe graph seen here [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fDpvr1DWL0eITbeW2BQgjIeL2YebYG-1/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fDpvr1DWL0eITbeW2BQgjIeL2YebYG-1/view?usp=sharing) shows an individual with sleep drive and circadian rhythm working together to create an ideal sleep window starting at around 11pm.\n\nYour ideal sleep window will be unique to you, based on the circadian rhythm established by your sleep schedule and genetics.\n\nFor example, if you‚Äôre a natural night owl, your circadian rhythm will sync with your growing sleep drive to make you feel sleepy later in the night.\n\nThe only way to make your sleep-starting force stronger is to be awake for long enough before attempting to sleep and to keep a consistent sleep schedule.\n\nBeing awake for a long enough time increases your sleep drive, and keeping a consistent sleep schedule sets your circadian rhythm to help you sleep at the right time.\n\nHaving a strong sleep-starting force each night at bedtime sets the stage to overcome insomnia in the long term and increases your probability of getting good sleep each night.\n\nThe sleep-starting force works without conscious control and allows normal sleepers to sleep easily without a second thought.\n\nSo what gets in the way of this happening for people with insomnia?\n\n**Anxiety and hyperarousal are what get in the way.**\n\n**Together, anxiety and hyperarousal make up what we‚Äôve named the Sleep-Stopping force earlier.**\n\nEven when your sleep-starting force is very strong, and there is a lot of biological pressure to sleep, this can be countered by high levels of anxiety and nervous system hyperarousal‚Äîthe sleep-stopping force.\n\nHyperarousal can override the biological pressure to sleep, at least temporarily.\n\nHyperarousal is meant to protect you from danger, and one way it does this is by suspending sleep so you can stay awake and be vigilant to threats.\n\nLife stressors or just worrying about not being able to sleep can activate the arousal system and keep you awake, even when your body is otherwise ready for sleep.\n\nIn a life-or-death situation, it‚Äôs more important for survival to stay awake than to fall asleep even if you‚Äôre really sleepy, so your body is doing its best to keep you safe.\n\nUnfortunately, in the case of insomnia, your body perceives the danger of not sleeping in a way that prevents you from [sleeping.In](http://sleeping.In) the diagram shown here [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b7NcWbhiTqbKzpYSWDih5Odz13Yu9mb2/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b7NcWbhiTqbKzpYSWDih5Odz13Yu9mb2/view?usp=sharing), you can see the relationship between the sleep-starting force, the sleep-stopping force, and your ability to sleep.\n\nWhen both the sleep-starting force and sleep-stopping force are high, your body is ready to sleep, but a high level of nervous system arousal gets in the way and makes it difficult to sleep.\n\nIf you stay in this state long enough or accumulate multiple nights of poor sleep, eventually you will sleep because your sleep-starting force will grow strong enough to overpower any amount of anxiety and nervous system arousal that you might have.\n\nWhen the sleep-starting force is low and the sleep-stopping force is high, it means that your body is not ready for sleep and your nervous system is not in a sleep-compatible state.\n\nThis combination will make it nearly impossible to fall asleep.\n\nWhen the sleep-starting force and sleep-stopping force are both low, it means you‚Äôre not very anxious or on edge, but your body‚Äôs need for sleep is also not high, so it will be difficult to sleep.\n\nThe ideal state is to have a high sleep-starting force and a low sleep-stopping force. This combination makes for easy and effortless sleep.\n\nYou need to take steps so that you have a strong Sleep-Starting force each night and at the same time lower the Sleep-Stopping force that gets in the way of natural sleep happening.\n\nThat‚Äôs it.Remember, the sleep-starting force comprises your sleep drive and circadian rhythm and represents your body‚Äôs natural tendency to fall and stay asleep.\n\nThe sleep-stopping force is the anxiety and hyperarousal that gets in the way of natural, effortless sleep happening to you.\n\n**Now, let‚Äôs break down the steps I used to end my insomnia.**\n\nFoundationally, you need to stop trying to force sleep to happen.\n\nThis doesn‚Äôt work and aggravates your situation.\n\nAttempts to force sleep to happen are called Sleep Efforts as mentioned earlier.\n\nOnce you identify your own Sleep Efforts and stop unhelpfully trying to force sleep to happen, then sleep becomes easy.\n\nTo decrease sleep anxiety you use mindfulness and mindful acceptance.\n\nThese core tools help create radical inner change so you can work through your sleep anxiety in the day and night.\n\nMindfulness and mindful acceptance are key to breaking free from unhelpful perceptions, reactions, and behaviors that maintain your insomnia.\n\nPart of the framework includes managing anxious thoughts and finding greater freedom from the relentless anxiety that often comes with chronic sleep issues.\n\nYou must also learn new ways to approach your days, even when you‚Äôve slept poorly.\n\nThese help you experience significantly less fear about sleep and will help you become more confident in your resilience.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to also include self-compassion and being kind and understanding with yourself as you go through the ups and downs of working through insomnia.\n\nThe core of the framework also includes critical mindset shifts that will help you strengthen and accelerate your progress.\n\nThese mindset shifts will help you find greater empowerment and escape being victimized by your insomnia.\n\nYou learn how to handle setbacks in your journey and how setbacks are extremely important for solidifying your gains and permanently ending your insomnia.\n\nBy increasing your sleep-starting force and lowering your sleep-stopping force, you will set the stage for great sleep and reverse the factors that have maintained your insomnia.\n\nAlthough it takes some time and commitment for this framework to produce results, with time, your mind and body will relearn that it is safe to sleep.\n\nThen, you can again enjoy a life free from sleep worries and sleep [problems.It](http://problems.It) might be evident by now, but this framework is not for the faint of heart and not for people looking for a quick fix.\n\nYou will come up against all kinds of obstacles, doubts, and frustration in this journey, but if you persist, you will overcome them.\n\n**I followed 6 core steps to recover.**\n\n**Step one is the process, as trivial as it sounds - I understood I have this condition called \"insomnia\".**\n\nAfter going through a stressful period in my life, both personally and professionally, I started having pretty rough nights - but I wasn't paying too much attention to it.\n\nI thought it would \"work itself out\".\n\nIt didn't.\n\nIt only got worse, and I got just a few hours of sleep per night for weeks!‚Äã‚Äã\n\n**Step two, as hard as it was, I had to go through all these other solutions that \"were supposed to\" work.**\n\nHere's a non-exhaustive list (some of these I already touched on earlier):\n\n* Sleep hygiene\n* Herbal teas\n* Bedtime rituals\n* Blackout curtains\n* A weighted blanket\n* Pre-bedtime exercise\n* Carefully timed hot showers\n* Quitting caffeine and alcohol\n* All kinds of so-called ‚Äúsleep hacks‚Äù\n* Pre-bedtime relaxation routines\n* Cutting out water and liquids hours before bed\n* Staying away from screens and blue light before bed\n* Getting a lot of sun in the morning (I thought, ‚Äúthe problem must be low vitamin D levels!‚Äù)\n* B12 supplements and shots (‚ÄúNo, wait‚Ä¶ the real problem is B12 deficiency!‚Äù)\n\nAnd much more.\n\nAnd, last but not least, the **\"Gold Standard\" - CBT-i (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia)**, where I had to exhaust my body into sleep by staying in bed for 5 1/2 hours.\n\nThe problem with all of these was simple:None of them were treating the root cause of insomnia.\n\n**Step three, after years and years of trial and error, suffering & exhaustion, massive opportunity costs, and social isolation, I finally understood what was maintaining my insomnia:**\n\nSleep anxiety (or the fear of sleeplessness)\n\nEverything changed once I addressed that.\n\nStanford scientists have confirmed the real cause of insomnia initially triggered by stress.\n\nThe more we approach the nighttime worried about sleeplessness and the daytime consequences of it, the more the nervous system gets trained to automatically enter a hyperaroused, ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù mode.\n\nAs a result, when bedtime approaches, the body floods with stress [hormones.It](http://hormones.It) can make our mind race with anxious thoughts‚Ä¶ we may feel ‚Äúamped up‚Äù and tense‚Ä¶ and we struggle to get the sleep we want so desperately.\n\nSo if I wanted to end insomnia for good, I needed to lose this ‚Äúsleep anxiety‚Äù, calm my nervous system, and undo the conditioned hyperarousal that made it so hard to sleep.\n\n**Step four, I had to increase my sleep drive (or the Sleep Starting Force).**\n\nFirst, I started having a reasonable sleep window of around 7 hours.\n\nThis worked for me, but for you, it might be less or more (between 6.5 and 8 hours).\n\nSecond, and more importantly, I started being awake for the rest of the time, meaning I had to have my eyes open for 17 hours.\n\nThat means no naps during the day (which, at one point, was extra hard as I was constantly falling asleep on the couch right after the lunch slump).\n\n**Step five, I started building healthy \"sleep habits\" - in other words, I returned to being \"me,\" but just before insomnia.**\n\nFirst, I started having a low-pressure wind-down 1 or 2 hours before bed, where I didn't watch or do anything stimulating.\n\nSecond, I stopped watching the clock at night and didn't wear any sleep trackers.\n\nThird, I stopped forcing sleep to happen as I realized it's a passive biological process we can't control.\n\n**Step six, I had to reduce the sleep anxiety that was maintaining my insomnia or, in other words, reduce my Sleep Stopping Force.**\n\nI started a daily mindfulness meditation practice.\n\nI wasn't that committed at first, but after seeing the benefits, I realized this is a free and easy way to directly influence my insomnia (read: the anxiety) in a positive way.\n\nIf I had some random thoughts like:\n\n\"I can't take this anymore; I can't live like this; this will not end well!\"\n\nI challenged those as they were not grounded in reality.\n\nMy anxious and tired mind was making that up!\n\nThen, when I couldn't sleep in bed, I kept practicing Mindfulness or did a Body Scan exercise.\n\nLast but not least, when I felt like I wouldn't fall asleep as I woke up during the night, I just went to the living room and turned on one of my favorite relaxing YouTube channels to watch before I felt sleepy again.\n\nThen, I had to keep doing what was working to see lasting improvement in my sleep, as it took years of hyper-arousal and learned behaviors (i.e., sleep efforts) that I had to \"un-learn\" before I improved.\n\n\\---\n\nI hope this information is helpful for someone here in case you're also struggling with anxiety-maintained insomnia. Just know, there's a way out, and you can recover too - you can sleep.",

Stir occasionally especially at first to dissolve the salts. Then you literally just wait and let it reduce by about half. You‚Äôre gonna end up cooking away most of the water volume, you COULD just start out with 2 cups of water and only letting it simmer for about 10-15 minutes, but I find that using more water and letting it slowly reduce gets a lot more of the mucilage out of the seeds. I‚Äôve made it with less water and cooking it less before, and this method of using more water and letting it reduce made the BEST most strong hold gel I‚Äôve ever tried. Even compared to store bought gels like my Aussie instant freeze‚Ä¶ I think the Epsom salts also help a ton with adding hold.\n\nThe manuka honey  and essential oils you wanna add AFTER you cook it all. I just strain directly into a large measuring cup, then add the honey and EO, and mix throughly, then I let it cool and transfer into a jar, this recipe makes about 8 oz for me which is perfect to go through in about 3 weeks which is how long it keeps in the fridge :)\n\nI am so happy with how this batch turned out cus I feel like my hair is the most defined it‚Äôs ever been. Literally NO frizz. I didn‚Äôt even brush style or anything and all I applied under the gel is a bit of leave in (the blue one from ouidad I forget what it‚Äôs called.) - my hair is also super shiny and soft, and isn‚Äôt weighed down or with any of that crispy feeling I get from a lot of gels and mousses!",

The idea is to focus on each muscle group, relax it, and then move to the next one.\n  \n2. **Breathing and Visualization**: Deep, slow breathing is combined with visualizing a relaxing scene, such as lying in a hammock or floating on a cloud. This helps calm the mind.\n\n3. **Clearing the Mind**: For 10 seconds, the goal is to keep the mind completely clear. If thoughts intrude, they are dismissed, and the focus is returned to breathing and relaxation.\n\nThis method, developed from techniques used in military training, aims to reduce stress and enable a person to fall asleep in potentially uncomfortable or disruptive environments.

All the suggestions to listen to an audio book, or try meditation are great, but don't do those things in your bed. Your bed is not for lying awake, your bed is for sleep. If you haven't fallen asleep after 20 minutes of lying there (you have to estimate this, don't just stare at the clock) get up and do a quiet activity like meditation for a few minutes. Then try lying in bed again. Repeat until you fall asleep.\n\nAs others have suggested, sleep hygiene is really important, sleeping in a cold room, dim lights in the evening, etc.\n\nFinally, if your doctor doesn't understand the health impact of short sleep then it's time to get a new doctor.",

If you're not willing to do this, don't bother with any of the other steps.\n\nDon't go to bed unless you feel like you'll be able to fall asleep. Laying there just staring and stressing about falling asleep is very counterproductive. Get up instead, do something relaxing for an hour and try again later.\n\nWhen you're in bed, don't think about and fret over stressful or frustrating things. Practice mindblanking or meditative practices, such as imagining yourself taking the stressful issue, putting it in a box and storing it away. Keep doing it until there are no more distracting thoughts. Once those thoughts are banished, count your breathing until 100. Alternately you can try recollecting things from your favorite fiction TV series, books or other media, I find that engrossing yourself in mundane imaginary things encourages drifting off to sleep.\n\nDo whatever you can to lower the temperature in your bedroom, it's easier to sleep when it's a little chilly but you're tucked in an comfy. Consider thinner covers, if that's what it takes to be comfortable.\n\nDownload a phone-app to record you at night, to record you for snoring, tossing/turning or sleep apnea, for example SnoreLab. Since you're asleep when it happens, recording it and reviewing later is the best way to self-diagnose. Considering what you describe, **I highly recommend you do this to eliminate the possibility of heavy snoring/sleep apnea**.\n\nConsider a body pillow, and sleep sideways with your knees bent, body pillow tucked in between, and your arms wrapped around it.\n\nConsider a weighted blanket. Having the extra weight wrapped around you helps create a comforting, calming atmosphere.\n\nTuck up your phone with some youtube video you find relaxing (if you can do it in an ad-free way).

    "body": "Our Denji was 4 years old; he was always very active, healthy, and happy. In May, he woke up one day feeling down and had no appetite. The vet diagnosed him with Stage 4 CKD, and he spent the entire month of May undergoing treatment to see if his levels would go down. \nA week ago, we repeated his tests, and there wasn't a major change. We agreed that next Monday I would take him for an ultrasound because his kidneys felt swollen. \n\nOn Wednesday, he came out of hiding, ate well, played a little, and went to sleep. On Thursday, he didn't eat anything, and at night he was breathing heavily, so yesterday morning I took him to the vet. They did an ultrasound, and he basically told us there was no point in continuing the medication because one of his kidneys was no longer working and his liver was also about to fail, so it was time to talk about making the decision to let him go.  \nWe had already prepared ourselves for the news, so we decided to hospitalize him that afternoon so he could be hydrated and given vitamins.\nBefore leaving him, I spoke with him and told him I was only going to leave him there for a few hours. I would come back for him and take him home. We would make him comfortable, and my wife and I would talk about setting a date that week. \n\nWhen we returned at 7:00 a.m., the vet said he was able to eat on his own, that there was no need to force him, and he seemed happy to be out of his cage. When he saw us, he seemed agitated to see them and I saw that he wanted to vomit, so we thought he was nauseous. \nWe got in the car, and I took him out of his carrier to wrap him in his blanket. I began to notice that he was breathing faster and more labored. My wife returned to the vet because they were about to close, and in the car, I noticed how his tongue was turning pale. He began to cry and move his little paws desperately, as if he couldn't breathe. \nI ran to the vet with him in my arms, and the doctor examined him and said one of his lungs had collapsed. He said we could intubate him or just let him go. \n\nI saw my Denji lying on the table, desperate and \ncrying. It wasn't a matter of thinking about it much, so we asked him to put him to sleep quickly so he would stop suffering. He hurried, and the injection didn't take more than 15 seconds to take effect. \nI saw his little eyes begin to fade and his body begin to relax. I cried and told him that I promised I would come back for him, and he was just waiting for us to keep our promise so he could say goodbye and leave. \n\nAfter he passed away, my wife and I went to the beach that night with him in our arms to listen to the waves.  After that, we went to Office Depot and bought some clay so we could have a memory of his paw. \nWe went home, laid him on a sheet with flowers, put lavender essential oil on him, combed his hair, cried, and one of his brothers lay with him for a while. \nWe were able to say our goodbyes until 4:00 AM. The smell of his fluids was starting to get strong, so he couldn't sleep with us. We put him in a box and placed him on his favorite scratching post.\n\nAround 9:00 AM, the crematorium service came to pick him up so we could have his ashes this Monday. I'm still processing this, and I feel like he should have died more peacefully because I wanted to avoid his suffering. \nIf I had known it was his last day, I wouldn't have let him. I had bought him a couple of pouches of wet food that he liked, so he could eat whatever he wanted without a prescription or medication. I still have the pouch I bought him. I see his medication and his new kidney kibble.  \n\nThere are many memories in the house, but we know that he was a very beloved cat and that he loved us so much that in the end he just waited for us to say goodbye.",

About every 6 months we have had to do this and her creatinine went from seven or eight all the way down to two and she was back to her normal self. it was only two weeks ago that she was jumping in and out the window and was playful and had the zoomies. These last two weeks have been hell for both of us.. she crashed over a period of about 48 hours and by the time I took her to the vet, her creatinine was 8.5 and we have been aggressively trying to get it down with daily fluid therapy and then if I give her a break from that she goes right back up. She is now having difficulty walking and I've had some heartbreaking talk with the vets. I'm trying to make it nice space for her now to enjoy her last days or weeks and I don't want her to suffer anymore, but I feel like she's not quite ready yet.

Part of this is living in Florida, where it's as close to 100% humidity as possible and feet are always funky. Part of it is being on my feet every hour of the day at work. \n\nTo combat this issue of prematurely gucky shoes, I've been buying super cheap insoles and swapping them into my daily shoe every morning. I've been buying the \"Dr. Scholl's Odor-X\" liner, or something similar (see link below). Doing this is keeping my shoes SO much fresher.\n\nAnother thing I've done to keep shoe funk at bay is diy foot powder. I looked into buying some at the store, but the ingredients show it's really just corn starch with some added fragrance and anti-caking agents. I've instead mixed up some corn starch with a teeeeeeny bit of lavender essential oil, and dusting my feet when I get out of the shower each morning.\n\nAnyways, just thought I'd share in case any of you ladies deal with foot funk ruining your favorite flats! \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Dr-Scholls-Fighting-Insoles-Packages/dp/B001EPQ9IM/ref=pd_sim_121_2?ie=UTF8&dpID=41OhU3alZEL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR160%2C160_&psc=1&refRID=FJZJ8S367YS7C4H0H5CR",

    "body": "About two or three weeks ago, I started using a form of self-training to manage and eventually eliminate my dermatillomania. The best way to describe it is ‚ÄúNegative Pavlov Training,‚Äù though the proper term is aversion conditioning.\n\nIt all started with a conversation I had with ChatGPT. I told him I wanted to completely stop picking at my skin, but at first, he suggested redirection methods, like picking at a piece of fabric instead. I was curious about that idea, so I asked him to explain more. He mentioned adding calming scents, like lavender essential oil, to create a relaxing experience.\n\nBut I didn‚Äôt want to associate the behavior with something calming. I wanted to get rid of it. So I said, ‚ÄúWhat if I used fart spray instead?‚Äù It was a half joke. Something said completely out of a crazy random thought, but this idea turned out to be something with real basis and structure, so we refined it to then arrive at white vinegar. We created a whole list of possible steps if the white vinegar stopped working, but it never did. \n\nEven though I was heading into finals and stress was piling up, I still went ahead with the plan. I was worried it might overwhelm me, but it was pretty easy to implement and didn‚Äôt add any extra stress. It was quick, simple, and gently disruptive.\n\nI now carry a small jar of white vinegar with me at all times. It‚Äôs portable and fits in my palm. \n\nI have to add a note of caution: avoid metal lids, as vinegar can corrode metal, affecting both the seal and the scent. My first jar had a metal lid, and after two weeks, the smell weakened and turned metallic, and it wasn't sharp anymore. \n\nWhenever I pick, am about to pick, or feel the urge, I take a whiff from the jar. The sting jolts me out of the automatic, mindless state and helps me stop.\n\nFor me, this method is a 10 out of 10. When you‚Äôre trying to recover from dermatillomania and feel like your body moves on its own, this technique brings back awareness. Within the first week, people were already noticing my skin was clearing up. \n\nIf you're serious about stopping, if you want to feel in control, I wholeheartedly recommend this method. It‚Äôs simple, effective, and empowering.\n\nFor more info, you can look up habit reversal training and cognitive behavioral therapy. \n\nEdit: I posted a picture of the jar on my personal profile since this sub doesn't allow posting media.

You wear a cast until your bone is healed enough to not. Once removed, it might be uncomfortable or weaker for a while, but eventually you can move like you did before. I think this is more a mental trauma related way of thinking of treatment though.

It's pretty good, definitely has blueberry in it. She tells me it's also lavender flavored. Fine, awesome! We did lavender syrups where I used to work made with literal lavender steeped in sugar. My mistake was thinking that was what they did here (remember, all organic, homemade bullshit, right?).\n\nYou can probably see where this is going. I order the smoothie because it's a special and I need some blueberries in my life. Drink it, fine, go back to work. I come in the next week, and read the special board. That smoothie was, you guessed it, made with DoTerra lavender essential oil. Y'all. They put lavender essential oils into my _drink_. Not. Okay. And it hadn't been disclosed when I drank the sample last week.\n\nParents have probably ordered that smoothie special for their _kids_. And upon further inspection, I realize that the whole shop is selling MLM products. There's a promotional area with DoTerra's bs sprays and another area with CBD oil on sale. How is this even allowed? I was under the impression that MLM contracts don't allow products to be sold in a physical storefront. Guess I was wrong.\n\n",

    "body": "This is my first post ‚Äî on RedditüòÇ ‚Äî so bear with me. To start, from about October of 2015 to December of 2015, I suffered from 6 extreme nocturnal panic attacks. I would wake up in the middle of the night, typically about 2 hours after I had fallen asleep, and would be having an all-out panic attack. More specifically, I would be in complete and utter fear of being on the verge of insanity/death and would eventually vomit. Some of the worst parts were that I was half asleep, I would not know what had triggered the panic attack, and I was in complete darkness. However, after much personal research, I came up with a hefty yet effective solution ‚Äî a nightly routine. Before I begin, I should also mention that in the past, I would wake up anywhere from 3-7 times a night but would quickly fall back to sleep. Therefore, after my 6th and final nocturnal panic attack, I researched how to stay asleep and how to calm my anxious and panic-provoking mind down before bed. I will now go in-depth about my routine:\n\nI begin by plugging in my phone thirty minutes before bed. A study done by the National Center for Biotechnology information found that \"frequent use of cell phones around bedtime is associated with repeated awakenings\" ‚Äî I want to stay asleep to help prevent these nocturnal attacks, not wake up. The artificial light emitted from your cellphone simply convinces your body's internal clock that it is daytime, resulting in repeated awakenings. I should also quickly mention that I try not to sleep next to my phone; I plug it in across the room to prevent myself from mindlessly waking up and checking social media, texts, etc. Anyways, the next step in my routine is to stretch. I myself have found that stretching before bed unknowingly relaxes me. Next, I layout my clothes. Then, I continue my routine by inhaling lavender essential oils ‚Äî an oil that induces sleep. This essential oil proves to be much more natural than sleep-inducing substances such as NyQuil or Benadryl (I will attach a link at the bottom with more information about lavender oil). Next, I lay in bed and read a book until I naturally get sleepy. Finally, I turn on an app known as 'Rain' and listen to exactly that ‚Äî rain. This may sound strange to some, but rain is a good example of white noise. White noise \"creates a masking effect, blocking out those sudden changes that awaken light sleepers.\" However, it's important to note that this doesn't include falling asleep to the television or fast-paced music! Anyways, this concludes my current routine that I still practice today. All in all, this basic routine that I have explored above enacts a powerful inner effect on my mind and body that it is time to sleep, and STAY asleep.\n\nHowever, in the very beginning of my self-treatment, I had a much longer routine (simply because I was much more fearful in the beginning).  I will now mention some additional habits I once had that helped me in the very beginning of my suffering. In the past I would consume a sleep-inducing mixture of 8 ounces of warm milk, 2 teaspoons of honey, and 1/8 teaspoon of ground nutmeg (I will provide a link to this mixed drink below that has more information about each ingredient and its effects on the brain). Also, before bed, I would occasionally jog for 30-45 minutes when I faced unusual sums of fear that night. This exercise would completely exhaust my body so much that it would not have the energy to flip on my \"flight or fight mode\" switch and would help to keep me at rest for the whole night. However, it is important to note that these extreme practices became unnecessary at a certain point in time ‚Äî they were simply my extreme solutions to the overwhelming fear I faced in the very beginning of my struggle. Overtime, due to my diminishing fears and the fact that I hadn't had a panic attack in so long, I slowly began to let go of these practices each night. \n\nI am proud to say that after starting the entirety of this routine I have not had ONE nocturnal panic attack since. I hope this post finds its way to any individual suffering from nocturnal panic attacks or even a curious reader :).

After therapy and meds and self help apps, I did get better. However, COVID pandemic messed it up and now I feel like I'm back at square one. Even worse, I'm waking up every night for the past month at exactly 2:27am and don't fall back to sleep until 4:30am. Everything I learned on managing my anxiety is only helping a little bit. My calm app and PMR (PROGRESSIVE MUSCLE RELAXATION) don't help much anymore. I wish I can sleep again all night like before. I agree that lavender does help. But in my case, it's not helping anymore. Tried stretches and yoga but nothing. It's 3:32am as I'm writing this and yup, still up feeling like an impending doom is happening. Writing this does help tho so that's a plus! So I understand all that you guys are going through and wish I knew how to help all of us. I wish even more there was a definite cure for this BS. I hope you all get better soon and can manage these awful crappy feelings.",

I am up all night and I go to bed when the sun comes up which causes me to not have a good sleep pattern that have me waking up every two hrs. I been drinking a lot of caffeine and no water. I have not been excersing at all. But I woke up after sleeping and hour, heart pounding, dry mouth for a brief moment, sweating, and the thought I was dying or something bad was happening to me. I got clammy, and cold, my stomach starts to hurt. I kinda start to feel that surge of a heat flash coming and feeling so off. I tried standing and I felt light headed. I finally had to breath and watch something on my phone to calm myself. I felt like nothing would help me and I wanted to scream for help or begg someone to take me to the ER. But I was so afraid to fall back asleep. I eventually did and I didn't have another one till two weeks later. And of course, no sleep, sleeping schedule way off, lots caffeine, and very stressed out over life and struggles. I came on here and read these and I kinda came to the conclusion they are maybe nocturnal panic attacks. Cause I don't feel these during the day. I do have a history of them since I was a child. And I've learned there are different kinds of panic attacks . I hate this kind. I'd rather have the shakes and feeling my throat is closed, then waking up feeling like I'm dying with all these physical symptoms. Sorry so long.",

I was getting like 2 hours of sleep a night and was actively hallucinating and vomitig/diarrhea from sleeplessness.\n\nWhat cured them, or at least is actively curing them, for me:\n\n1. Prozac, 20mg, once a day\n\n2. Ativan, .5mg, taken nightly the first four weeks of taking Prozac to break the brain-body connection my idiotic brain decided to form between sleeping/going into my bedroom and panic, and while the Prozac built up to its full efficacy. No problem tapering them back off, no crazy reddit-lies list of insane \"evil benzo\" side effects. I use them as needed now. Ignore anyone who tries to give you a single drop of grief about needing benzos, per my very, very well educated psychiatrist\n\n3. Carvedilol, 3.25 mg once daily, a beta blocker. Blocks excess adrenaline from affecting the heart (screw you brain, can't get anxious if I can't receive the signals :D)\n\nLiterally nothing else worked. No amount of CBT tools from my past experiences with GAD, no amount of distracting, nothing. Unfortunately, my body is DETERMINED to dump cortisone and adrenaline at 10pm, and only medications can make it stop. Now why is it doing that? Who knows. I ran out of money for doctors lol, that's my next goal to figure out. \n\nThere's hope. See your PCP, they can start you on the right mess. Shit gets better. Good luck.",

Next moment, I feel an electric shock radiate up from my gut to my chest and brain; then I wake up in a panic with a pounding heart and gasping for air. I'm able to calm myself down by acknowledging there is nothing wrong, but it's difficult to fall back asleep. On the precipice of drifting back asleep, I'll get a panic rush (e.g., \"you've stopped breathing!\") and my heart will start pounding again.  I sit up, calm down, and try again.\n\nI've found two pharmaceutical interventions that help: 1) Half a Xanax, which you don't want to take more than once or twice in a blue moon. It just vaporizes the urges that rise up from my brain stem and trigger panic attacks. 2) Piracetam, which is generally not prescribed in the U.S. but is available as a supplement, seems to also suppress the panic impulses. I take three 00-size pills before bed if I've had an episode recently, and always sleep through the night.\n\nSpending time with family before bed, or reading a book, instead of locked into devices or social media, might also help. But I am generally not an anxious or stressed person.  Nocturnal panic attacks are a physiological phenomenon, as far as I'm concerned.  They just happen and it's difficult to prevent through behavior alone. I've done sleep studies and have no apnea. It's just a weird quirk of the nervous system, it seems.",

    "body": "Sorry if this is a bit long, but I really need to get this out. TLDR at the bottom.\n\nI found out the hard way today that I'm allergic to lavender. I'm a dog groomer, and we have a YL Hun that brings in her yorkie for grooming. He's an absolute psycho for his nails and pawpads. She also only brings him in every 5-ish months, so he's never going to get better for it. After his first groom, we told her how he acted (in nicer words than \"psycho\") and suggested she bring him in every couple weeks for nail trims so he can get used to the process and eventually settle down. \n\nShe didn't do that. Instead, the next time he came in, she handed him off to me since he was my groom that day, pulled out a bottle and doused his feet in undiluted lavender essential oil to \"keep him calm.\"  I assumed the breathing problems and burning in my lungs and throat were because it was so strong. Unfortunately, my boss believes in essential oils and that they cure most things, so I couldn't tell her not to do it again or that it was very bad for the dog. Instead, I just took him straight to the tub and washed that crap off with dawn dishsoap the moment she was out the door. (I was able to get away with that by saying it was too strong and giving me a headache, which wasn't a lie. And that kind of oil is incredibly bad for our equipment so I couldn't do any kind of pre-work on him with it still on and very wet.) Unsurprisingly, it didn't keep him calm. He was still psycho for his feet, and I told the owner that when she asked at pick up.\n\nFast forward to this afternoon. One of my coworkers had him today. She's also an EO enthusiast. This time, the Hun had put the oil on him at home so it could soak in before his groom. So instead of washing him immediately, my coworker puts him on the table and starts doing the normal pre-bath stuff. She gets to his nails, and of course he starts acting up. So she needs help holding him. I put my dog down in a playpen and go over to hold the yorkie so she can get his nails done. (Important note here... we almost exclusively dremel nails. It's safer. You're less likely to quick the dog and traumatize it. However, it does create a lot of nail dust in the process.) While the smell wasn't nearly as strong this time, I almost immediately notice that my nose starts burning. And then my throat, and my lungs. And I couldn't breathe properly. And it set in quickly enough that my coworker was barely through just the back feet before she stopped to ask if I was about to pass out. I ended up having to leave the building to be able to breathe. And stayed out there until she had that dog washed and her area vacuumed.\n\nMy boss told the Hun what happened when she came to pick up the dog and asked her not to put it on the dog before grooms anymore. And I will never, ever forget what she said. \"Oh, you can't be allergic to it. It's Young Living. It's a pure essential oil. You must be asthmatic. It was just detoxing your lungs.\" I'm not asthmatic in any way. I rarely ever get any respiratory illnesses. Thankfully, I was on my last dog for the day, because I still wasn't breathing quite right. I immediately took some benadryl when I got home. \n\nTLDR - Hun puts lavender oil on her dog to \"keep it calm.\" Doesn't keep it calm and turns out, I'm allergic to lavender. Hun claims I can't be allergic and the oil was just \"detoxing my lungs\" which is why I couldn't breathe.",

Animal Control also ended up pressing criminal charges for *felony-level animal neglect and cruelty*; psycho sadist MIL ended up serving time. \n\nI wonder if that undiluted lavender bullshit was applied to poor doggo‚Äôs paw pads, and that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs so tender and defensive of that area.

    "body": "This recipe has been honed and tweaked over the course of 18 months and is now at a point where I think it's about as good as it's going to get. There are 2 steps - the flavour base and the syrup base. The flavour base ideally should be made and left to age for 3 weeks before using to allow the oils to really mature together to get the flavour going. The syrup base should be left for 3 days at a minimum to age as well.\n\n**Flavour Base**\n\n* 250ml 95% alcohol\n* 7.5ml orange essential oil\n* 7ml lime essential oil\n* 2ml lemon essential oil\n* 1.5ml nutmeg essential oil\n* 0.75ml cassia essential oil\n* 0.5ml coriander essential oil\n* 0.5ml neroli essential oil (can substitute petitgrain if neroli is too expensive)\n* 0.25ml lavender essential oil\n\nSeal in an airtight bottle, shake well to mix and leave in a cool, dark cupboard for 3 weeks. This flavour base will make around 135 litres of cordial, so it goes a very long way.\n\n**Syrup Base (makes 1 litre of cordial)**\n\n* 800g white sugar\n* 500ml water\n* 10ml lime juice\n* 10ml glycerine\n* 10ml E150d\n* 3ml phosphoric acid 75% (or 2.5g citric acid)\n* 350mg caffeine powder\n* 2ml Flavour Base\n\nAdd the caffeine powder to a small heatproof bowl (I use a mortar and pestle). Pour about 50ml of just off the boil water over the caffeine powder and use the pestle to mix it into the water throughly and remove any lumps.\n\nAdd the sugar to a large heatproof bowl and pour over the remainder of the water, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Add the caffeine, acid, E150d and glycerine.\n\nOnce cooled, add the lime juice and flavour base. Bottle and seal. Allow the cordial to mature for at least 3 days before using.\n\nDilute 1:7 with sparkling water to drink.\n\nI find this is just about right for me, but you can play with the lime juice amount to taste, add a bit of vanilla to round it off if you like, or add other flavours like raspberry or cherry. I'll be adding instructions on how to do this later on.",

    "body": "Hi everybody!! I've been fully obsessed with indies for the last year (this community saved me from going crazy in this pandemic!) and have started to amass quite the collection - particularly from my #1 favorite house, Solstice Scents. I totally get why the brand is so well-loved here. The aesthetic, the blends, everything about Solstice just does it for me. I've got the best hit rate with them, bar none. At least of the houses I've tried so far. I've been meaning to do this for a while but I just keep collecting more samples üòÖ\n\nA bit about my tastes - I'm a certified vanilla freak. I also love woods, green scents, atmospherics, ambers, gourmands...the list goes on. I'm open to a lot.  My biggest death notes are licorice, marshmallow, and red musk.\n\nI'm rating everything according to my own personal taste and wearability. Everything I've tried is very well blended, true to description, and would work for someone. I have a mix of EDPs and oils, I'll indicate which I have for each. If I've got a scent in both formats I'll write how they differ. The longevity for all of these is about the same between oils and EDPs, btw. 3-4 hours for oils and 5-6 hours for EDP, unless otherwise specified. All right, buckle up, people. Here we go!\n\n\\-**Cardamom Rose Sugar** *(Brown Sugar, Cardamom EO, Moroccan Rose, and Bulgarian Rose)* I hate to start off on a bad note (no pun intended) but this is one of the few scents that did not work for me at all. I found the rose to be metallic and sharp, mixed with cloying maple syrup. The cardamom is there and it is SPICY. It's spot-on, I think I just like the smell of cardamom + rose + sugar less than I thought I would. I have this in oil format. 4/10\n\n\\-**Conjure** *(Vanilla, Amber, Cedar, Spices, & Cauldron Smoke)* The ultimate Stevie Nicks-long-hair-flowing-dress-casting spells scent. When I first got it it was nothing but a baby powder bomb, as I had read in other reviews. I heeded the advice of just leaving it alone for \\~6 weeks and this baby transformed. It went from one note powder to a layered, perfectly balanced witch scent. And it keeps getting better with age! The spices are punchy, mostly allspice. Not too heavy on clove. The smoke is subtle and not BBQ at all. It dries down to a slightly powdery amber/woody vanilla. I love it but I don't reach for it much, honestly. I wear it when I do rituals or dress like Stevie üòÇ I have this in oil. 8/10\n\n\\-**Foxcroft** *(Decaying Leaves, Rich Black Soil, Dry Leaves, Fall Air, Woods, Chimney Smoke)* It's love. It's the perfect sweet spot of accurate atmospheric and something I actually want on my body. I don't find it weird or off-putting at all, even though it is incredibly realistic. If you want a hyperrealistic leaves, dirt, air, and smoke scent, this is it. There is a slight sweetness underneath everything but I feel like decaying leaves have a sweetness to them. I wouldn't say it's overly sweet though - it actually has slight cologne-y vibes. It kind of reminds me of Terre d'Hermes for some reason, just less citrusy. I bet it would be great for layering, I'm excited to try different combinations. I wore this while out biking the other night and I could smell Foxcroft on my neck mixing with the actual smell of crisp night air and it was heavenly. I want a full size badly. I have a sample in EDP, I find the longevity to be a bit on the lower side. 10/10\n\n\\-**Foxcroft Fairgrounds** *(Cotton Candy, Cream Soda, Vanilla Taffy, Funnel Cakes, Powdered Sugar, Crisp Fall Air, Woodsmoke, Incense)* My baby. My absolute darling. I picked this up just because of how much everyone raved about it- I mostly saw it as a novelty and had low expectations. It did need to rest, when I sampled out of the mail it was a very flat cherry coke smell. After two weeks, though...oh my god. I wear it almost every day; it's the perfect fall/winter scent. So complex, so unique. I slathered on so much that I went through 5 ml oil in 3 weeks!! I actually just bit the bullet and picked up a 60 ml EDP as a birthday present to myself. So I've got it in both formats - I'd say the oil is much heavier on the greasy funnel cake smell as the opener. It's kinda trashy, but I like it. Both have the cream soda smell in the opening as well. To me, the EDP has a bit more of that Foxcroft air smell. They both dry down about the same - a sweet, dark cotton candy incense. The oil might be a little spicier as well. I love both formats and I REALLY love both at the same time. Funny how the most unexpected frags can become HGs. I get so many compliments on this one. DROWN ME IN A VAT OF FOXCROFT FAIRGROUNDS 10/10\n\nSide note: Foxcroft + Foxcroft Fairgrounds is predictably incredible. I have thought to myself that the only way to make FF more perfect is to add just a hint more of that fall air and dead leaves...and I was goddamn right. I'm wearing them together right now and the combination makes my eyes roll in the back of my head. I feel like that Vince McMahon meme. 10/10!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\\-**Gibbon's Mischief Night** *(Sugar Cookies, Vanilla Frosting, White Chocolate Popcorn, Toasted Marshmallow, Graham Crackers, Gibbon's Boarding School, Cream Soda, Bourbon, Pear Brandy)* Ok, this one was 100% the dark horse of the bunch. Even after I'd come around to gourmands, this sounded way too candy and over the top to me. I would have never picked this on my own but I received a small decant of the burnishing glace as a freebie in a swap. You guys...I love it. I love smelling like yummy popcorn and chocolate and just a hint of fruity booze and woods. The marshmallow is inoffensive, must be that it's toasted. I really like wearing it when I'm laying around watching TV and - what else - eating snacks. Seriously considered grabbing a 5 ml...I might just have to. I have this in glace format and the longevity and throw seem lower but I'm not putting on very much. 9/10\n\n\\-**High Noon** *(Worn Holster Leather, Tobacco, Whiskey, Woods, Sand, Gunsmoke, Musk & Soft Ladies' Perfume)* I picked this up mostly for the leather and woods. Ya girl loves a good leather. I was a bit scared of the whiskey note, I have to say. I generally don't like the smell of booze and I reeeeeally don't like whiskey, even to drink. I was shocked by how much I love this! The whiskey is very prominent in the open but it's so pleasant??? I honestly couldn't believe it. It's definitely booze-y and identifiably whiskey but...not gross? LOL I don't know how else to describe it. The (very pleasant!) whiskey note dissipates pretty quickly and leaves a beautiful mix of dry woods (maybe I'm getting the sand as well?), soft skin musk, and the lightest wisp of perfume. A stunningly subtle \"your skin but better\" scent with just the slightest edge. I wear this when I want to feel like a rootin-tootin, rough-n-tumble, sexy saloon barmaid. Will likely pick up a 5 ml at some point. I have this in oil. 9/10\n\n\\-**Lace Draped Spectre** *(Vanilla Musk, Spicy Pink Carnation, Pink Pepper, Rose, White Musk)* Do you want to feel like the unmoored spirit of a Victorian lady, cursed to haunt the halls of a dilapidated old mansion for all eternity? Of course you! LDS opens with just a tickle of pink pepper and spice. The carnation has a little kick but it's gentle, and the vanilla and white musks soften it even more in the dry down. Occasionally I'll get the barest hint of rose, like a whisper. I had been looking for a good carnation and this fits the bill. It's just so lovely and I plan to get a 5 ml. I have this in oil. 9/10\n\n\\-**Lavender Vanilla** *(Lavender Essential Oil & Sweet Creamy Vanilla)* Sadly one of my bigger disappointments. I had been really looking forward to this one because I looove Hex's Wuthering Heights and was excited for more lavender vanilla goodness. The lavender in this is nice, a bit more herbal. But the vanilla...I swear there's marshmallow in there. How I wish I loved marshmallow. It's frickin' everywhere. Alas, I hate it. It reminds me of condoms. Anyway, the vanilla is just too marshmallow. I was bummed, I wanted to love this. It's definitely pretty and if you don't mind a marshmallow, I'm sure you'd love this. I've worn this to sleep before but rarely. I'll use up my sample eventually and just stick to Wuthering Heights. I have this in oil. 4/10\n\n\\-**Manor** *(Woody-Vanilla Musk, Vanilla, Agarwood \\[Oud\\], Sandalwood)* Believe the hype, people. This is the first Solstice Scents I ever tried and I was hooked immediately. This is a straightforward, beautiful scent. Spicy oud and gorgeous, elegant vanilla. The hint of smoky sandalwood incense rounds it out and is just so lovely. Not much else to say about it that hasn't been said before. I have EDP samples and full size in oil. I'd say the oil has a bit of a \"spicier\" opening, while the EDP is smoother. I find the dry down identical. 10/10\n\n\\-**Master Bedroom** *(Soft Skin Musk, Sandalwood EO, Amber, Clove EO, Somalian Myrrh EO, Vanilla, Aged Patchouli EO and Champaca Absolute)* This smells super complex rich, and spicy at first...then goes a bit flat. And very powdery. For such heavy, imposing sounding notes there's something I almost find...thin about it? That's the only way I could describe it. In the longer description on the site, there's mention of an anise-like aspect; thankfully, I don't get too much of that but if I focus I can find it - and I don't like it.  It's a shame, the notes made it sound like a sure winner for me. The dry down is pleasant enough, actually. Nice fuzzy skin musk and powder. I still don't love it, though. I got it in EDP. 6/10\n\n\\-**Midnight Marquee** *(Black Musk, Gasoline, Supple Leather, Earth, Tobacco, Moss, Leaves, Foxcroft Air, Vanilla Musk)* I lusted after this one for months and waited with bated breath for the autumn release. I love weird atmospherics (Fantome's Namba is a fav of mine) and was very intrigued by the gasoline note. And, as mentioned earlier, I love a good leather. So I had high hopes for this one. Y'all, it delivered. It's super smooth and artfully blended. It smells very high-end to me. The gasoline note is present in the open but not headache-inducing or gross at all. It fades and mixes into the leather and musk. It's a beautiful suede shoe kind of leather, not sharp or synthetic smelling. I get the moss, leaves, and Foxcroft but I don't get much of the vanilla musk or tobacco. I expected a hint of sweetness from both but no, I think it's more of a subtle rounding out. I might layer it with another vanilla just to see. But I really like it as is, it makes me feel tough and cool. Will have to full size sometime. I have it in EDP. 9/10\n\n\\-**Mountain Vanilla** *(Sweet Clover, Coumarin, Vanilla Musk, Fresh Green Accord, Poplar Buds, Morning Dew)* I really wanted to love this one. I like green scents, I like vanilla. What could go wrong? I don't know. There's something here I don't love. The opening is slightly mentholated, which I'm not crazy about. Even after that fades, though, there's something that just smells a little off to me. I haven't tried this on a warm spring day while trundling through a field, maybe that's the key? I've only tried it on dreary, cold days. I haven't given up yet but as it stands...4/10. Have it in oil.\n\n\\-**Nightgown** (Vanilla, White Chocolate, Tuberose & Tiare Flowers) This one was a bit of a reach for me, I don't wear toooo many florals usually, at least not straight-up florals. But I wanted to try it. I liked the top notes especially, it's really like sticking your nose in a bouquet of white flowers. The white chocolate and vanilla make it very creamy. The florals went ever so slightly soapy on me during the dry down but not irredeemably so. It's pretty. I could see myself wearing this on a date night with a pretty little dress, when I want to feel very dainty and femme. But it's not really me. I have this in oil. 7.5/10\n\n\\-**Parlor Trick** *(Ivory lace, white wax, aged paper, glossy white smoke, teak, black tea, blonde woods, delicate spice, bone musk, Manor, and a faint trace of rose)* Another one that I had been very excited for. I love wax as a note and everything else sounded up my alley. There's something...weird here. I have read about the dreaded pickle effect and I think that might be what's at play here.  It doesn't read as pickles to me per se but there is something sharp and acrid that lays on top of everything. Underneath it's mostly waxy, musky vanilla with a hint of rose. My husband said he smelled \"nice vanilla\" and couldn't detect anything weird. Maybe it's the \"blonde woods\"? I don't know. It does morph a lot though, some whiffs I enjoy more than others. It's a few days rested but I'm going to let it age a bit, I've known Solstice oils to really benefit from aging. But right now...Parlor Trick is a no. Oil format. 3/10\n\n\\-**Riverside Sleighride** *(Vanilla Musk, Bayberry, Fresh Snow, White Amber, Fir Balsam, Cold Winds, Birch, Mistletoe)* Picked this up in a swap just because. I'm honestly not that into Christmas-y stuff, generally speaking. I get into the spirit on the day itself, but yeah. I wouldn't usually go for a Christmas frag, is all I'm trying to say. I have to admit, out of the vial it gives candle or the holiday aisle at Michael's. Once you put it on it chills out, though. It's a nice cool woody smell. The woods are lovely (I can pick out the fir note specifically) and it fades to a gentle vanillic skin musk. I wore this on Christmas and thoroughly enjoyed it but will probably not full size. I'd only wear it once a year! If you are all about Christmas, though, do not sleep on this. I have this in oil format. 8/10\n\n\\-**Rose Custard Kulfi** *(Rosewater, saffron, cardamom, coconut vanilla custard, caramelized sugar, dates, pistachios, lime zest)* When I first started getting into indies I was pretty staunchly against very \"foody\" gourmands. How wrong and foolish I was. I'm discovering a deep love for gourmands and RCK was one of the first I fell for. It opens with a slightly sharp and sweet rose paired with bright lime zest. In the back, you get the pistachio rounding it out. As it dries down it morphs into a beautifully sweet custard that is not cloying at all. I swear I can almost smell the egg in the custard?? Magic. I don't get too much coconut, cardamom, or saffron but if I focus I can pick them out. I brought this with me on a beach trip and loved wearing this in the warm weather, it's a great summer scent. It fades to a gorgeous, light, custardy skin musk. Will definitely be full sizing this at some point. I have both EDP and oil samples and notice no real difference in the smell, though I'd say the oil has much lower longevity than other SS oils. It is a very faint, sweet skin scent after just 2 hours. I had to reapply often but...worth it. 10/10\n\n\\-**Runestone** *(Natural Earthy Forest Blend With Aged Patchouli, Vetiver, Oakmoss, Cedar, Violet Leaf, Dirt, Leaves, Cypress, Spruce)* My least favorite and the only scrubber of the bunch. It's extremely sharp and herbal, like a bitter tincture. I'm not really able to pick out any individual notes, I think the patchouli takes over for me. I bought this for my husband and he doesn't love it either.  Will probably destash at some point. If you are a real patchouli lover, this might be for you! I believe this is only available in alcohol format. 2/10\n\n\\-**Sea of Gray** *(Vanilla rain, saltwater, seaweed, ambergris \\[vegan\\], white amber, roasted seashells, white sandalwood, frangipani)* If Foxcroft Fairgrounds is my baby, Sea of Gray is my one true love. Is this getting weird? Probably. Who cares! Sea of Gray might be my #1 favorite fragrance...ever. I grew up five minutes from the beach but have been living in stupid, landlocked northern Europe for the last few years. I kid, I love where I live, but words can't express how terribly I miss the coast. The smell of the salty air...just thinking about it makes me wistful. So when I read reviews saying that Sea of Gray truly evokes the sea, not just generic blue candle, I had to have it. I blind bought a 60 ml and don't regret it one bit; it met every expectation and more. The opening notes are briny and funky. I smell wet rocks, salt water, seaweed, and vanilla. It reminds me of walking on a North Fork beach on a cool, grey day while wearing vanilla perfume (something I did often). The vanilla is front and center and is what makes the scent wearable, as others have said. It dries down to a lovely white amber/vanilla. My signature scent, my ultimate love that reminds me of home. Another one that has received the most compliments! This only comes in EDP format. 10/10\n\n\\-**Tenebrous Mist** *(Skin Musk, White Amber, Sea Spray, Sandalwood, Bay Rum, Tea, Smoke)* Honestly kinda reminds me of the briny, sea captain cousin of Conjure. I think it shares the same amber and smoke notes. The elements all blend together really well, it's almost hard to pick them out individually. I'd say the Bay Rum and sea spray come through most obviously as well as the smoke. The skin musk and amber make it a bit powdery and fuzzy. I like this but it's not really me. I think I'd like it more on someone else. Gonna try and get the husband to test it. 7.5/10\n\n\\-**Vanilla Pipe Tobacco** *(Chewy Unlit Vanilla Pipe Tobacco & Light Fragrant Pipe Smoke)* I had really high hopes for this one and it was a bit of a letdown. I hadn't fancied myself much of a tobacco gal until I received Death + Floral's VPT in a swap. I was astonished by how much I loved it and thought I'd love to try Solstice's, given my hit rate and overall love for the brand. Unfortunately, I just didn't like it as much as D+F's! It's definitely very realistic, like shoving your nose in a pouch full of tobacco. It just seems a bit dry compared to D+F's and I don't think I care for the smoke note, even though it's very subtle. I don't hate it at all, it's a very pleasant fragrance and it hits the mark. But I have to admit that I prefer D+F, which is weird because I have a pretty bad hit rate with them overall. Go figure. Anyway, I have this in oil and EDP, they are identical to me. 7/10\n\nHOOOO-weeeeee  OK GUYS WOW. That was a long one. Thanks for sticking with me! To wrap it up, I just want to reiterate how much I love this brand. Super fast TAT, have never had any logistics issues and I'm international. I have so many favorites from this house and even the ones I don't like, I appreciate and respect. I'm really just blown away by the artistry.\n\n**Standout favorites: Foxcroft, Foxcroft Fairgrounds, Gibbon's Mischief Night, High Noon, Lace Draped Spectre, Manor, Midnight Marquee, Rose Custard Kulfi, Sea of Gray**\n\n*Nine* standout favorites out of twenty sampled! Pretty remarkable, honestly...or maybe I'm just easy to please üòÇ For real though, I have not had nearly as much luck with other houses. I can't wait to try even MORE. I love you, Solstice Scents!!!\n\nEdited a typo!",

    "body": "Forty-eight (48!!) whole-ass scents. I'm a slut for Poesie. I'm going to try to be hella succinct, okay? Here we go.\n\n**All Mirth, No Matter** \\- *notes: apricot blossom, white chocolate, butterscotch, honeysuckle, magnolia, ¬†amber, and a fillip of juicy blood orange:* Um? I can't even begin to describe this. Weird. Doesn't work for me at all. Opaque plastic and salt? Play-Dough but not quite? No florals or gourmands to be found. Just weirdness.\n\n**Athena** \\- *notes: sun-baked Mediterranean herbs and earth, a rich and resinous vanilla spiked with a complex blend of incense and spice, and exquisite grey musk*: YES. Ugh, sweet, herbal, slightly spicy, a little musky. Hella goddess-like. The Athena in the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series would ABSOLUTELY smell like this.\n\n**Autumn Shadows** \\- *notes: spiced peach butter spread on sweet brown bread, a vase of chrysanthemums in the center of a mahogany table, and a lingering hint of amber perfume*: Really pretty, but maybe it a little too floral? Poesie's mahogany note is ridiculously amazing, though.\n\n**Black Cat Cuddles** \\- *notes: sweet coconut milk spiked with clove, cinnamon, and black pepper, incense-dusted fur, flecks of vanilla bean, and a distant pine forest*: I love this, sweet and musky and slightly spicy. Cuddly and soft. It's so cozy. If it had a touch more longevity on me, I would have full-sized the fuck out of this.\n\n**Book of Words** \\- *notes: sweet orange, lemon, lime, sugared milk, skin musk, benzoin, muguet, oud*: Limes and assorted citrus and just a tiny dash of cream? It's not awful, but since I'm not a citrus fan to begin with, I think I'll pass, thanks.\n\n**Cauldron of Morning** \\- *notes: powdery marshmallows laced with licorice, juicy plum and blood orange, gardenia, green rose, rich mahogany*: Green rose, mahogany, and an unexpected handful of dirt. I don't know what I assumed a cauldron of morning would be, but this is not it, unless your cauldron is actually a freshly potted rose bush on a mahogany table.\n\n**Charm of Making** \\- *notes: amber honey in the comb, antique pages bound in leather, bunches of lavender smoked over a wood fire, and jars of dried chamomile, juniper, and clary sage*: Herbal and not sweet, like a kitchen witch's cottage. Very atmospheric.\n\n**Cinders** \\- *notes: the smoky scent of burnt firewood:* Recently put-out firewood. Realistic, not at all perfumey. Smells like your house *might* be burning down. Go check on your oven.\n\n**Cozy** \\- *notes: spicy cardamom + rich vanilla featuring our favorite 100% natural cardamom*: True to description and wonderful. Very yummy and you will get compliments when you wear this.\n\n**Creature Comforts** \\- *notes: a pastry shop filled with sugar cookies, pumpkin pie, apple tarts, homemade marshmallow, and sticky toffee pudding*: Ugh I love this scent, it's a delicious world of pastries and spices. The site description makes me a little sad, though.\n\n**Damn Fine** \\- *notes: dark coffee beans, airy vanilla, black musk, cardamom, bitter almond*: Damn fine it sure it. Sweetened coffee beans, a little musk, and a hint of cardamom. Smells like dinner at the Double R Diner in a town where there's more than meets the eye.\n\n**Eggnog Noel** \\- *notes: creamy custard, opulent vanilla, warm nutmeg, and a splash of French cognac*: Full and rich in the vial, turns into clear, water-down alcohol on the skin? Bizarre reaction with my skin chemistry, but a goddamn delicious scent in the vial.\n\n**Elemental Tea Party** \\- *notes: a swirl of autumn leaves on chilly air, brewed black tea with a discreet splash of whiskey, overturned earth, and distant bonfires*: Poesie's tea notes are out of the world. Clear, crisp, slightly oversteeped black tea and leaves and earth. Tea in a forest.\n\n**Ethereal Lace** \\- *notes: white lilac + old books, Vanille, antique lace*: Um, a little boring and bland, quite frankly. White fabric, a little floral, not all that sweet. Good if you want to smell like a character in *Little Women*.\n\n**Fan Dance** \\- *notes: sugar-dusted tart raspberries, vanilla bean, and powder-white skin*: Tart raspberries countered by sweet vanilla and powdered sugar. It's a really good raspberry scent. Refreshingly tart and surprisingly good for year-round wear. I would love this more if it didn't go quite so powdery on the skin.\n\n**Faraway, Nearby** \\- *notes: wild-crafted pinyon pine oil, aromatic sagebrush, hot sand & desert winds, bone musk*: This smells like hot, cracked bones half-buried in a sandy desert spotted with pinyon pine and sagebrush. Poesie has a way with herbal atmospherics. Wear this to be a rugged cowboy, riding across the hot American Southwestern desert.\n\n**Fine Eyes** \\- *notes: tart rhubarb paired with an irresistible burst of tuberose that conquers all resistance to its charms, a spark of ginger keeps things warm and lively*: Blech. Fuck... the rhubarb? The ginger? I'm not exactly sure what the problem is in this blend, but to me, it's a hard pass.\n\n**French Kiss** \\- *notes: marshmallowy vanilla meringue kisses swirled with blueberry jam*: Blueberry vanilla-y goodness. So simple and so pure--unlike a french kiss.\n\n**Great Northern** \\- *notes: fresh cedarwood, ripe plum, black and pink peppercorns, warm clove*: Woody, spiced, and just richly fruity enough to keep the other notes balanced. Smells like secret wall compartments and getting shot in the chest.\n\n**Hera** \\- *notes: slices of yellow cake layered with strawberry jam, fluffy vanilla icing, and soft pink lotus blossoms*: Light pink, more floral than gourmand. So pretty. Not what I picture Hera smelling like, but maybe my judgement has been colored by the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series.\n\n**Illuminated** \\- *notes: pineapple, pomelo and cherimoya are sprinkled with crushed pink peppercorns and delicate petals of ¬†jessamine and choisya*: Clean, white, bright floral and slightly fruity. Very tropical, like relaxing on a Caribbean beach with a fruity alcoholic beverage in your hand. The water is crystal-clear blue, there's a pleasant breeze, and you have no responsibilities. That'd be the life.\n\n**Innocence** \\- *notes: sweet peach skin, delicate coconut milk, comforting skin musk*: Not as sweet as I was expecting. Creamy peach, but in a... dry way? Not exactly what I wanted, but still good. However, I have other peach scents I'd rather reach for.\n\n**Lady Disdain** \\- *notes: fresh carnation petals, spiced vanilla, red velvet musk, soft leather, Moroccan rose, ylang ylang, and pink peppercorn*: I didn't consider myself a carnation gal before this scent, but boy, this turned me. Slightly spiced florals with a creamy, dark depth. This scent is Too Good For You.\n\n**Lagniappe VII** \\- *notes: dragon's blood incense, haunted woods, graveyard dirt, pumpkin spice*: Spicy dirt! Nice for a free gift, but not really my vibe.\n\n**Laura** \\- *notes: ethereal violet, sweet basil, rain-drenched earth, balsam fir, secrets*: The vibe here is on point. Starts very murky but sweetness and brightens up after drying. Gorgeous and mysterious. Poor Laura, though.\n\n**Library Ghost** \\- *notes: studious marshmallow surrounded by books, ink, and polished wood*: This smells like haunting a library, but you're a good, friendly ghost. You guard the old manuscripts people are viewing with your undead life.\n\n**Madar** \\- *notes: comforting creamy Basmati rice pudding flavored with orange blossom water, saffron, cinnamon, and dried rose petals, then piled high with sugared pistachios*: Soft, cozy, lightly floral gourmand. Delicious. Must resist eating my arm, or swallowing this like Alice in Wonderland. I mean, it basically smells edible.\n\n**Morning Mayhem** \\- *notes: vanilla French toast sprinkled with cinnamon and drizzled with¬†maple syrup, coffee milk, balsam fir, wrapping paper*: Coffee milk and vanilla cinnamon and a hint of balsam. This is what every Hallmark Christmas movie with a bakery plot-line smells like.\n\n**Nyx** \\- *notes: opium, night-blooming flowers, midnight black river water, a wisp of oud incense*: Cold yet... not uninviting. A hint of sweetness from the florals and opium, but very dark. A little resinous. Different, and not something I'd often reach for, but the vibes are right. (Unless we're talking about Nyx in the Heroes of Olympus series... then this scent is *way* too mellow).\n\n**Perfect Happiness** \\- *notes: crisp green tea, slices of wedding cake topped with coconut, a hint of mint + ginger, sandalwood, marshmallow musk*: Sweet sandalwood and marshmallow musk. Don't really get any of the other notes, sadly.\n\n**Petite P√™che** \\- *notes:* *petit fours of juicy peach slices layered with yellow cake, topped with a vanilla bean glaze*: Bready peaches? This peach note is a little sharp, but it mellows on the skin. \n\n**Pink Lace** \\- *notes: juicy strawberries and pink champagne, vanilla, and antique lace*: Sweet, fizzy, uncomplicated sparkly, summer strawberry scent.\n\n**Radiant** \\- *notes: toasted coconut and salt-tinged skin touched with summer heat*: Another uncomplicated summer scent, this one smells like warm, salty skin. The coconut is very mild, like toasted shavings as opposed to coconut cream pie. I didn't keep this one.\n\n**Secret Boyfriend** \\- *notes: a mountain of light fluffy marshmallows, your secret boyfriend's leather jacket, pine and cedar, a wisp of smoke*: I'm hugging my secret boyfriend. He's such a secret, he doesn't even know he's my boyfriend. He smells so good, masculine but cozy. His name is Tom Holland. I love him--I mean, this Poesie scent.\n\n**Shy Ghost** \\- *notes: comforting milky chai tea laced with vanilla and topped with whipped cream*: No, thank you. Spicy chai contrasted by no whipped cream. Maybe whipped cream was in the room when the tea was being made?\n\n**Sleepy Ghost** \\- *notes: marshmallow pillows sprinkled with natural lavender essential oil and absolute*: Goodnight, IMAM! I'm going to bed, because I am the sweetest, cuddliest, sleepiest ghost, buried under piles of soft blankets and cushioned by fluffy pillows, falling asleep in a cloud of marshmallows made of lavender.\n\n**Strawberry Fields for Emma** \\- *notes: earthy green oakmoss, wild strawberries, Italian bergamot, lily of the valley, galbanum*: Best strawberry scent I've tried, by far. The strawberry and lily work amazingly together, and the oakmoss and galbanum keep it from being too sweet and fruity. Tasteful and summery.\n\n**Sucre Vanille** \\- *notes: sparkling white sugar laced with vanilla bean*: Simple, sweet vanilla sugar. Delicious. Uncomplicated.\n\n**Sugar Dusted** \\- *notes: cinnamon sticks, apple and pumpkin pies in the oven, plates of sugar cookies and tins of sugared pecans, smudges of butter and splashes of vanilla extract*: Very similar to Creature Comforts, but not quite as good. Don't quite know why, but that's where I stand. Maybe it's the cinnamon.\n\n**Tea-Stained Lace** \\- *notes: rich pipe tobacco + black tea leaves, Vanille, antique lace*: Sweetened black tea and rich tobacco, a little bit of lace in the background. This is a scent for slightly poorer Victorians whose smoking rooms and drawing rooms are connected, and the scents of an after-dinner pipe and cups of tea mingle together.\n\n**Tiny Phantom** \\- *notes: innocent pink roses, marshmallow buttercream, pale white musk, antique mahogany*: Powdery pink roses over marshmallows and mahogany. A very delicate Victorian phantom, could possibly faint at any moment. You know, for the drama.\n\n**Twice to Tea** \\- *notes: a strongly brewed cup of Earl Grey tea delicately infused with all natural lavender absolute, sweetened with vanilla syrup, and lightened with a splash of milk*: Poesie's tea notes are always outstanding. This is true to life Lavender London Fog, and it's nice. I don't reach for it very often, though.\n\n**Versailles** \\- *notes: golden cake, intoxicating orange blossom, fluffy vanilla citrus icing, blood orange*: Delicious, cake and blood orange and vanilla. Very decadent. I'm a fan.\n\n**Villa Diodati** \\- *notes: wild rosemary, fresh balsam pine, crystal clear lake water, and dry, dark vanilla*: One of my top favorite Poesie scents. Rosemary and pine on a clear lake with woody vanilla. Smells like heaven.\n\n**Watson** \\- *notes: lavender in bloom, apples plucked straight from the tree, sweet dried tobacco leaves, a scattering of hay, polished mahogany & rosewood*: Soap for your guest bathroom. Clean, and very inoffensive. Smells like the Safe Bet option in the romance novel you're currently reading.\n\n**Wicked Ghost** \\- *notes: innocent marshmallows encompassed in glowing black amber and resinous incense smoke*: I love Poesie's marshmallow note, but I did not get along with the incense note. Headache-inducing on the skin.\n\n**Year Without Summer** \\- *notes: a narcotic sweetness of opium blended with the blackest amber, spilled coffee, and a hint of bitter green cannabis*: Mmm, very different. Black coffee, dank weed, opium. Wear this if you want to smell goth in a day-drunk Victorian way, not a Hot Topic way.\n\n**You Tempt Me** \\- *notes: vanilla custard, marzipan, sweet cherries, a hint of pastry crust, ambery notes*: Sweet vanilla cherry, but not gross cherry. Cherry candy and sweet, warm vanilla and marzipan.",

Hopefully it works here too)*\n* Emmeline Pankhurst ‚Äî black tea swirled with vanilla cream, cold rain on stone, soft linen, cozy musk *(Stepping out on an atmospheric limb here as I'm not sure what \"cold rain on stone\" smells like. Hopefully it won't make the rest of the notes weird)*\n* Ida B Wells ‚Äî velvety red rose, plum, smooth golden amber, jasmine sambac, royal sandalwood, nutmeg *(Sooo florals, amber, and spice? Totally in my wheelhouse)*\n* Luxor ‚Äî warm spices, wafts of incense smoke, creamy sandalwood *(not sure about the incense smoke as my skin, in general, tends to amp smoke.)*\n* The Abbey ‚Äî sweet rosewood, white and red sandalwood, four vanillas, a spark of coriander, and cardamom *(I hope that the coriander makes this interesting as the other notes are pretty standard for a lot of the perfumes I own. But also cardamom, which I love)*\n* The Aviation ‚Äî candied violets, spicy juniper, freshly squeezed lemon juice, and a hint of cherry *(Debating on this one. I don't love juniper or cherry but I do love the perfume's name. \\*sigh\\* Maybe get it just for that and make it part of a giveaway for my next book.)*\n* Watson ‚Äî lavender in bloom, apples plucked straight from the tree, sweet dried tobacco leaves, a scattering of hay, polished mahogany & rosewood *(I totally see Watson smelling like this. I wish there was a Sherlock scent to wear with it too)*\n* White House Garden ‚Äî creamy sweet fig, white musk, blossoms of lemon thyme (*Wonder if the \"creamy sweet fig\" includes a milk note. I don't do well with Poesie's milk notes)*\n* Young Romantics ‚Äî a voluptuous blend of dark fig preserves + lush, velvety red rose tinged with exotic spice, sultry resins. musk mallow, and vanilla bean *(Yep. Another one right up my alley. Sounds like it will be great for date nights!)*\n* Zephyr ‚Äî wisteria soliflore *(Because who doesn't love a good wisteria single note?!)*",

I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm really excited about this section. I'm not happy that Korea is and has been for years, swamped in pollution from the winds carrying it over. There is a lot of microdust and even people with resilient skin reported getting redness & severe irritation from the pollution. Everyone has to wear these giant masks, sometimes special ones, and limit their exposure to the world outside of their homes.*\n\n*So there has been a lot of push for soothing, calming products and \"clean\" ingredients. A lot more focus on repairing the skin barrier. So I'm excited about those, but not the fact that people have to suffer.*\n\n*I'll be bolding some of the soothing, repairing and/or skin-identical ingredients in the ingredient lists. I don't know every good ingredient, but I will bold the ones that I do know of. Some other beneficial ingredients as well.*\n\n*\\*Also got random pictures of the textures of the creams and the users who posted it.*\n\n*If you're interested in barrier repairing/replenishing as I am, here are some good quotes from Susan, from Swift Crafty Monkey blog:*\n\n>**Natural moisturizing factor (NMF)** is found within the corneocytes, and makes up 20% to 30% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum. It **consists of amino acids (40%), sodium PCA (12%), lactate (12%), urea (7%), ions (18.5%), sugars (like glycerol ‚Äì 8.5%)**, and a few other things. These are water soluble [humectants](https://swiftcraftymonkey.blog/better-crafting-through-chemistry/) (meaning they draw water out of the atmosphere to our skin) that have a huge impact on the biochemical and mechanical properties of our skin. Having an adequate NMF level in our skin can prevent or reduce skin tightness, cracking, scaling, and flaking. It improves our skin‚Äôs plasticity (thanks to the interactions of the amino acids with keratin) and helps maintain skin‚Äôs barrier properties.  \n>  \n>**Filaggrin** is a really important protein found in our skin! ...When we are in more arid climates, the filaggrin breakdown increases to produce more NMF. More NMF is a good thing!  \n>  \n>The contents of the NMF do more than act as humectants. The lactate and potassium can affect the pH and stiffness of the stratum corneum. The lactic acid stimulates ceramide biosynthesis and improves barrier function. The [hyaluronic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan) (HA ‚Äì picture to the left) maintains hydration and structural integrity of our skin. It also interacts with intercellular lipids and regulates the mechanical properties of the stratum corneum.  \n>  \n>\\[The strateum corneum lipids\\] make up about 15% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum, and contain about **40% to 50% ceramides, 20% to 25% cholesterol, 15% to 25% fatty acids** (those with C16 to C30 chain lengths, with C24 to C28 being the most common), and **5% to 10% cholesterol sulfate**.  \n>  \n>Oils with **linoleic or gamma-linoleic acid** are always welcomed by our skin (like sunflower, sesame seed, borage, evening primrose, rice bran, and others), especially in the winter.\n\n**Squalane, beeswax, lecithin, lanolin** are also good skin replenishing ingredients. Shea butter is very soothing and moisturizing, as well as having a lot of antioxidants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TOP CREAMS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. \\[Dr. G\\] Red Blemish Clear Soothing Cream - 4.22/5 (9,894 Reviews)**\n\n70ml/36,000 KRW - $31.29\n\nWater (Aqua/Eau), **Glycerin**, Butylene Glycol, C 13-16 Isoparaffin, **Niacinamide**, C 12-14 Isoparaffin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Pentylene Glycol, Vinyl Dimethicone, Caprylyl Methicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Panthenol**, Acrylates/C 10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Tromethamine, **Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate,** Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, **Beta-Glucan, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside,** Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Epigallocatechin Gallate, **Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid.**\n\n*This line from this brand is extremely well-known and popular in Korea.

I get the appeal, these two characters have only ever loved each other, no one else, they're practically fated- perhaps only made for each other! How romantic!

It feels like mystery lite but there's literally nothing at stake.\n\nTime skips at the end - if an author is going to set up circumstances where they can't be together then I'd rather that just be the ending.

They're different people. They've been through different experiences. I don't even know if I should be rooting for them anymore. Also, part of the reason I read that far anyways is to see how those characters are going to deal with their circumstances. If there's a time skip then the characters technically aren't dealing with them and instead are just waiting until they change/avoiding them! \n\nAnnoying villains made to be face-slapped - in this genre villains are gonna be face-slapped by default but like, sometimes, I think I read more about a character getting face-slapped than them actually doing anything wrong. A good face slap should be like a slow burn. I should hate this character for 70+ chapters and then see their downfall. And by hating them, I don't mean being annoyed by them. They should be INFURIATING me. I don't care about characters that annoy me or are going to be 'killed off' in ten chapters. I do care about villains who are way too good at fucking everything up and make me anxious about the main characters. Braindead annoying villains are just filler and there to boost an otherwise flimsy plot.",

    "body": "(M)y completed collection - with brief reviews and breakdowns\n\nI have finally completed my collection! I am comfortable with saying that I am done with acquiring fragrances now, especially because since January I have only bought 3 bottles, and am no longer looking for new fragrances. \n\n[Here's a photo of my collection.](https://imgur.com/RxfdgKi) I've edited it like crazy just to increase visibility, otherwise it's too dark to see anything other than what was at the front. I'm only including full bottles here, so no decants or samples.\n\nThe perfumes:\n\n* **Aesop** *Marrakech Intense EDT* \\- main notes I pick up are clove and cardamom, gives off a lemongrass-y vibe.\n* **Amouage** *Beloved Man* \\- main note I pick up is elemi, and also ginger which isn't listed as a note. Probably the most underrated in the Amouage men's collection, this is great for whenever you need to wear a shirt, any kind of shirt, but can be dressed up or down.\n* **Amouage** *Journey Man* \\- main notes I pick up are sichuan pepper, frankincense and juniper berry. This dries down into a very masculine spicy leather scent, and while it smells very different to Tom Ford's Tobacco Oud the drydown gives off a similar vibe.\n* **Amouage** *Jubilation Man* \\- blackberry, opoponax, frankincense, myrrhe. This is the greatest resinous perfume of all time, and one of my all-time favorites. This is the most regal perfume ever made.\n* **Amouage** *Myths Man* \\- ash and chrysantheum. This is a very ethereal and cold fragrance, and  if I were to describe it in one word I'd say 'ghostly'.\n* **Atelier Cologne** *Rose Anonyme -* rose, oud and chocolate (even though chocolate isn't a listed note). This is basically a dupe of Tom Ford's Noir de Noir, but NdN smells better throughout its progression on skin.\n* **Atelier des Ors** *Lune Feline* \\- vanilla, Peru balsam, cardamom and cinnamon. This is my staple vanilla fragrance. It smells just like vanilla and cinnamon cookie dough. It's stunning to wear. Only thing I dislike about this fragrance (and all fragrances made by Atelier des Ors) is the gold flakes in the perfume. \n* **Atelier des Ors** *Riviera Drive* \\- lemon. This is the most authentic lemon fragrance I own, so much so that rubbing myself in freshly-squeezed lemon juice would do the same trick.\n* **Bois 1920** *Oltremare* \\- rhubarb and tea. This is an incredibly refreshing fragrance, and one of the more unique freshies I've ever smelled. The combination of rhubarb, tea and literally every citrus note out there work miracles here.\n* **Bulgari** *Man in Black* \\- rum and leather. Probably one of the best winter fragrances for the buck, this is an extremely sensual and masculine fragrance that screams seduction. I reckon this is a classic.\n* **Bulgari** *au The Noir* \\- rose, oud and tea. Smells a bit like a bandaid or bandage, but not in a bad way. A very interesting fragrance that just somehow works.\n* **Byredo** *Accord Oud* \\- blackberry and oud. I've always seen this as Byredo's take on Amouage, to me it comes across as a less sophisticated cross of Jubilation and Journey Man. Great for when you want to wear a more casual oud scent.\n* **Byredo** *Black Saffron* \\- raspberry and leather. This was the first niche fragrance I ever bought, and still one of my favorites. I see this as Byredo perfecting Tuscan Leather - it is fresher, fruitier, less in-your-face, way more casual and has some added floral nuances. \n* **Byredo** *Pulp* \\- rotten apple and pear (according to the notes, there's red apple and peach blossom). You either love this or hate this. It's loud, it's green and fruity, it really is evocative of rotten fruits, and it's great (in my opinion). I'd say this is worth a try at the very least.\n* **Chanel** *Cuir de Russie EDP* \\- leather and birch. This is probably the most iconic take on the idea of 'Russian leather'. Slightly animalic, pretty sensual, and very snooty. Once you wear it, you just feel like a rich person, which isn't the most eloquent way to describe it but probably the best way to describe it.\n* **Chanel** *Jersey EDT* \\- lavender, lavender, lavender, a bit of vanilla and a touch of musk. Do yourself a favor - if you want Jersey, buy lavender essential oil instead. Same shtick. This is nice and great for casual wear, but not worth the asking price. It's just lavender.\n* **Chanel** *Platinum Egoiste* \\- lavender, geranium, rosemary and clary sage. My favorite barbershop fragrance, this is just nice. It just is. There is no other way to describe this. Quintessentially masculine, this always works with a cleanshaven face.\n* **Chanel** *Sycomore EDT -* vetiver. This smells so close to Lalique Encre Noire, I wouldn't recommend buying this for anyone. It smells great, but you can buy the same thing (which actually came out before Sycomore) for 10% of the price this costs.\n* **Creed** *Aventus (batches 17T01 and 19U11)* \\- pineapple, oakmoss and vanilla. Both batches smell the same to me, which is to say they smell like Aventus. I like this. I understand some people don't, and a lot of people do, and whether you buy into the hype or not it's just a good, casual dumb-reach kinda fragrance.\n* **Creed** *Fleurissimo* \\- tuberose, violet and iris. This is just an incredibly clean, soapy fragrance. To me, the best way to describe this would be by calling it a 'feminized take on the classic barbershop fragrance'.\n* **Creed** *Love in White* \\- rice and magnolia. This is a synthetic jumble of flowers and citruses. One to avoid unless you're getting a good deal on it (I bought a tester for $10 because the store selling it was phasing it out, $10 more and I probably would have passed).\n* **Creed** *Millesime Imperial* \\- sea salt and 'marine notes'. This is my most recent purchase along with Silver Mountain Water, and I'm not sure on it yet. My bottle is from 2016, and I haven't really been enjoying it yet. It reminds me a bit of being in an airport terminal - not the nicest of smells.\n* **Creed** *Royal Mayfair* \\- eucalyptus, rose and gin. My favorite Creed fragrance I own, this is actually pretty sophisticated and very classy. Works great in an office environment.\n* **Creed** *Royal Water* \\- citrus. Maybe it's because my bottle is from 2010, but it just smells off and is an incredibly boring and bland fragrance. I got given a tester from a friend, and now I just use it when I go to the gym. If you want to explore Creed, make sure you don't start with Royal Water or you might be put off them straight away.\n* **Creed** *Silver Mountain Water* \\- green tea, blackcurrant and citruses. Along with MI, this is my most recent purchase and I'm not sure whether I'll keep it or not. This smells similar to MI to me, maybe because of the shared 'marine notes' among other shared notes, and also gives off the vibe of being in an airport terminal. The bottle is from 2015.\n* **Christian Dior** *Ambre Nuit -* ambergris and rose. This is a beautiful fragrance, quite simple but of extremely high quality, and the smell is just phenomenal. Ambergris and rose is really all I got from this past the opening, but it is an amazing combination. It's just a beautiful fragrance.\n* **Christion Dior** *Bois d'Argent* \\- iris, myrrhe and Yemenite frankincense. Despite what  the notes may suggest, this is actually a really light and refreshing, casual fragrance. Something you'd wear with a white t-shirt, it's a nice fragrance but I wouldn't say it's worth the asking price.\n* **Christion Dior** *Dior Homme 2011 -* iris, cocoa and leather. Powdery, leathery and sweet, this is a great fragrance within the masculine iris sphere. It's an all-time classic, and I have nothing to say to detract from that.\n* **Ermenegildo Zegna** *Florentine Iris EDT -* iris, bergamot, violet, musk and jasmine. Basically all the notes this is advertised with is exactly what this smells like. A light, fresh take on the masculine iris with the office in mind. A dumb-reach for a work-friendly, inoffensive and generally pleasing fragrance.\n* **Etat Libre d'Orange** *Divin'Enfant* \\- marshmallow, orange blossom and tobacco. This is a nice, gently sweet, gently warm, gently everything kinda frag. Something you'd wear to feel cozy that doesn't attack the senses.\n* **Frapin** *Isle of Man* \\- basil, grapefruit, bitter orange and 'wood notes'. A 'meh' kinda fragrance, smells alright but not of anything in particular and is instantly forgettable. Makes for a decent dumb-reach, but not anything more.\n* **Frapin** *L'Humaniste* \\- gin, citruses, so much pepper. This fragrance would be a perfect summer freshie if it lasted longer, and if they took out all the pepper!  I get so much pink and black pepper from this when I use it, sometimes when I smell myself up close I want to sneeze! Other than that, this smells just like a gin and tonic.\n* **Frapin** *The Orchid Man* \\- begamot and oakmoss. The notes may not suggest this, but this is just a poor attempt at an Aventus clone. Unless you are getting a good deal on this like I was, I'd say avoid it.\n* **Gucci** *Gucci Pour Homme II* \\- black tea and cinnamon. This smells like a beautiful, refreshing yet warming chai latte. This is my favorite designer fragrance I've ever owned. It works for nearly all occasions and even if nobody else notices it on you, you'll still be happy smelling yourself all day. Now that it's discontinuation has been confirmed, if you see one at a good price definitely jump on it - prices are only going up now.\n* **Helmut Lang** *Cuiron 2014* \\- suede and bergamot. This is definitely a unique take on leather, but it definitely is not for everyone. It smells a bit earthy, and honestly a bit like dirt. Try before you buy, and then try again just to be sure you actually liked it.\n* **Hermes** *Eau d'Orange Vert* \\- citrus and oakmoss. A classic, but a pretty boring one to me. Citrus, oakmass and two hours is all you get with this one..\n* **Hermes** *Terre d'Hermes EDT* \\- vetiver, pepper, orange and grapefruit. Now this is good. I have nothing to say that hasn't been said before, and while this isn't my favorite fragrance of all time, I also have no reason to object as to why Basenote titled it number one in its list of the 500 greatest modern perfumes a few years ago.\n* **Knize** *Knize Ten* \\- leather, civet, carnation and oakmoss. While Chanel's Cuir de Russie was leather all dressed up, this is leather for the working man. I get a really strong petrol vibe from this, and it just conjures up images of hard-working men sweating as they labor away in their duties. I love this fragrance, and make it a point to wear it as often as is appropriate.\n* **L'Artisan Parfumeur** *Tea for Two* \\- lapsang souchong tea and tobacco. The most realistic portrayal of tea and cigarettes in the morning, perfect for an autumn date at the local cafe. I adore this fragrance - it just radiates so much warmth, it's something you wear to share with the people around you.\n* **L'Artisan Parfumeur** *Timbuktu* \\- vetiver, incense, papyrus and myrrhe. A green take on Jubilation Man by the same perfumer, this is a fresher perfume that definitely pays homage to the Amouage to me. Of course, this perfume is much more focused on vetiver, and that really takes center stage here. This is a really good perfume.\n* **Lalique** *Encre Noire* \\- vetiver and cypress. This is one of the perfumes that got me into this hobby nearly ten years ago. Dark, mysterious, sensual, unique (when it came out), there is no excuse for people not to try this. As for the comparison with Sycomore, they smell 99% identical, and this performs better and came out first. I cannot recommend Sycomore in good faith knowing that this is a better option.\n* **Lubin** *Idole de Lubin EDP* \\- rum, saffron, ebony, leather and sugar cane. A more modern reincarnation of a modern masterpiece, this is an amazing perfume for the nights, especially winter ones. This fragrance is sexy, be it on a man or a woman, and is 99% similar to the original EDT variation.\n* **Lubin** *Idole de Lubin EDT* \\- rum, saffron, ebony, leather and bitter orange peel. This is the perfume that dragged me down the rabbit hole, and my favorite perfume (and bottle) of all time. I absolutely am in love with this. If you are looking at chasing down a bottle of Idole, though, unless you are set on owning the EDT, I'd recommend buying the EDP. They're extremely close in terms of scent and performance, and the price of the EDT has only been going up as it becomes rarer and rarer.\n* **Lubin** *Upper Ten* \\- sandalwood. I'm not a big fan of this as sandalwood, when it is the dominant note, is something I really do not like, and this perfume is just sandalwood. I have friends who love sandalwood, though, and this perfume is their grail. So that's really both sides of the coin, then.\n* **Maison Margiela** *By the Fireplace* \\- chestnut, vanilla and Peru balsam. A very, very cozy and extremely sweet fragrance, BTF has its fans and its haters for this very reason. I love it, but at times it is just too sweet.\n* **Maison Margiela** *Jazz Club* \\- rum, vanilla and tobacco. Exactly the same thing I said for By the Fireplace applies here too. A very warm and cozy fragrance, at times this too gets way too sweet.\n* **Mancera** *Cedrat Boise* \\- vanilla, leather, musk and a whole lotta fruits. This is a very nice dumb-reach fragrance that pays homage to Aventus but really is its own fragrance. This is an extremely versatile fragrance, and you wont find much objection to it whenever wearing it.\n* **Maurer & Wirtz** *Tabac Original EDC* \\- it smells of literally every note that's listed. Animalic, leathery, smoky, floral, spicy, woody. This is man in a bottle. Long after I've passed, Creed may be dead, Amouage may be forgotten, Chanel may be bankrupt, but Tabac Original will still be there, standing strong and smiling at the graves of everything else.\n* **Montale** *Intense Cafe* \\- rose and vanilla. Talk about a misleading name. There's nothing 'intense' or 'cafe' about this fragrance. It's a nice, light rose and vanilla pairing on my skin. \n* **Thierry Mugler** *A-Men, Kryptomint, Pure Havane, Pure Malt, Pure Tonka, Ultra Zest* \\- I grouped all these up because with all of these, you're just getting a perfume that's a slight variation of the original A\\*Men. No matter which one you pick, you know what you're getting with all of them - a sweet fragrance that smells a lot of vanilla and patchouli, with maybe one or two other notes thrown in the mix. That's not a bad thing, though. I love A\\*Men and I love all the flankers. There's a reason this line is so iconic, with so many people out there determined to chase down every single variation ever made.\n* **Parfum Prissana** *Mandarava* \\- this has about 3,000 notes, so for me I mainly get civet oakmoss, but one look at Parfumo and Fragrantica shows everybody else gets something different. I like this perfume a lot, but it's nothing too special - on me, it smells like a classic chypre perfume. Of course, this differs for everyone, so if you are interested in this take what I say with a grain of salt.\n* **Rogue Perfumery** *Chypre-Siam* \\- kaffir lime, civet and oakmoss. This perfume was my favorite discovery of last year. This isn't an original perfume in any way, but it is the perfection of modern perfumery inspired by classical perfumery. The best part, though, is that this perfume is non-IFRA compliant, so it has real oakmoss and civet in it, which smells incredible.\n* **Serge Lutens** *Fille en aiguilles* \\- pine needre, frankincense, dried fruits. I'm not an expert on coniferous perfumes, but to me this smells like the deep insides of a dense, richly populated forest. I don't get many occasions to wear this perfume, but always look forward to when the opportunity arises.\n* **Serge Lutens** *Un bois vanille* \\- tonka, vanilla and coconut. Take vanilla essence, and add coconut to it. That is this fragrance. The vanilla is as authentic as they come, and so is the coconut. A perfect fragrance for a spring day out in the town.\n* **Tom Ford** *Mandarino di Amalfi* \\- mandarin (even though it isn't listed as a note). It's hard to imagine that there is no mandarin in this perfume, after all, it is named after the fruit and smells exactly like it. This is a stunning, clean freshie that works best fresh out of the shower.\n* **Tom Ford** *Noir Extreme* \\- vanilla, cardamom and kulfi (which is an Indian desert). This smells delicious. A very sweet gourmand, this radiates warmth throughout its entire life. Just a fair warning, though - try not to bite your arm whenever you spray it there. The temptation may be daunting.\n* **Tom Ford** *Plum Japonais* \\- plum, oud, fir and cypress. This is a strange one. Not bad in any ways, just a wholly unique and interesting perfume. This definitely leans female, and probably works a lot better on women than on me, but I enjoy wearing this a lot, especially during winter. This is a dark perfume, and many of the times I've worn it I've actually struggled to pick out the notes I'm smelling. Definitely one to try before you buy.\n* **Tom Ford** *Tobacco Vanille* \\- 'aromatic spices', tobacco and vanilla. This on me smells like a sexy strong chai latte. It's a sweet, spicy, smoky, woody concoction of notes that smells so good on my skin I just want to drink it.\n* **Viktor & Rolf** *Antidote* \\- lavender and incense. This is a boring, over-hyped perfume not worth the prices floating around at all. Someone once described it to me as \"incense water\", and that is exactly how it smells. I only got this because it was offered to me in a trade, and I'm going to keep it as the value keeps rising and then cash in on it. A lot of people want this perfume because since being discontinued it has been hyped up like crazy, but the truth is it got discontinued for a reason, and that reason is that it is an incredibly boring fragrance.\n* **Xerjoff** *Ceylon* \\- black tea, honey, oud and jasmine sambac. This is one poopy, barnyardy fragrance and I love it. This has one of the most beautiful drydowns I've ever smelled, as the opening oud and jasmine sambac settles into a sensual pairing of tea and honey. This is on the really pricey side, though, so I strongly recommend against blind buying this.\n* **Xerjoff** *Erba Pura* \\- musk, vanilla and a lot of fruits. This is dynamite in a bottle, possible the most potent perfume I have ever owned. Thankfully, it smells great too though. This isn't a complicated perfume at all, just a complete sensory overload of vanilla, musk and fruits. I like it a lot, but for some people it can be too sweet due to all that fruit and vanilla. Also, I know some people are still confused about Xerjoff and Sospiro. Yes, this was a Sospiro fragrance first, but both companies are owned by Sergio Momo and he decided to consolidate them both into one, keeping the Xerjoff name and making the Sospiro line the new Velvet Collection. Same fragrances, different bottle.\n* **Xerjoff** *La Capitale* \\- strawberry, caramel, benzoin and vanilla. This is a very sweet fragrance, but in a very delicate way. This is a bit strange, but the way to describe how this smells is to compare it to the taste of the Strawberry and Cream Chuppa Chup lollipop. This smells just like that tastes.\n* **Yves Saint Laurent** *L'Homme* \\- vanilla, ginger and apple (even though this isn't a listed note). This is my favorite dumb-reach fragrance. A nice, fresh apple aroma is what I get from this, and while it's performance is severely lacking, every time I wear this I smile a lot.\n\nI've left several perfumes out; two Moroccan ones that don't exist outside of a dodgy Facebook page, two from a local clone house, and one perfume from a Singaporean house called Sfir Aromatics that specialize in custom perfumes, but other than these, this is my entire collection. \n\nIf you've read all the way to the end, thank you and I hope you've enjoyed reading about my collection. If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them all :)",

Feel like the flair should be *Review.* Hope you do more of the same as reviews, maybe expand just a tad, not much.\n\nEdited to add: I thought Amouage Jubilation for men and Timbuktu might be by the same perfumer and they are. Timbuktu came about four years before Jubilation XXV. Bertrand Duchaufour. A B2B review of the two would be interesting (you could just copy and paste).\n\nMy long review of [*Herba Pura*.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/78610m/review_sospiro_herba_pura_you_1980s_fruity_floral/) You are spot on.\n\nAdded: Consider checking out *Recommend me a Fragrance* if you haven't. I think you'd make some excellent recommendations. Some of my recommendations are blind, based on accords. I read your description of *Royal Mayfair*, a recent blind recommendation for eucalyptus, and I was like *nailed it*!\n\nAnd finally, consider doing Show & Tell weekend posts (or reviews or both) broken down by accords?  There are several red berry focused perfumes here, and that sour apple (people ask for apple all the time.) ‚Äî Yves St. Laurent *L'Homme* and Byredo *Pulp*.  If you like strawberry, check out Slumberhouse *Sadanne*, also Soivohle *Strawberries and Black Pepper* (exactly as named).\n\nLast question: what's your process for choosing a perfume to try? Do you look for certain accords or scent profiles (like I did with rose) or is it more random than that? Or do you go by other recommendations? Or are you looking for a certain vibe like formal/casual/cool or hot weather?\n\nMy eye keeps swinging back to Amouage *Myths Man*. Something intriguing about it (I'm F). May try that, perhaps Woman too.\n\nTl;dr. Great stash ‚Äî variety of niche, designer, accords, and price. Enough good info here for several different posts. And capsule reviews are very valuable when they are as descriptive as these. Not everyone wants to read a long review",

    "body": "I've been trying out indies for almost a year now, and have amassed a reasonable collection of full sizes and an absolutely deranged hoarde of samples that I found to be ok for me, but not something I need 5ml or more of. There are so many that I find myself too overwhelmed to get into the sample drawer very much, which kind of negates the point of keeping them! In an attempt to know my collection better and maybe even pare it down, I thought I'd try a little tournament-style review of scents in the same family.\n\nThe rules:\n\n* I choose a scent \"family\" and within that family, assign scents to brackets based on similar notes (e.g. the family could be Amber and brackets could be white amber, amber resin, etc.). These are all scents I've tried and made notes on before, so I (theoretically) have a first impression and some idea of which bracket they fit into based on actual wear, not just notes, going in.\n* Scents are tried two at a time, comparing the most similar first - the goal here is to pick one winner of each round, and decide on keeping or destashing. (I'm not \\*requiring\\* myself to destash the loser of each contest, but hoping some paring will naturally occur as I directly compare similar scents and decide I clearly prefer one. Which might make you ask \"is this really a Thunderdome then?\" To which I merrily wave my hands and move on.)\n* Winners of each contest go on to compete with each other until there's one ultimate winner, which gets increasingly meaningless as scents get less similar across brackets, but nonetheless, I persevere.\n\n\\-----\n\nFor my first outing, I decided on VANILLA THUNDERDOME, comparing scents that feature vanilla as the star or at least as an equal partner with other notes. Here's how I fared:\n\n\\------\n\n*Contestants:*\n\n**Amber Bracket**\n\n* Apparition (Hexennacht) - Spectral amber, alabaster vanilla, bone-white woods. \n* Black Vanilla (Hexennacht) - golden amber, three different vanillas, marshmallow fluff, musk \n* Eternal Ankh (NAVA) - White Amber, Powdered and reconstructed oil of Egyptian Vanilla Husk, Vanilla fleck, African White Vanilla and the scent of soft Egyptian Sands (from the White Amber accord) \n* The Sweater We Buried You With Is Hanging In My Closet (Death and Floral) - A luscious blend of three different vanillas, resinous ambers, Arabian sandalwood, a soft cashmere sweater \n\n**Basics Bracket**\n\n* Bonbons a la Vanille (Kyse) - A grown up Vanilla Candy. We started with Tahitian vanilla beans made into a new accord, then added some Peru balsam and a warm skin scent base. \n* Spectre (Hexennacht) - Hex-blend solinote of vanilla, vanilla, and more vanilla. NO bakery/caramel notes. \n\n**Nature Bracket**\n\n* Athena (Poesie) - sun-baked Mediterranean herbs and earth, a rich and resinous vanilla spiked with a complex blend of incense and spice, exquisite grey musk \n* It's All In Your Head (Death and Floral) - Sun-warmed Texas sunflowers in a bright field, luscious dark amber, vanilla, and freshly baked bread.\n\n**Other Bracket**\n\n* Cardigan (Poesie) - creamy Mysore sandalwood spiced with cardamom pods & pimento berries, French vanilla, white chocolate, comforting sweater musk \n* Smoke and Mirrors (Alkemia) - An elusive, smokey blend of burning wood, Madagascar Vanilla, and Tonka.\n* Vanille Patchouli (Alkemia) - Purest vanilla seduced and despoiled by wild, dirty patchouli. \n\n**Spice Bracket**\n\n* Cozy (Poesie) - spicy cardamom + rich vanilla \n* Poivre Vanille (Hexennacht) - Vanilla, pink peppercorn, black pepper, amber, cedar, conifers, clove. \n* Sky Amber (NAVA) - Ethereal Vanilla essence, Crystalline essence, Vanilla Bean Absolute, Vanilla Cream, Cardamom, Egyptian Cedar, Egyptian Frankincense, Egyptian Sandalwood, Egyptian Rock Rose, Egyptian Patchouli, Egyptian Siam and Bastet Amber essence. \n\n**Wildcard Bracket** *(e.g. I impulsively purchased and received still more vanilla scents while running this contest, someone send help)*\n\n* Estate Vanilla (Solstice Scents) - Raw Vanilla Pods, Vanilla Infused Sugar, Cream & Vanilla Extract. Our Rich House Vanilla. \n* Lavender Vanilla (Solstice Scents) - Lavender Essential Oil & Sweet Creamy Vanilla. \n\n\\-----\n\n*Round 1 - bracket winners:*\n\n**Amber Bracket winner: Apparition.**\n\n* I pitted Black Vanilla against Sweater and ended up putting both on my destash list. Black Vanilla was a pretty basic vanilla on me, not too thrilling, and Sweater went too perfumey on me, something I'd put in my notes previously, but decided to keep the sample because I was hoping the really nice amber/vanilla thing it has going on would prevail. It did not. I declared Black Vanilla the technical winner of this contest because it's...fine on me. Eternal Ankh vs. Apparition was much more of a contest; both scents are great. Apparition got the nod because it's a balanced blend of cool clean amber and woodsy vanilla, while EA is more amber and sand on me, with vanilla way in the background.\n\n**Basics Bracket winner: Bonbons a la Vanille.**\n\n* This was another easy contest - Spectre was kind of thin and a little plasticky for me, and just didn't cut it compared to the rich, sweet, slightly boozy vanilla bomb of Bonbons. I ended up destashing Spectre because if I want just vanilla, I'm going to grab Bonbons every time.\n\n**Nature Bracket winner: Athena.**\n\n* This was a tough one because I like both scents a lot - I can see the winner here going either way depending on the weather or my mood. For this contest, I gravitated to the light herbal freshness of Athena slightly more this time; I can see It's All in Your Head taking the lead on a lazy late-summer day when there's a little hint of fall chill in the air. There's something lazy and sticky-pollen and end-of-season about it. Keeping both scents.\n\n**Other Bracket winner: Vanille Patchouli.**\n\n* A bit of a walk for VP, which I find such an intriguing scent, with a creamy sophisticated vanilla playing against a very green, fresh, wild patchouli. I can really go either way with patch but I find this one compelling. Smoke and Mirrors failed to thrill in comparison to Vanille Patchouli; the smoke dominates on me, and is more \"charred wood\" than \"fresh bonfire,\" kind of harsh. Cardigan (also contested with Vanille Patchouli) I found to be a nice dry woodsy sort of vanilla, but I wished for a bit more oomph from the pimento berries and cardamom than I got; I'm keeping it for now, but the patch wins this round. Smoke and Mirrors goes onto the destash list.\n\n**Spice Bracket winner: Poivre Vanille.**\n\n* I first put Cozy up against Sky Amber and Sky Amber walked away with it. Cozy has a weirdly buttery quality on me that's out of place and persists through the dry down, and the cardamom is sort of fleeting. In comparison, Sky Amber presents a rich, sweet vanilla with a very realistic cardamom that packs a punch. I love cardamom and can't get enough of it, so my only complaint with Sky Amber is that I wish the cardamom stayed stronger, longer. Still, it dries down to a nice, lightly spicy vanilla that's enjoyable and easy to wear. Head-to-head with Poivre Vanille, Sky Amber just barely gets edged out because Poivre's spice profile lasts a bit longer on me, blending with a very good vanilla for a smooth, comforting dry down. I'm keeping both Sky Amber and Poivre but the bracket goes to Poivre.\n\n**Wildcard Bracket winner: Lavender Vanilla.**\n\n* Lavender Vanilla is a \"does what it says on the tin\" scent and it does it well, with astringent herbal lavender balanced with light, airy vanilla. Estate Vanilla is ok, but on me it goes from a killer opening that's near-perfect, rich vanilla, to a scent that's more about the sugar and cream than anything else. It's ok but I'm here for vanilla, so Lavender Vanilla takes the game. Keeping both of these, at least for now, as they have had the least rest.\n\n\\-----\n\n*Round 2 - bracket winners head-to-head (sparing you extensive notes here since at this point, most of them are just \"I liked it better\"):*\n\n* Apparition vs. Lavender Vanilla: winner - **Apparition.**\n* Athena vs. Vanille Patchouli: winner - **Vanille Patchouli** (by the slimmest of hairs).\n* Bonbons a la Vanille vs. Poivre Vanille: winner - **Poivre Vanille.** I flipped and flopped AND flipped again over this contest, but Poivre Vanille ended up edging out Bonbons because I love that little spicy peppery kick it has and its cool, mellow overall profile.\n\n\\-----\n\n*Round 3 - overall winner:*\n\n* **Poivre Vanille** walks triumphantly out of Thunderdome as the victor! It's right in that Goldilocks sweet spot of being everyday wearable for me while serving an extra level of interest from the spices (unlike Apparition, which is great but low-key and subtle on me; or Vanille Patchouli, which is a striking weirdo probably best enjoyed in moderation). \n\n\\-----\n\n*Other notes:*\n\n* Scents tested: 16 / destashed: 5 - a promising near 1/3 destash rate from this family!\n* I now know I have go-to scents for spiced vanillas, sweet vanillas, herbal vanillas, vanilla vanillas and weirdo vanillas. I'm probably all set for vanillas!\n* (I will, nonetheless, probably buy more samples of vanillas.)\n* Comparing similar scents really helped me map them a bit better in my brain. I'm less overwhelmed by at least this one segment of my collection and will actually use those I'm keeping.\n* The word \"vanilla\" doesn't look real to me any more.\n\n\\-----\n\nThanks for reading all this, if you did! It was a fun exercise for me.",

However, now I can wash every other day (and maybe even less then that?) with this new method and my hair looks clean and normal!\n\nI just ordered some arrow root powder off of amazon, added 10 drops of lavender essential oil (only to make it smell nice), and dusted it on my hair with a makeup brush.  Just a hint, if you have a lot of hair like me, make sure section your hair to dust the powder everywhere.  Also, try putting it on before going to bed!  It will take some trial and error to figure out how much you need to use, but I‚Äôm so happy with this method!\n\nPS: if you‚Äôre brunette you can add coacoa powder to make the powder brown instead of white :)",

    "body": " The dreams started about a month ago. I‚Äôve racked my brain to come up with something that could have triggered it, but everything was ordinary. \n\nMy life was going wonderfully. I had just gotten a promotion, moved into a new apartment, my relationship had never been better. Nothing was wrong, nothing was out of sorts.\n\nI‚Äôve never had particularly vivid dreams. Usually, I can‚Äôt even remember them when I wake up. But this was wholly different. \n\nI was exhausted that day ‚Äì I‚Äôd had multiple meetings at work and had only just gotten home that night. I fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow. \n\nAnd then I was there, in my dream world, lifting my head. Only, it wasn‚Äôt a dream world.\n\nYou know when you dream and everything has that languid, dream-like quality? Like there is a haze over everything and no matter how hard you squint, you can‚Äôt make anything out clearly. And the way one implausible thing flows into the next implausible thing, and no matter how hard you try to think, you can‚Äôt remember why that wouldn‚Äôt make sense in the waking world. \n\nThis wasn‚Äôt like that at all.\n\nIt was hazy, but a familiar haze. The haze of my old apartment. The one I shared with *him.* It was hazy because the only light coming in was filtered through the tiny basement window, the one that hadn‚Äôt been cleaned in years. Dust particles floated in the air and settled around me. \n\nI pushed back the sheets to discover that I was dressed in jeans and a t-shirt which I had sweat through during the night. The sheets were not the fern-printed satin ones I had picked out for my new apartment, they were the old flannel grey ones. The t-shirt was not one of my own but one of *his*, one I remembered sanctimoniously burning after I had left.\n\n*What‚Äôs going on?* I thought. *Why am I here?*\n\nThen I spotted my phone tangled up in the grey sheets beside me. The screen was shattered. I picked it up and unlocked it ‚Äì *11:45am, March 3rd, 2021.*\n\nHow could it be? The last time I had been in that apartment ‚Äì those sheets, that t-shirt ‚Äì was late 2016. That is when I had finally gotten out and gotten as far away as possible. There was no way I could have woken up back there again.\n\nThe room was tinted grey, but the dull tinge was so familiar. \n\nI tried everything I could to wake myself out of the dream ‚Äì I stared at my hands, which were still mine, still human, but with bruises on the knuckles. I flipped on and off all the light switches, shorting out a few bulbs. Everything was the way it should be.\n\nI wasn‚Äôt in a dream ‚Äì I was in something very real.\n\nI started to panic and ran to the basement door with its maze of locks and tried to get out, but it wouldn‚Äôt budge more than a few centimeters. I could see the brassy weight of a padlock through the crack of the door. \n\nI opened the mini fridge in the room, nothing but spoiled milk and Bud Light. I frantically unlocked my phone and scrolled through the recent texts ‚Äì my mom, him, some names I didn‚Äôt recognize. \n\nI tried to call my mom but it went straight to voicemail. I waited for the beep.\n\n‚Äú*Please tell me what year it is,‚Äù* I said flatly and hung up. I tried to check social media, the news, anything, but I couldn‚Äôt connect to the Internet. \n\nFinally, I called him. The phone rang five times, my heart clenched with each ring.\n\n‚ÄúZo√´, I‚Äôm at work,‚Äù he said. I winced at the sound of his voice. I tried to talk, but the inside of my mouth tasted tinny and rotten.\n\n‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on...‚Äù I whispered.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back tonight. Maybe we‚Äôll go for a drive.‚Äù The phone clicked as he hung up.\n\nI threw myself on the bed, sobbing and sobbing. I was trapped here. I burrowed my face into the grey sheets, which smelled of sweat and mothballs, and wept until I must have drifted back off to sleep.\n\nI woke up with a jolt. To my relief, I saw the familiar fern-printed sheets when I looked down around me. Early morning light was streaming in, hitting the plants on my windowsill, illuminating a small patch of ferns on the bed. Kevin was asleep wistfully next to me. I thought gratefully of how gentle and kind he was.\n\nI was back in my sanctuary; I was not in my old life anymore. \n\nI went about my day and tried to forget about it, but I was shaken. I felt shell-shocked going into my office, looking around at my files, the framed picture on my desk of me and Kevin. I vowed never to take any of this for granted. Still, I could not shake off the grey haze of the dream.\n\nI went asleep tentatively that night. I read some of the book I‚Äôd gotten out of the library, I dabbed lavender essential oil on my temples. Eventually, I drifted off.\n\nI woke up in the same tangle of grey sheets again. Wisps of hair were pasted to my face. It was dark this time ‚Äì no light came in through the window. I unlocked my phone and scrolled through it again. \n\n*11:52 pm, March 4th, 2021*, it said.\n\n‚Äú*Where are you?!?!‚Äù* I had texted him thirty minutes ago, ‚Äúyou said you‚Äôd be home at nine‚Ä¶‚Äù I had written ten minutes later.\n\nI saw there was a voicemail from my mom. I didn‚Äôt bother listening to it ‚Äì just called her straight back. She answered right away.\n\n‚Äú*Mom,*‚Äù I gasped, ‚Äúis it you?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHoney, you‚Äôre really worrying me,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúhave you been taking something?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMom, I think I‚Äôm stuck in a bad dream,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúPlease tell me what‚Äôs going on. What year is it?‚Äù\n\n‚Äú2021?‚Äù she answered.\n\n‚ÄúI thought I left this place in 2016. What the hell happened?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou were gonna,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúbut you said you couldn‚Äôt afford your own apartment. You didn‚Äôt want to quit your job here. He promised he would change, he was gonna get help. You know, the usual shtick.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not possible,‚Äù I said. \n\nJust then, I heard the heavy padlock clank from outside and my nervous system was on fire.\n\n‚ÄúMom, I have to go,‚Äù I said. \n\nI ran to the bathroom, locking the door behind me. I rifled through the bathroom cabinet to find something that would knock me out, fast. I needed to escape to my real life.\n\nI went through all the little orange bottles. They rattled like little maracas as they fell to the floor. The best I could find was Lorazepam. I popped five into my mouth. He was banging on the door, and I could see it warp. \n\nI felt myself falling, falling and then I jolted awake again. I looked for the ferns on the sheets ‚Äì they were there. Kevin was snoring. I burst into tears.\n\nHow could I still be so trapped? Why did I have to mentally go back there?\n\nEvery night is the same. I put my head on the pillow in this life, I wake up in that one. Sometimes he‚Äôs out drinking, sometimes he‚Äôs banging on the door. I tried calling all the contacts in that phone and they all say the same thing ‚Äì it‚Äôs 2021, I never left him, I never got out of that apartment. I simply surrendered to that life.\n\nAt this point, I don‚Äôt know which life is the one that is truly happening. I‚Äôm living them both, and each day I become more exhausted. I fear each night that he‚Äôll get closer, he‚Äôll get in my face, and I‚Äôll be trapped in that life forever. The life in which I never left and everything stayed the same. Please, I‚Äôve tried everything and I just need it to stop.",

The worst dream I had was feeling trapped in my house and knowing I was asleep, so I started clapping as hard as I could in the dream to try to wake myself up in real life, and it wasn't working and I couldn't wake myself up. Once I was awake I refused to go back to sleep even though I was tired because I was scared of being trapped again. \n\n.\n\nThis kind of made me think of you.",

I wanted to share a small travel altar/shrine (whichever verbage you prefer) I made for Hermes. \n\nInside is a square of charcoal gray faux fur due to his Shepard connections, a dollar in quarters for his connection to finance and commerce, a piece of Timothy Hay, a lavender purple crayon for his connection with lavender and stationary, a piece of charcoal, a dog tag (with my old name lol, it was on a necklace I gave my wife when I went by that name and it connects to Hermes via his connection with guard dogs and the reason I usually travel -for my wife-), a scorbunny coin due to his connection with hares, gold, commerce, and trade (pokemon is big for trading), and pieces of my dog's broken collar that he wore when we traveled to LA and he kept us safe while we attended the Kiss concert. Plus his name is Sonic and the collar was Sonic themed, which both humans the blue hedgehog are always on the go. \n\nI also added lavender essential oil, and a nameplate which includes the winged helmet, winged sandal, the caduceus, a red tailed hawk (common out here), and a turtle/tortoise shell lyre. \n\nI'm going to be carrying with me to work and other places so he can keep me safe, and help me too if he can. I'm hoping he helps me get this job I'm really wanting to get, so I'll keep this with me while I apply and hopefully interview. Wish me luck! \n\nThank you for checking this post out ",

It's got a fantastic flavour and a really good acid tang to it - something that makes it a really refreshing drink, especially on a hot day.\n\nSo after a lot of taste testing and experiments based on my cola cordial recipes with some adjustments, I've got pretty damn close. So, without further ado, here's my recipe.\n\n**Cola Flavour Base**\n\n* 250ml 95% alcohol\n* 8.5ml mandarin essential oil\n* 7ml lime essential oil\n* 2ml lemon essential oil\n* 1.5ml nutmeg essential oil\n* 0.75ml cassia essential oil\n* 0.5ml coriander essential oil\n* 0.5ml neroli essential oil (can substitute petitgrain if neroli is too expensive)\n* 0.25ml lavender essential oil\n\nMake this and store in an airtight bottle. It needs to age for a few weeks before use, so keep it in a cool, dark cupboard.\n\n**Mandarin Essence**\n\n* 30ml 95% alcohol\n* 1.5ml mandarin essential oil\n\n**Syrup Base (makes 1 litre of cordial)**\n\n* 800g white sugar\n* 500ml hot water\n* 10ml glycerine\n* 10ml E150d (caramel colour)\n* 5ml phosphoric acid 75% (or 4.5g citric acid)\n* 350mg caffeine powder\n\nOnce the syrup has cooled, add\n\n* 2ml Cola Flavour Base\n* 1.5ml Mandarin Essence\n\nMix well and bottle. It works best if you let the syrup age for a few days to let the flavours really meld together.\n\nAdd 3ml (1oz) to a glass and top up with 210ml (7oz) ice cold sparkling water.\n\nEnjoy!",

The only reason I haven‚Äôt mentioned the name in previous posts is because I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôre allowed to here. \n\nAnyway, the Huns and Brohuns have descended on Vegas so that they can celebrate earning $1.00 on each aluminum free deodorant they sell. Apparently they‚Äôre all physicians too because they like to remind people that aluminum deodorant causes Alzheimer‚Äôs. Listen, I know some people choose aluminum free deodorant for a variety of reasons and I‚Äôm not knocking those choices. All I‚Äôm saying is that the aluminum is used for a reason I learned the hard way. A few years ago, I put ‚ÄúDove spray deodorant - any scent‚Äù on the grocery list for my husband. I figured even he couldn‚Äôt screw that up. Fast forward a week or so and I was leaving the gym and I realized that it was not in fact the lady next to me that smelled like a dumpster. It was me. And worse, I‚Äôd been noticing it for days. I was so distraught that I immediately assumed I had some sort of terminal illness and my organs were rotting and decaying and releasing a pungent odor. I actually called my husband at work. I‚Äôve never done that. I didn‚Äôt even call when my father died. I sent a text. But this‚Ä¶ this needed a call to the phone that sits on his desk. He told me not to go to the closest Emergency Room and reassured me that body odor is rarely terminal and we would deal with it when he got home. So I went home and looked at the deodorant he had bought and then I saw it: ALUMINUM FREE. \n\nThat was the day I learned why deodorant has aluminum in it. Sorry about that tangent, back to the Vegas invasion of Huns and Brohuns who may or may not have body odor due to using aluminum free deodorant and masking it with lavender essential oil. Who wants to be the one to tell them that literally every company pays for rooms when employees have to travel? They pay for rooms, food, transportation, airport parking, and so much more. My husband once got really sick on a business trip and his company sent an Uber to get him and bring him to urgent care, and an Uber to pick him back up, bring him to the pharmacy, and back to his hotel. Then they paid to change his flight so he could rest an extra two days. That meant paying an extra two days at the hotel. Oh, and the health insurance provided by his silly corporate job paid for his emergency care visit and the prescriptions he needed to get well again. They even had food delivered to his room without being asked so that he didn‚Äôt have to leave and could rest. So yeah, Brohun, literally every company ‚Äúcomps‚Äù rooms and they‚Äôre not always at the shittiest hotel on the Vegas strip.\n\nI really hate this particular MLM because they seem to prey on really uneducated people with little to no real world experience. It enrages me that these people can‚Äôt comprehend that they‚Äôre not going to become millionaires by making $1 per stick of deodorant they sell.",

    "body": "GBC- Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Body Butter: I like this a lot and it smells heavenlyüòç. I've mostly been using it on my feet in the mornings and before bed.  I layer it with a dermasil lotion and its been a great combo for me. I put on socks and it helps keep everything in! 9/10\n\nChap Ice Lip Balm- wonderful product, keeps my lips moisturized and soft. It has a light scent but i think it's nice. 10/10\n\nUdderly Smooth Hand and Body Cream- love this stuff. I've used it for years and it's always a go to moisturizer. It's perfect to take with you in your purse/bag. 10/10\n\nDermasil Eczema Relief Body Lotion- light smell but pleasant, works extremely well to hydrate the skin and keep it that way. It's probably one of the best lotions I've ever tried. I layer it with other creams/lotions from DT as the last step to seal everything in and my skin has never looked or been more healthy :) 20/10\n\nB.Pure Body Lotions- They're all awesome and smell luxurious to me. They are my daily lotions. They work well, much better than I had anticipated! You get a good amount in the bottles as well! Absolutely worth the money. I keep one in my livingroom, my nightstand, and in my car. 20/10\n\nB.Pure Makeup Remover Cleansing Oil- nice remover. Works well to break down mascara, although I don't do waterproof so I can't vouch for that. Ive been using my fingers with it to remove my makeup and it seems to work much better than using a cotton pad. Anywho, has a nice smell, nothing too strong and id repurchase it. 8/10\n\nB.Pure Pads (Various sizes)-\nI liked these a lot. They worked well for me. They stayed in place and were comfortable to wear. They do have lavender essential oil though so maybe something to think about before getting some, if you're sensitive to fragrance. Lastly, they are affordable and I saved so much money. All of these together cost less than 1 box of tampons at walmart, and in this economy, that makes a huge difference. 10/10\n\nWay to Skin collagen mask- i liked it. Nothing special, it's a fun and relaxing thing to do on a random night if you want to treat yourself. I always love how hydrated my skin looks after using these. 7/10\n\nB.Pure hand mask- unfortunately this was a no go for me. It was fun at first but at the end when I rubbed all the liquid in, my hands were so sticky. And I cannnnot do sticky hands, it's a sensory nightmare for me lol id skip this one guys. 1/10\n\nGBC Glowing Exfoliating Toner- I like this a lot. Works well and I love the clean feeling on my face after I use it. No reactions or anything but I'm also not sensitive to a lot of things. Scent is nice, not overpowering. 10/10\n\nI hope these reviews were helpful! ü©∑ ",

    "body": "I've seen lots of posts on here looking for sleep advice, but only a couple comprehensive posts with tips, so I thought I'd share some of mine.\n\nBackground: I have always (since at least middle school) struggled to fall asleep, stay asleep, and wake up at the time I'm supposed to. In my mid-twenties, I decided to get serious about sleeping better and embarked on an odyssey of sleep hygiene. This list represents 5+ years of researching and testing various methods to help me sleep better.\n\nNote: This was for my sleep problems while UNMEDICATED. I was only diagnosed with ADHD earlier this year and just started medication. Luckily the meds haven't messed with my sleep much, but that means that I don't have tips that are specific to stimulant-related insomnia, sorry! Ask your doc!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOrganized in order from lowest-barrier to highest-barrier. The ones that helped me the most are in **bold**, and I've provided links to research where possible. I also tried to have them be things that require little to no effort in the moment or not much planning ahead.\n\nSLEEP TIPS:\n\n* Bed/bedroom is for sleep only\n   * Trains your brain to connect bed with sleep\n      * Don't do work or study on your bed\n      * Don't sit on your bed while hanging out with friends\n      * Try not to watch TV or do a lot of screen time in bed (I know, it's hard)\n* **Complete darkness**\n   * Seems obvious, but any night-time light inhibits melatonin production in your body, which makes it harder to sleep (and messes with your circadian rhythm) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light\\_effects\\_on\\_circadian\\_rhythm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_effects_on_circadian_rhythm), [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4375362/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4375362/)\n      * Blackout curtains\n      * Nothing that has a light on it in the room/visible\n      * Close the bedroom door if you can\n      * My last apartment had an open loft as the bedroom, so I hung curtains from the ceiling all around the bed and that helped a lot\n      * Eye mask can also work, though I find them too uncomfortable to sleep in\n* Lavender *\\[EDIT: Lavender essential oil is toxic to cats and birds and could trigger asthma symptoms in humans, so be careful! Thanks to* u/Eluaschild and u/fightmebeck *for the info!\\]*\n   * Lavender seems to work as a mild sedative [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4505755/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4505755/), [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16298774/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16298774/)\n      * They sell lavender pillow spray that helped me feel sleepy but irritated my asthma so I stopped using it\n      * Once a kid I was babysitting had a humidifier with lavender and when I went in the room I almost immediately passed out from how sleepy it made me\n* White noise machine\n   * Blocks out random noises that distract/wake you up\n      * The brand Dohm makes the best ones, but there are lots that aren't too expensive\n      * A fan would also work\n      * There are also free/cheap apps for white noise! h/t to u/BonesTheHeretic!\n* **Melatonin supplement**\n   * Melatonin is a natural hormone that your body releases at night to make you sleepy (it's triggered by darkness, hence second bullet point above). Apparently a lot of people with ADHD have this thing where melatonin is released in their body much later in the evening than other people, and supplements might help with sleep. [https://apsard.org/are-you-a-night-owl-about-adhd-and-late-sleep/](https://apsard.org/are-you-a-night-owl-about-adhd-and-late-sleep/), [https://chadd.org/adhd-weekly/new-research-directions-on-adhd-and-sleep/](https://chadd.org/adhd-weekly/new-research-directions-on-adhd-and-sleep/)\n      * I take it every night, but do your research and talk to your doctor (especially if you're on medications)\n      * I read in another post on here that prolonged use can make your body stop producing it on its own, but I haven't seen any credible sources back that up. Here is info on safety: [https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/melatonin-what-you-need-to-know](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/melatonin-what-you-need-to-know)\n* **Pregnancy pillow**\n   * I am not now, nor have I ever been, pregnant, but seriously this pregnancy pillow is so comfortable. It's one of the U-shaped ones and it's been a game-changer.\n* **Meditation App**\n   * Helps me stop my brain from going a mile a minute and get into sleep mode. Also, after doing the same meditation every night for years, I feel like it's just become Pavlovian at this point.\n      * I use Headspace (there's a specific meditation recording to help you fall asleep) but any body scan/progressive relaxation meditation would probably help. Headspace is expensive :\\\\\n* **Turn temperature down at night**\n   * A decreasing body temperature is correlated with the onset of sleep [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3427038/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3427038/), [https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/12/sleep-cold/604111/](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/12/sleep-cold/604111/)\n      * Obviously requires some ability to control temperature in your home, or at least your bedroom, so this one is a higher-barrier one, unfortunately.\n      * I usually keep the temp at 72F during the day, so I crank it down to 65F-68F (ish) at night.\n      * **This has been one of the single most helpful things on this list for me.**\n* **Smart bulbs or wake-up light in the morning**\n   * More circadian rhythm stuff. The light signals to your body to stop making melatonin and wakes you up naturally. I find I'm less likely to go back to sleep when the light wakes me up, and I think it helps preserve my overall sleep cycle.\n      * There are several standalone wake-up lights that do this, at varying price points (the one I used to use is made by Philips)\n      * Smart bulbs (LIFX, Philips Hue) will accomplish this as well (and you can have them turn off at a certain time at night too)\n* **Casper Glow lights**\n   * Bedside lights that slowly dim as you go to sleep and can wake you up in the morning\n      * Including this as a separate bullet because these lights specifically really help me wind down and get sleepy and they're super easy to use. They are expensive, though, which is why they're at the bottom of the list!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nLots of this may seem obvious to some, but I had to learn it all at one point! Slowly adding these things into my sleep routine over several years has seriously improved my sleep. I hope there's something in here that may help you too!\n\nEdited to add a couple things I forgot! Thanks to everyone for the additional info in the comments, keep it coming and I'll keep editing!",

    "body": "I recently took the advice of @Celestial-Year-1133 (thank you, friend, for the recommendation: it was spot on!) and picked up the Diptyque Paris city candle ‚Äî I‚Äôm in love. While it‚Äôs described as having a chypre accord and lavender, my (admittedly untrained) nose doesn‚Äôt really detect much lavender, at least not in the way I‚Äôve experienced it in other candles or perfumes (read: it doesn‚Äôt smell like lavender essential oil).\n\nTo me, it smells clean ‚Äî like a classic men‚Äôs foug√®re cologne, evoking the feel of an old-school barbershop. It‚Äôs the scent of a man in a sharp, timeless suit. The throw is impressive: not overpowering, but easily fills a room like my office or bedroom.\n\nThis is definitely one I‚Äôll repurchase, and I highly recommend it if you enjoy woody, fresh, clean, slightly masculine-leaning cologne-type fragrances.\n\nP.S. \n\nA chypre accord (pronounced sheep-rah) is one of the great classic fragrance structures in perfumery. It‚Äôs built around a specific combination of notes:\n\n-Citrus top notes (often bergamot)\n\n-Floral or fruity heart (like rose or jasmine)\n\n-Earthy, mossy, woody base ‚Äî most importantly oakmoss, labdanum (a resin), and sometimes patchouli\n\nThe result is a scent that‚Äôs often described as dry, mossy, woody, earthy, slightly floral, and quite sophisticated.\n\nIt‚Äôs not meant to be sweet or overtly floral ‚Äî it‚Äôs more about balance and contrast: the brightness of citrus, the softness of florals, and the grounding, slightly bitter depth of the mossy-woody base.\n\nIt‚Äôs a famously ‚Äúgrown-up‚Äù style of fragrance, often used in classic perfumes like Guerlain Mitsouko or Rochas Femme.\n\nProbably reasons that the lavender doesn‚Äôt come through much for me:\n\n1.) Lavender can be subtle or reshaped.\nIn perfumery, lavender doesn‚Äôt always smell like the sharp, herbal, almost camphorous lavender you sniff in a fresh bunch or essential oil. It can be softened, blended, or reworked ‚Äî sometimes it‚Äôs powdery, sometimes it‚Äôs sweetened, sometimes it‚Äôs so tucked into the background that it just adds a ‚Äúfresh‚Äù or ‚Äúclean‚Äù impression without shouting ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lavender!‚Äù\n\n2.) The chypre and foug√®re overlap.\nInterestingly, chypre and foug√®re families share some DNA ‚Äî foug√®re (which literally means ‚Äúfern‚Äù in French) is built on lavender, oakmoss, and coumarin. But in something like the Paris candle, the chypre accord may be taking the lead, giving more of that mossy, woody, (very) faint citrusy backbone. The lavender is probably acting like a support player rather than a soloist.\n\n3.) My nose is picking up the dominant accords. Our brains tends to latch onto the most dominant scent impressions, especially if they match scent memories we already know ‚Äî like ‚Äúclassic men‚Äôs cologne‚Äù or ‚Äúbarbershop‚Äù (which often come from the combination of lavender, moss, and aromatic herbs). So even if lavender is technically there, I‚Äôm reading the scent more holistically as ‚Äúfougere-cologne‚Äù because that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs evoking for me. \n\n4.) As many of you have probably experienced, candle composition is different from perfume. Sometimes fragrance notes behave differently in wax + flame than they do in alcohol + skin. Some delicate notes (like citrus, green, or herbal tones) can burn off or soften in a candle, especially if they‚Äôre top notes. So the lavender might just not survive as prominently once the wick is lit.",

The diameter of the log should be 1.5 inches or so. Take your parchment-wrapped log to the freezer, and let it firm up for at least 40 minutes to an hour. \nPreheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Remove your cookie log from the freezer, and slice it into 1/4 inch thick slices. The cookies will not get much larger or rise as they bake, so you may place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper fairly close together if necessary. Bake the cookies for 13 minutes, until the edges start to change color, then let cool. Enjoy with a glass of milk, if you like milk with your \"tea!\"\n\nThere is a lot of flexibility on flavors with this recipe. The more traditional zest here is orange, but I love Earl Grey with lemon, and this is what I had on hand. Next time, I will add some lavender essential oil to give it even more flavor. Maybe you can even consider changing out the tea bags for dried lavender or another aromatic, sweet herb or spice for a unique, new cookie. The recipe can easily be multiplied, just make sure you give the cookie logs enough time to chill before slicing and baking.

For whatever reason, we do have a tendency to let our beliefs and emotional reactions (feels) get in the way of facts (reals).\n\nThere‚Äôs a link in the sidebar to a page about ‚ÄúEssential Oils in Haircare‚Äù.  This set off crazy warning bells: essential oils are not something with which to be tinkering around.  This is about 7000 times more true if they are being used topically, rather than for aromatherapy, which is how the linked website (and many of this subreddit‚Äôs users) recommend using them.\n\nJust because something is ‚Äúnatural‚Äù or derived from a plant does not mean it‚Äôs a-okay for your skin.  There‚Äôs no market out there for poison ivy tea rinses, after all.  I want to work through (for now) the oils specifically mentioned on the linked page, since that is what the subreddit ‚Äúadvocates‚Äù or is, at least, what most users will find when looking into essential oil use.\n\n‚ÄîTHE LINE-UP‚Äî\n\nBASIL: first up, this essential oil has some compounds that are going to be old friends by the time we get through this: linalool and eugenol.  This are BOTH documented irritants that you should avoid in any skin care product. (http://www.aromaweb.com/essential-oils/basil-oil.asp), (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/eugenol), (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/linalool)\n\nCHAMOMILE: this one checks out; it doesn‚Äôt appear to be widely irritating in general, though some people with allergies to the daisy family may have issues. (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/chamomile)\n\nCEDARWOOD: this is a fragrance, and like many fragrances, can be irritating and allergenic.  There is also, apparently, some research which found it to cause tumors on mouse skin.  The evidence is far, far from conclusive, and even if there were more studies with similar results, ‚Äúcorrelation is not causation‚Äù would still apply.  However, if you‚Äôre going to freak out about parabens or whatever, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to use cedarwood oil. (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/cedarwood)\n\nCLARY SAGE: this is tagged with the Risk Number* R38, marking it as irritating to the skin.  Don‚Äôt put it on your scalp, fer Pete‚Äôs sake. (http://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB9340183.htm)\n\nEUCALYPTUS: this is a fragrant oil which, as the sidbar-linked website says, may well have some anti-fungal and anti-microbial effects.  HOWEVER, some of its components are known irritants.  \"Truly a mixed bag, because this oil, like rosemary oil, is one that has benefits and risks. Because the risks are primarily with topical application to skin, eucalyptus oil is an ingredient to avoid‚Äù (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/eucalyptus-oil)\n\nLAVENDER:  STOOOOOOOOOOOOP putting lavender essential oil anywhere near your skin. The ‚Äútingling‚Äù feeling that many people describe isn‚Äôt lavender oil stimulating your bloodflow or anything, it‚Äôs the oil irritating and damaging your skin.  You do NOT want to experience tingling with any product you apply topically: it is your body sending you distress signals.  Lavender is so, so misunderstood, so I‚Äôm going to quote the whole article:  \n\n\"Of particular concern is the lavender oil, which smells great but causes havoc on skin. Research indicates that components of lavender, specifically linalool, can be cytotoxic, which means that topical application causes skin-cell death (Source: Cell Proliferation, June 2004, pages 221‚Äì229). Lavender leaves contain camphor, which is a known skin irritant. Because the fragrance constituents in lavender oil oxidize when exposed to air, lavender oil is a pro-oxidant, and this enhanced oxidation increases its irritancy on skin (Source: Contact Dermatitis, September 2008, pages 143‚Äì150). Lavender oil is the most potent form, and even small amounts of it (0.25% or less) are problematic. Although it‚Äôs fine as an aromatherapy agent for inhalation or relaxation, it is a must to avoid in skin-care products. (Sources: Psychiatry Research, February 2007, pages 89‚Äì96; and www.naturaldatabase.com).\"\n\n(http://www.paulaschoice.com/beautypedia-skin-care-reviews/by-brand/bio-oil/_/Bio-Oil)\n\nLEMON: this provides no demonstrated skin care benefits, but can be both irritating and photo toxic, i.e. reactions may result following exposure to sunlight.  (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/lemon-oil)\n\nLEMONGRASS: this is another fragrant, volatile oil which contains the same compounds that make lemon oil (above) irritating to the skin. ( http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/lemongrass-oil)\n\nMYRRH: another one that contains limonene, an irritant also found in the two oils above, as well as pinene (see ‚Äúvolatile oil\" description below) and eugenol, which you also don‚Äôt want on your body. (http://www.baseformula.com/product.php/6670/myrrh-essential-oil), (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/eugenol)\n\nPATCHOULI: this is derived from mint, can sensitize skin, and contains eugenol (see myrrh, above) which is an irritant.  Patchouli is considered a ‚Äúcounter irritant‚Äù, for which see below for a full explanation. (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/patchouli)\n\nPEPPERMINT: it‚Äôs another counter-irritant; move along. (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/peppermint)\n\nROSEMARY: this one kind of almost barely checks out.  In very, very small quantities rosemary EXTRACT can be okay, but if you look at the main constituents of rosemary OIL, it‚Äôs a whole lot of known irritants: pinene, borneol, linalol, camphor, etc. (http://www.aromaweb.com/essential-oils/rosemary-oil.asp), (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/antioxidants/rosemary-extract)\n\nSAGE: I feel like this is starting to get repetitive: it‚Äôs a fragrant oil, and all the usual, skin-annoying compounds are there, including camphor.  Nope.  (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/sage-extract)\n\nTEA TREE: Fiiiiiiiiiinally!  This one kind of checks out too!  It can have anti-inflammatory effects and seems effective at treating certain skin conditions.  However, that doesn‚Äôt mean you should go whapping it all over your head: it still contains components that can cause issues, so it should STILL be treated with extreme caution.  (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/tea-tree-oil1)\n\nTHYME: once again, fragrance compounds found in thyme oil are undesirable on your skin.  Billionth verse, same as the first, no?  (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/thyme-oil)\n\nYLANG YLANG: allllllllllll together now!  It‚Äôs a fragrant oil made up of compounds known to cause skin issues!  Skip it!  (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/ylang-ylang)\n\n‚ÄîIN CONCLUSION‚Äî\n\nMany people who avoid shampoo do so because they feel it contains too many ‚Äúharsh‚Äù or ‚Äúirritating‚Äù chemicals.  Swapping out a rigorously-tested, carefully-formulated shampoo only to start smearing essential oils (chemicals) over your head is, however, nonsensical.  Not that you can‚Äôt do it, of course; it‚Äôs your body.  If, however, you‚Äôre going to invoke science in defense of any part of your regime (often done in no-poo-land), why not apply that standard consistently?  ‚ÄúDiluting‚Äù these oils with carriers may help, but these compounds can be problematic for skin even in tiny quantities in professionally-made products.  If you‚Äôre avoiding shampoo to limit your exposure to chemicals and irritants, why risk the above-listed essential oils\n\n‚ÄîADDITIONAL NOTES AND DEFINITIONS‚Äî\n\nVOLATILE OIL: \"Group of volatile fluids derived primarily from plants and used in cosmetics primarily as fragrant additives. These components most often include a mix of alcohols, ketones, phenols, linalool, borneol, terpenes, camphor, pinene, acids, ethers, aldehydes, and sulfur, all of which have extremely irritating and sensitizing effects on skin.‚Äù (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/volatile-oil)\n\nCOUNTER-IRRITANT: \"Ingredients such as menthol, peppermint, camphor, and mint are counter-irritants (Sources: Archives of Dermatologic Research, May 1996, pages 245‚Äì248; and Code of Federal Regulations Title 21‚ÄîFood and Drugs, revised April 1, 2001, CITE: 21CFR310.545, www.fda.gov). Counter-irritants are used to induce local inflammation for the purpose of relieving inflammation in deeper or adjacent tissues. In other words, they substitute one kind of inflammation for another, which is never good for skin. Irritation or inflammation, no matter what causes it or how it happens, impairs the skin‚Äôs immune and healing response (Source: Skin Pharmacology and Applied Skin Physiology, November‚ÄìDecember 2000, pages 358‚Äì371). And although your skin may not show it or doesn‚Äôt react in an irritated fashion, if you apply irritants to your skin the damage is still taking place and is ongoing, so it adds up over time (Source: Skin Research and Technology, November 2001, pages 227‚Äì237).‚Äù  \n(http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/counter-irritant)\n\nRISK NUMBERS: an explanation can be found here (https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/newsletter/essential_oils_handle_with_care.php)\n",

        "body": "You took a lot of time to write this out, and I'm grateful for your references, and the general warning you're giving, but I feel like you're overstating a couple of things here.  \n\nHere's the general tone of your piece:  \"natural\" and \"safe\" are two different words.  This is a true statement, and I'm glad someone is pointing this out.\n\nThat said, I wanted to point out a couple of things to anyone who may still read this thread.  What makes something toxic or damaging is amount, and that can be said for everything ranging from resiniferatoxin to normal water.  While there are definitely going to be stupid or ignorant people that use essential oils in an unsafe manner, most of them have safe levels associated with use.  In other words, diluted down sufficiently, there's nothing on the list you've provided that *can't* be safely used for lotions, shampoos, and bath oils, and some, like lavender, are *so* safe that they're regularly used in baby lotions.  \n\nEveryone isn't going to be rolling to EO use with a solid chemistry background, so mentioning that certain things cause sensitization (like the wood oils) more rapidly than others is definitely worth noting.  But even with that in mind, almost everything you listed makes regular appearances in commercial perfumes, so they've been tried and tested in the population.  \n\nLastly, I wanted to point out that your concept of skin irritant is a little off.  Inducing local inflammation isn't the horrible thing you seem to think it is, in fact, products containing a number of the ingredients above are recommended for multiple-times-daily use by doctors for treatment of pain (like from sore muscles and arthritis).  The proportion of eugenol and linalool and other potentially irritating compounds is so low in most of the ones you've listed that dilution is sufficient to all but eliminate risk.  The remaining risk is the same for any new scented product you'd buy, including tested deodorant soaps and shampoos.  \n\nJust don't use EO's undiluted, ever, and follow established protocols for reduction, and people will be fine including them in whatever homemade hair or skin tonic they wish.",

They were all carefully packaged, shipped quickly, and came with a thank-you note *and* a free sample (Madar). Sweet! I love small businesses. Also, I emailed to ask about resting and whether or not one of them (Sleepy Ghost) should be shaken up, and she got right back to me. The Ghost perfumes have a resin which sinks to the bottom, so yes, shake it like a Polaroid pictcha. \n\nLet's dive in.\n\n**Villa Diodati** \"pungent wild rosemary and fresh balsam pine, crystal clear lakewater, dry, dark vanilla.\" It smells like wet wood, pencil shavings, and a whiff of pine. I was hoping for lakeside camping nostalgia but I'm getting clean elementary school classroom on a rainy day. It's not a bad smell but it's not the ~~droid~~ scent memory I'm looking for.\n\n**Versailles** \"golden cake, intoxicating orange blossom, fluffy vanilla citrus icing, blood orange.\" It smells like pound cake. Someone thought about making orange frosting, opened the bottle of orange extract, and then changed their mind. It's pleasant. I'm into it. \n\n**Sleepy Ghost** \"marshmallow pillows sprinkled with natural lavender essential oil and absolute for sweet dreams.\" It smells like lightly toasted marshmallows and lavender. Can't stop sniffing myself. I have the feeling more experienced cognoscenti would think this is basic. However, am I an extremely basic bitch? Yes. Everything should smell like this all the time. \n\n**Whisper Your Bitter Things** \"pressed coffee beans, dried clove bud + cassia bark, jasmine and neroli blossoms, roasted vanilla pods.\" It smells like hippies and coffee. Like white people with dreadlocks at a cafe/book store/crystal shop, on Open Mic Slam Poetry Night. Did you watch Orphan Black? This is what [Cosima](https://www.pinterest.ph/pin/50806302031902114/) might wear when she's not in the lab. I'm not opposed to it. Gonna wear with my darkest lipsticks and live my best 1990s South Street Philadelphia life.\n\n**Cardigan** \"creamy Mysore sandalwood spiced with cardamom pods & pimento berries, French vanilla, white chocolate, comforting sweater musk.\"  It does smell like a sweater! How do they do that? It smells like a sweater your rich friend absent-mindedly left at your house, and when you fold it up and carefully put it in a bag to return it, you catch a whiff and think, *mmm, rich people.* I definitely smell the sandalwood and can detect the chocolate. I like it, but I'm going to wait til the weather cools off more to wear it, so I can be Rich Sweater Friend‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.\n\n**Madar** \"comforting, creamy Basmati rice pudding flavored with orange flower water, saffron, cinnamon, cardamom, and dried rose petals, then piled high with sugared pistachios.\" Expensive potpourri. Not the kind from the craft store. It's potpourri from a boutique that someone gave to your mom as a thank you for helping with their taxes in spring of 1983, and then she kept it in a glass jar in the bathroom forever and ever. If you want to smell like expensive 1983 accountant potpourri this will be your jam. Alas, it's a no from me, dawg.",

But that makes sense, since one farm wouldn‚Äôt make enough oil to stock their entire market. \n\nSeems that when people say ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt trust MLM‚Äù you REALLY can‚Äôt trust MLM.\n \nIf anyone knows more about the case, feel free to leave your comment.",

    "body": "I've decided to compile a list of things that have helped others on this forum with akathisia.  Many people despair because they've tried many things, and they think there's nothing left to try.  Maybe they'll find something new, and effective, on here.  So...here goes.  Click on the treatment to get linked to the original post describing that treatment.\n\nFirst treatment is usually discontinuing the offending drug.  There is almost always something out there that does the same thing, with a different chemical structure.  Talk to your doctor about discontinuing.  Edit:  Some people have experienced worse akathisia after discontinuing.  See comments below.  Be careful!\n\nFor those whose medication is court-mandated, or those whose doctors are stubborn, or those with long-lasting, chronic akathisia, here are a few things that others have said help, and which might or might not help you, based on your body chemistry:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Magnesium!**  There's this site called [StuffThatWorks.com](https://StuffThatWorks.com) and they have an akathisia section.  The #2 tried treatment for akathisia by members is magnesium, and it supposedly \"worked extremely well\" for all 26 people who tried it.  (Edit:  It's been updated, and more people have been added; it only worked for some).  One way of getting magnesium is soaking your hands or feet in epsom salt.  This worked for me for a while.  Worth a shot, right? [https://www.stuffthatworks.health/akathisia/treatments/magnesium](https://www.stuffthatworks.health/akathisia/treatments/magnesium)\n2. [**A niacin flush (vitamin B3)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Akathisia/comments/lhznvw/nothing_has_helped_my_akathisia_more_than_a/)  Edit:  The kind that doesn't give the flush is worth a shot too, although the original post that I've linked to here describes using the kind that DOES give the flush.  The non-flush kind helped me for a while.  Try both!\n3. **Chamomile tea.**  Helps me when I get mild akathisia with my current med.  Helped my brother too, when he got akathisia; he's the one who recommended it to me.\n4. [**Biperiden and/or Artane**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Akathisia/comments/jyfvo9/anyone_here_uses_biperiden/)\n5.

Something to consider if you try it.\n15. **Gabapentin and Pregabalin,** as well as **Carbamazepine** (see the comments on this post, below; I added number 14 and the ones on the list after it after people commented on my original post.)\n16. **Kava tea** (see comments)\n17. **Propranolol, B6, and Tonic water** (see comments)\n18. **Curcumin** (see comments)\n19. **Kemadrin (Procyclidine)** (see comments)\n20. **Benztropine** (see comments)\n21. **Ketamine** (see comments)\n22. **Broccoli pills / sulforaphane** (see comments)\n23. **Ambien.**  See comments.\n24. **Yellow mustard.**  See comments.\n25. And there's a list on a comment (below) of studies, and the treatments they have shown to work.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Akathisia/comments/p3d4vz/comment/ip41uha/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Akathisia/comments/p3d4vz/comment/ip41uha/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)  Thanks to that commenter for doing all that research!  Here's a list of different things that have helped, based on different studies they've found:  **Mirtazapine, Propranolol, Mianserin, B6, Clonidine, Benztropine, Trazodone, Cyproheptadine, Biperiden, Gabapentin, and Ketamine.**  See their comment at that link above for links to the different studies.\n26. **Nicotine patches** (see here:  [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9399378/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9399378/)) and the comments below.\n27. **Vyvanse,** an ADHD medication that helped at least one person with akathisia.  See comments.\n28. **Propranolol, Ativan, and Benedryl.**  See comments.\n\nEdit to say:  I wrote this list for those who have already heard of and tried first-line treatments like Propranolol.  That being said, it's occurred to me that not everyone may have heard of all of the first-line treatments, which are what doctors usually go to first. So here's a list of them, too, in case you haven't tried them all yet:\n\nFrom [https://www.webmd.com/schizophrenia/what-is-akathisia](https://www.webmd.com/schizophrenia/what-is-akathisia)\n\n1. **Beta-blockers such as Propranolol**\n2. **Benzdiazepines**\n3. **Anticholinergics**\n4. **Some antidepressants, like mirtazapine or trazadone**\n5. **Drugs used to treat Parkinson's, like amantadine**\n6. **B6**\n\nAnd I've also read about **Benedryl** being a first-line treatment; it's one of the first things doctors say to try, like the short list above.\n\nGod bless.  Hope this helps!",

It did the opposite and even allowed me to actually sleep. My psychiatrist told me that the dopaminergic effects of stimulants counteract the low dopamine levels that are believed to cause akathisia and other EPS.

It's  not legal everywhere, and like any herb or supplement, comes with some controversy, but I find it helps more than Propanolol. When I do use it, I make sure it is not within a few hours of other medications.\n\nBenadryl and melatonin will increase my akathisia, and while these are sometimes suggested as a remedy, they do have the opposite reaction in some people.\n\nFor some reason, pressure on, or movement of my diaphragm and mid section can help me when i'm having a hard time. Bending over on my mid section or using a rocking chair to do that,  can be soothing.  I believe this is because I am stimulating my vagus nerve. So sometimes I also will try valsalva maneuver and bear down to try to get relief. You must be careful doing Valsalva maneuver, so ask your doctor or do some reading about it.\n\nHere is a really good article about the vagus nerve, valsalva maneuver, and the sympathetic  and parasympathetic nervous system:\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/night-sweats-and-delusions-grandeur/202208/conquer-anxiety-simple-powerful-brain-hack",

And some other stuff, obviously! Anyway, I am stuck in bed for a while after breaking my leg in the dumbest possible way over the weekend (Happy Halloween to me, and no, I was not doing anything fun; I was mopping the floor üòÇ) so I thought I thought I would cheer myself up by testing my new ghosts (and everything else).\n\n**FAVORITES**: Campfire Ghost, Library Ghost, Wicked Ghost, Tiny Phantom\n\n**LEAST FAVORITES**: Oyster! due to a disappointing dry down\n\n**Cardigan** *creamy Mysore sandalwood spiced with cardamom pods & pimento berries, French vanilla, white chocolate, comforting sweater musk*\n\nFoodier than I expected but the sandalwood/white chocolate combo works even better than I hoped it would! They really blend perfectly. There is a gentle sweet cardamom spice on top and soft musk underneath everything to tie it all together. Very sweet and comforting, which is exactly what I need right now!\n\n**Oyster!** *grey musk, ocean brine, bitter cucumber, ¬†a twist of lemon, elemi resin, angelica*\n\nI was interested in Oyster! because of my newfound love of salty aquatics and constant hope to find something reminiscent of my greatest perfume love, Arcana Molly Malone- the magical sweet/salty/musky/floral/aquatic combination that has yet to be matched. This is not it, because nothing iS, but this starts out pretty unique- a refreshing salty scent with lemon and mysterious ‚Äúgrey musk.‚Äù At first sniff there is something so fresh and fascinating about it. Unfortunately, it morphs on the dry down to smell more powdery and basically like an ‚Äúocean‚Äù scented candle. Now I‚Äôm sad.\n\n**Tiny Phantom** *innocent pink roses, marshmallow buttercream, pale white musk, antique mahogany*\n\nMarshmallow candy roses with a very nice polished wood base note! Like a combination of BPAL The Antikythera Mechanism and Solstice Scents‚Äô Lace Draped Spectre. I am not generally a fan of rose or florals in general, but this kind of sweet floral gourmand is exactly when rose DOES work for me and I like this a lot. I feel like I should be going to a tea party in an old Victorian house, possibly hosted by ghosts.\n\nNow, the ghosts! üëª\n\n**Campfire Ghost** *marshmallows getting toasty around a woodfire in an autumnal forest*\n\nAhhh I love this! I didn‚Äôt know what to expect from the smoke notes but it is soft, not overpowering, like a sweet woodsmoke in the background of sticky marshmallow goodness. It dries down to a soft smoky sweetness that is the perfect intersection of atmospheric and gourmand and makes me want to go outside and immediately make some s‚Äômores. This also has really good staying power!\n\n**Hungry Ghost** *toasty marshmallow, gooey chocolate, buttery graham cracker*\n\nOh wait, here are the s‚Äômores! All of the elements are here- the marshmallow, a creamy cocoa note, and the perfect graham cracker. It‚Äôs delicious but does not QUITE match my holy grail s‚Äômores perfume (Possets Maggie) and it fades too quickly on my skin.\n\n**Library Ghost** *studious marshmallows surrounded by books, ink, and polished wood*\n\nThis was the reason for my order and it does not disappoint! I LOVE the ink note, the smooth wood in the background and the little bit of marshmallow sweetness that brings it all together. It‚Äôs super cozy and comforting and I absolutely love it!\n\n**Shy Ghost** *comforting milky chai tea laced with vanilla and topped with whipped cream*\n\nMy husband‚Äôs standard Starbucks order is a chai latte with vanilla and this is literally that in perfume form. Everything is there, from the black tea to the spices to the milk and vanilla syrup. It is sweeter than it is spicy, extra creamy and milky. It doesn‚Äôt morph much and has really good throw. \n\n**Sleepy Ghost** *marshmallow pillows sprinkled with natural lavender essential oil and absolute for sweet dreams*\n\nThis was a sample and it is a really cuddly and relaxing lavender blend, similar to BPAL TKO but with a sweeter, softer lavender! I want to slather myself in this before bed. It‚Äôs the perfect bedtime lavender- not the strong, almost medicinal lavender you sometimes get, but much sweeter and gentler. The vanilla-y marshmallow note goes a bit flat the longer it sits on my skin, but I still like this very much as a bedtime scent.\n\n**Wicked Ghost** *innocent marshmallow encompassed in glowing black amber and resinous incense smoke*\n\nI love this incense note- it‚Äôs smoky, resinous and has great throw! The amber note is also really nice, a particularly rich golden amber. The marshmallow provides a sweet backdrop but if I smelled this without knowing the notes, I don‚Äôt think I would guess that it contained marshmallow. It really adds to the sticky resinous sweetness, though! A nice addition to my hoard of incense perfumes.\n\nSo overall, my first Poesie experience was a positive one! I wish some of the scents were a little stronger, but they seem to have decent staying power (a huge issue for me; my skin devours perfume) and there were some unexpected hits here- for example, I did not know Campfire Ghost would be SOO good, but it is- the smokiness is just perfectly balanced. I‚Äôm glad I took the plunge and got the whole ghosts set!",

    "body": "I was restocking my \"comfort measures\" bag and I thought you all might find it interesting. For context, I am a hospital midwife and these are all the things I bring with me to make my job easier :)\n\nFrom left to right:\n\n1. Fake rebozo - just a long, soft bath towel. I also have an authentic rebozo, but a towel works just fine, and I won't weep if I leave it with a laboring woman at the end of my shift and it gets lost. Some of my colleagues use hospital linens but I find the towel softer and more comfortable for mom.\n\n2. Big bottle: almond oil for massage.\n\n3. Small bottle: lavender essential oil. You can dilute a couple of drops in 10 ml almond oil, or put 3-4 drops on a cotton ball/gauze that you affix to your collar. Useful for relaxation, pain management and stalled labor.\n\n4. Straws. It's nice for mom to be able to drink while resting her head.\n\n5. Hair ties. Hard to relax with hair on your face!\n\n6. Small jar: sodium bicarbonate. Useful for stalled labors - see recipe below :)\n\n7. Tennis ball and handheld massager: try applying pressure to your sacrum, back dimples, or behind your shoulders for pain relief (look up BL31-33 and GB21 acupressure points).\n\n8. Birth combs\n\n9. Wooden discs bracelet and plastic teether: use as a birth comb. Useful when mom finds the comb teeth too sharp, or when she's gripping the comb so hard I'm afraid she'll bruise her hand. I was playing with my daughter's teether when I realized it would be perfect :)\n\n10. Torchlight and travel tilt mirror: (for the midwife, in the pushing stage) to check baby's progress in any position.\n\n11. (Not shown - provided by my hospital) Hot and cold packs\n\n\n#And now for the secret recipe:\n\nSometimes when labor is very long or stalling, the uterus gets very tired, like any muscle working hard. It can cause something called \"myometrial lactic acidosis\" - your uterus builds up lactic acid and contractions get very painful but uncoordinated and inefficient. The uterus often feels tender and achy even between contractions. What mom needs in this case is something to give her energy and dilute the lactic acid.\n\nThe trick is: 1 teaspoon sodium bicarbonate + 1-2 teaspoons sugar or honey + 200 ml of plain water. Take frequent sips and don't hate me if it tastes foul.\n\nAn alternative is to dilute the sodium bicarbonate in water, take a sip, and then wash it down with a second sip of sweet tea or apple juice.\n\nI hope someone will find it helpful! :)\n",

I don't have particularly sensitive or allergic skin, and I don't react to baking soda.)\n\nMaterials needed:\n\n* Aromaco\n* Cup O Coffee or Mask of Magnaminty (or really any clay-based mask)\n* Silky Underwear, or your dusting powder of choice (I'm a fan of SU, Get Closer, and my new love Gymslip!)\n* Your personal hot bath products, because hot baths will help you through this trial.  Now is an excellent time to treat yourself to a bomb or two.  Alternately, a long, hot shower will mostly do the trick.\n* Bonus: Little bottle of lavender essential oil.  It's not strictly necessary, but it helps boost your confidence during those first few trying days.\n* Bonus 2: A workout plan.  You want to sweat as much as possible in the beginning.\n\nThis story starts over a year ago, when I decided, in the height of my newborn Lush obsession, to tRy ThEiR nAtUrAl DeOdOrAnT!! because I loved the idea of being a Happy Hippy-smelling happy hippy of a person.  I bought T'eo because of the lovely lemongrass scent, and I returned it within four days because it scratched my arm pits to hell.  I exchanged T'eo for Greeench, but returned that too after I realized that I smelled a) rank, and b) like a tea tree bomb went off in a medicine cabinet.  Dejected, I decided that Lush deodorant wasn't going to work for me.  I went back to my trusty Dove deodorant, and on with my life.\n\nSpoiler: Lush deodorant DOES work.  I just hadn't transitioned yet, but more on that later.\n\nFast forward to about two months ago, when I developed a reaction to Dove.  I've used the same antiperspirant/deodorant for over a decade without a hint of a problem, and suddenly, without warning, my arm pits were red, angry, and incredibly sore.  I was horrified.\n\nI took a day or so off from Dove and just used Silky Underwear under my arms to calm things down.  It helped - my arm pits healed quickly.  I went back to Dove, because I'm a dense cosmic phenomenon and I just don't learn - my pits flared up again, red and angry as ever.\n\nRats.\n\nDamn it.\n\nOk.\n\nI went to Lush and picked up the smallest bit of Aromaco that I could find.  I hated the scent of it (never having been much of a patchouli fan), but I liked the texture and I was a little desperate tbh.  After that, I went home and researched the hell out of natural deodorant, because that's just how I like to spend my free time.\n\nWhat I learned was this: switching from chemical antiperspirant to natural deodorant involves a phase called \"transition,\" and that phase is terrible.  A quick lesson in arm pit science: pits naturally sweat, and they naturally have bacteria growing in them as part of the human microbiome.  That bacteria grows both on the surface of the skin, and inside the arm pit's pores.  If left to their own devices without antiperspirant, most people (who don't have a separate sweat-related medical condition) will perspire a bit under their arms as a way to keep their pit microbiome healthy.  Sweat washes out pores.  This is good for the skin, and good for a person's general health.  The unsavory aroma that comes from an arm pit is the result of (and, yes, gross) bacteria a) excreting waste, and b) dying on your skin.  This is all, again, normal.  When left uncovered by antiperspirant, all that bacterial waste can simply be washed away.\n\nThe problem comes in when antiperspirants (particularly those containing aluminum) block the sweat glands under the arms, preventing the body from naturally taking care of its own microbiome.  Antiperspirants fill arm pit pores with the equivalent of little glue plugs, making it impossible for the body to wash away dead bacteria and their waste products.  This causes all that bacterial waste to build up in the arm pit pores, which is just as gross as it sounds.  It also causes the body to go overboard trying to sweat more so that it can perform it's basic cleansing function, which the antiperspirant completely prevents.\n\nTLDR: Antiperspirant keeps the body from cleansing itself of dead, smelly bacteria, but you don't know about it because the chemicals and scents in commercial antiperspirant are strong.\n\nTransition is the process by which the body cleans all the accumulated bacterial gunk out of its pores and re-learns the proper amount that it needs to sweat to keep your body healthy.  It involves a scent purge, which is a hellacious couple of days/weeks during which your arm pits secrete months of back-logged bacterial waste, which smells just as good as it sounds.  After you've made it through transition, though, your body will settle down into a normal amount of sweat and the sweat that you still produce doesn't smell that bad at all, assuming you wash your body regularly.  You just have to make it through your Pit Purge.\n\nI'd recommend starting this process on a Friday, or on any set of consecutive days when you can kind of lay low for a while.  At least pick a day when you can wear long sleeves, and when you can duck off to the bathroom multiple times per day.\n\nStart by simply skipping deodorant.  You want very little on your arm pits during your first three transition days.  Give your poor pits some time to just breathe.  During this time, I used a few drops of lavender essential oil under each arm (it can be used undiluted on the skin, even for most sensitive skin types), and then followed up with some Silky Underwear dusting powder.  You'll smell like an herbal lavender bomb, but trust me that it's better than what your pits are naturally producing during this phase.  I rinsed my underarms a few times per day, and reapplied my lavender oil and powder as needed.\n\nAt night, take a hot bath.  You want to soak for 10-20 minutes, making sure your arm pits are submerged and the water is warm enough to make you sweat.  The goal here is to loosen up any left over antiperspirant glue plugs left in your arm pit pores so that they can be dissolved and washed away.  Antiperspirant is definitionally water-resistant, so simple soap and water won't completely do the trick.  The truth is that a person who has used chemical antiperspirant for a long time hasn't properly cleaned their arm pits out in years.  (And believe me, I was as distressed as anyone at learning this, having used antiperspirant for about a quarter of a century.)\n\nOnce you've soaked for a sweaty bit, crack open a clay-based mask and apply it liberally to your pits.  I used Cup O Coffee because it's what I had on hand, but really any clay-based mask will do.  The magic of a clay mask is that as it dries, it draws impurities out of the pores, including leftover antiperspirant chemicals and whatever old bacteria you've got in there.  Let the mask dry, and then rinse it away.\n\nRepeat this process for three days, or for as many baths as your body can take.  Work out as much as you can.  Sweat as much as you can.  Apply your powder and essential oil (if you've got it), and try to ignore how bad you smell.  Trust me, BETTER TIMES ARE SOON TO COME.\n\nAfter three days, open your Aromaco and apply it to your underarms.  If you already love patchouli, then I'm genuinely happy for you.  If you, like me, think it smells kind of awful, then I have a few pieces of comfort to offer: 1) You will actually come to appreciate the scent, unlikely as that seems at first; 2) It unquestionably smells better than Transition Pits; 3) Other people will just think you smell kind of like a tree, at least according to my husband; 4) The Aromaco scent fades after a few hours; and 5) Patchouli is easily masked by other Lush scents, many of which blend with it particularly well.  Most importantly, of all the Lush deodorants, Aromaco is the one I've found that WORKS.  It really, genuinely works.\n\nAromaco feels a lot like a traditional antiperspirant/deodorant as you put it on.  It does get a little rough if it dries out: the best pro tip I've found is to run it under a bit of water and then apply, which makes it go on much more smoothly.  I then applied a layer of a dusting powder over the Aromaco to help with sweat a bit, because it takes more than three days for the body to regulate its sweat production.  At first I applied Aromaco a couple of times per day, along with dusting powder, just to make sure I could feel confident in my scent.  Now I'm back to only after a shower, just like I was when I was plugging my pores with aluminum glue.\n\nAll in all, it took me almost a month to feel like my sweat production started to calm down.  I wore a lot of black, white and navy shirts during that time.  The Pit Purge scent started tapering off after a week or so, and now has settled into a very normal human scent that Aromaco can more than handle.  I don't have the sterile sense of blind arm pit confidence that commercial antiperspirant gave me, but I've got a better sense of my body's natural functions, and at this point, I smell pretty darn good.  Now that I've transitioned, I can actually tell when eating certain foods makes me smell better or worse.  (Tangent, but eat tons of fresh fruits and veggies, people - your body just loves it, and they make you naturally smell great.)  My husband actually told me that I smell sexier now.  There's a natural, human musk that each of us has: we can try to replicate it with perfumes that have musk notes, or we can just keep our bodies generally clean and allow them to function as they were meant to function, with a little extra soap, oils and plants for a flourish.\n\nSide note: I store my Aromaco in an incredibly eco-friendly ziploc bag (/s) which works well enough for me, though I'm sure an official Lush tin would work better.\n\nThat's all I can think of for now.  Questions welcome!",

My feet sweat a lot, I get sweaty hands etc. I've done the transitioning, lush deodorants are much rougher on your underarms for one. It doesn't seem as lush knew they were designed for sensitive areas so didn't have to be pointy, or have actual flowers in them. And honestly if you're a heavy sweater they won't be much use.\n\nObviously they don't stop you sweating, but that's probably the main aim most people have with their underarms. My natural musk isn't bad - I quite like it - but it's the sweating and then the sweat drying on clothes that results in the bad smells. And the stains of course. So using lush deodorant didn't reduce how much I sweat, all it did is made the beginning of the sweat smell woody and earthy. (which I thought smelt worse than my natural).\n\nIf lush deodorant isn't working for you, then your best bet for slightly improving your pits would be to go rogue. Everyone has a day or night off, or a couple a week. Itll allow your pits to breathe. And could be the first stepping stone to changing to a better deodorant if you don't have the time to be \"smelly\"!",

I also get a lot of dry firewood, but it smells like it hasn't been burned yet. There is a really warm sensation when I smell it up close, like how mint perfumes smell cool.  I think I might be getting some kind of pepper, maybe cayenne is responsible (it's not really foody, it just smells like it's radiating heat somehow).\n\nI am getting the church incense in the background, but the smell of sparks/crackling fire is right upfront and totally unique to my collection.  I have a lot of perfumes with fire/smoke notes from Poesie, but this doesn't really remind me of any of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Sugar Dusted** (cinnamon sticks, apple and pumpkin pies in the oven, plates of sugar cookies and tins of sugared pecans, smudges of butter and splashes of vanilla extract)\n\nRight away I preferred this to **Creature Comforts**, probably because I‚Äôm getting more distinct notes and a lot of cream and vanilla.  The photo she used on the website is perfect for this, because it really does smell like setting out individual ingredients prior to baking.  Poesie does sugar notes so well!\n\nAnd as someone who usually amps spice to the point that it overwhelms all other notes, I was shocked how well this one behaved. The cinnamon is very noticeable but stays balanced with the sugar + creaminess, and doesn't turn into the scent of sweets burning. I'm pretty sure the apple is the same from CC, but it smells extra crisp here and doesn't overshadow anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Messe de Minuit** (Catholic church incense, frosted cranberries, balsam fir garlands, old wooden pews)\n\nNow the church incense in this is much more obvious than it is in **Fireside**, it stays at the forefront of the scent along with the smell of hardwood.  This smells exactly like walking into an extremely old, historic church with wooden everything.  The fir and cranberries are a nice touch in the background, but the perfume doesn‚Äôt read overtly fruity or green.  There's another creamy wood note that reminds me of a really nice shaving cream. To me the overall scent smells androgynous, but I also think some might consider it to lean a little masculine due to that shaving cream-like note.",

ALSO, if you think of anything I might like feel free to let me know in a comment! My collection used to be a lot bigger, but over the years I've really dwindled it down to what I love. I've got orders from Osmofolia, Death and Floral, and Mythpunk Olfactive coming my way so I'll definitely report back once those are all tested too!\n\n[The collection in all its glory apart from my two non oil bottles! I like making labels for my bottles!](https://preview.redd.it/xz7haizh7z5c1.jpg?width=2016&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0854cfe81c7660a91a495cfc1a3ac9a39d2b13f6)\n\n**üî∂ ALKEMIA** (Surprisingly, Alkemia is a newer try for me, and I am loving so much of what I try! I definitely want a bottle of Silken Tent at some point!)\n\n* **the Magpie's Rhyme** *(GC in non-alcohol spray format: A nostalgia of animal crackers, warm milk, a soft blanket, and luminescent white amber daydreams.)* It starts off as an almond gourmand but dries to a comforting dry amber and skin musk scent. I detect a whisper of woods and a touch of biscuit (not cookie, not american biscuit, but like a great british baking show biscuit), but it‚Äôs less gourmand than I thought it would be, which I love. This is so good for layering omg.\n\nüî∂ **ARCANA and ARCANA CRAVES** (After all the recent Arcana news, I will likely not be purchasing from them in the future. I still wanted to include these here as a reference.)\n\n* **Astrid's Diadem** *(Discontinued: A bright sparkler of Madagascar vanilla, Bourbon vanilla, sugared lavender creme, citron, lemongrass, peppermint, and a touch of stately patchouli.)* This smells like a delicious lemon merengue with a hint of mint and something a little herbal. There is no cookie or a baked feel, just cream, sugar, a touch herbal lemon, and mint.\n* **Honey Craves Sunshowers** *(GC: A big dose of warm cardamom is pierced with bright sunshine and scattered raindrops, then softened with Tahitian vanilla, sheer georgette, salty Ambroxan, and wildflower honey.)* Golden glorious vanilla with an herbal cardamom at the forefront. Stunning? Hello? Also? Honey? Nowhere to be seen tbh.\n* **Vanilla Craves Crescent Moons** *(GC: Blushing pink cherry blossoms are lightly infused into cold milk with the softest, fluffiest Mexican vanilla, caramelized tonka bean, cane sugar, and a bit of sweet hay.)* This smells like the prettiest floating fluffy sweetened milk scent. I don‚Äôt get any floral, just sweet slightly fatty lactones. Like heavy whipping cream, not butter? If that makes sense?\n\n**üî∂ BLACK PHOENIX ALCHEMY LAB** (My first love but also the house that just doesn't work for me much anymore. Perhaps it's more that I just no longer have the patience for it. Who knows, either way I will always treasure my collection below.)\n\n* **a World Where There Are Octobers** *(Halloweenie 2013: An armload of maple boughs and a swirl of autumn leaves.)* The initial blast is all bell pepper, green and dry and a little spicy. It dries down with a bit more of a sweetness (like maple syrup without the syrup) and a bit of fall spices. It‚Äôs still peppery, but the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù aspect is mostly gone. Very atmospheric.\n* **Celeste** *(BPTP LE: Madagascan vanilla bean, vanilla orchid, orris root, and saffron.)* Buttery, sugary vanilla, and powdery orchids. It‚Äôs very lady-like, and it smells like a lightly purple, velvety, powdery, floral marshmallow.\n* **Eat Me** *(GC: Three white cakes, vanilla, and red and black currants.)* Gorgeous cake, earthy woody black currant, and a hint of juiciness from red currant. It‚Äôs round, intoxicating and not super sweet. Age has done wonders for this beauty.\n* **Edith Cushing** *(Crimson Peak LE: Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind: pearlescent vanilla musk with white sandalwood, grey amber, white patchouli, ambrette seed, and oudh.)* Predominantly vanilla musk and grey amber on me. I absolutely adore a light amber scent, and this is a stunning one. It almost has a sweet floral quality that makes it quite approachable. Not the most unique, but lovely nonetheless.\n* **Golletes** *(Halloweenie 2010: A circular pastry glazed with pink sugar that symbolizes the sweetness of life and the certainty of death.)* Lovely, pink, and foody. I'm not sure if the pink is strawberry or what kind of fruit, but it is decidedly a PINK pastry and not really juicy or obviously fruity. Of all the foody scents I have, this is BY FAR my favorite. It's just delectable without being too heavy. It's FUN!\n* **Hand of Glory** *(Carnaval Diabolique: Beeswax, dry leather, black pepper, saltpeter, nutmeg, Mysore sandalwood, and oak bark.)* Leather and beeswax and a good dose of sandalwood underneath it all. The leather is so creamy and supple and buttery and positively drenched with melted lightly sweetened candles. A favorite comforting leather.\n* **Lady Una** *(Stardust: Honey musk, green tea leaf, blackberry leaf, vanilla bean, and fae spices.)* It‚Äôs just as I remember it, a comforting vanilla green tea with a healthy dose of a beeswax like honey and lightly spiced, lightly green berries. It‚Äôs a bit lactonic but also comforting and a little laundry-like and fresh. A bit of a conundrum, but a lovely one.\n* **My Little Grotesque** *(Lilith LE: Lilith expressing herself at the V&A: cardamom-dusted cupcakes.)* Vanilla cardamom cake, nothing more, nothing less. Cardamom and vanilla are two of my absolute favorites so this is a cozy favorite, and I adore that the gourmand vanilla cake note is the same as in Eat Me.\n* **No. 93 Engine** *(GC: Balm of Gilead, benzoin, frankincense, balsam of peru, beeswax, saffron, galbanum, calamus, hyssop, mastic, lemon balm, and white sage.)* This honestly has just gotten even better with age. Herbs, resin, beeswax, and benzoin. It's golden, spicy, and rich, and it's really mellowed out with time. No edges at all.\n* **Paduan Killer Swarm** *(2010 LE: Tonka, black licorice, amber, golden sandalwood, ginger cream, bitter clove, stinging nettle, cinnamon bark, and coconut shell.)* It's sweet, cozy, resinous, and warm. The tonka and licorice are at the forefront when it is wet, but when it dries down the spices and woods come forward to make it feel a little less juicy. It's still an absolute cozy favorite of mine in a similar vein to the Soldier.\n* **Snake Oil** *(GC: Deep, rich, earthy notes swirled with vegetal musks, sugared vanilla bean, and dark spices.)* My bottle is rather old so the oil is thick and gloriously terracotta colored. It smells of spices, musk, incense, and a sweet sugared vanilla underneath it all. A triumph of a scent that is best experienced with a light hand.\n* **Snow-Flakes** *(Yule 2009: The radiance and desolation of winter.)* I don‚Äôt think there will ever be a prettier snow perfume than this one. Minty, slushy, aquatic snow, and something ethereal tying it all together, something floral I think. It‚Äôs a crisper, cooler version of Snow White. I am desperate for another bottle.\n* **Tamora** *(GC: Amber, heliotrope, golden sandalwood, peach blossom and vanilla bean.)* A warm, fuzzy, amber and peach perfume to end all peach perfumes. Sweet, a hint fruity, golden, and rich. It‚Äôs like a warmed summer day where you can feel the heat envelop you, but the juice of a ripe fuzzy peach keeps you refreshed while sitting in your wicker chair.\n* **Temple Viper** *(Carnaval Diabolique: Snake Oil with sugar cane, frankincense, champaca, opoponax, labdanum, and hyssop.)* Sugary incense, resins, vanilla, a bit of smoke, and patchouli. There is also an addicting, lovely, powdery champaca floral tone running through which keeps this a bit lighter than regular Snake Oil. I used to wear a ton of Snake Oil and Samhain, so this reminds me of my college days but it‚Äôs something I can still wear and adore!\n* **the Soldier** *(Yule 2010: Red musk, vanilla cream, black tea, black pepper, leather, and pie.)* This starts off as all red musk, black tea, a bit of creaminess, and gourmand anise which I'm assuming is the pie! No black pepper in sight! It's gotten richer and more gourmand over time and has this syrupy almost honeyed red musk and licorice pie vibe now, less tea.\n* **Wulric, the Wolfman** *(Carnaval Diabolique: Friendly, charming, and cuddly, but possessing one hell of a mean streak: cocoa absolute, French vanilla, birch tar, lavender, bourbon vetiver, wild musk, cardamom husk, clary sage, and cistus.)* Cocoa and lavender with a large dose of vanilla and a hint of something herbal that keeps this from getting too sweet. Delicious and perfect, especially for sleep!\n* **Zombi** *(GC: Dried roses, rose leaf, Spanish moss, oakmoss and deep brown earth.)* Dry decaying greenery, wet earth, and roses. It‚Äôs a bit powdery and musky. I used to love this, and in a way I still do, but that musky powdery edge is a little bracing. I will keep this for now, but one day it might make its way out of my collection.\n\n**üî∂ FANT√îME** (One of my all time favorite houses and I am desperate for a pretty 50ml bottle of Namba which is probably my second favorite scent from the house!)\n\n* **Finist the Falcon** *(GC Perfume Oil Format: Bulgarian rose married with dewy Russian rose, swirled in strawberry, currant, & peach kissel with cream.)* Juicy rose jam with velvety currant and a hint of cream underneath it all. My favorite rose. It‚Äôs lush, juicy, and delicious without going gourmand or fruity. Just a vibrant beating heart of a rose. It does lean a bit gourmand but not something that a gourmand hater would dislike.\n* **Lycanthrope** *(GC Perfume Oil Format: Spicy tomato leaf, dark honey, and oakmoss, with hints of peach, lychee, ivy, vanilla, and tomatoes fresh from the vine.)* Fresh, sweet, and sparkly from the bottle, but on skin a bitter, herbal, freshness from the tomato leaf starts to bloom. There is depth from the oakmoss and lingering sweetness from lychee, peach, and a dash of honey. Overall a gorgeous sweetened fresh spring garden botanical.\n* **the Fox Sisters** *(GC Perfume Oil Format: Spiced cardamom cake with orange zest and candied red currants, caramel cream, dragon‚Äôs blood resin, and flecks of vanilla bean.)* If I had to pick a signature scent, the scent I would want to be remembered by, it's this one. It's a cardamom forward chai latte, and it fulfills my wish of both smelling like a snack and being a snack. Perfection. I have tried the EdP and unfortunately that one is a bit too red hots for me so I'm strictly perfume oil only for this one.\n\n**üî∂** **NOCTURNE ALCHEMY (NAVA)** (I had to get rid of a lot of my old NAVA bottles since the old reducer caps were falling apart, and I didn't have a way to salvage the oil at the time. After being a bit sad about it for a few years, I finally bought new bottles of some favorites and tried a few new blends this year so all of these are quite fresh!)\n\n* **Blue Egypt** *(GC: Egyptian Blue Lavender Essential Oil, Manuka Lavender, Egyptian and Indian Chamomile Essential Oil, Aloe Vera Absolute, Egyptian Blue Vanilla Bean Whole, Palmerosa Absolute, Languid Lavender Cider and a drop each of Angelica Root and Valerian Root.)* The perfect perfume to wear to sleep and perhaps my favorite from Nocturne Alchemy. It's a juicy, but soft and sweet lavender and chamomile tea.\n* **Eternal Ankh** *(GC: White Amber, Powdered and reconstructed oil of Egyptian Vanilla Husk, Vanilla fleck, African White Vanilla, and the scent of soft NA Egyptian Sands accord.)* A cool floaty soft vanilla, honestly mostly vanilla with a dollop of white amber. It‚Äôs a bit fluffy and powdery and definitely needs some age on it to become beautiful, but once it does? Stunning.\n* **Moonstone** *(Studio: The true Husk, black and white Fleck, essence, and whole of African White Vanilla with a kiss of Crystalline will only get better.)* A slightly powdery marshmallow vanilla. It stays close to the skin and is very lightly sweetened. I suspect this needs age.\n* **Opal Vanilla** *(Studio: Bastet‚Äôs Vanilla Custard accord, Bastet‚Äôs Ice Cream Absolute accord, Crystalline Vanilla Absolute, Vanilla Pudding accord, Vanilla Liqueur accord, True Vanilla Absolute from pod/fleck/orchid, French Vanilla Whole Beans pods, Bavarian Cr√®me accord, Vanilla Cr√®me, Vanilla Caramel, Brown Sugar and Vanilla Cookie essence accord.)* Cozy, sweet, condensed milk vanilla that is more potent in the bottle than on skin. It‚Äôs sweet and lactonic and less buttery than I expected. I suspect this needs age as well!\n\n**üî∂ POESIE** (What can I say, I love their cozy scents and their tea scents!)\n\n* **Comfort** *(LE: Toasted cardamom pods, pink peppercorn, precious resins, sandalwood flower, cashmere blankets, warm vanilla musk.)* A lightly spiced, lightly woody, lightly musky, lightly sweet, enveloping vanilla. Comfort is a good name for this since it smells like a lovely cozy sweater and is perfect for layering. It is a bit of a skin scent imo.\n* **Curiouser and Curiouser** *(LE: Daisy chains, blades of grass and a rabbithole, a blue cotton frock, airy vanilla clouds.)* It's a¬†fluffy and sweet vanilla with a hit of green almospt aquatic freshness keeping it from getting heavy at all. It reminds me of a lighter, fresher BPTP Celeste but without the \"purple\" that I largely get from Celeste. If I had to pick a favorite vanilla from my collection... it's this one.\n* **Emmeline Pankhurst** *(LE: Black tea swirled with vanilla cream, cold rain on stone, soft linen, cozy musk.)* This is Poesie‚Äôs tea note with a heaping helping of cool, airy, earthy stone and musk. It‚Äôs a pretty, chilly, but more bracing version of their Twice to Tea classic. Initially, the earthy watery elements are strongest, but over time the tea and earthy notes balance each other out. It‚Äôs a soft crisp blend that feels both cuddly and invigorating.\n* **Poison Pen Lane** *(LE: Black tea, berry and ginger scones spread with jam, polished mahogany, fuzzy jumpers, a hint of cyanide.)* Black tea, berry jam, and a hint of something absolutely snuggly and woodsy underneath it all. This perfume is delicious, cozy, and perfect for fall. The berries are decidedly blueberries but sometimes give me fig vibes, and they recede a bit over time. This feels like a more nuanced, cozy, and grounded take on their Twice to Tea classic.\n* **Twice to Tea** *(GC: A strongly brewed cup of Earl Grey tea delicately infused with all natural lavender absolute, sweetened with vanilla syrup, and lightened with a splash of milk.)* It's a sweet scent that has bits of tea, vanilla, milk, lavender, and that sweetness that comes with earl grey tea. It's not super foody but is more of a perfume version of a rather sweet tea if that makes sense.\n* **Velvet Moon** *(Collab: Cardamom, a wood-paneled library filled with old books, black pepper, a velvet dressing gown, paper + ink, flickering beeswax candles.)* Initially, this smells like a whisper of a sweet cardamom vanilla. It‚Äôs so light I can barely smell it, but in the drydown, it transforms to this papery inky library scent. I really do sense the flickering candle-smoke and hardwood shelving. It‚Äôs incredibly evocative.\n\n**üî∂ POSSETS** (Another house I have only more recently gotten into. I can tell there are more in their catalog that I will probably really love!)\n\n* **Black Annis** *(Halloween Retour: \\[Halloween Retour\\] Star Anise, black anise, fennel, absinthe, smoked licorice, and sweet black dry licorice. So dark and saturated that you will fall into a raging fit!)* Medicinal, herbal, and slightly sweet black licorice. Dark, inky, and absolutely gorgeous. This is the anise perfume of my dreams. If you have tried Olypic Orchid's Osafume but found that to go rubbery on you, try this. It's Osafume, but warmer and spicier without the rubber.\n* **Pavane** *(GC: Silver Cardamom, the sweetest of the strains of cardamom (something nice enough to put in a pasha's coffee) and the exquisite Silver base for which Possets is famous. Add a tot of artemesia, and a pinch of coumarin and the result is a fabulously gourmand to tempt even those on a diet against the gourmand world.)* Cardamom sugar cookies! A rich spiced gourmand that is neither too rich and sweet nor too spicy. It‚Äôs a delectable combination of the two, and I love wearing this snuggled up in a sweatshirt with a book in hand.\n\n**üî∂ TREADING WATER** (They had me at floral cardamom lol. I also really enjoy Demimonde and would go feral if my partner wore it tbh.)\n\n* **D√©chets** *(GC: Opulent white floral fragrance. jasmine and tuberose swirl together creating a disgustingly rich scent. Paired those with saffron, cardamom, and spicy angelica root you have an extravagant summer scent that almost hides all the emotional baggage you carry around.)* The prettiest fresh floral jasmine scent that has a hint of airy aromatic spices in the back ground. I don‚Äôt even like jasmine, and I find this to be so lovely and perfect for spring. It‚Äôs airy and pretty and warm and almost vanillic.",

    "body": "Okay so seen loads of posts on various subreddits about rituals for the new year. Some of them are really great but a lot of them seem to be for people that live in houses with gardens not flats. So thought I‚Äôd put together some ideas for rituals that are suitable for you lovely witches in flats. Please add more if you know of any! \n\nFYI: I don‚Äôt work with deities but there are loads of cool ways to incorporate them if you‚Äôd like to :) \n\n1. Magical Floor Wash\nGive your flat a cleanse with a magical floor wash. Mix moon water, salt and sage essential oil and give your floors a good scrub whilst thinking about everything you want to leave behind in 2019.\n\n2. Spell Jar\nThis is really nice to do with people. Write down a list of things you‚Äôd like to attract in the new year. Fill a jar with herbs corresponding to these wishes and maybe some charms if you have any. Seal the jar shut with wax and bury it in a plant pot‚Äôs soil. Leave the jar and your wishes to grow in the new year and remove when they start coming true.\n\n3. Kitchen craft\nFor all you lovely kitchen witches, bake some delicious food! Create a Sigil to protect you in the new year. Bake a loaf of bread and carve the sigil in to the top. Share the bread with your friends, family or someone who needs it.\n\n4. Thread craft \nMake a list of all the problems you want to leave behind in 2019. Take some thread and tie a knot for each problem. You can then either burn the thread safely or untie each knot.\n\n5. Bath\nThink about what you want to attract in the new year. Find a corresponding herb/flower for this (eg basil for business or money success, Rosemary for some great memories and big life events etc). Slowly heat up some honey in a bainmarie with the herb of choice. When the honey is feeling thinner and moving easily then remove it from the heat and drain the herbs from it. Leave the infused honey to cool. Run a bath with salts and some lavender essential oil to keep it nice and relaxing and light some candles. Rub yourself in the cooled honey and think about all that you want to attract to you in the new year again with intention. Get in the bath, relax and clean yourself.\n\nJust a few ideas but I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôll be plenty more. Feel free to share! \n\nHappy new year and I hope you all are well rested to fuck patriarchy in 2020.",

    "body": "This review is for the perfumes only. I have not tried any of her bath or body products. I am hoping this can help some people on the fence about what to order or introduce Firebird to those that haven't heard of them. I tried to break this up in sections so you only have to read what interests you.\n\nI went to the Firebird site on July 1st and ordered 6 samples and fell in love.  Bought 2 full size and and 9 more samples the SAME DAY I received my first package. When I got that package I fell even MORE in love and bought 5 more full size the same day I got the 2nd package. In all Firebird has collected about $125 from me in the past 5 weeks. I just can't get enough.\n\nHere's what I bought so far and my opinions on them. Your mileage my vary. Just because I do or don't like something doesn't mean you will or won't. I will try to describe my experiences the best I can, so you can decide for yourself if you might like it or not. Links are included so you can read the pages original descriptions and notes. Some of the notes I mention may or may not be a part of the original perfumes notes. I'm just describing what I smell, personally. If you would like to know more about what my personal scent preferences are I'll leave them in a reply after this post. That way you can see if we have the same tastes in scent or if we are polar opposites.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways enough about me. On to the reviews. The good, the bad and the HOLY GRAILS!\n\nThe good -\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Black Cocoa\\]([https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/collections/perfume/products/black-cocoa-perfume](https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/collections/perfume/products/black-cocoa-perfume))\n\nBlack Cocoa to me, smells like an old wooden coffee shop in the mountains that has been around for 50 years. With a little old man in a rocking chair smoking a pipe on the front porch of the place. You get the soft but not overpowering smell of the wood shop, and some chocolate muffins in the glass case. Then sitting down with a nice cup of coffee, you get fainest smell of vanilla pipe tobacco from the old man on the porch. It's a comforting, warm,  yet dark smell. I will be purchasing the full size.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Cake\\]([https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/collections/gourmand/products/cake-perfume](https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/collections/gourmand/products/cake-perfume))\n\nThis smells like those little lemon sandwich cookies (the vanilla kind with over sugary lemon frosting stuff squished in the middle) mixed with vanilla cake...on steroids. This is a sugar rush in a perfume. And it's amazing! The lemon is a sugary sweet lemon. Not pledgey at all. No bathroom cleaner lemon here. And it is not overpowering. The vanilla is rounded out by the almond, which normally I don't like almond, but here it just fades to create a perfect vanilla cake, straight out of the oven smell. It's the main star in this perfume. I mean she nailed it. This smells like cake. I bought a full size.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Woodland\\]([https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/collections/fresh-herbal/products/woodland-perfume](https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/collections/fresh-herbal/products/woodland-perfume))\n\nWoodland is laying down under a tree on a batch of freshly mowed grass. The grass and dandelions all mulched up together and the fainest smell from the moss and the tree that you're sitting under. This is walking down a country back road and smelling the greens of the field baking in the summer sun. This is a sweet, feminine greenery. I bought a full size.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Nectar\\]([https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/collections/perfume/products/nectar-perfume](https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/collections/perfume/products/nectar-perfume))\n\nThis is sitting down to afternoon tea and sticking your whole nose right into the honey pot. But still smelling the jams that lay in wait on the table. Nectar is hands down the best honey scent I have ever smelled. It's got a bit of apricot jam that really intensifies the honey scent and actually makes the honey smell sweeter. The notes claim to have clove which worried me at first, since I don't like clove. But, to be honest I don't smell clove in it at all. I bought a full size.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Lavender Milk\\]([https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/collections/perfume/products/lavender-milk-perfume](https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/collections/perfume/products/lavender-milk-perfume))\n\nI had much higher hopes for this one. I really enjoy lavender, but the addition of the other notes made it sound like the lavender of my dreams. Marshmallows, vanilla, coconut milk, sugar! I was all in! I imagined a smooth, creamy, sugary lavender. Perfect for making you feel cozy and relaxed for bedtime. Well, that's not what I got. While the lavender scent does smell like natural wild grown lavender, it is so strong in this one that it overpowers all the other scents in it. I get no milky creaminess or even much sweetness, I'm sad to say. Just kind of smelled like your basic lavender essential oil. I already have plenty of that. But, since I still love lavender, I guess this still goes in the good section.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Woodsmoke & Vanilla\\]([https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/collections/smoke/products/woodsmoke-vanilla-perfume](https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/collections/smoke/products/woodsmoke-vanilla-perfume))\n\nHonestly. This one is just ok. But not amazing. I was hoping this would be a sweet smelling smokey vanilla. But, it's not. You get pine, mostly. Which is ok. It's not horribly offensive pine in any way. Still it's not as sweet as I like my pine scents to be. Then you get the little hint of smokiness. The notes claim vanilla, heck it's even part of the title, but I'm not really getting any vanilla. The title should be Woodsmoke & Pine in my opinion. Not vanilla.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Snowdrift\\]([https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/products/snowdrift-perfume?\\_pos=1&\\_sid=569d3d0ec&\\_ss=r](https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/products/snowdrift-perfume?_pos=1&_sid=569d3d0ec&_ss=r))\n\nSnowdrift is nice. I bought this one because one year my daughter received a Christmas perfume from The Limited Too in the mid 2000's. She didn't like it, so she gave it to me. I fell in love with it and went back to buy more, but they were already sold out and discontinued that item after that Christmas. I treasured and nursed what I had for years. But it was only a tiny rollerball and sadly didn't last forever. It was like a super sweet vanilla with a little hint of peppermint candy. And I have been looking for a replacement ever since. I've been using Bath and Body Works Twisted Peppermint as a semi-substitute for years. But, it' still isn't sweet/vanilla enough and too peppermint heavy. Firebird's Snowdrift is nice but it's basically just Twisted Peppermint with a little bit of evergreen thrown in. My closest finds have actually come from Solstice Scents recently. Snowmint Mallow from there is good (still too much mint though, not enough sweet), but Snowshoe Pass is pretty magical. It's also still not as sweet as my original love, but the added Cold Winds accord give it such a magical spark. It will be my new substitute, come this winter, unless I can find one better before then.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Heavy Seas\\]([https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/collections/aquatic/products/heavy-seas-perfume](https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/collections/aquatic/products/heavy-seas-perfume))\n\nYes, this a masculine cologne scent. Yes, I bought it for myself (sometimes I like to wear male cologne scents if they are soft enough to be unisex or if they're interesting and realistic). No, I didn't end up keeping it for myself. It's a nice masculine aquatic cologne scent. It's just a little too generic male cologne smell for my taste. Don't get me wrong, I still liked it, I just gave it to my significant other, so he can wear it instead of me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe bad -\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Cinders\\]([https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/collections/perfume/products/cinders-perfume](https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/collections/perfume/products/cinders-perfume))\n\nCinders is the pungent smell of someone throwing a fat piece of still slightly green pine, full of sap, into a fire. And then having the smoke go right in your face. It's astringent and bitter and very potent. I was looking for a great campfire smoke smell, but this one, for me, was not it. This is a rugged, \"hand me the whiskey\" lumberjack, smoke cologne for men. Not cozy, warm \"I love campfires\" smoke perfume for women.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Viking\\]([https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/collections/aquatic/products/viking-perfume](https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/collections/aquatic/products/viking-perfume))\n\nWith the notes this one claimed to have in it, I was looking forward to this one the most. I was hoping for a salty ocean, with crisp fresh air, faint smell of trees and snowy ozone aquatics. What I got was a big whiff of straight to the back of your throat and cling there, icy menthol. I mean it actually made my throat cold and lingered. I HATE menthol with a passion so this was no go for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Green Lemon\\]([https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/collections/fruit-citrus/products/green-lemon-perfume](https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/collections/fruit-citrus/products/green-lemon-perfume))\n\nThis one I was kind of on the fence about. I have almost a love-hate relationship with it. But, while sitting on that fence, I smell it again and it knocks me backwards off that fence. So, (for me) into the bad category it goes. This is 100% true to it's name. This is slicing open a green lemon. It is as realistic as it gets. This is not pledge lemon cleaner, nor is it sweet sugary lemon dessert. This is fresh cut, slightly green lemon. Juice, rind, seeds and all. If you're looking for 100% realistic lemon juice scent. This is it! My 15 daughter loves it, but she loves to eat lemons raw. So, there you go. That's why I put it at the bottom, so close to the Holy Grails, because for her (and maybe you too) it is HG.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Holy Grails -(I can't ever live without these fragrances again. I don't know how they did it, but these are the most REALISTIC, amazing, memory evoking, magic potions in a bottle. ) As if I need to say it I bought full sizes of all the Holy Grail's and plan to repurchase every time I run out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Cabin\\]([https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/products/cabin-perfume?\\_pos=1&\\_sid=9829eb7f6&\\_ss=r](https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/products/cabin-perfume?_pos=1&_sid=9829eb7f6&_ss=r))\n\nCabin is deep woods camping in a bottle. This is sitting next to the firepit the morning after, enjoying the nature around you. The fire that WAS burning all night is now just a few embers under a huge bed of ash. You can smell the sweet smell of trees and even catch a faint whiff of the dirt that is caked all over your shoes. This evokes so many of my memories of camping that I raced back to the site to buy a full size.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Lagoon\\]([https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/collections/aquatic/products/lagoon-perfume](https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/collections/aquatic/products/lagoon-perfume))\n\nLagoon is the craziest, most incredible, weirdest aquatic scent I have ever smelled. I have been looking for a good aquatic scent for a long time. Most are just too cologne/perfume smelling and not enough realism. But this one knocked my socks off. And it was soooo different on me than it was on my daughter. On me it was the smell of swimming in the North Carolina South Toe river. I could smell the rocks, the river water, the plants that grow around the river and my suntan lotion.  On my daughter however, it completely flipped and it smelled like swimming at the local pool! You could smell the wet cement around the pool, the sunblock, even the chlorine on her. I laughed out loud when she  said...\"I can even smell bathing suit! You know that smell swimsuits get after you go swimming? I smell that!\" LOL This was one wild ride of an aquatic let me tell you. I had to buy a full bottle. However I will add, that this is still a bit more masculine aquatic than feminine. Not overly so though. A female can definitely get away with wearing this one (both me and my daughter will wear it). It's unisex, but leaning more masculine I'd say.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Campfire\\]([https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/collections/smoke/products/campfire-perfume](https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/collections/smoke/products/campfire-perfume))\n\nThis is the one that started my whole love affair with Firebird. I have been searching indie brands, looking for a perfume/cologne, that smells like your clothes smell after going camping. Some people hate that smell. I personally love it and wanted it bad enough to look for it in something I could apply whenever I wanted to. At first I was failing miserably. Everything smelled too artificial or way too acrid and didn't have that sweet yet dark smell I was searching for. The closest I had come was Solstice Scents Manor Fire (which I still love), but even it was still a bit too astringent. Then I found this gem. This is the closest I have seen....er...smelled in a perfume that mimics that smell. It's cozy and warm and the marshmallow and maple notes take the edge off the smoke and make it truly a wearable smoke perfume. I'm so in love! If you're looking to replicate that \"I've been camping all week\" campfire smoke in my clothes smell, this is the closest one I have found yet! It's not perfect (don't truly know if there is one that's spot on perfect), but it's damn close!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd last but certainly not least! My hands-down favorite from Firebird!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Saltwater\\]([https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/collections/aquatic/products/saltwater-perfume](https://www.firebirdbathbody.com/collections/aquatic/products/saltwater-perfume))\n\nI grew up in Florida, right by the beach. This scent sends me home. It‚Äôs more driftwood than saltwater to me. Actually, to me it‚Äôs the exact  smell of picking up a piece of driftwood and smelling it. Or sitting on a sun-warmed, wave battered dock. Not  JUST wood. But sun, salt and sweet  driftwood. Almost, like a salty, powdery vanilla. If you've ever smelled real driftwood on the beach, then you know what I'm talking about. This is my go to summer scent. It doesn‚Äôt last long and I have to reapply a few times throughout the day. But, I don‚Äôt care. That smell is worth more than words to me and will be my Holy Grail beach/summer scent forever. The site claims it's a masculine scent. I don't get that at all. It's feminine all the way to me. Like I said almost a soft, powdery, aquatic, salty, vanilla scent.",

        "body": "My favorite notes - Vanilla. I don't know how many of you have ever used [Waft.com](https://Waft.com), but they have a place where you type in your favorite perfumes and it will show you a little graph of the notes that are in it. Mine are always very vanilla heavy. In that same vein I also love Marshmallow, and generally anything cotton candy or sugary. I just love most gourmands in general. I also love bread, rice, nuts and wheat/oat scents. Milk, butter and creams are winners. Honey, hay, corn, pumpkin, wood, sawdust, amber, fire, smoke, and other earthy smells like dirt, stone, sand, shells and petrichor. And I also love the ozone smells like lightning, salt and water. Plus, I love smells that are kinda hard to pin-point and are subjective to many people like sunshine, crisp air, animal fur and skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNotes I don't like - I'm not fond of florals with the exception of maybe Lavender and Jasmine. Maybe a few others but not many and never heavy. I don't care for heavy incense, resins or spices unless they are used lightly. Like I love pumpkin, but not pumpkin spice. I usually don't care for soapy smells either. And I despise menthol and wintergreen. I like some mints, (spearimint and peppermint) especially if they're mixed with other smells like choclate or vanilla.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen there are those notes that can go two ways. And I either love them or hate them depending on the one that is used. Like pine. There's a sweet pine that I love and reminds me of North Carolina and Christmas trees and then there's an acrid, harsh pine sap smell that I don't like. Also lavender can go two ways. There's a soft natural lavender smell that I adore and reminds me of the lavender farm I used to live next to, and then there's this horrible bathroom cleaner like lavender that smells awful and nothing like true lavender.  Sometimes pipe tobacco can smell so nice and comforting and other times way too harsh. I love powdery scents, but I hate baby powder. Even chocolate can sometimes go two ways.   \n\n\nBut industrials and metallics is the hardest. Things like iron, steel, copper and blood for metallics. And things like motor oil, gasoline, cement, tar and asphalt for industrials. These things can add the perfect amount of edge or totally kill a smell. They are some of my most favorite and most hated, depending on how they're done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTeas can go one way or another. Most of them I like. Green and white teas especially. But some black and red teas can go too bitter. Some of the others can too.  Just depends on the amount used and the quality of the perfume.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe are some plant scents that I absolutely adore and others that smell way too pungent. Sweet fresh cut grass can be amazing and one of my favorites. But done wrong and it can ruin a scent. Others in this plant category that can be good or go wrong are clover, olive and cucumber.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd then there is fruit, Which really should be it's own category, Because there are so many fruits and all with unique smells. Most fruit scents I love but there are a few that hit that weird category that it's one of two types, that make me either love it or hate it. Banana is one of the worst. Banana done right is so amazing, but done wrong, sooo bad. Anyways, here's the run down on ones I like and the ones that can go two ways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFruits I Love - Strawberry, pineapple, apricot, peach, blackberry, raspberry, blueberry, white grape (but not purple candy grape, ick).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFruits I either love or hate depending on what kind is used and how heavy -   \nBanana, coconut, citrus (especially lemon), apple, cherry, plum, mango and melons.  \nMost of the time I just avoid these notes. I still take a shot on banana, coconut and citrus once in while though, because of how much I love them it when it's done right.",

    "body": "Hello there! Since I recently got a couple more orders from destashes and Mythpunk, I figured it was time to review all the other scents I've tried as I wait for rest periods! And also procrastinate because Ariadne (*Honey, Grape Vines, Olive Leaf, Lemon, Dionysian Wine*) from The Little Book Eater smelled initially just like grape medicine and I am scared of it. These are my mini vibe reviews on how they smelled initially straight out of the bottle to me and then how they worked on my skin after some time resting; or just the latter if I didn't save my initial notes. Fair warning, my nose isn't super developed lol but I had fun with these! This is reminding me I should probably revamp my rating system lol but oh well.\n\nLikes: gourmands, cake, peach, citrus, vanilla, pumpkin, chai, cider, marshmallow, strawberry, maple syrup\n\nDislikes: leather, smoke, apple, cherry, cucumber, most florals, coconut, tropical, atmospherics\n\nMy rating system:\n\n* 5 stars: I want to be drenched in this\n* 4 stars: good enough to keep, not enough to be the star\n* 3 stars: I like the scent but doesn't fit my vibe // doesn't stand out // not a huge fan but worth keeping\n* 2 stars: nah I'm getting rid of this\n* 1 star: absolutely revolting bad bad bad\n\nALKEMIA\n\n* **Yuletide Blessings 2020** (*Decadently boozy fruitcake studded with golden pineapple, candied citron, apricots, cherries, and sugary dates; almond marzipan for love; honey for wealth; evergreens for health; cinnamon for good luck; bay for wisdom; cloves for friendship, and frankincense for gratitude*): boozy fruitcake; on skin, hot tamales with a hint of boozy sweetness. 4/5\n\nAMORPHOUS\n\n* **Strawberry Cake** (*Aroma palette is gourmand and fruity.

    "body": "Posting this as a thread because I've posted my experience getting to waist length, and other subs here have co-signed my tried/true routine. As someone who has used EVERY product line (Olaplex 0-9, K18, every single Cecred product, was a former Joico ho, etc.) to save you valuable time, stress, and downright heartache! \n\nSo here goes (re-pasting it here)\n\nAs someone who was where you were a few months back.\n\nPlease consider this game changing routine!\n\nProducts- Olaplex(Only the No.3 treatment), Cecred, and the Redken Acidic Bonding Curls Leave In(the green one for T4/T3 hair, not the regular leave in)\n\nRoutine(In this Order)\n\nApply Cecred's Clarifying Shampoo(or a really good clarifier that you like)\n\n-Rinse-\n\nOlaplex No. 3 Treatment(10-20 mins)\n\nApply Cecred‚Äôs Hydrating Shampoo( Insane amount of slip, makes an excellent detangler) atop of the Olaplex 3 after leaving it in for the Amt of time above.\n\n-Rinse-\n\nCecred‚Äôs Rice Water + Silk Rinse Treatment(BEST & Most Innovative Protein Treatment on the market for Relaxed & T4 Hair in terms of anti breakage/excessive shedding, and length retention)\n\n^Only use once a month, it‚Äôs that powerful. Don't bother with the reconstruction mask... as it's not going to repair your relaxed hair to the extent of the rice/rose treatment!\n\n-Rinse-\n\nCecred‚Äôs DC Mask- under a heat cap or steamer(Most moisturizing mask for relaxed T4 hair..keeps moisture in your head/scalp for a VERY long time) \n\n^ don‚Äôt bother using Cecred's hydrating conditioner instead of the DC, it won‚Äôt work the same for thicker relaxed or T4 hair. The DC is what truly gets the moisture in your strands.\n\n-Rinse-\n\nApply Redken‚Äôs Acidic Bonding Concentrate Leave-In for Coily/Curly Hair(the green one, not the regular one)before you blow dry. It‚Äôs a very powerful treatment to seal the cuticle & all of the products you‚Äôve used and a VERY strong bond builder for chemically treated hair!\n\n^ there‚Äôs also a standard one, but the more powerful green one for coily/curly hair works better for relaxed hair.Given the naturally weaker bond structure of coily hair in particular.\n\n I prefer the green leave in for coily/curly hair because its a stronger concentration of the bonding care ingredient (16% vs 5% for the standard one, which our hair needs). And it's wayy more lightweight on the hair with no silicones, compared to the regular 5% leave in. \n\nLeave on & let air dry for 15-20 minutes before blow drying. Particularly to ensure your roots are near dry beforehand.\n\nWhat you'll then be SHOOK about next when blow drying ...is just how STRAIGHT the green Redken Acidic Bonding Curls Leave in gets your hair! Even with a ton of new growth! \n\nThe Redken leave in will have your hair near bone straight from blow drying alone. Additionally, you'll be suprised just how little hair is on the ground, if any. A key testament to the effectiveness of the product.\n\nNote- please use just a few DOLLOPS (no more than 1-2 tablespoons equivalent amount) to evenly coat the hair. Don't use a GALLOP(handful) or be heavy handed with this  like you would use for a DC mask. I initially did, and discovered that Using too much of this leave in will cause your hair to \"feel\" a certain way. It's very potent. A few dollops, not a gallop lol.\n\nNow you're set up for a flawless Flat iron.\n\nThen after(if you have low porosity hair like me)...apply some Cecred oil and do a quick 10 minute session with your hair covered with plastic under a heat cap.\n\nWhen you take it off... your hair will be so Lusciously SILKAYY! Equivalent (if not better) than salon results.\n\n\n*Important to Note*...To save additional time...I usually will do the routine above and blow dry, then have a stylist flat iron my hair after At a salon due to my length. I alternate between flat ironing my hair at home, and at a salon every other month. \n\nTrims- get my hair trimmed every other month at a salon(my stylist has been so impressed with Cecred..that she now offers a \"Cecred Silk Press\")\n\n\n\nBest Part of This Wash Day Rountine- It ONLY takes from an hour and a half to 2 hours max!! From the first rinse to blow drying to flat ironing. \n\nThis is primarily accelerated by using a detachable kitchen sink faucet. Instead of showering, and constantly having to get out and dry and repeat. Saving so much time and energy. Who wants to feel exhausted on wash day? When it should be a soothing self care/spa day. Lavender essential oil being diffused throughout the house, elevator music and all! Lol\n\nHeat Tools I use:\nDyson Airwrap(Blow Dryer)\nBabyliss Nano Titanium Flat Iron with a \"grip comb\" added. \n\n\nWeekly Maintenance: \n\nCecred‚Äôs Hair Oil- Best Hair Oil on the market‚Ä¶.so good you only have to use it every 3-4 days or so for your ends! It makes your hair so damn silky and lightweight. It's 1000x more moisturizing than any other hair oil, and the scent is out of this world \n\nCecred‚Äôs Moisture Lotion- Start using weekly the following week or second week after wash day, for a quick hydrating treatment to infuse moisture into your hair weekly like the DC.\n\n^ Your hair & scalp is going to remain so naturally moisturized/hydrated‚Ä¶.that most don‚Äôt need to start using it weekly until 2 weeks after wash day.\n\nCecred‚Äôs Edge/Growth Drops-For any bald patches or areas where you‚Äôve lost hair. It‚Äôs literal magic ü™Ñ. Use every other day, as it‚Äôs water based and will cause your roots to revert. I ONLY take a tiny dabs to rub DIRECTLY on my scalp(previously in small parts where I had breakage- not over my entire scalp) and edges. \n\n^The product is incredible and game changing for reversing thinning edges & bald spots. The thousands of people showcasing the results speak for themselves.\n\nUsing ALLIGATOR CLIPS to put my hair in pin curls under your silk bonnet at night. You can buy a silk bonnet specifically designed for overnight hair wrapping from Amazon. Keeps hair in place with less shedding/breakage as opposed to traditional wrapping. Look up the beautiful YouTuber Niara Alexis' night routine for more details.\n\nI only wash my hair monthly, sometimes Bi-weekly. \n\nWHY THIS ROUTINE ACTUALLY WORKS FOR RELAXED T4 HAIR:\n\nThe Olaplex No. 3 re-links your innermost bonds with its patented ingredient. \n\nCecred‚Äôs products(specifically formulated for T4 & T3 hair) all have a molecular weight. Meaning that it‚Äôs truly able deliver the necessary proteins(of the Rice/Rose Silk treatment) and hydration(Of the Deep Conditioner) to the innermost structure of your hair‚Äôs cortex. Something that‚Äôs critical for coarse, coiled, and/or low porosity hair like mine. \n\nLastly, the Redken Acidic Bonding leave in not only fortifies/relinks your bonds that the Olaplex might missed‚Ä¶but literally SEALS your hair cuticle. Sealing in all of the nourishing ingredients you‚Äôve put in your hair. It also helps to prevent split ends. Not to mention‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a DAMN good heat protectant! A 4-in-1. \n\nYou‚Äôll be stunned how little shedded strands you‚Äôll see in the shower and during blow drying. And after in the following weeks. Most importantly- this routines saves SO much more time and energy from being exhausted(using a detachable kitchen faucet vs showering) compared the endless 4+ hour routines and various products for relaxed hair...that simply do not work.\n\nMy hair is now almost waist length using this routine for the past year.\nConfidence restored. \n\nBest wishes to everyone reading this!

In the pic:\n\n1. Burberry ‚Äî Goddess. It started my obsession and I love it! Did not expect to like it so much, but it is such an easy reach for me. The vanilla in it is very multidimensional, and I am thinking of purchasing a fb after finishing a travel spray!\n2. Zara ‚Äî Golden decade. It‚Äôs a dupe for Libre Intense, I think. It‚Äôs a good dupe but ironically it‚Äôs too intense for me. It‚Äôs a cheapie though so no regrets.\n3. Lush ‚Äî Sleepy. It‚Äôs a body spray but it feels like a perfume! Very natural, but does not smell like plain lavender essential oil. It‚Äôs a recent purchase and a perfect smell for a cozy evening at home. Very strong and I feel like this bottle might last me forever.\n\nI have Initio ‚Äî Paragon and Mon Guerlain on my list to try. \n\nDo you have any other lavender suggestions for me? I am open to anything except local brands from US as they are not easily accessible in Europe where I live. Would be happy to hear your thoughts and wishing you relaxing holidays from my aromatic lavender clouds lol ‚ú® ",

It was unusual for Chloe to call during her classes, so I quickly picked up.¬†¬†\n\n‚ÄúHello?‚Äù¬†¬†\n\nSilence. Then, a faint rustling sound, like fabric brushing against the phone, followed by a sharp click.¬†¬†\n\n\"Chloe?\" I asked.¬†¬†\n\nNo response. I called back, but it went straight to voicemail. Something felt wrong. I texted her: \"Hey, just got a call from you. Everything okay?\"¬†¬†\n\nMinutes turned into hours with no reply. She never ignored my messages. My discomfort grew with every passing minute.¬†¬†\n\nAs the workday neared its end, I couldn't focus anymore. I told my boss there was an emergency and rushed out. As I pulled into our apartment complex, my heart sank at the sight of Chloe's bag on the ground, its contents strewn everywhere.¬†¬†\n\nPanic surged through me as I slammed the car door and rushed over. I screamed her name, hoping she was nearby. All down the sidewalk was her makeup, wallet, keys, and phone. With trembling hands, I quickly dialed 9-1-1.¬†\n\nMy voice was shaking as I explained the situation. The dispatcher, in a dismissive tone, asked if she might be with family or friends, seemingly unconvinced. I felt like crying. My whole world has been stolen from me and my only lifeline is being less than useless. After several minutes of arguing and clarification, she finally let me know a car was on the way before I hung up on her mid-sentence.¬†¬†¬†\n\nWith tears now running down my face I slowly collected her belongings and put them back into her bag. Every item gave me visions of her. The concealer she put on in the morning, the hairbrush she always used in the car. The lavender essential oil she put on her pillow.\n\nI sat on the grass in a stupor for I don‚Äôt know how long before I looked up to see two cops wander over to me.¬†¬†\n\nI explained everything. The shop, the cult, the symbols for which I still had an open police report.¬†¬†\n\n‚ÄúIs this some kind of joke?‚Äù one asked.¬†¬†\n\n‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I said as I looked up at him confused. ‚ÄúWhy would this be a joke? She's missing! She's probably scared right now! Why won‚Äôt you do anything?‚Äù¬†¬†¬†\n\n‚ÄúLook...‚Äù one of them sighed, ‚Äúwe get calls like this a lot. She's not a minor, and she hasn‚Äôt been gone that long. She might just be staying with a friend. If she doesn't show up in the next few days, give us a call and we‚Äôll take a look. Until then, just sit tight.‚Äù¬†¬†\n\nI didn‚Äôt respond, I just stared at the blades of grass, even as they got back in their car and drove off. I was completely and totally broken. These freaks clearly wanted us dead for mocking them, and they had the numbers to make that happen.¬†¬†\n\nI pulled out my phone and looked at the post with the photos Chloe had taken of the ritual. Desperate for someone to take this seriously, I started recording a video. With puffy red eyes and a shaky voice, I let it all out. I don‚Äôt remember everything I said or the order I said it in, but by the end, the video was seventeen minutes and thirty-six seconds long. I hit reply and sat on the grass until nightfall.¬†¬†\n\nI moved through the next day like a ghost. I didn‚Äôt even bother calling out sick to work. That afternoon, I heard a knock on the door, expecting it to be my landlord bitching about our trash cans again. I opened it to find a different face greeting me, one I never wanted to see for the rest of my life.\n\nTwo massive hands slammed into my chest, sending me tumbling over a barstool. A large man with a shaved head, wearing a wifebeater and gold chain, walked in.\n\nTim, more commonly known as little Timmy, was anything but. Last time I heard of him, he was stealing cars from dealerships and using them to run guns down to Mexico. Given that he was now in my apartment, I‚Äôm guessing most of the felonies he was charged with didn‚Äôt stick.\n\n‚ÄúWhere the hell is my sister, little man?‚Äù He said as he loomed over me.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, someone took her.‚Äù I said with a cough. ‚ÄúHow did you even find out?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWell, no thanks to you, asshole. Not even a call to her family?‚Äù He punched me in the gut.\n\nI was in a lot of pain, but I had to admit he was right. I should‚Äôve told them, but I think I was in too much of a stupor to even think straight.\n\n‚ÄúYou were supposed to be keeping her safe.‚Äù He said as he kneeled down and grabbed me by the collar.\n\n‚ÄúI knew you were always a sniveling little shit, but she gets got and I have to find out like this?‚Äù he said as he held up his phone with the video of me crying on the grass yesterday.\n\nI was confused. ‚ÄúHow did you see that?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúShe's my sister, dumbass, how do you think? Shits blowing up right now. Do you not check your phone?‚Äù He spat as he walked over me, further into the apartment.\n\nI snatched my phone off the counter. Notifications flooded the screen in a blur. I clicked one to see my post was now at twenty seven thousand likes with nearly five thousand retweets. It had gone viral.\n\n‚ÄúI got a meeting with my parole officer down south in three days,‚Äù Tim started. ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm not leaving until I know she's safe. So either we find her, or I‚Äôm going back to jail, and that shits gonna be on you little man. You don‚Äôt want to know what happened to the last guy that got me locked up.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúRight, um‚Ä¶ okay.‚Äù I stuttered.\n\nI scrolled through the replies. There was everything from reaction gifs to condolences to people accusing me of killing her, but one in particular caught my eye.\n\n*Hey George, I‚Äôm Kelly with GSNN. Would you be available to meet for an interview?*\n\nI stopped for a moment. Everything was happening so fast. I went from feeling helpless to feeling like the whole world was on my side. At that moment, I knew I had to man up. I was going to save her.\n\n‚ÄúTim, there's a woman at the shop that knows more than is letting on.Can you talk to her? A journalist wants to meet and I‚Äôm going to try to see her tonight.‚Äù\n\nTim walked over. I flinched as he put a hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúSure, kid. I‚Äôll go ‚Äòtalk‚Äô to her. Just give me the address.‚Äù\n\nI replied to Kelly, arranging to meet at a caf√© near the station at 7 PM. She agreed without hesitation. Since we lived downtown, the station was only a few blocks away, so I decided to walk instead of taking an Uber.\n\nThe air was cool and crisp as I stepped onto the sidewalk. It was Friday night, and the city buzzed with life. Tourists filtered in and out of restaurants and bars, ready to start their wild nights. The scents of street food mingled with the distant hum of live music created a vibrant collage of city life.\n\nThe crowds near the public market seemed thicker than usual. Groups of rowdy adults streamed out of the parking structures, their laughter and chatter echoing off the buildings as they made their way to a concert at the Showbox. Neon lights flickered overhead, casting colorful reflections on the wet pavement, remnants of an earlier drizzle.\n\nLost in thought about what I was going to say in the interview, I almost missed a fleeting image in my peripheral vision. I could have sworn I saw a large, overweight man standing on the street corner, cloaked in a gray hoodie and wearing a rabbit mask. I snapped my head towards the figure, only to see an older Asian man holding a shopping bag, his eyes focused on his phone through his glasses.\n\nI shook my head, trying to clear the unsettling image from my mind. The streets seemed more crowded than usual, with groups of people milling about, their faces blending into the city's evening blur.\n\nThen I saw another one. This time, it was a slender figure in a fox mask, standing at the entrance of an alleyway, the mask‚Äôs painted eyes seemingly fixed on me. Unlike before, this figure didn‚Äôt disappear; it remained, an unnerving presence that tracked my every move as I passed.\n\nI quickened my pace, trying to rationalize the sightings. Maybe it was a promotional stunt or some kind of performance art. But the more I walked, the more these figures appeared. A tall man in a wolf mask loitered near a bus stop, his masked face turned towards me. A child in a bear mask peeked out from behind a parked car, their eyes following me intently. They stood still, their masks fixed in my direction, blending into the crowd yet distinct in their silent, unnerving presence.\n\nThe crowd thickened as I approached the market area. The festive atmosphere felt increasingly oppressive, the laughter and chatter of the crowd a dissonant background to my rising panic. I weaved through the throng, my eyes darting around, trying to make sense of what I was seeing.\n\nNo one else seemed to notice them. A group of teenagers walked right past a person in a bird mask without even a second glance. A couple chatted happily, oblivious to the figure in a deer mask standing right behind them. It was as if I was the only one who could see these eerie figures.\n\nThat‚Äôs when it happened. A sharp, searing pain tore through my side. An icy chill spread through my body, causing me to stiffen. The sounds of the night faded into a muffled drone, and my vision narrowed and sharpened.\n\nInstinctively, my hand flew to my side. My fingers met something warm and wet. I pulled my hand away and stared at the blood slicking my skin. It was only then that the reality hit me: I had been stabbed.\n\nI stumbled, my back colliding with a cold stone wall. My legs felt like jelly, barely able to support my weight. A woman next to me screamed, her eyes wide with horror as she backed away. I tried to focus on her face, but everything blurred together, the world tilting and spinning around me.\n\nAnother man rushed over, supporting my neck as I slumped to the ground. He muttered something in a reassuring tone, but his voice seemed distant. My vision started to fade as he reached down to my side. With a firm but careful grip, he pulled out a long, wavy-bladed dagger. The blade was intricately patterned, each curve shimmering under the streetlights, with an ornately decorated hilt.\n\nThe pain intensified for a moment, then dulled as a numbing cold spread through my body. I could hear distant sirens, growing louder as they approached. The man kept talking, trying to keep me conscious. I blinked slowly, fighting to stay awake, the world around me dimming.\n\nThe next thing I knew, paramedics were by my side, their voices urgent. They worked quickly, applying pressure to the wound and asking me questions to keep me alert. The stretcher felt hard as the bright lights of the ambulance interior blinded me.",

I have a cat who willingly comes and sleeps away from my diffuser and next to me (I leave my door open so he can leave on his own as well). My sister sold DoTerra for a while and kindly gave me a bottle of their lavender oil as a ‚Äúyou‚Äôre stressed and pregnant, diffuse this and enjoy‚Äù gift, knowing that my cat had no issues when I diffused these other oils. \nIt smelled different, like walking through a warm lavender field, so I put a couple of drops in my diffuser the way that I would with my other oils. I noticed right away that I needed less, it was a stronger smell, so I stopped with three drops as opposed to my normal 8. That night my cat woke me up trying to throw up on my bed. No big deal I thought. Well the next four times I diffused this oil, he would throw up, which seemed really odd to me as he was fine in between. I stopped using that oil and went back to my regular oils and he is more than fine since. I told my sister and she apologized and asked if I was okay, which I was, I‚Äôd been sick at the time, but I thought it was just a flu like virus. I‚Äôm now realizing that the times I used that oil coincided with my ‚Äúillness‚Äù. MLM oils aren‚Äôt safe in my eyes based on this.",

    "body": "Hey y'all! This was my first time trying Poesie and I'm so happy with how everything turned out. I got samples from the Cozy Christmas collection and a custom discovery set (they've been sitting for a few weeks each), but I‚Äôm only reviewing the ones that I‚Äôve worn enough to give a confident review.\n\nPersonal preferences: Most of my collection is grounded gourmands, and my favorites tend to have bakery spices and fruit notes. Most incense notes give me a headache as do certain florals so I tend to avoid them. Another note, I‚Äôve noticed that Poesie gets very faint on my skin very fast. Most fade to a sort of sweet-cardboardy base note in 2-3 hours\n\nGeneral Collection-\n\nMadar- *comforting, creamy Basmati rice pudding flavored with orange flower water, saffron, cinnamon, cardamom, and dried rose petals, then piled high with sugared pistachios*\n\nTo preface this, you must know that after I read a review of this perfume I immediately made two kinds of rice pudding and it has since become my favorite dessert. That‚Äôs how much the description appealed to me. I‚Äôve been pining after this one for months and slathered it on as soon as I got it out of the package (which was a mistake, it was 100% rose and pistachio). After a week or two it settled down, the rice pudding came through, and I honestly have no words. This is what I want to smell like every day. It's warm and inviting and homey, with a little unexpected twist- like wearing a new bra under your favorite shirt. It has just enough spice and rose to keep from becoming boring, but the pudding is so realistic and soft that I can't imagine I would ever get tired of it in the first place. This is the best perfume I have ever worn, and once I finish the sample it's going to be the first scent I full size. Vibes: indescribable.\n\n5/5, I‚Äôd give it more but I‚Äôm not a rule breaker\n\nWhisper Your Bitter Things- *pressed coffee beans, dried clove bud + cassia bark, jasmine and neroli blossoms, roasted vanilla pods*\n\nOh man, this one is interesting. It's the strongest scent of the lot, almost nose-tinglingly so. The coffee beans (and its distinctly coffee beans I smell, its too grainy and strong to be a regular cup of coffee) are bitter and smoky, but also buttery. The sweetness of the vanilla doesn‚Äôt take away from the bitterness, but keeps it inviting and warm. The blossoms and spices are hard to discern for me; I get a general woodsy, slightly earthy tinge from the cassia, and the jasmine is almost indescribably delicate but still very much there. I don‚Äôt know what neroli blossoms would smell like, but the floral aspect is very complex so I‚Äôm sure you could find it if you know what you‚Äôre looking for. This is unexpected and sultry, but still wearable. Vibes: a fairy coffee shop, covered in flowering vines\n\n4/5, only because my personal preference is a much lighter perfume. However, this is 5/5 for date nights or rainy Sundays\n\nSleepy Ghost- *marshmallow pillows sprinkled with natural lavender essential oil and absolute for sweet dreams*\n\nSleepy Ghost put me through the five stages of grief. I wanted to like it so much. It sounds so simple and pure and perfect, but every time I wore it I got nauseous and uncomfortable? Something about it is very sharp, like medicinal lavender and hard shards of rock candy instead of soft pillowy goodness. It almost‚Ä¶ makes my stomach hurt? After my third time trying it, I had a eureka moment. This smells like my tampons. I basically pavloved myself into hating this one. I‚Äôm sure this is a beautiful scent, but please, if anybody uses Always pads/tampons, tell me I‚Äôm not crazy. Vibes: hot water bottle\n\n0/5\n\nTwice to Tea- *a strongly brewed cup of Earl Grey tea delicately infused with all natural lavender absolute, sweetened with vanilla syrup, and lightened with a splash of milk*\n\nWho knew Jane Austen would hold a special place in my heart *and* my nose. The tea is creamy and realistic (not too herbal or floral and very well rounded) and, much to my relief, the milk isn‚Äôt sour at all. I‚Äôve heard the Au Lait horror stories. The vanilla is present but not overly foody- I get a smidge of sweetness and a general warmth from it. My only problem is the lavender. I‚Äôm thinking that my issue with it may extend beyond menstrual products, which is a shame because I love the scent in person. I‚Äôm not sure how to determine what notes I amp, but the lavender is definitely overpowering for the first hour or so. After that, it‚Äôs a super relaxing perfume, perfect for everyday wear, that lasts a surprisingly long time. Vibes: Sitting in a frothy white gown with a frothy cuppa\n\n4/5 ‚ÄúBut indeed I would rather have nothing but tea‚Äù- Jane Austen. Also, you bet your bottom dollar that I'm gonna buy the actual Twice to Tea tea once it's back in stock.\n\nI also have Fan Dance (*sugar-dusted tart raspberries, vanilla bean, powder-white skin*), which I haven‚Äôt tried as much but I love so far! It would be amazing for spring and summer. Its ultra-tart raspberry *almost* on the cusp of perfectly realistic. Sweet and refreshing and a 100% crowd pleaser.\n\nCozy Christmas-\n\nGingerbread Kittens- *gingerbread cookies sandwiched with marshmallow fondant and dipped in citrus glaze, fluffy kitten fur, a glint of amber eyes*\n\nTo me, this is very not-complex, with easily discernable notes. I mostly get an accurate gingerbread scent, with no overpowering ginger, and a fresh squeezed glass of orange juice. Sadly, this is one of the ones that my skin EATS- to the point where I could only smell vague sweet cookie smell after about 45 minutes, which is a huge bummer because I love the first burst of fragrance. It‚Äôs very gourmand, but such an unexpected combination that I feel like almost anybody would like it. Vibes: you‚Äôre six, the world is simple, and your parent/guardian lays out an after-school snack\n\n3/5, just from my stupid skin chemistry. I‚Äôll definitely finish the sample, though!\n\nThe Perfect Tree- *rows of balsam & silver fir trees, curls of orange peel and cloves simmering on the stovetop, a bayberry wreath on the front door*\n\nThis one is gonna be short, because my boyfriend loved it so much I let him keep it after wearing it once. Luckily, I got my review because he now wears it nonstop. ‚ÄúSimmering on a stovetop‚Äù is such an apt description of this because somehow, it smells like Christmas tree clippings and faint orange rind with something sweet and blackberry-like (I dunno where I got that from) steaming away happily in a little pot of water. It's not warm, it's not watery, it's distinctly steamy. I don‚Äôt know how. The Poesie team are undercover witches and this is their holiday brew. Vibes: You know how kids like to make ‚Äúsoup‚Äù by throwing everything in the backyard together and it ends up a muddy, earth-wormy mess? Like that, but Christmas and in the best way.\n\n5/5 for making my boyfriend smell so good\n\nFireside Reverie- *a crackling wood fire, holiday blend of cinnamon & nutmeg, precious resins of frankincense, myrrh, and benzoin*\n\nI freaked out about this one in a post a few minutes after I got it. Once again, this is amazing and I‚Äôm even more sure that the Poesie team are secret witches. For some sad, sick reason, many ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù perfume notes give me headaches, i.e. patchouli, incense like nag champa, amber, and resins. Needless to say, I wasn‚Äôt expecting much. I took a tentative sniff, and‚Ä¶ nothing. No resin headaches, for the first time in my entire indie journey! And besides that, it's just a plain gorgeous scent. This is so well blended that it was difficult for me to pick out individual notes, but the illusion of heat is so strong that my eyelids instinctively felt heavy. I mostly smell the frankincense, with a sharp hint of nutmeg and the perfect amount of cinnamon. I feel like cinnamon tends to overpower other spices, but in this case it just adds to the warmth. Vibes: Fireside Reverie paints a very vivid picture to me that I‚Äôve never experienced before but somehow just feels so *right*? You‚Äôre a little boy, dressed in your stifling Sunday best. The church pew is covered in a soft crushed velvet cushion. The sun streams in from a stained glass window. You‚Äôre so warm, and so sleepy, and you fall asleep to the sound of reverberating choir songs.\n\n4/5, a little too heavy for me to want to wear all of the time, but the perfect sleepytime scent.\n\nFor some reason, I always wore the other scents in the Cozy Christmas Collection when I could never find the time to write out my thoughts. These reviews are based on my memory and are therefore not to be trusted.\n\nFrosted Mittens- *a peppermint mocha topped with mini marshmallows and crushed candy canes, white chocolate peppermint bark, chill winter air*\n\nThis one faded on me in less than 30 minutes, so I don‚Äôt think I can give an accurate review. I remember thinking that the mocha was very realistic and pleasant, but that I didn‚Äôt get much peppermint.\n\nMorning Mayhem- *vanilla French toast sprinkled with cinnamon and drizzled with* *maple syrup, coffee milk, balsam fir, wrapping paper*\n\nA pleasantly surprising maple syrup scent, considering I don‚Äôt normally like breakfast smells. The coffee milk and wrapping paper (either that or the cardboardy base note I get) played along well with the rest of the notes. The balsam is more of a suggestion, and I sadly don‚Äôt get much, if any, eggy and sweet French toast. I think I tried this before it was properly rested, so I‚Äôm going to have to retry.\n\nSugar Dusted- *cinnamon sticks, apple and pumpkin pies in the oven, plates of sugar cookies and tins of sugared pecans, smudges of butter and splashes of vanilla extract*\n\nSomeone in a previous review said that this smelled like laying out individual ingredients before baking, and I have to agree but in a different way. They didn‚Äôt smell the apple or pumpkin pie, but those were in the foreground during my test. Imagine cleaning up your counter after baking: your finished products are cooling on a rack, and beneath them are lumps of spilled sugar and smears of butter.\n\nIf you're this far down, thanks for reading :) you better have a lovely day",

    "body": "Just wanted to add to the pool of reviews. I always come back here and read, re-read, and re-re-read reviews on whether or not I should buy a candle.\n\n**Bastide Candles**\n\nFigue d'Ete - Oh wow, it is fig through and through. Not a sugar sweet fig to me, it burns fruity and green and subtle. It easy fills a medium room when under a candle warmer, and burns are more subtle. The vessle almost has a full meltpool, but it's always one sliver on the edge that remains solid. But yeah, this smells like Diptyque's Figuier but less green, but just as refreshing and summer-y.\n\nAmbre Soir - It is kind of sweet and resinous, and it kind of reminds me of chocolate without the milk fats and sugar. The scent as a whole is kind of sweet and not heavy. It lacks some type of base 'oomph' that rounds out the whole experience. In other words, it kind of feel like it lacks something to make it more fulfilling. However, it's throw is impeccable when lit, and even better when under a candle warmer. Sometimes I find myself a little nauseated by the cold smell, but I quickly get over it once it's warm.\n\n**Diptyque Candles**\n\nLys - My first luxury candle! I love this so much. I am not religious but I have such an attachment to Easter Lilies. Their smell is so nostalgic to me, and this candle has a ever-so-slightly smoky quality that enhances the inherent sweetness of the heady white floral. Not as head as tuberose, mind you, but this fills out that niche for me in every way. It smells like Easter Lilies. I guess that's all there is to it. (I am sure there are other minute notes here but I just am not skilled enough to descern them). Easily fills a medium room when lit by a flame, only strengthed by a candle warmer.\n\nVanille - Of course this has a cult following. This was one of my first 4 luxury candles (I bought all 4 at once and it includes Lys). This is a not-sweet vanilla with a nutty quality, supported on a base of something woody but not wood-y. It has that foundation that emphasizes the pitchy 'higher' smells (unlike the Ambre Soir at times). I am not too sure how to phrase it, but Vanille feels like a complete image that mirrors a gourmand but does not fall into that frame. Awesome hot throw when lit.\n\nOranger - Oranger is a refreshing orange jacked with spices. Unlike Pomander, which is slightly soapy and full of cloves, Oranger relies on cinammon and orange rind, with a splash of the refreshing pulp-filled juice. I honestly cannot get enough of it, hence it being one of my first 4. Mixed with Vanille, it is like a spicy orange cream-sicle, but very light on the spice. A garnish of spice, if you will, to accentuate the orange and vanilla qualities. Also has great hot throw. Cold throw is surprising as I catch whiffs of it when it across a table.\n\nTh√© - One of my first 4, but it doesn't grip my heart like the aforementioned 3. At first it smells spicy and almost peppery. \"This is tea?\" I would ask the Sales Associate. He doubles down and nods, \"this is my favorite background scent. It is just so calming to me.\" He led me to Th√© after explaining his aversion to all things cinnamon, so I was on an Oranger high. When Th√© is lit, the tea becomes to creep out. It is a deep and unadulterated black tea to my nose, and the spice somehow disappears. Actually, it reminds me so much of Earl Grey Tea, without the refreshing qualities of the bergamot. It is deeply concentrated and steeped black tea, chocked-full of tannins and astringents that the wax would probably be bitter if it was edible. When super up close to the melted wax pool, it pulls some citrus note from somewhere deep inside, but that just might be my subconscious filling in the Earl Grey checkbox. This is fantastic and strong throw-wise, and pairs super well with a sweeter or fruitier fragrance. Th√© and Vanille bffs xoxo\n\nGardenia - I find this white-floral-heady territory just like Lys, but I found it different enough to warrant a full separate purchase. My favorite part of this candle, besides the smell, is that the wax turns pink while it is melting. Despite its similarity to Lys, this is less smokey and more green. And probably more like Gardenia than Lilies. Unfortunately I do find this to be a redundant candle to have because it doesn't strike a chord with me. I just like candles. Moderate hot throw, not as strong like Lys though.\n\nMousses - Green and refreshing. Smells like something minty and vegetal, but not the same type of veggie like tomato vines. It is an earthy green, and smells like men's shampoo if it was all-natural, made with only botanical extracts. It just screams a bit masculine to me, which I love. I also just love a lot of green fragrances, and much prefer them. Even the wax is green, so bonus points. Cold throw is decent, hot throw is also kind of just okay. I think it could fill a medium size room, but it turns background like Th√©. \n\nMenthe Verte - It evokes the smell of when you chew actual spearmint leaves in your mouth. It has that green 'taste' to it, along with the aforementioned mint. Imagine mint gum without the sweetness, toned down immensely, and tainted with something generically *green*. This candle is not generic, since it is more of a soliflore, but not a flore and not a perfume. When lit, the green is subdued and the mint takes a back seat, much like Th√© and Mousses. I find it to be a personal hit, though. Carriere Freres also has a spearmint, but that one smells like how the plant smells when you smash it between your fingers. That greenness is not as strong, and the sweet mint takes the forefront.\n\nChoisya - Disappointingly subtle to me. Maybe it didn't help that I was probably nose blind from burning Carriere Freres Orange Blossom at the exact same time. I find it uninspired yet beautiful. It is your standard orangle blossom with a bit of green (most floral Diptyque candles seem to be the whole flower, leaves and all). The hot throw is something that needs to be worked on.\n\nCoing - How do I even... describe this one? I fear that any candle that is remotely 'apple' related will smell synthetic to me. Coing represents the quince fruit, which to me smells like an amalgam of a sour apple and a pear. It is fragrant and floral, though, almost like bubblegum but not sweet and painfully synthetic. It also kind of smells like perfume to me, which makes me question how good of a represention to Coing this Coing candle really is. Hot throw is very good, but I quickly become nose blind because it just doesn't shout. It murmurs and mumbles.\n\nSantal - I really wanted to like this. Remember how I mentioned that I prefer scents that are full? This is the foundation, without the beautiful house on top. It is a sweet wood that goes nowhere. Yes, a room would smell nice if it smelled like this, but why would I get this if I could get Lys or Vanille instead? Sure, those are woody single note candles, so maybe I just hate woody scents. Much like Musc, Vetyver, Benjoin, Chene, et cetera, it does not bring me the joy or stimulation. I do enjoy burning this one, though. It is a nice background candle. It is a nice candle in general.\n\nFeuille de Lavande - Lavender! It is strong, too. Carriere Freres also has a lavender, but of course Diptyque has a certain green aspect to it that levels it up from standard to standard plus. I also can find this one cheaper on European websites compared to Carriere Freres, so a win is a win. I light this when I need to fresh up the room, after a cleaning day, or to unwind. I also just light it whenever I feel like it. I do not find a difference between the cold scent and the hot scent, but the hot throw is very nice. Easily fills a medium sized room after a few minutes of being lit. Candle warmer is just even more throw-y.\n\nGeranium Rose - Smells like geranium! With a bit of floral rose to tone up the spicy geranium! Smells like their perfume Geranium Odorata! When lit, this fills the room, the rose steps forward, and it is just a pleasant spicy green floral. I would call it generic, but Geranium has such a distinct facet to it that it is too iconic to label it as such. I really do like this, and I find this a relative to Menthe Verte. I do need both, though! Do not get me wrong.\n\nCypres - I swear this is more minty than Menthe Verte. It is striking, cold, fresh, and (omg) GREEN. It is very cold, though, and kind of masculine in nature. It's like being out in the cold near a nice formidable tree, but also simultaneously taking place in the heat of June. I'm sorry I really cannot put smells into words that well. This stays as a mainstay in the rotation for sure. Solid throws from both being lit and being under the warmer.\n\nOpopanax - I swear this one has a throw that just permeates through doors and walls. It smells musky and kind of powdery when hot, but when cold it smells kind of fizzy like soda. But, not sweet. If makeup was only for men, marketed for men, and had a history of being solely masculine, this is probably what the manly-man men foundation for manskin would smell like. Hope this helps! The confounding thing about having Opopanax under the warmer or lit is that, when you prance somewhere else in the house, there is this striking sweetness that just hides under every breath you take. I don't know if the essential oils are slowly killing me and filling my lungs, if this is a form of psychosis, or if this candle is secretly a beast. Cold throw is also kind of crazy.\n\nGen√©vrier - Juniper berries! How do I describe this one?! People say it smells like a gin and tonic so... it smells like a gin and tonic. Juniper berries are not sweet at all. They are aromatic, *green*, and astringent. If all the berries went to a berry convention, Juniper berries would be seriously serious and seriously not there. They do not play around at all, and this candle is not as fruity and happy as what we associate with the term \"berry\". Very nice hot throw.\n\nJasmin - I don't know... it doesn't smell like jasmine while it burns. It smells like how every candle kind of smells when burning. The distinct smell of wax burning to fuel the flame. Cold, it smells pungently like jasmine.\n\nFeu de Bois - At first I didn't get it. \"Euck, it smells like smoke but not cancerous.\" I burned it, though, and it mellowed out into this sweet smoke that persisted behind the scenes but spoke like a narrator of a play. I do find this kind of addictive to always have burning or melting. It is just a nice smoke, but not the urgent scary kind of billowing darkness. No, it is the searing of a fragrant herb, or the start of a cozy fireside.\n\n**Carriere Freres**\n\nTomato - Really nice. It is if a salad was floral and fragrant and not a meal topped with dressing. It is reminiscent of breaking off multiple leaves of a tomato vine and smelling the sap that seeps out. It is very, very fragrant and very, very green. And, obviously, very, very nice.\n\nTea Plant - Ignore everything you know about black tea. This is not black tea at all. This the original tea plant *Camellia sinensis*, popular in early China and a staple for trade way back in the day. Imagine a green tea that isn't roasted at all, just dried. It is kind of sweet, kind of musky. Actually, it is really sweet. It has that addictive quality of what a green tea candy would have, without the bitterness.\n\nOrange Blossom - Straight up orange blossom, kind of soapy.\n\nLavender - Straight up lavender essential oil, but not as concentrated.\n\n**Flamingo Estate**\n\nSage - Hi! This is phenomenal. Got me into a weird 'sage phase' where I needed everything sage-scented because I didn't know what I was missing. Kind of reminds me of Cowboy Grass by DS & Durga, which I purchased soon after I bought this candle. Like most aromatherapy, it is relaxing, kind of minty and fresh, and even a bit culinary. I feel like, deep down, it is an almost savory candle. Would never pair this with something like Vanille or Opopanax because it might make me sick.\n\n**Cire Trudon**\n\nMadurai - What if I said I was disappointed by this. Would anyone be upset? It is not strong, even after the first full-melt burn. Not even under a candle warmer does this sing its song, if it even has one. I thought this would replace my needs for a jasmine candle from anywhere else. Like most Trudon candles, these ones are more complex than the many single-note candles that I happen to collect. This is an amalgam of really nice white florals like jasmine, tuberose, and probably even orange blossom. However, like having a choir of only sopranos, they trample all over each other and silence the whole performance. I really cannot tell if I am smelling it. Up close it doesn't really have a distinct strong smell to it. Maybe I got a dud? I remember smelling it in a store and it was strongly of jasmine on the glass cloche. Bummer!\n\nOdalisque - My favorite and first Trudon. What a great note to start on, orange blossom. It is a pungent white floral with some soapiness and some sweetness that really goes together and fills the whole room. It is nostalgic and yet I cannot pin-point a single note that I experience.\n\nProletaire - I also do not know Lily of the Valley well enough to dictate if this smells just like it. I think this one is also kind of on the weaker side, or I got yet another dud. Smells nice!\n\nDada - Minty! And kind of like tea, but mostly minty. When it is warm, the tea comes out to mingle with the single mint, and the nuances truly mix it up in the air.\n\nCyrnos - Fruity, floral, green, all bundled together in one happy family. I wish I had more to say for these complex smells, but to me these smell like a whole experience rather than a play by play story. \n\n&#x200B;",

    "body": "Since my last Poesie review post ([the complete Wonderland collection](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/tsnnkk/welcome_to_wonderland_6_poesie_reviews/), posted this past spring), which is when I started realizing how well Poesie works for me as a house, I have taken the opportunity to try a fairly large set of Poesies, including a wide range of samples and decants (with my thanks to Ajevie, u/flouncingsnape, u/definingmagic, and u/wewawalker for making all this tremendous fun of exploring this house possible!) Here are my thoughts (scents in alphabetical order rather than by collection, since in most cases there's just one or two from a given collection), with a few final thoughts at the end (recommendations if you're looking for snuggly and/or cardamom scents) and my usual \"here's where they landed in my collection\" overview.\n\nA lot of Poesie's perfume oils have an underlying, recognizable vanilla musk base, which works really well for me (in fact, when I put on a Poesie perfume oil in the late summer after not having worn any Poesies for months, I realized that I'd really missed it!), but if you've tried a few and don't love that vanilla musk base, chances are most of Poesie's catalogue may not work on you. Other notes I *love* from Poesie are their cardamom (I truly think Poesie has the very best cardamom note!), sandalwood, black tea, and - to my HUGE surprise - their leather note. (This from a girl who does not like leather or suede! Read on to find out why I've been converted.) They do cozy, snuggly scents like nobody's business, but I find their more gourmand scents to be too sweet or artificially candy-ish on me. I also branched into some of their darker scents in the last few months and found a few that I really enjoy and one that instantly became a holy grail scent for me.\n\nSeveral of these - **Black Cat Cuddles**, **Myself Invisible**, **Perfect Happiness**, **Sleepy Ghost**, and **Sweet Sleep** \\- are currently available either as general catalog or autumn scents, if you're looking to add something to your cart for a Black Friday order. (And if you're looking for even more Poesie reviews, [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/sq0we8/14_poesie_reviews_my_black_friday_order_plus_a/) is my review post from last winter, when I reviewed 14 Poesie scents including several general catalog scents, several autumn scents, and several winter scents, including a couple of the current \"returning winter favorites\" and Black Friday gift tier scents too.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Black Cat Cuddles** \\[Sweet coconut milk spiked with clove, cinnamon & black pepper, incense-dusted fur, flecks of black vanilla bean, a distant pine forest\\] - When I first put it on, it's milky, almost buttery coconut milk, with some underlying autumnal spices (but not nearly as strong as I expected). After a few minutes for the coconut milk to settle, a blast of trees joins it, and the longer it dries, the more balanced it becomes, with the spices amping up to join the coconut milk and pine. To my devastation, I don't get any incense (and I love incense). But your mileage may vary - I know some other people get all incense and no trees. Personally I would call this one \"atmospheric\" rather than \"snuggly\", though I know a lot of folks consider this to be a really cuddly perfume. I'm so glad to have it in my collection! It's not going in my \"autumn cozy\" section though - I'll wear this on days when I want a more atmospheric scent, with outfits in shades of dark blues and greens to play up the trees.\n\n**Blanket** \\[Dry vanilla bean, skin musk, all the winter coziness\\] - After the tremendous success, for me, of Poesie's snuggly scents with cardamom, I wanted to try this one even though it doesn't have cardamom. üòÇ It's incredibly cozy, very pretty. This vanilla isn't in the slightest bit gourmand, and the (slightly baby powder-ish) skin musk makes it very intimate and personal. There's not a lot to this scent, but it's executed beautifully. Snuggly and inoffensive. If you enjoy cozy vanilla scents, this one is worth trying if it comes around again. (I got my 2-ml in Poesie's short-lived \"our fall collection's release is delayed so here are a few past autumn/winter scents we found leftovers of\" release.)\n\n**Cozy** \\[Spicy cardamom + rich vanilla\\] - I got this one along with **Blanket** in that past autumn/winter leftovers sale, after I'd been seeking **Cozy** for *ever*! I adore Poesie's cardamom note (see also **Comfort** and **Cardigan** and **Lagniappe X** below) so of course this one's been on my wishlist since I first heard of it. Does **Cozy** have too few notes? Probably. But I don‚Äôt care - it's vibrant spiced cardamom and a snuggly, buttery vanilla, and I am happy. On my Poesie cardamom enjoyment scale, this falls below **Comfort** \\[Toasted cardamom pods, pink peppercorn, precious resins, sandalwood flower, cashmere blankets, warm vanilla musk\\] and just above **Cardigan** \\[Creamy Mysore sandalwood spiced with cardamom pods & pimento berries, French vanilla, white chocolate, comforting sweater musk\\].\n\n**Crowned** \\[A clean blend of lavender, mint and grapefruit, fluffy marshmallow, royal sandalwood\\] - This one strongly features the typical Poesie vanilla musk base, so if you don't like that or it doesn't really work on your skin, this might be one to skip past, but if you do like that base (like me!), this is an absolutely gorgeous scent that feels so quintesentially \"Poesie\". Over that fluffy marshmallow-y vanilla musk base are Poesie's warm, fuzzy sandalwood note (gosh I love their sandalwood), the soft herbal of the lavender and mint, and just a touch of grapefruit citrus vibrancy.\n\n**Emmeline Pankhurst** \\[Black tea swirled with vanilla cream, cold rain on stone, soft linen, cozy musk\\] - Okay, so Poesie's black tea not *is* as good as everyone says, but my actual success with their tea-focused scents has varied. **Twice to Tea** \\[A strongly brewed cup of Earl Grey tea delicately infused with all natural lavender absolute, sweetened with vanilla syrup, and lightened with a splash of milk\\] *really* doesn't work for me; **Always Time for Tea** \\[Countless cups of black tea loaded with cream, treacle tarts, mini strawberry jam tarts\\] also didn't work, and I'm still debating about **Opening Chapter** (see below), but **Emmeline Pankhurst** is my holy grail cozy tea scent. It's the perfect rainy day tea perfume - the gorgeous Poesie tea note is underlaid by the familiar vanilla musk base, giving it a hint of sweetness without being overwhelming. Even without looking at the notes list, I could make out the linen and stone notes too, which together make this perfume a paradoxical combination of cozy and reserved. Sadly, it doesn't last more than a few magical hours. If this comes back around in this spring's Reissue, I will absolutely upsize this one (this year I got an Ajevie slonk).\n\n**French Kiss** \\[Marshmallowy vanilla meringue kisses swirled with blueberry jam\\] - This one is a highly artificial blueberry note, at least on my skin. Paired with the meringue, it's blueberry candy but with an interesting hit of lemon zest for vibrancy, which I didn't expect but rather enjoyed. However, for a springtime blueberry scent I vastly prefer **Nui Cobalt Robin's Egg** \\[Dainty forget-me-nots and lily of the valley, a dollop of whipped blueberry creme, and a cozy birch nest tucked into a flowering dogwood tree\\], so I ended up destashing this one.\n\n**Goblin King** \\[Crystal candy balls, mossy labyrinth walls, a cup of Earl Grey tea, marshmallow, pumpkin pie, a spicy dance, leather pants, a sigh\\] - This one came as a mystery freebie with everybody's Ghosts & Goblins order - it had the name on the vial but no notes announced, and teased a forthcoming Labyrinth-themed release (and I still think we're going to get a whole Labyrinth collection in 2023). Based on my initial sniffs in the vial, I guessed the notes for this mystery sample were tiare flower (or at least something floral), lime blossom (I got a citrus note that wasn't lemon or lime), and suede. I'm actually quite pleased with my guess! On my skin, the bergamot becomes obvious; it's the same as in **Twice to Tea**. Happily, without the milky notes of **Twice to Tea**, **Goblin King** doesn't go all sour on me. The greenish floral note I got in my first guess was definitely the moss, which is damp and flowery for the first hour or so before this note dissipates. It dries down to a heavily bergamot-scented, suede-like rather than sharp or smoky leather.\n\n**Introverted Goblin** \\[Chai tea with extra cardamom, a cozy stack of old books, marshmallow, sweet pumpkin flesh enrobed in warm pumpkin spice\\] - Pumpkin and chai spices with EXTRA CARDAMOM, over the Poesie marshmallow base? Sign me up!! I couldn't commit to a blind-bought full-size, so I ordered an Ajevie sample and crossed my fingers that I wouldn't regret missing out on the chance to buy a full bottle. Marshmallow and pumpkin make a fluffy, creamy base. Above it are beautiful baking spices (fellow cardamom lovers will want to know that cardamom is definitely here, but not nearly as prominent as in **Cardigan** or **Comfort** or **Cozy**). The \"old books\" notes is here as a strongly-present but gentle and velvety leather. I'm not one for leather notes, but Poesie is slowly convincing me that theirs works for me, in **Tempus Fugit** especially, and also in **Myself Invisible** (see below, for both of these). **Introverted Goblin** blooms beautifully over the next few hours of wear, the creamy pumpkin coming a bit more forward. This one is a gorgeous cozy autumnal scent and one I'm enjoying very much, but also to my great relief, it's not among my very most favorite Poesies, which is good because it was so limited and I didn't get a chance to try it until now, after the collection had come down (so I can't buy any more unless it comes back next fall).\n\n**Just Like Heaven** \\[Delicate lavender, heavenly marshmallow accord, resinous incense\\] - Right when I first apply it, there's a sort of green, snipped stems aroma. As that starts to dry down, it becomes smoked lavender. About half an hour in, the notes balance out - herbal lavender and a smoky incense on a bed of powdery marshmallows. I should note that this is *very* different from **Stereoplasm Lavender Scarab** \\[Golden amber, English lavender, blackberry, incense\\] even though it shares the lavender and incense notes over a sweeter base - **Lavender Scarab** is quite warm and fuzzy, and the golden amber almost pumpkin-y in its creaminess, while **Just Like Heaven** is much more herbal and smoky.\n\n**Lagniappe X** \\[Creamy vanilla custard, golden amber, fragrant vanilla pods soaked in fine cognac, a plume of church incense, rich sandalwood, curls of dark chocolate, marshmallows, organic cardamom, and warm pink peppercorn\\] - This one is sweeter than I tend to like, hovering right around the line of being too gourmand for me, but because it's not imitating a specific dessert, it works for me, and the sugariness dies down a bit as it dries, to be replaced by the pink peppercorn. Amazingly, every single one of the notes can be distinguished if you look for it. There's a *lot* to it, lots of notes here - Husband sniffed it and said, \"it's kind of piled up, isn't it?\" - and although I wonder if it might be even better if it had fewer notes and was a little more directed, I also see what Joelle was going for here, with this mix of her ten favorite notes. There's something so enthusiastically celebratory about this scent, warm and sweet and spiced and undeniably golden. With my great love of vanilla, incense, the distinctive Poesie sandalwood note, and especially CARDAMOM, it's inevitable that I would fall hard for this one (despite the gourmand-ness of the custard and cognac), and I blind-bought a full-size in full confidence that I would adore it - as indeed I do!\n\n**Marble Kiss** \\[Gorse blossom, pink marshmallow, sweet sandalwood incense, a wedding coronet of orange blossom, white iris, and rose de mai\\] - Absolute, sublime gorgeousness. This is the same milky sandalwood base as my beloved **Comfort** and in **Crowned**, but instead of spicy warm cardamom as the accent (as in **Comfort**) or the herbal + citrus of **Crowned**, here the sandalwood is joined by herbal gorse and some velvety florals, and a bit of extra sweetness from the marshmallow.\n\n**Mure** \\[Juicy, ripe blackberries picked straight from the vine\\] - Stunningly realistic blackberries! Juicy and sweet, tempered by some tartness, acidity, and astringency. There's not a lot of depth to this one - it's very linear and smells basically the same throughout its whole wear - but it's a fantastic layering note, one I've already been playing around with in colder weather but I think it's going to truly sine in summer.\n\n**Myself Invisible** \\[Stacked books, spilled ink, black tea, shy violets hiding deep in the forest\\] - It really is ink! I didn't know that I knew what ink smelled like, but as soon as you apply this, it's immediately obvious. This is a spectacular and completely unisex \"dark academia\" scent. It's a poet in a flowing shirt frowning over their quill by candlelight as they pen a poem to their beloved. Behind the dark, swirling ink is a handful of fresh violets, and behind that is a hint of leather, which I recognize from **Tempus Fugit** (see below). This is 100% going in the \"dark academia\" section of my autumn scents, which interestingly enough (though it's perhaps not surprising, given last year's Quill & Ink collection) is comprised mostly of Poesies - my other Poesie perfumes in this category are **Firelight Study**, **Yet To Be Written**, and **Wicked Ghost** (and then the non-Poesies are **Nui Cobalt Black Squirrel** and **Nui Cobalt Spectral Spidersilk**). I'm super thrilled to have finally had the chance to try **Myself Invisible**; it caught my eye early in my indie perfume journey and I finally got one as the freebie with my Poesie order for Reissue leftovers this past summer. As for longevity on my skin, this one is especially low even for Poesie, gone within just a few hours.\n\n**Opening Chapter** \\[A generous cup of steaming Darjeeling tea, a rainy day, a pile of old books all your own\\] - This one is definitely in the same family as **Emmeline Pankhurst**, with Poesie's lovely tea note and underlying vanilla musk. This one, though, is much grassier, with an almost tobacco-like chew to it. This scent is sort of on probation, waiting for me to see if I reach for it when I have so many other black tea scents I love. (Thus far, it has not been getting any love, so it's a candidate to join my destash list.)\n\n**Perfect Happiness** \\[Crisp green tea, slices of wedding cake topped with coconut, a hint of mint + ginger, white sandalwood\\] - This was a swap gift and honestly, I wouldn't have picked it out for myself - I don't actively dislike any of the notes, but they didn't stick out to me as something I'd want to try. And that's the beauty of gifts and freebies, isn't it - someone else can help you discover things you never would have otherwise. This is absolutely gorgeous: vanilla with a distinctly white cake flavor, paired with coconut, mint, and ginger, and creamy sandalwood making it smooth, and just a bit of grassy green tea for that little something extra. It's a perfect summer scent.\n\n**Rich Ghost** \\[Iso E Super, ruby red grapefruit, rich sandalwood, golden threads of saffron, a hint of jasmine perfume, grey musk, warm amber, marshmallow\\] - This perfume smells mad expensive, all musk and sandalwood and amber and effervescent grapefruit. I know a lot of us were worried when grapefruit was a last-minute addition to the notes list, but truly, I don't get a separate citrus note from this, just a general brightness, like when you add a splash of lemon juice when cooking just to brighten up the flavors with that acid, but the end result doesn't taste like lemon. This scent isn't fizzy, but could almost be - it feels like a glass of champagne in a really fancy, shimmery dress. Marshmallow doesn't come out until several hours later, when it pops its head out as the base to this perfume, but I couldn't smell it until the top notes had left - which makes this a little strange as a Poesie Ghost given that they're all constructed on a marshmallow base, but here the marshmallow really isn't apparent, at least not for a long while. I'm loving this one; it feels undeniably sophisticated (dare I say \"mainstream\"?) and I have a humorous worry that I am not cultivated enough for this scent.\n\n**Selene** \\[Magnolia grandiflora, moon musk, calming clouds\\] - Husband, sniffing my wrist, gets a distinct saltwater note, and characterizes this as \"moonlight on the beach.\" Meanwhile I get a very pretty, powdery soap, that opens with an almost-citrus note (though I can't quite identify what type of citrus) but then goes more floral as it dries. It's pretty although rather nondescript.\n\n**Shy Ghost** \\[Milky chai laced with warm spices and sweet vanilla is topped with a dollop of whipped cream\\] - It's definitely in the same family as **Cozy** with its combination of vanilla and gentle spice. **Shy Ghost** goes on with that familiar and lovely Poesie vanilla musk base, with an unexpected but short-lived burst of something almost like citrus, then settles into - well, they're exactly right to call this a \"milky chai.\" Where **Cozy** is a fat, buttery vanilla with spicy wonderful cardamom, **Shy Ghost** is a very milky vanilla and a more muted blend of chai spices - I get cardamom and nutmeg and maybe some allspice, but no cinnamon, pepper, clove, or ginger. It's incredibly cozy and I love it! In truth, if you have **Cozy** or **Comfort** or maybe even **Cardigan**, you may not need **Shy Ghost** \\- it's not that different in overall effect - unless like me you are a fiend for snuggly cardamom scents, in which case **Shy Ghost** is a must for your collection.\n\n**Sleepy Ghost** \\[Marshmallow pillows sprinkled with natural lavender essential oil and absolute for sweet dreams\\] - It's really gentle and exceptionally lovely. This herbal lavender has no astringency or sharpness whatsoever to it, but almost an undertone of smooth, gentle incense (as in **Stereoplasm Lavender Scarab** \\[Golden amber, English lavender, blackberry, incense\\]). The marshmallow is fluffy and powdery but not overly sugary. It's perfect as a comforting sleep scent.\n\n**Sweet Sleep** \\[Caramelized pumpkin flesh, pumpkin pie spices, creamy vanilla, blonde woods, natural lavender essential oil and absolute\\] - This one is creamy pumpkin pie with a kiss of lavender. In comparison to several other houses' pumpkin + lavender scents (comparative review post coming soon!), **Sweet Sleep** is primarily the pumpkin and spices, with a sweet (not bitter or herbal) lavender behind it. It doesn't morph much as it wears, and it's perfectly lovely but not my favorite of Poesie's snuggly autumn scents. I actually do prefer **Introverted Goblin** over this one.\n\n**Tempus Fugit** \\[Precious sandalwood, spilled blackberry wine, wheels of golden amber, antique lace, a forgotten rose pressed in the pages of an ancient leather-bound book\\] - I bought a decant and it immediately became my holy grail blackberry + sandalwood scent, and I'm so thankful that they then let me buy the rest of their bottle! It opens with that familiar and lovely Poesie vanilla musk base, then blossoms into tart, juicy blackberry, velvety golden amber, and the Poesie sandalwood note I love so much in **Comfort** and **Amaterasu** \\[Golden sandalwood incense, rice milk, bright cardamom, amber, dry wheat, and sunflowers\\] - three extraordinarily different takes on sandalwood, all of them stunning. If I could only remember who recently convinced me to give this a try by promising that the leather wasn't prominent, I would give you a flying hug, because this is amazing, I love it so much, and I'm so grateful to have been introduced to another true love.\n\n**Wicked Ghost** \\[Innocent marshmallow encompassed in glowing black amber and resinous incense smoke\\] - This black amber has more labdanum than my usual favorite amber (golden), but it is tempered by the sweet, powdery marshmallow so that the scent isn't overwhelmingly dark but just a *little* wicked. I don't get much incense on its own, but it definitely contributes a bit to the overall glowing, resinous quality.\n\n# Final thoughts:\n\n* If you're looking for cozy and snuggly, try **Blanket** or **Emmeline Pankhurst** or **Sleepy Ghost**\n* If you're a cardamom fiend like me, look for **Cozy** or **Lagniappe X** or **Shy Ghost**\n\n# Where these all landed in my collection:\n\nFall:\n\n* **Black Cat Cuddles** and **Goblin King** are in the \"Not pumpkin\" subsection\n* **Introverted Goblin** is in the \"Cozy\" subsection\n* **Sweet Sleep** is in the \"Pumpkins\" subsection\n* **Myself Invisible** and **Wicked Ghost** are in the \"Dark academia\" subsection\n* **Shy Ghost** is in the \"Chai\" subsection\n* **Tempus Fugit** is in the \"Blackberry, blackcurrant, and wine\" subsection\n\nWinter:\n\n* **Selene** is in the \"Fancy soap in winter\" subsection\n\nSpring:\n\n* **Marble Kiss** is in the \"Pastels\" subsection\n\nSummer:\n\n* **Perfect Happiness** is in my \"Summer\" section (uncategorized)\n* **Mure** is in the \"Summer fruits\" subsection\n\nAll year 'round:\n\n* **Sleepy Ghost** is in my \"Lavender & chamomile\" section\n* **Just Like Heaven** is in my \"Rainy day\" section\n* **Emmeline Pankhurst** and **Opening Chapter** are in my \"Tea\" section\n* **Blanket** and **Lagniappe X** are in my \"Snuggly\" section\n* **Cozy** is in my \"Cardamom\" section\n* **Rich Ghost** is in my \"Silk & sophisticated\" section\n* **Crowned** is in my \"Herbals\" section\n* **French Kiss** was destashed\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would love to hear if you've had similar - or vastly different! - experiences with any of these, or if I've inspired you to seek out a few new-to-you Poesie scents!",

    "body": "I'm trying to do a low-buy month, so I'm reviewing a bunch of samples and bottles I've been resting and testing!\n\n**ALKEMIA**\n\nI *love* this house. I have had some misses with it: the cake note in Gateux Anniversaire goes mayonnaisey, the ambers (in Ghost Fire) are sometimes waxy, and some scents I have trouble picking up. But the hits are AMAZING and some of my all-time favorites, (Silken Tent! La Belle Epoque! Sigil!). Also, whoever picks their free samples is a psychic wizard, which always makes placing an order exciting. I placed this order mainly because I was excited to check out a bunch of their Arcanum Experiments -- they're only $9 for a 5 mL!!\n\n***Sigil*** *- A recipe in an ancient 16th century grimoire that includes olibanum frankincense, lignum aloes, bdellium, styrax, black honey, and euphorbium; the essence of \"Stones of Immortality\" - opium thebaicum, dried citrus, and the quintessence of gold; and an alchemist's compounding of coffee beans and ritual herbs.*\n\nWOOO! This is a somewhat intimidating list of notes, but I learned a lot from looking them up! And true to description, this is a very complex scent. When wet Sigil has a fizzy aldehydic quality a lot of Alkemia scents have for me, but that exits on dry down, leaving this a truly gorgeous nnnf sorry I'm huffing my arm again. It's so well blended -- I can pick out opium and dried citrus, but otherwise it's a sweet haze of witchy incense. It's everything that's great about my favorite Alkemia perfumes -- it is beautifully complex, rich, delicious, and not too overwhelming. This was a free sample I received with my order, and I wound up full-sizing.\n\n6/5 Magic potions üß™üß™üß™üß™üß™üß™\n\n***Ambre Caramelise*** *- Gourmand ambre blanc caramelized with slow, seductive swirls of brown sugar.*\n\nThis is lovely! I like but didn't love Ghost Fire (Alkemia's very popular white amber) -- it was really faint on my skin. But this is a soft, sweet skin scent, really everything I wanted from Ghost Fire. I can faintly detect an ambery waxiness after a few hours, but it's not prominent and doesn't bother me. There's something that reminds me of a sunscreen I used to have (I have this experience a lot with perfumes that are a bit caramelly... now if I could just remember what the sunscreen was...).\n\n3/5 Nostalgic beach days üèñüèñüèñ\n\n***Vanille Patchouli*** *- Innocence lost. Purest vanilla seduced and despoiled by wild, dirty patchouli.*\n\nI had Alkemia's Smoke and Mirrors because I loved the sample I got, but after a few wears I realized it was too much smoke for me in a perfume  -- it was amazingly realistic, just too strong for me to use on my body. Vanille Patchouli is like 5% of that woodsmoke and 95% chewy vanilla patchouli goodness. It definitely hits that chocolatey-patchouli level because of how rich the patch is, and it laaaaasts. Gorgeous. I wish this came in a lotion and a shampoo.\n\n5/5 Elegant hippies ‚òÆÔ∏è‚òÆÔ∏è‚òÆÔ∏è‚òÆÔ∏è‚òÆÔ∏è\n\n***July Monthly Alchemy*** *- A summery evening of night blooming jasmine, moonflowers, and a hint of stargazer lilies bathed in clean moonlit musks, fresh green aldehydes, and soft white sandalwood*\n\nI was excited about this one -- I nudged my order up to $50 to get it, because I love jasmine and moonflower. It is indeed very pretty and crisp! But it made me realize that what makes a floral a real knockout for me is a sweet base, whether that's honey or vanilla or sugar. I'm going to try layering this with some sweeter scents -- I think I'll wear it on its own on especially hot days.\n\n3/5 Lightning bugs at dusk üí°üí°üí°\n\n***Arcanum Experiments #4*** *- A floriographic tussy-mussy of late spring flowers - Peonies; Honeysuckle; Magnolias; Wisteria blooms; Alyssum; Lily of the valley; Apple blossoms; Linden flowers with splashes of Silver Needle tea*\n\nI love honeysuckle -- it's one of my top 5 favorite notes -- but it's hopelessly lost in the garden here. This was unfortunately too floral for me. It smells astringently, sneezily vintage, and didn't morph much on my skin.\n\n1/5 Garden parties üå∏\n\n***Arcanum Experiments #7*** *- Medieval saffron honeycake; Black cardamon; Nutmeg; Scottish oatcakes; Saxon lemon tart; Penydes; and a splash of Mead*\n\nThis was a fun one, and I was surprised by how much I liked it -- it's much less gourmandy than I expected, and the mead only lends some honey, no alcohol. This reminds me of a comforting holiday season tea. I bet I'll be coming back to it in the fall and winter.\n\n3.5/5 Caledonian feasts üçØüçØüçØ\n\n***Arcanum Experiments #10*** *- Soft summer rain; Gentle ozone rising from a waterfall; Fae aldehydes; Tumbling meadow streams*\n\nI've been on a search for a good marine aquatic, and though this doesn't technically fit the bill, this is actually quite close to what I've been wanting! It's incredibly fresh and blue without punching me in the sinuses as some aquatics do. The aldehydes are very present when it's wet, but they float off within an hour or so.\n\n3/5 Gently babbling brooks üíßüíßüíß\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BPAL**\n\nBPAL was my first foray into perfume, really, and I dearly love so much about them. The gothiness! The label art! The red musks! The white florals! The incenses! This is definitely the house I've dived most deeply into, and I've fallen in love with their honeysuckles, vanillas, lilacs, dragon's bloods, and Laces. I found their Antique Lace to be a little plasticky, and there are certain florals that are a bit sneezy/astringent, but for the most part they range from In Love to Meh for me.\n\n\\*The Lilac Wood (2021) - Ageless trees, everblooming flowers, brilliant grass, a flicker of fireflies, and soft shadows.\\*Like my cherry hunt, I've been on the lookout for lilac perfumes ever since encountering BPAL's gorgeous how-is-this-not-a-fresh-bouquet Hotaru No Yu HG (lilac and jasmine and honeysuckle and amber). And there's no lilac in these notes, but it felt like a safe bet from the title!\n\nThis isn't my dream of Hotaru No Yu but perfume.... but it's close! It's very fresh and green -- the grass note is pretty prominent, and I definitely pick up lilac and a breath of white floral too (peony, maybe?). I layered this with Every Day You Play With the Light of The Universe, a slightly sweet and powdery honeysuckle beauty, and it was very flouncy fairy princess.\n\n3/5 Fairy dusts üßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Elf* \\- *Pale golden musk, honeycomb, amber, parma violet, hawthorne bark, aspen leaf, forest lily, life everlasting, white moss, and a hint of wild berry.*\n\nA sweet honeyed violet, innocent and lovely. The florals and greens are very much to the background of the violets, musk, and honey, but after I've been wearing this for a while the berries come out. It's gorgeous, and so true to what an elf might smell like (I generally recommend BPAL's entire RPG line, it's a lot of fun!)\n\n5/5 Lembas bread picnics üßù‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßù‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßù‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßù‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßù‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Beholder Optician - A clear, glassy scent, translucent and blushing, that will bring your world into sharp focus: eucalyptus leaf, white amber, pink bergamot, strawberry, and sheer, crystalline vanilla musk.*\n\nI got a sample of this, because I love BPAL's vanillas and musks and wanted to see how their strawberry was! This was very foody to me -- like an herbal strawberry juice, in the same family as some strawberry-basil drinks I've had. There is indeed a fascinating glassy... coolness? I think it's coming from the eucalyptus, which comes on strong and then drifts in and out. I would really like this in a soap or shampoo/hair gloss, I think, but it's not something I'd reach for regularly as perfume.\n\n3/5 Nice pairs of glasses ü§ìü§ìü§ì\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The Unicorn (2021) - Frosty lilac petals, iris pallida root, orris, violet leaf, white chocolate, coconut, wild lettuce, white sandalwood, white gardenia and oakmoss.*\n\nI had very high hopes for this one, given my warm feelings about lilac! But this was sadly a no go for me, thanks to the lettuce and oakmoss. It smells like you're eating a damp salad, and someone nearby is eating a really wonderful chocolate ice cream sundae. But you have the damp salad!! :,( A very weird experience, in a not-great way -- this is going on the destash list.\n\n1 of 5 Medieval tapestries ü¶Ñ\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Tombeur - Deadly and seductive: vanilla-infused sandalwood, blood musk, antique patchouli, vetiver, lavender, bitter almond, amber, and a trickle of Snake Oil.*\n\nI picked this baby up in my hunt for something that's as close as possible to BPAL's standby, Snake Oil, which has been out of stock for a little while. I like all the additional notes here save for bitter almond, but thankfully it doesn't make too much of an appearance -- this is a very heady, dark purple scent that's got an interesting candy-like quality I wasn't expecting from the notes! I like it very much.\n\n4/5 Bodice rippers üßõ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßõ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßõ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßõ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Lyonesse - Golden vanilla and gilded musk, stargazer lily, white sandalwood, grey amber, elemi, orris root, ambergris and sea moss.*\n\nBecause I'm a lover of BPAL vanillas (and Zorya Polunochnaya in particular), I've been recommended Lyonesse a few times. But to me this is mainly an aquatic (fitting, as the inspiration is a sunken city!). Reading the other reviews of it, I've seen it described as a vanilla, a floral-resin, an aquatic, and amber-forward, so I think this is one that changes substantially according to skin chemistry. Wet it smells a lot like soap with a shimmery vanilla overtone, and as it dries the lily comes up and the mossy sea smells fall away until it's a, dunh dunh dunh: very clean, very light powdery floral-resin! It is very pretty, but I wouldn't class it as a vanilla, personally. I definitely get the parallel to Zorya P; this is like its older, golder cousin.\n\n3/5 Sunken cities üè∞üè∞üè∞\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**NAVA**\n\nI've tried a bunch of Nocturne Alchemy's vanilla standbys (Crystalline variants, Eternal Ankh), and have dabbled in their other scents (Callisto, Nefertiti, Selene). I haven't explored them too widely, and I wanted to try some of their fruitier scents with this order. I feel like the hit rate of this house for florals and woods is kind of low for me -- everything I've tried from them is capital-R Rich and seems to need a good bit of resting time. I'm happy I dipped into their fruitier options this time, because I discovered a major hit!\n\n***Edinburgh -*** *Blood Ripe Raspberry Scotch, Green Heather Tea, Black Vanilla, Spun Sugar, Sweet Meringue and a dusting of soil under a Hazelnut tree.*\n\nRaspberry is one of my favorite flavors, but I have never tried it in a perfume! And oh, I'm so happy I did. Though the notes are \"Raspberry scotch\" and \"Heather tea,\" my brain says \"Raspberry iced tea\". I was a bit worried about this being too sweet, but I think the heather and the soil note (both of which are really subtle!) pull it back from the edge. It's a really fun scent -- it doesn't strike me as Very Gourmand, but also it makes my mouth water, and I think that's because the raspberry is very true to life. It also reminds me of Snapple's Raspberry Iced Tea.\n\n5/5 Childhood memories of stealing the neighbor's raspberries üíúüíúüíúüíúüíú\n\n***Cherry Santalum -*** *Rich Egyptian Cherry Essence, creme of Vanilla Bean, Studio Limited - Santalum and a soft stirring of exotic Cacao.*\n\nI've recently fallen in love with a very cherry heavy, expensive, mainstream perfume, so I've been branching out to see if I can find an indie that suits.This has a Christmas tree overtone to it that is baffling to me! There's also the nose-chill that comes with vetiver, but without the depth and darkness of vetiver that I enjoy, so I'm unsure what's doing that (perhaps the santalum?). It's not cherry forward at all -- if I didn't know better I'd say the notes were pine and vetiver and sweet vanilla. It's not wholly unpleasant, but not what I'm after.\n\n1/5 Surprise! Pine trees üå≤\n\n***Haunted Parlor -*** *Aged Vanilla Oak, Cedar, Teak and Sandalwood Essential Oils, Black Cherry Wax, Ripe Cherry Flesh, Chocolate Essence and Vanilla Velvet.*\n\nSee above, this was another cherry experiment. This one is very woodsy when wet, with teak predominating. It's not too sweet. Teak notes almost always smell a little funky to me...damp, I think is the right word... and this one does, too. But that goes away and this rounds out into a spiced wood as it dries. It is atmospheric; would spray over my centuries-old rug and gilded armchairs, but I don't know that I'll reach for it to wear. No cherry or chocolate to be found for me.\n\n2/5 Creaking antique breakfronts üèöüèö\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Blue Egypt -*** *Egyptian Blue Lavender Essential Oil, Manuka Lavender, Egyptian and Indian Chamomile Essential Oil, Aloe Vera Absolute, Egyptian Blue Vanilla Bean Whole, Palmerosa Absolute, Languid Lavender Cider and a drop each of Angelica Root and Valerian Root.*\n\nThis was a fun one, because it was a freebie and I couldn't find its description on the website for a little while, so I went in cold. I'm a big lavender fan, and this is a very gorgeous lavender -- not too herby or sharp, nor too sweet or cloying. All of the notes in here shine like I'm sniffing a tea sachet. I'll be trying this as a sleep scent.\n\n4/5 Soothing cups of tea üçµüçµüçµüçµ",

I thought I was crazy because all the reviews I saw on the BPAL forums kept talking about the lilac and the chocolate and the sandalwood, but I just got lettuce! So sad üò≠",

    "body": "I thought I would make a post here as it's a great resource for motivation and optimism as well as ideas for things to try to help. I really freaked myself out when long covid hit me and my symptoms were at their worst on my reddit/internet deep dives. \n\nI got sick in July '23 (my first time ever testing positive and I had let my vaccination lapse because I guess I thought I might be immune lol). I took paxlovid and started testing negative after about 6 days and I had a trip planned so I went.... for a day of tubing and drinking. I ended up basically getting sick again for another week. \n\nI tried to get back into my activities and workout routine but couldn't get even close and was feeling really worn down. I had a lot of stuff going on and some stressful work events and I kind of crashed for a few days. Got back out there, then crashed again after an hour bike ride and cleaning my bathroom and a stressful family event. I was in the push crash cycle for August/September/October. Also daily headache, increased migraines, some autonomic stuff like high heart rate and blood pooling, dizziness. Doing less each time and triggering worse PEM. Also a TON of grief and anxiety and frustration.\n\n In mid October I gave up on all activity except work and taking care of myself. I gave myself permission to REST aggressively/radically.  I was very lucky to have a supportive boyfriend who helped me with things like changing sheets, doing dishes, bringing me some meal prepped food. I didn't clean my apartment for 3 months, I started doing grocery pickup. I also sprained my neck doing a stretch which was a whole additional layer- after a basic blood work and being told by my doc there was nothing they could really do except wait and see, I focused further medical efforts on dealing with my neck injury/coathanger pain/constant headaches. I was also diagnosed with occipital neuralgia. \n\nI have been on an upward trajectory SO SLOWLY since December.  I thought I'd list out all the things I did that I feel helped. I have a general theory that our bodies/nervous systems are both physically inflamed and also in fight/flight/freeze from the physical and mental stress. Anything you can do to support the body and mind's natural healthy processes to heal/detox/relax is going to help, even if it only moves the needle .0000001%. Then it's up to time and of course your own unique health situation.\n\nI'm able to walk for like half an hour right now, more if I can take breaks/go slow. I'm doing PT/light body weight exercises a couple times a week, hitting the pool sometimes and swimming about 12 minutes right now. I can easily grocery shop most of the time, I can socialize and drink (though hangovers are worse haha). It feels like huge relief to be back in the world and not SCARED of what will happen. I may have new limits or needs moving forward and that feels ok to me- I've always had anxiety, ADHD, fatigue, burnout issues. I'm optimistic that I'll continue to improve and that life is a journey. There will be low time and high times forever. My challenge now is continuing to stay motivated to support myself so I don't start picking up bad patterns again!  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#1 MOVEMENT/PACING- After letting myself rest hard for about 6 weeks (still working hybrid model but did have some vacation and sick time) I started by just walking down the block and back. After a week, add another block. Get up to 5 min, then 10 min, then 2x 10 min. I found that frequent rests are key. As someone with ADHD I always want to finish a task completely because I believe I will get distracted if I stop. But you can wash half the dishes and sit down. If you can't walk 12 min at once, maybe you can walk 6 in the morning and 6 in the evening. And you really have to understand your body's cues- it's ok for example to make your symptoms 2 points worse on a 10 point scale but any further and you need to stop immediately. This is not graded exercise therapy. And 2 points worked for me it might be 1 or 3 for you. You don't want to trigger a massive crash but if you're tired, or need to lie down, that's ok. Expanding capacity happens so slowly.\n\n1b. Lymphatic drainage via movement- I did several lymphatic drainage techniques from youtube including Perrin technique and all triggered PEM/crash. I think getting your lymph moving is key but doing it yourself is risky and your body is in a weak sensitive state. This is where the importance of movement comes in again- to get your lymph/fascia/blood/digestion all moving. Yin or gentle yoga, physical therapy, \"floor time\" as I called it just to get out of the laying down position. Going on a walk, doing a little self massage. A gentle scrub in the shower with a washcloth (I'm sorry if you can't shower- my daily shower is the main thing keeping me going lol).  \n\n\\#2 Zoloft- Yes another one on the antidepressants. Initially it was because I was struggling with my mental health in the face of all these issues, but it does help with anxiety and may be good for inflammation too. \n\n\\#3 ELECTROLYTES (and to an extent, minerals generally)- I do not crave plain water but even a pinch of sea salt will make it gulpable for me. I used to think they were too expensive to use regularly- but health is wealth. I drink electrolyte mixes daily and it does wonders for my energy and well being. I like Redmond Relyte the best and it's cheap if you go per serving. Also love gatorlyte, nuun is good. Lots of magnesium!!!\n\n\\#4 Mindset/Relaxation- Tried some meditations, some yoga nidras, really allowing myself to acknowledge and feel rather than avoid or suppress. I used exercise for this previously so I really had to carve out quiet brain time deliberately. Honorable mention here to reducing screens, circadian rhythm, sunlight, good sleep hygiene type stuff. My partner helped me a lot with realizing that my worth is not tied to my productivity or what I can do for others. It was a real breakthrough that allowed me to rest and take care of myself and be NICER to myself. Also, I kept any entertainment I consumed light and familiar, and felt very supported by listening to all the Harry Potters and rereading all the Anne of Green Gables books. Young adult content is great for fighting the good fight, dealing with grief and loss, finding your identity, and learning right/wrong. There are so many options for brain retraining/support- I just did whatever I felt called to.\n\n\\#5 Other vitamins- Fish oil, b complex (this is helping nerve damage from 3 years ago so I think I must have been really lacking), D, lysine (taking for cold sores but also antiviral effects and it's cheap), Vit C, probiotics, occasional melatonin. Nothing too groundbreaking here. Just added a multi, and I don't take all these every day. I still have quercetin and monolaurin on the shelf untried- I've taken a very slow pace to trying new supplements.\n\n\\#6 Diet/Whole Foods- Focus on eating a shit ton of protein and eat until full. I was eating a lot of diet foods and tracking calories and I dropped all that- not worth it. Why stress your body further. I increased my veggies, full fat dairy, whole grains, legumes, spices, teas. As much color and variety as possible. Food is medicine- big shout out to coconut oil. cooking with coconut oil always makes me feel better (antiviral/antimicrobial) but I had stopped due to high cholesterol. Also bought myself a juicer so I can get big doses on things I don't eat as much (beets, ginger, citrus, pineapple, fruits in general). Plus fermented food (booch, yogurt, kraut)\n\n\\#7 Physical therapy and Blair Technique Chiro - PT is usually great but I was not improving on my neck issues after a month so they recommended adding Blair Chiro- specifically a neck focused \"no crack\" technique. Those adjustments made a HUGE difference in my headaches/neck pain healing progression. I legit could not hold my own head up all day starting out. I include these because I think neck/spine/body dysfunction can be part of the package, and my PT also does a lot of training on breathing properly- another big issue people have these days. And they got me moving too!\n\nHonorable mentions to compression socks, my neck heating pad, my theracane and foam roller, hot showers with lavender essential oil, decaf green tea, advil, aleve, biofreeze, dr bronners magic balm, hugs, grocery pickup, sex (eyoooh), and countless other little things that improve general quality of life and probably actually target whatever is going on with long covid. \n\nSome things that didn't do much or were bad- \n\nVestibular PT - had a work up and they couldn't diagnose me with much other than general vertigo. Not BPPD or neuritis or anything. I have a sneaky suspicion a number of things were contributing to my dizziness that are all wearing off- neuroinflammation, neck dysfunction, anxiety, cold/hats triggering my occipital neuralgia (winter is over!) and possibly CBD\n\nCBD- I love CBD and I started taking it more during all this. Recently stopped as I've been doing better and I feel my dizziness has improved a lot so maybe there's a connection there. Still think it's helpful though!\n\nAntihistamines- I went on zyrtec (normally was just taking the occasional claritin) and turns out it gave me INSANE sinus pain after awhile which also triggered migraines (and a lot of tears). Took me a month or so to figure that out.\n\nFlonase- doctor told me to take this for my extreme sinus pain and it roided me out. I barely slept for like 2 nights after taking one double dose. I felt great like a week later, so much extra energy. But not worth it and not what it's for anyway. I switched to a hypertonic saline solution spray and it works great.\n\nUbiquinol gave me heart palpitations so bad.\n\nOlly stress gummies- these worked so good but I'm so nervous about messing with GABA\n\nFL-41 glasses - I think the tint helps a lot with light sensitivity/migraine but maybe the frames I got sucked because these make me so much worse if I wear them for more than an hour. \n\nRed light therapy- I got this off amazon it's the one that's like a flashlight for cold sores but I used it on my neck/head/sinuses.

        "body": "My theory echoes your experience. Try anything that gets your parasympathetic nervous system activated. Avoid anything that causes undue stress. As a trail runner, I can see on my Garmin, how my dysautonomia is effecting my HRV (tanks), HR/RHR (increased). This results in stressful unrefreshing sleep/days.\n\nThe key thing is to build up, in the bank as it were, deposits of REST and relaxation (healing mode). Then, hopefully, you give the body enough time to heal and repair itself, and eventually you'll reach a tipping point where you have built up enough time in the parasympathetic rest and digest branch that your body can start reverting to it's former self.\n\nThe parasympathetic branch of our nervous system is also anti-inflammatory, that is why it is crucial to do everything you can to connect with it. If, long Covid is caused by inflammation due to viral persistance, then getting back into 'healing mode' could allow our bodies to naturally clear out the viral debris (can last in our blood for up to 14-months according to a study published this week) from our blood.\n\nThank you for sharing your journey, I hope you make a full return to health üôè\n\nPS., \"Olly stress gummies- these worked so good but I'm so nervous about messing with GABA\", what are the dangers of taking supplemental GABA?",

The owner of Haus of Gloi posted this a couple days ago:\n\n> ‚ÄúY'all, I don't normally give in to this kind of stuff. But I want to reiterate, as I have in the past when her business was \"Haus of Haunt\" - that we are in no way affiliated with Debaucherous Bath and Body. She has lifted scent blends from myself, my good friend Tiggy at Future Primitive, Haunt (now closed I think? A shame because Erin made AMAZING stuff) and even BPAL. These days she has taken to altering blends by just a few notes to keep from crossing the line. This is just a PSA in case you were wondering.‚Äù\n\nI had heard of this brand but haven‚Äôt purchased from them myself so I was curious, and had a look at their products. Even just comparing their scents to ones that I am personally familiar with, the similarities are often glaring. Haus of Gloi seems to have been the greatest source of ‚Äòinspiration‚Äô from what I can tell (I've bolded matching/similar notes):\n\n* Aunt Hattie Maes **Sweet Potato** Pie: **Butter** rich crust, **sweet potatoes**, heavy cream, whiskey, toasted **marshmallows**\n* Haus of Gloi **Sweet Potato** Treat: **Sweet potatoes** with mild spices, **butter** and brown sugar baked off with **marshmallows**.\n* \n\n* **Lychee** Bubble **Tea**: Tapioca pearls, rooibos **tea**, **lychee fruit**, a **dash** of brown sugar and **coconut milk**.\n* Haus of Gloi **Litchi** Milk **Tea**: Tart **lychee fruit** and black **tea** met with a **splash** of **coconut milk**.\n* \n* Turkish Mocha: Rich **Turkish coffee**, dusted with **cocoa** powder, **marshmallow** creme, frothy cream and a **hazelnut** ganache.\n* Haus of Gloi Vice: Steam billows rolling off a vessel of fresh made **Turkish coffee**, **marshmallow** goo tainted by graham cracker crumbs, toasted **hazelnuts** and blanketed in black **chocolate**.\n* \n* Black Cat: **Blood oranges** and tooth achingly sweet **marshmallows**.\n* Haus of Gloi Blood Orange Marshmallow: **Blood orange** infused in rich homemade **marshmallows**.\n* \n* Grandma Lee‚Äôs **Eggnog**: Eggs, **sugar**, fresh **cream**, clove, **nutmeg**, cinnamon, grandma's special **rum**\n* Haus of Gloi **Eggnog**gin: **Cream**, **sugar** and a shot of dark **rum** topped with fresh grated **nutmeg**. \n* \n* **Arctic Wolf**: Douglas **fir**, arabian **frankincense**, a touch of white pepper, alaskan cranberries, arctic **snow**, green amber, **woods**y **vanilla**.\n* Haus of Gloi **Snow Wolf**: Three howling **fir**s, white **frankincense**, **vanilla** bean husk, tainted by droplets of blood **cedar**.\n* \n* **Debaucherous Amber**: Rich, deep and resinous blend of golden, black, and red ambers. Sweet, musky and woody.\n* Haus of Gloi **Haus Amber**: Rich and sultry amber, our own hand blended accord.\n* \n* Alice's Nightmare in Wonderland: Rotting **pumpkin** flesh, over**ripe peaches**, drizzled with caramel, touched with liquid black **amber**, hot butterscotch, wicked **spices** and soft hay.\n* Haus of Gloi Pumpkin Queen: Gentle hay pillows, **pumpkin**, **ripe peaches** dusted with **clove and nutmeg**, dried summer herbs and lastly, a lovely crown of **amber**.\n* \n* **Aged** Oak Barrel **Cider**: **Apples** brewed in an **oak** barrel with spices, **vanilla** beans and dark brown sugar\n* Haus of Gloi **Olde Cider** Haus: Old **oak**, sweet drying hay fields, crushed **apple** pulp and **vanilla** husks.\n* \n* Stollen: Sweet **cake** bread, **candied fruits**, orange zest, 50 year old **rum**\n* Haus of Gloi Ye Olde Cake of Fruit: Rich **brandy** soaked spice **cake** filled with **candied citron**, pecans, **candied cherries** and pineapple.\n\n\nBut several other companies also have very similar scents to some of theirs:\n\n* **Drink Me**: **Cherry tart**s, vanilla **custard**, buttery **toffee**, **hot buttered toast**, a swig of rum.\n* BPAL **Drink Me**: **cherry-tart**, **custard**, pine-apple, roast turkey, **toffee**, and **hot buttered toast**\n* \n* **Cheshire**s Grin: Rotted cranberries, pink **grapefruit**, black **currant**, peach skin, toffee and roasted nuts.\n* BPAL **Cheshire** Cat: **Grapefruit**, red **currant**, dark musk, Roman chamomile, delphinium, and lavender.\n* \n* **Cinderella's Carriage** French Heirloom **Pumpkins**, **Coconut Cream**, Sweet **Vanilla**, Benzoin and a touch of Peppercorn.\n* Cocoa Pink **Cinderella‚Äôs Carriage**: **Coconut Cream** Pie with Marshmallow Meringue, Sweet **Pumpkin**, Spiritueuse Double **Vanilla**, and **Vanilla** Bean Noel.\n* \n* Lucy **Chiffon** Tart **Lemons**, Raw Sugar Cane, White Cake with a Gardenia flavored cream filling.\n* Solstice Scents **Chiffon**: Vanilla, White Amber, White Musk & **Lemon** Myrtle EO\n* \n* Marsh**mallow** Woods Toasted **Marshmallows**, butterscotch, vanilla bean, **woods**, maple leaves, acorns\n* Solstice Scents Smoky Mountain **Mallow**: **Wood** Smoke, Fossilized Amber Resin, Lapsang Souchong CO2, **Guaiacwood**, Labdanum, Nutmeg EO, **Marshmallow**\n* \n* Cupid: White Cake, Fluffy Pink **Marshmallow Creme**, Sugared **Violets** and Tonka Bean.\n* Solstice Scents Violet Mallow: **Marshmallow Cream**, **Violet** Flowers, Vanilla Bean, White Musk\n* \n* Bella Miele: Raw golden **honey** dipped in freshly picked **honeycomb**, pieces of beeswax dropping, **toffee** and **vanilla** bean tincture adds a gentle warmth with a hint of sweetness to this fragrance. Frankincense resin and dead cedarwood give a hint of earthiness, while red **amber** adds to the sexy and alluring side.\n* Future Primitive Dark Carnival: **Honeycomb** bricks drizzled with warm **honey** & **vanilla**-infused **caramel** sauce, hot sugared walnuts, fresh coconuts from the shy and a velvet pouch of **Amber** & Tonka Bean incense to burn at midnight\n* \n* Marshmallow Lavender: Real Bulgarian **Lavender essential oil** swirled in **clouds of marshmallow fluff** with a hint of white chocolate.\n* Future Primitive Sylph: **Clouds of fluffed up Marshmallows** infused with a glug of classic **Lavender oil**.\n* \n* Big Bad Wolf: Earthy **patchouli**, woods, **sandalwood**, **leather**, spice.\n* Sugar and Spite Grim Bastard: vanilla, **sandalwood**, black **patchouli** and **leather**\n* \n* **Peppermint Bark**: **Dark Chocolate**, **White Chocolate**, and crisp bites of **mint**y candy canes.\n* Solstice Scents Chocolate **Peppermint Bark**: Milk Chocolate, Cool Pepper**mint**, **Dark Chocolate** and **White Chocolate**\n\nOf course some of these match better than others, and a few could just be the regular seasonal/typical scents we tend to see repeated.

And yeah, that's not good. Rude, to say the least. (EDIT: I googled and the notes in Drink Me are just how the taste was described in Alice in Wonderland so that's not scent plagiarism at all, that's just research)\n\nOtherwise, it's a stretch to claim they're copying or ripping off other brands. Seriously, if you're aiming for seasonal gourmands what else could you possibly expect to put in an eggnog, sweet potato treat, or peppermint bark scent? These are super common foods where I live, perfume companies don't own their scent any more than they do apple pie or smores. Plus that's actually one of the most creative variants of toasted marshmallows that I've seen.\n\nSome others have odd similarities but enough major changes that I'm willing to let it pass because they've been made into new blends entirely. Cheshires Grin obviously wasn't aiming to dupe Cheshire Cat even if it was intentionally or subconsciously lifting the grapefruit/currant combo. One of those scents is a floral citrus, the other is a fruity nutty gourmand (as far as I can tell), so they're aimed at different tastes and I don't see a real issue with that.\n\nAnd claiming Debaucherous Amber is a copy of Haus Amber is a serious stretch. Tons of companies have their own proprietary amber blends, Alkemia and NAVA included.\n\nSo maybe they started off with uninspired copycat blends. Maybe they're still looking for inspiration from other perfumeries, maybe they don't have the most creative perfumer. But honestly, if we're gonna go down the path of how many houses share similar looking blends and concepts there is a lot of territory to cover.",

So, I have no idea what is actually happening in regards to lifting ideas or riding coattails, but looking at this list I don't see a whole lot to be upset about. Maybe the BPAL ones?  \n\nThe pattern, if there is one (and I'm not seeing a whole lot of pattern, as most of these are classic foodie ideas), could be problematic. Artists pull from each other all the time, though. A few years ago Moonalisa made a perfume with corn cakes in it, and 6 months later it was everywhere. Tokyo Milk's Bittersweet is \"cake flour, dark cocoa, bronze musk and osmanthus.\" 1692's This Is Just to Say has cake flour, cocoa powder, and osmanthus in it. Is that suspicious, coincidence, or someone riffing on and attempting to improve on a theme? I have no idea. My point is that it happens all the time, and it's hard to know how or why, but I don't immediately get suspicious when it happens.  \n\nThat being said, Debaucherous has a long history of sketchiness even though the examples posted here aren't enough, in and of themselves (barring the BPAL), to give me pause.",

Or put another way - I could make a cake, and substitute salt for sugar. I can say what I've made is practically the same as the original, given it's only one ingredient different, but you can bet nobody is going to be eating that cake - that one ingredient has changed the final result completely. Also, I think with seasonal releases, there is only so much diversity we can expect - like two pumpkin perfumes released by different brands around Halloween isn't going to make me bat an eyelid - they're drawing from a similar inspiration and I don't think it's dodgy on the part of either brand to have arrived at a similar product. \n\nI think the most important part of plagiarism is an intent to copy or guarantee sales by stealing ideas from someone else, and just by comparing notes lists, we have no idea whether or not this intent is present. Release dates are also super important, otherwise you could say all of these comparisons are proof that HoG are copying rather than the other way around. \n\nThat said, reading comments here, it seems like there are many issues associated with this brand apart from just having similar perfumes, including TAT issues and getting products out. Ultimately of course it's up to the individual what reasons they decide to/not to purchase from a brand, but I honestly couldn't say I'm bothered by similar notes lists without further proof of malicious intent - TAT issues if reoccuring are a way bigger deal to me as a buyer. \n\nEdit: I just want to add since I forgot to address the first part of your post - I love HoG, and if the owner made such a claim, I do think it's a pretty serious one to make, and it doesn't seem like one that would have been made lightly. However, just based on notes lists, I don't think it's proof either way. If HoG has further proof, it would be great to know, but at this stage I just don't think we have enough info to be sure.",

    "body": "Hello there! I'm relatively new to the indie perfume scene but have really been enjoying reading people's reviews and participating in swaps, so thought I'd give my impression of the first few SS scents I've tried. Already they've shot up to being one of my favourite houses because so many things from them are lovely on me, and even things I like less I still think are enjoyable. Sadly I did catch them right before they closed temporarily but I have my eye on a lot of scents when they open back up!\n\n* **Violet Mallow** (Marshmallow Cream, Violet Flowers, Vanilla Bean, White Musk) - Ugh, gorgeous. I don't remember consciously smelling violets before this blend so I didn't know what I was getting myself into but turns out I love them. This starts really clear and clean, with the violet note being what some people might describe as green or watery (?) but the sweetness of the marshmallow quickly comes out. This makes the scent super balanced and lovely, like a sweet gentle light purple haze with no edges. I love powdery scents and this one definitely has a soft powdery feel to it. It feels so sophisticated for a marshmallow scent, and smells so well-blended. I ended up with a full size!\n\n* **Violet Truffle** (Dark Chocolate, Violet, Violet Leaf & Vanilla Absolute) - At first I was ready to hate this, because the dark chocolate is way too prominent and thick, but not in a nice sophisticated way. More like a dank, clingy chocolate, somehow. It does quickly settle and become a gorgeous, somehow fruity scent, though. I love it at this stage - it smells vaguely purple from the violet and I can still get the chocolate underneath, but mainly there's this well-blended sweet fruity note that emerges unexpectedly. I ended up keeping my FS!\n\n* **Lavender Raspberry Truffle** (White Chocolate, French Lavender, Bulgarian Lavender, Tonka, Cocoa Absolute, Raspberry) - Also gorgeous! It starts off as an unexpectedly sweet BPAL TKO-style lavender than wears off fairly quickly to reveal a really lovely tart, translucent raspberry note, with a nice round cocoa backdrop. I was worried the cocoa would be musty, but it didn't turn out like that on my skin at all. It took a lot of slathering for this one to stick around but once it did, it dried down to a lovely, again well-blended and somehow complex raspberry chocolate that seemed more beautiful and perfume-y (in a good way) than the sum of its notes. The chocolate isn't too creamy either, which I love. I want this in FS but have had no luck finding it...\n\n* **Nightgown** (Vanilla, White Chocolate, Tuberose & Tiare Flowers) - Okay, I have to preface by saying, I generally quite enjoy white florals, and tuberose in particular. So this review might not be helpful to people who find them icky haha. This blend is surprisingly bright, sweet, and fruity, considering it's marketed as a soft gentle calm scent (which I get a lot more from Violet Mallow). The white flowers here are really pulling that tropical fruity vibe more than they are a heavy/musky smell. Smells really sweet, like something that could be eaten. It's lovely but doesn't become particularly complex or change throughout. I'll keep the FS but don't love it as much as others.\n\n* **Rose Mallow Cream** (Rose absolute, Marshmallow, Strawberry Nectar, White Chocolate, Vanilla, White Musk) - I had high hopes for this one but am starting to realise that I really only like rose in very specific situations. At first this reminded me of Lush's Rose Jam - very sweet, not very floral rose. On my skin it became more like Lush's Ro's Argan body conditioner bar - rose and white chocolate! I found the chocolate slightly uncomfortably creamy on my skin at points but it didn't really bother me when I wasn't actively sniffing my hand haha. After a while some tartness from the strawberry comes out, but then it disappears again. Overall this is a fairly nice scent, but again I don't think it's particularly for me or special. Would love it if the strawberry note remained throughout!\n\n* **Lavender Vanilla** (Lavender Essential Oil & Sweet Creamy Vanilla) - I should love this, but I don't think I do. The vanilla is a bit too uncomfortably buttery for me to wear, and the lavender is slightly too astringent (minty) to my nose. It does dry down and eventually become a lovely soft lavender marshmallow, but it's not really worth the wait for me. I loved it in my oil burner though - it made my flat smell like lavender shortbread!\n\n* **Snowmint Mallow** (Peppermint, Vanilla Cake, Flaked Coconut, Sugar Cookies & Marshmallow Creme) - Again, this one was too buttery for me. Maybe the sugar cookies note? The mint is lovely and sweet but on top of the butter it's just too much minty butter cookies for me, almost cookie dough-like. I preferred it in my oil burner.\n\n* **Pinyon Truffle** (Chocolate, Pinyon Pine, Pinyon Resin, Swiss Stone Pine, Tonka, Vanilla) - This was nice! It's a beautiful pine-y chocolate, with the pine feeling very resinous, rather than minty or astringent. There are some lovely spices in there that make this smell like drinking a winter hot choc near a pine tree. Not really my thing but it's perfect if it's yours!\n\n* **Gunnerson's Pumpkin Patch** (Leaves, Vines, Autumn Air, Pumpkin Flesh, Lavender, Moss, Balsam, Tonka, Hay, Caramel, Dirt, Patchouli, Mushroom) - This was the only one I didn't like, which is a massive success rate for me! Initially it seems to be an interesting dirt-like note that I thought I could stand, but the spices quickly took over and I just smelled like musty cardboard and a health-food store. This is exactly what happened to me with BPAL Abolish ICE, and some other pumpkin scents, so I'm guessing I have a lot of spice-y death notes. For what it's worth, it wasn't disgusting, even if I don't like these kinds of scents - it managed to be bearable to have on for a while!\n\nAny feedback/questions on the reviews is very much welcome :) Or suggestions for more SS/other perfumes to try, you enablers...",

Both were FS blind buys (my first foray into the Indie world) before i knew better. However, it was all good, since I‚Äôve already re-bought both. üòç\n\nViolet Truffle is  also on my wish list for when Angela reopens. It would appear that I do love violets. LOL \n\nI do like Snowmint Mallow, too. Apparently smelling like a buttermint is a thing I like. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇAlso, my husband has an affinity for them, since they have been a favorite of his since childhood.\n\nI have an EDP sample of Rose Mallow Cream. I am like you - it‚Äôs a nice scent, but not my favorite. I think I like rose more in theory than on my skin. I do like the dry-down notes and how it softens and sweetness with wear, but not enough to move it to my heavy rotation. \n\nChiffon is a lovely lemon-vanilla scent. It‚Äôs one of my favorite ones for spring. And Estate Vanilla is TO. DIE. FOR. if you love vanilla. üíó\n\nGreat reviews! I lived reading them. üôÇ",

Reading your review, though, is giving me pause. I didn't think the sugar cookie note would bother me, but you said this read as *very* buttery on the skin, and that sounds like something I would not like at all. Does it veer into popcorn territory? Because that's a note I always avoid. **Pinyon Truffle**, though, sounds delightful from your description!\n\n**Lavender Raspberry Truffle** is another one that I've eyed for a long time. Others who've tried it drew some parallels to Guerlain's *Mon Guerlain*, which to me already signaled that it would be perfume-y enough that it wasn't a truly edible gourmand. It honestly sounds better than *Mon Guerlain*, though.",

Breathing in the natural intense warm, resinous, earthy-woody nuances you feel a tingle as you quicken your pace and look behind you. You can‚Äôt help but feel in this overcast, Autumnal foggy early morn that someone is following. Feeling a bit more at ease as you smell in the distance, the lingering embers of a campfire, hoping if you move fast enough you may meet up with others. The hope of comfort comes to you as you detect toasted marshmallows, melted chocolate, and graham crackers. You now breathe easier in the warm, soul-soothing aroma of a hot apple ciders and chai tea with a dash of cinnamon, brown sugar, and vanilla. But just before you reach the campers, you feel a cold dread touch your spine as a Ghostly chill embraces you.\n\n**Sleepy Hallow:** Experience the legend with this solid perfume flying Ointment reminiscent of smoldering seasoned oakwood fires, warmed leather from fierce riding through the eastern woodside and the distinct aroma of roasted spiced pumpkin flesh and smoldering marshmallows. \n\n**Smoked Apple Vanilla:** A subtly smoked apple blends with sultry, boozy, Vanilla Bourbon.\n\n**Sweetgrass and Smoke:** A sweetgrass fragrance- the best I have ever run across- and a special blend of natural isolates, essences of deep woods, damp mosses and smoke.\n\n**Swirly Pop: **Halloween is complete with this delightful treat of Sweet Orange eo, Caramel, Vanilla and Spun Sugar!\n\n**Where‚Äôs My Pie:** Adorable pie crust filling, and whipped topping, complete with a pecan.

If a plant does not have a pest or disease it does not need to be treated. Your plant needs to be thoroughly rinsed and repotted to remove any oils in the soil and on the plant. Also, watering on schedule does not allow the plant to adequately drink what it has if it‚Äôs not finished or thirsty from the last watering, and maybe it‚Äôs too long between watering if the plant is unhappy. The plants environment will determine how much water it wants to drink not a 7 to 10 day schedule. Use your finger or buy a $5 moisture gauge to determine a plants moisture level.",

After you chop, clean off the remaining leaves. You‚Äôll have to get rid of all the pests. When you‚Äôre not sure what pest it is, use rubbing alcohol to start. Spray the leaves with rubbing alcohol - mostly the underside but also the tops. And wipe off with a microfiber cloth. Afterwards, spray with neem oil if you have some. \n\nTake out the plant from soil and wash the roots. Completely rinse off any old soil and chop any dead or dying roots. Spray the roots with 3% hydrogen peroxide - this will disinfect the roots. Get new soil and put in a snug pot and water thoroughly. Don‚Äôt use any fertilizer yet because the plant will likely go into shock after all this. \n\nOnce you‚Äôve repotted in fresh soil and have given it a thorough water, inspect it again for pests and other spots. \n\nGood luck!",

    "body": "I don't think I've seen any reviews of the full collection posted yet, so I thought I'd share my testing notes in the event that they might be useful to anyone considering a purchase.\n\nI've heard it said that even reviews where someone doesn't like a scent can be useful, because someone else might love something I hate, and be able to then figure out that they should try a certain perfume...\n\nI will say as a disclaimer that I usually don't get along with \"fall\" scents-- I generally don't like notes such as smoke, warm/pumpkin pie spices, incense (especially frankincense), dead leaves, or dirt. So, I knew going into this collection that I might not enjoy most of it, but I bought a sample set because I love Poesie overall and wanted to support the brand.\n\nFinally, my collection has gotten quite large in the almost-a-year I've been purchasing indies, so it's quite a high bar at this point for me to keep a blind bottle or decide to purchase a full size of something-- the scent has to be a real love, and not just a like, so my \"keep or full size\" is going to be skewed negative.\n\n# Reviews\n\n**Brooding Wings**\n\n**Notes:**  *spilled red wine, narcotic opium, wild fir branches, the leathery wings of a bat, black musk*\n\n**Review:**  Really strong opium and wine with a little tinge of fir. Not really getting any leather in this one. I'd describe it as \"medicinal raisins that will get you super stoned,\" the opium and wine combining to emulate heavily aged ruby port. Not the \"darkest\" scent I've ever smelled, but heavier than Poesie normally gets.\n\n**Keep/Full Size?:** Nah, I like drinking port more than smelling it.\n\n**Castle Dracula**\n\n**Notes:**  *wolf‚Äôs fur musk, cold stone, layers of dust, a drop of blood, and a distant burning fireplace*\n\n**Review:**  Sweeter than I expected from those notes, in the same way that ballpoint pen ink is sweet. It is somewhat animalic (but not really \"dirty\"), a different fur musk than Forest Cat, and not at all smoky. I do think I get a damp, chilled stone note mixing with the fur, and a certain attic-esque tinge from the dust. The stone comes to the forefront as it dries down on me, which is disappointing; I wanted the fur note to stick around. Disappears within a couple of hours.\n\n**Keep/Full Size?:** No, the longevity isn't the greatest and the notes I like aren't perceptible for long.\n\n**Children of the Night**\n\n**Notes:**  *inky black tea, vanilla lace, distant bonfire smoke, ivy climbing up an ancient stone wall, and a soft bite of pepper*\n\n**Review:**  Green and smoky on first application, with only a whisper of vanilla. Then the tea comes through and it's basically (tea) and LAWN CLIPPINGS with a side of smoke. No thank you. If I wanted tea and grass I'd full size Possets Rhode Island... Dries down to mostly just tea and vanilla, which is fine but still not really anything I have to have.\n\n**Keep/Full Size?:** No, this isn't my kind of thing anyway so I figured I wouldn't enjoy it, and am not surprised I didn't.\n\n**Scholomance**\n\n**Notes:**  *ancient castle walls under a forest floor, dragon‚Äôs blood incense, a wicked blend of green herbs and rich spices*\n\n**Review:** Just not a whole lot going on here, to my nose. Sort of muddled green herbal notes, plus a cinnamon-esque warm spice. The dragon's blood is subdued and sort of dry and crumbly, and the \"forest\" accord seems to mix in to the Colonel Sanders 13 Herbs and Spices thing going on. Does have a subtle sweetness to it. Has some things in common with the previous Poesie scents Ritual and Charm of Making, but I liked those better. I will give this credit for not smelling like a witch store based on the notes, but I don't love it.\n\n**Keep/Full Size?:** A respectful no thank you.\n\n**Sweet Sleep**\n\n**Notes:**  *caramelized pumpkin flesh, pumpkin pie spices, creamy vanilla, blonde woods, natural lavender essential oil and absolute*\n\n**Review:**  I'll give Poesie credit, this doesn't immediately call to mind a fall Yankee Candle, like most \"pumpkin\" scents (or, for that matter, fall gourmands) do for me. I find the lavender note to be the strongest part of this (which I guess makes sense as this is a \"sleep\" scent), followed by the \"caramel\" of the caramelized pumpkin and the vanilla. The vanilla becomes more prominent as this dries down, but the lavender remains strong with a side of pumpkin. I don't like warm spices and can usually pick them out easily, but they are really not prominent here. Out of all of the scents in this collection, this one lasts longest on me.\n\n**Keep/Full Size?:** No, because I already have a couple strong lavender scents and also I don't find lavender actually helps me relax, but this is a creative and well-thought-out fragrance if you love pumpkin but also want to nap. Probably my favorite thing out of this collection.\n\n**The Dead Rise**\n\n**Notes:**  *dark roasted coffee beans spiked with fresh cardamom pods, cubes of brown sugar, ambroxan, cedar*\n\n**Review:**  There's an orangey element to this that I am discerning is the fresh cardamom, and that's the strongest note on first application. I don't get any coffee, nor much cedar (it's just a hint, not full on mulch smell). I'd say this is primarily cardamom and ambroxan, with just a touch of the molasses undertone that brown sugar has. Does brown sugar even come in cubes? Pleasant, well-made, I just don't love it. Fades off almost completely within maybe an hour, but for a whisper of ambroxan that leans a bit hot plastic to my nose. Have you ever left, like, a plastic storage box in your car in the sun and then opened the door and got baking plastic right to the face? That's the drydown on this.\n\n**Keep/Full Size?:** No, I don't love cardamom *this* much, the drydown is not my jam, and the longevity is sort of disappointing.\n\n**Weird Sisters**\n\n**Notes:**  *voluptuous milk chocolate, damp leaves dotted with mushrooms, overturned earth, three broken caskets*\n\n**Review:**  Ew, ew, ew, get it off. This reminds me of the chemical animal shelters use to clean litter boxes, plus cheap clay cat litter that may already have been used a little. I get what this is trying to do, but the chocolate weaves together with \"mildewy leaves\" and \"dirt\" to just smell like badness. I put my nose near my arm to smell it and immediately have to pull away. Dries down to remind me a lot of Pineward Funerie (which I also didn't like much), but getting there is ROUGH.\n\n**Keep/Full Size?:** I want to lock this vial in a lead-lined safe and sink it in a lake just to be sure I don't have to smell that opening ever again.",

    "body": "A few months ago, I taught an in-person class called Demystifying Aromachemicals for fragrance aficionados and aspiring perfumers who wanted to learn more about the world of fragrance ingredients outside of natural oils.   It was a hands-on class and everybody walked home with a hundred pipettes, a dozen empty bottles, some perfumers alcohol and half an ounce of all the materials described here.  \n\nThis was the I handout I wrote up for the class.  I figured that some of the folks here might find it interesting.\n\n\n**Demystifying Aromachemicals**\n\n**PART 1**\n\nAromachemical is a catch-all term that describes the fragrant materials used in perfumery. Some fragrant materials are made up of a single type of molecule, like linalool or phenyl ethyl alcohol. Some are a blend of many different molecules, such as lavender essential oil or Givaudan‚Äôs Ultrazur base.\nDifferent ingredient types\n\n* Essential oils ‚Äì steam distilled oils that come from plants. Typically\nessential oils are a blend of dozens or hundreds of aromachemicals. Not all oils can be extracted well through steam distillation though. Sometimes the high heat breaks down some of the oils. Sometimes oils don‚Äôt actually extract well with steam. Rose and Jasmine are examples of oils that don‚Äôt react well to steam distillation. Rose oil isn‚Äôt extracted fully. Jasmine has ingredients that don‚Äôt react well to the heat. ~~In the case of rose, sometimes steam distillation is used to partially extract the oils and solvent is used to extract the rest. When the steam distilled and solvent extracted ingredients are combined back together, this gives you a rose otto.~~ In the case of rose, the steam distillation process is more complicated. The oil from the rose petals is distilled and then the water used during the distillation needs to have the phenyl ethyl alcohol extracted from it and blended back into the oil extracted in the previous step. This is called rose otto.\n* Absolute oils ‚Äì solvent extracted oils that come from plants. Usually hexane is used as the solvent. This typically gives stronger, richer oils than steam extraction. Typically absolute oils are a blend of dozens or hundreds of aromachemicals.\n* CO2/SCO2 extracts ‚Äì solvent extracted oils that come from plants. In this case, carbon dioxide is cooled until it becomes a semi-liquid slush and that is used to extract the material. Many people believe that this gives the purest smell. Typically CO2/SCO2 extracts are a blend of dozens or hundreds of aromachemicals.\n* Concretes ‚Äì solvent extracts that come out as a solid or semi-solid wax. Orris butter is an example of this. Typically concretes are a blend of dozens or hundreds of aromachemicals.\n* Resins ‚Äì solid fragrance materials that come from plants. Benzoin, frankincense tears and myrrh gum are examples of resins. Typically resins are a blend of dozens or hundreds of aromachemicals\n* Tincture ‚Äì fragrant liquid made by soaking an ingredient in alcohol for a long period of time to extract the oils\n* Individual molecules ‚Äì solid or liquid materials that are made from a single molecule. There may be multiple isomers of the same molecule in the ingredient. Limonene, phenyl ethyl alcohol, calone, ambroxan and galaxolide are examples of this.\n** Isomers ‚Äì The same collection of atoms put together in a slightly different way. Different isomers can smell very similarly to each other or very differently. Some isomers are just mirror images of each other. Some are constructed slightly differently. Some have a part that‚Äôs twisted. D-[molecule name] and L-[molecule name] are mirror images of each other. Cis and Trans refer to how they‚Äôre twisted. Typically the ‚Äúcis‚Äù versions of a molecule are both more unstable and more valuable in perfumery than the trans variants. Alpha, Beta and Gamma also refer to different isomers. Iso E Super, Iso Gamma Super, Timbersilk and Sylvamber are all trade names for the ingredients with the same assortment of isomers, just in different ratios.\n** Isolates ‚Äì Single molecule ingredients that have been extracted from a natural oil. One might find linalool extracted from mint, or eugenol extracted from clove for example.\n* Captive molecules ‚Äì Patented molecules that were created by one of the big oil houses that are not generally available for sale. Paradisone (which is basically hedione with a very high ratio of cis molecules) and Georgywood (which is very close in smell to the very desirable gamma isomer of Iso E Super) are examples of captive molecules.\n* Fragrance oils- A blend of ingredients. Those ingredients are not disclosed. They could be natural, lab created, or mix thereof. There is no way to tell. Avoid using fragrance oils because they could change or disappear at any time, leaving you high and dry\n* Bases ‚Äì These are blends that have been put out by one of the big oil companies. They are basically fragrance oils, but with a guarantee of consistency and availability. Even when one oil house goes out of business, others buy the formulas and continue to provide the bases. Bases from a century ago from companies long expired are still available by special order if you know who to ask.\n* Key accords ‚Äì This is a term that Perfumer‚Äôs Apprentice uses for bases based upon published example formulas from big oil houses. The formula is available, but you can also purchase the finished base for the\nsake of convenience. Key accords vary in quality because they were designed to highlight a particular ingredient that the oil house is trying to sell rather than trying to smell perfectly natural.\n\n\n**Additional resources**\n\n* The Good Scents Company maintains an incredible database of information on thousands of ingredients, in a level of detail that is astonishing. Do a google search for ‚Äúgood scents [ingredient name]‚Äù to find the page or go to http://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/search2.html\n* The Good Scents Company also maintains a comprehensive list of demo formulas (like the key accords). http://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/demos/dm1015272.html\n* The Perfumer‚Äôs Apprentice publishes all of their key accord formulas here: http://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/perfumersworkshop/formulas/key_ accords/\n\n**Sourcing aromachemicals**\n\n\nYou can‚Äôt buy aromachemicals directly from the big oil houses unless you‚Äôre buying by the 55 gallon drum. Some of the big oil houses are:\n\n* Givaudan\n* Firmenich\n* International Flavors and Fragrances (IFF)\n* Symrise\n* Takasago\n* Robertet\n\nMany of the most famous perfumers also work directly for these companies and are contracted out.\n\nIf you‚Äôre buying in quantities of less that 1 kg, you‚Äôre looking at buying from sources like these:\n\n* The Perfumer‚Äôs Apprentice ‚Äì http://shop.perfumersapprentice.com - Small volumes of hundreds of aromachemicals available. Based in Scott‚Äôs Valley (near Santa Cruz). USPS shipping to the Bay Area is often overnight. The materials for this class mostly came from the Perfumer‚Äôs Apprentice.\n* Creating Perfume - http://www.creatingperfume.com - Small volumes of hundreds of aromachemicals available. They carry many ingredients that the Perfumer‚Äôs Apprentice doesn‚Äôt and also carry perfumer‚Äôs alcohol. Based in San Leandro. They provided some additional materials for this class.\n* Perfumer Supply House - http://perfumersupplyhouse.com - Another small volume reseller, based on the east coast which carries some items the other two don‚Äôt.\n\nThere‚Äôs another middle level of purchasing, where you have a business license and you‚Äôre buying by the kg, but not by the drum. Vigon International and the John D Walsh Company are examples of such sources.\n\nEconomies of scale are huge in aromachemicals. Hedione is $800/kg when you‚Äôre buying it 4 ml at a time. It‚Äôs $100 kg when you buy it by the kg. It‚Äôs $12/kg when you buy 200 kg at once. It‚Äôs even cheaper by the 55 gallon drum. Most artisan perfumers are paying 50-100x the prices for raw materials that LVMH and Estee Lauder are.\n\n**Creating a Modern Accord: The Grojsman Accord**\n\nSophia Grojsman created this modern accord which can be found (with some variations) in a huge number of modern women‚Äôs fragrances. Lancome Tresor consists mostly (80%) of this accord.\n\n* Methyl Ionone gamma 85% (Isoraldeine 95) ‚Äì 5\n* Iso E super ‚Äì 5\n* Hedione 5\n* Galaxolide 50% - 10\n\nDilute the result to 20% concentration by adding 75 drops of alcohol (the Galaxolide is already diluted and we‚Äôre taking that into account.\n\nOPTIONAL: Add 10 drops of ambroxan as well.  Many modified Grojsman accords include ambroxan.\n\nOPTIONAL: Remake the same formula with Timbesilk instead of Iso E Super.\n\nOPTIONAL: Add a drop of damascone beta to get a very modern smelling accord.\n  \n**PART 2**\n\n**Olfactory Fatigue**\n\nSmell Memory: Your nose is a limited resource. Perfumers do their best to limit the number of sniffs that they give a material to avoid olfactory fatigue. Practice smelling materials with a single sniff and holding on to the memory of them. After 15-30 seconds, go back and take another brief sniff. Over time, your smell- memory will improve.\n\nUsing Olfactory fatigue to your advantage: When a perfumer wants to isolate a particular smell (such as when trying to figure out an ingredient in an unknown composition) the perfumer can deliberately fatigue him/herself to the known ingredients so that the unknown ones stick out.\n\n[At this point, I had people deliberately sniff a blend of two ingredients, one of which was much stronger than the other (damascone beta and a bergamot accord).  I then had them deliberately smell the damascone beta for a few minutes until they became fatigued to the smell. I then had them re-smell the original mixture to show how much more prominent the bergamot became]\n\n**Smelling similarities**\n\nMolecules with similar names can have similar smells, whether it's the prefix or the suffix. There‚Äôs lots of variation in this (for example, in salicylates), but if you‚Äôre familiar with how acetates, alcohols and aldehydes smell and you‚Äôve smelled the acetate and aldehyde of something, you can often guess how the alcohol version is going to smell.\n\n**Common suffixes**\n\n* Alcohol ‚Äì ends in ‚Äúol‚Äù or ‚Äúalcohol‚Äù ‚Äì reasonably mild smelling version of\nthe molecule\n* Aldehyde ‚Äì ends in ‚Äúal‚Äù or ‚Äúaldehyde‚Äù ‚Äì strong and harsh smelling\nversion of the molecule, often with a distinct aldehyde smell\n* Acetate ‚Äì ends in ‚Äúacetate‚Äù ‚Äì reasonably mild smelling version of the molecule with distinct acetate smell\n* Oxide ‚Äì ends in oxide ‚Äì reasonably mild smelling version of the molecule\nwith a distinct oxide smell\n* Salicylate ‚Äì ends in salicylate ‚Äì often sweet and slightly basalmic version\nof the molecule.\n\n[In the class at this point, I had people smell phenyl ethyl alcohol, phenyl ethyl acetate, phenyl ethyl aldehyde, phenyl ethyl butyrate, and phenyl ethyl salicylate to see if they could identify a common \"phenyl ethyl\" smell.  I also had them smell linalool, linalyl acetate and then linalool oxide, lime oxide and rose oxide]\n\n**PART 3**\n\n**Evaluating new ingredients**\n\nDifferent ingredients smell different in different dilutions. Ingredients that are overpowering or distasteful smelling at 100% concentration can smell mild and pleasant at 1% or 0.1% concentration. Additionally some ingredients can be valuable because of the effects that they have on the smell of other ingredients. Hedione is one of the most famous examples of this. By itself it smells very mild, but it has an powerful effect on other ingredients.\nWhen evaluating a new ingredient, you should do the following:\n\n* Evaluate the ingredient in different concentrations ‚Äì Start at 10%, but feel free to dilute even further. Take a small whiff of the ingredient neat to get an idea of how the smell changes as the concentration changes\n* Smell the ingredient in an example formula that showcases it\n* Smell the same formula without that ingredient (or with a substitute) - Often, the most insight comes from this step because it will also give an idea of the effect that the ingredient has on the other ingredients in the composition\n\nKey accords are all example formulas. The link to the Good Scents Demo formulas is also very helpful here.\n\n**Evaluating an ingredient and building a demo formula**\n\nIn order to see the effect that any particular ingredient has on the composition, make a version that excludes that ingredient and compare it to the complete formula.\n\n* Hedione - (very light all-around enhancer) - 58\n* Galaxolide 50% (musk) 28\n* Iso e super (smooth woody amber - velvety) 8\n* Habanolide (sweet musk) - 6\n* Ambroxan 10% - 20\n* Linalool (lighly floral) 6\n* Helional (ozone) 4\n* Calone 10% (marine) (this is a solid, heat gently to melt) 20\n\n[I had each person make two version of this accord.  One version was made according to the formula above.  The other version was missing an ingredient.  Each student was assigned to skip a different ingredient.  Students then passed around the versions that were missing an ingredient and compared them to their finished version to try to understand what each ingredient added to the accord]\n\n**PART 4**\n\nGC/MS is a Gas Chromatograph with a Mass Spectrometer attached. The Gas Chromatograph separates a sample into it‚Äôs individual components and then passes each of the components through a mass spectrometer to see what they are. The mass spectrometer compares the behavior of the material to a database of results from known materials and then outputs what it believes the material to be.\n\nA GC/MS will give information on the percentage and amounts of individual molecules and will generally identify most or all of them. Complex natural oils are broken up into their constituent molecules though, so a peak of linalool could come from a combination of neroli, bergamot, lavender and rose. Notes listings can be helpful when doing this reconstruction.\n\nTheoretically one could recreate a fragrance from a GC/MS, but often, some of the most important ingredients are found in very small amounts. Pyrazines, for example, can add a pronounced smell even when they are present in amounts so tiny as to not even register as a blip. Also, GC/MS devices aren‚Äôt always good at detecting isomers. They may not be very good at telling the difference between Hedione and Paradisone or Iso E Super and Timbersilk.\n\nThere are also GC/MS devices that have the exhaust ports connected to a cooling sleeve so that a trained perfumer can sniff each molecule as it comes out and try to identify it.\n\nSeveral GC/MS readouts are attached to this packet.\n\n[They aren't attached here, but you can find some on the web]\n\n\n**Aromachemicals provided**\n\n**Ambroxan 10% in DPG** ‚Äì base note ‚Äì A synthesized version of a molecule that originally comes from ambergris. It‚Äôs not technically part of ambergris, but ambrein, the main component in ambergris, oxidizes in air to turn into ambroxan and ambrinol. These oxidation products are what gives ambergris its distinctive smell. Ambroxan has a clean, dry, amber note and is a very, very long lasting base note. It is very popular in modern fragrances. On its own, it‚Äôs a crystalline powder.\n\n**Calone 10% in DPG** ‚Äì base note ‚Äì Smells like fresh air, water and/or melon depending on the dilution. This was the ingredient that started the aquatic trend. Found in Cool Water, Dune and most other aquatics. Very powerful. Very long lasting. On its own, it‚Äôs a crystalline powder with a low melting point. A water bath in hot water out of the tap will be enough to melt it. So will a hot summer day.\n\n**Cologne Key Accord** ‚Äì base note ‚Äì This is a modern ‚Äúcologne‚Äù accord that is based on a demo formula from Givaudan that can be found here: https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/Images/sds/Key%20Accord%20Formula/Cologne.pdf\n\n**Coumarin 10% in DPG** ‚Äì base note ‚ÄìA synthesized version of a molecule that occurs naturally in tonka beans, hay, sweet grass and many other things. Almost all ‚Äútonka bean‚Äù notes in commercial fragrances are actually just coumarin, and have been since the 1880s. Coumarin, is sweet, spicy and a bit herbaceous. It can be found in most commercial fragrances. On its own, it‚Äôs a crystalline powder.\n\n**Dihydro Myrcenol** ‚Äì heart note ‚Äì Cologne fresh, almost lavender-like. It was originally used largely in functional fragrance such as detergents. In the 1970s, people started to use it in fine fragrance (Paco Rabanne pour Homme was one of the first in 1973). Drakkar Noir is the quintessential Dihydro Myrcenol heavy fragrance.\n\n**Galaxolide 50% in IPM** ‚Äì base note ‚Äì A strong, floral diffusing white musk that is very popular in fragrances today. One of the so-called ‚Äúlaundry musks.‚Äù\n\n**Habanolide** ‚Äì base note ‚Äì One of the traditional white musks. Slightly sweet and fresh.\n\n**Hedione** ‚Äì heart note ‚Äì Hedione is a jasmine-like aromachemical with a faint smell and a powerful effect. It smooths out blends and adds a rich florality to them. In order to get a good idea of hedione‚Äôs effects, make a blend. Add a bit of hedione to one and leave the other without. This is the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù hedione. There‚Äôs also a version with a larger amount of the ‚Äúcis‚Äù isomer, which has more exaltant effects called Hedione HC. Firmenich also makes a version that is 100% cis, called Paradisone that‚Äôs currently captive. Hedione is used very commonly in modern fragrances.\n\n**Helional** ‚Äì heart note ‚Äì Harsh, haylike and ozonic with metallic nuances. Luca Turin described the smell as ‚Äúlike sucking on a silver spoon.‚Äù\n\n**Iso E Super (Patchouli Ethanone)** ‚Äì base note ‚Äì Iso E Super is a very long lasting woody, dry amber smell with some hints of freshness. It‚Äôs actually the trade name for a mixture of isomers. Timbersilk is a mixture of the same isomers in different ratios. Iso E Super is a remarkably good fixative in small amounts. In larger amounts, it imparts it‚Äôs own unique scent and tends to mute other notes, making them a bit ‚Äúfuzzy.‚Äù Most fragrances today use some amount of Iso E Super (or another Patchouli Ethanone). Molecule 01 uses a high gamma version that‚Äôs an IFF captive.\n\n**Limonene** ‚Äì top note ‚Äì Limonene is a molecule that occurs naturally in citrus peels. In fact, most of the limonene that‚Äôs available comes from the waste peels from the orange juice industry. When you squeeze an orange peel and a spray of oil comes out, that‚Äôs largely limonene. Limonene is citrusy, sweet and fresh smelling but can remind some people of cleaners because it‚Äôs used heavily in them. Invaluable in citrus compositions and as a general freshener.  You can tell that the limonene that you're getting came from orange juice waste because if it didn't, it wouldn't smell like oranges at all.  According to some recent research done at Givaudan by Charles Sell, the more you purify limonene, the less it smells of citrus.  The current theory is that limonene itself smells vaguely pine-like but that it has a high affinity for aldehydes that affect it's odor profile.  In other words, \"limonene\" is mostly just a carrier for tiny amounts of high impact aldehydes that are found in citrus peels.\n\n**Linalool** ‚Äì top note ‚Äì Very floral, light and somewhat sweet. Linalool is one of the major components of lavender (40%), Rosewood (90+), freesia (the headspace is mostly linalool) and is in most flowers. Most fragrances have some amount of linalool in them.\n\n**Methyl Ionone (aka Isoraldeine)** ‚Äì heart note ‚Äì Ionones are found in nature and tend to smell violetlike or orrislike. Ionone alpha, Ionone beta, Methyl ionone and the dihydro ionones are the most commonly used ionones. The characteristic smell of violets cannot be extracted in traditional ways and so almost all violet notes come from synthetic ionones. Methyl Ionone has a fine rich violet note with hints of orris (iris root).\n\n**Phenyl Ethyl Alcohol (aka Phenethyl Alcohol)** ‚Äì heart note ‚Äì A relatively long-lasting rosy note. Found in roses and in other flowers. Often used in floral accords\n\n**Timbersilk (Patchouli Ethanone)** ‚Äì base note ‚Äì A drier, woodier version of Iso E Super with a larger amount of the desirable gamma isomer.\n",

The question springs from the name of the chemical as an \"alcohol\" ....and I admit in advance a great ignorance with regard to chemistry, so only chuckle off-mike please.\n\nWith regular alcohol-based perfumes like most of us wear everyday, the perfumer mixes up a soup of EOs and other aromachems and then mixes that with odorless perfumer's alcohol (for example). We spritz that on our arm; the alcohol evaporates; leaving behind the oils and other aromatic components which volatilize and make us smell good.\n\nMy question is this: Is it possible to use Phenyl Ethyl Alcohol as your carrier alcohol (in place of perfumer's alcohol in this example) ... and if you did, when it evaporates does any of the rosy smell stay on skin or does it disappear completly as the ahcohol vaporizes?\n\nIOW, with perfumer's ahcohol and rose EO, the alcohol evaporates leaving behind the molecules of rose EO to smell good.  .... but when Phenyl Ethyl Alcohol evaporates where does the \"rosy\" smell go or is something left behind that still smells of rose?\n\nThank you greatly in advance.",

I have a couple of Questions if you don't mind. \n\nWith regards to something along the lines of Limonene, is that a catch-all term for any the molecule found in any citrus, or is it specific to a certain one? For example, the molecules of a lemon grown in Amalfi may smell different from a lemon grown in California, but both would be called Limonene?\n\nFor a beginner, is there anyway that I can train my nose to 'smell passed' the alcohol found in fragrance? There are some that are highly praised (Bleu de Channel and Imperial Millisime spring to mind), that both smell of nothing but alcohol to me. I'd love to be able to discover what they're 'meant' to smell like.",

    "body": "I have been searching for the perfect lavender perfume. I think lavender perfumes are a bit tricky because the compounds in lavender oil/absolute are volatile, and the smell dissipates quickly. I no longer believe I will find the perfect lavender perfume, but throughout this journey I've at least discovered I really like vanilla. \n\n***Sorcellerie Apothecary***\n\n**Moon Magic** (Lavender sugar, Tonka bean, chai spices, vanilla steamed milk, Cashmeran, Ambroxan, crystals charged by the moonlight)\n\nNo lavender at all, mostly cardamom and cinnamon. I don‚Äôt really know what musk means, but this is very musky, maybe too musky. I would also prefer if there was more vanilla. 6/10\n\n**Snow Moon Magic** (Lavender sugar, vanilla steamed milk, chai spices, tonka bean, Cashmeran, Ambroxan, crystals charged by the moonlight (our crystal accord), marshmallow, cookie butter, and Tahitian vanilla) \n\nThis is very buttery, which I don‚Äôt love. The chai is pretty hard to detect, and no lavender. I think the cookie butter accord is composed of roasted barley extract, and I am not sure how I feel about it. I do like the vanilla in this. 7/10\n\n**Strings of Light in the Forest** (Vanilla milkshake, Haitian vetiver, lavender maillette, beeswax absolute, golden orbs of amber, Ambroxan)\n\nDefinitely vanilla, no lavender. Vetiver to me smells like a wooden cabinet that stored some herbal medicine, so I think what I smell is vetiver. The combination of heavy sweetness and wooden cabinet with herbal medicine is not my favorite. 5/10\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Haus of Gloi***\n\n**Lavender Sugar** (‚Äã‚ÄãBulgarian lavender and a heaping spoonful of pure Muscadovo sugar)\n\nIt kinda does smell like lavender but also like plastic. 2/10\n\n**A Place in Space** (A silvery lavender, nag champa, dry amber incense and faded patchouli)\n\nI feel like maybe I can smell lavender, but it is overpowered by the other notes. I wouldn‚Äôt say this is bad, but it is not for me. 3/10\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Solstice Scents***\n\n**Lavender Vanilla** (Lavender Essential Oil & Sweet Creamy Vanilla)\n\nThe lavender is there, but it is astringent and quickly becomes dominated by drugstore vanilla body spray. 2/10\n\n**Courtyard** (Lavender, Coriander, Lime, Gardenia, Sandalwood, Muhuhu, Oakmoss, Patchouli, Mitti, Cypriol)\n\nCinnamon, saliva, and lime. 1/10\n\n**Estate Lavender** (Estate Vanilla, Lavender (many varieties), Bergamot, Black Tea, Coriander, Wild Violet, Davana, Heather, Rain)\n\nDirt, bugspray, and marshmallow. 4/10\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Osmofolia***\n\n**Waxing Crescent** (Night-blooming tuberose and gardenia flowers opening in cool night air, three varieties of lavender oils in a snuggly white musk, and wafts of warm spices with chilled vanilla bean)\n\nGardenia. I love the smell of gardenia in real life, but not in perfume. 4/10\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Black Hearted Tart***\n\n**Girlfriend in a Coma** (Lavender, tonka bean, sandalwood, vanilla)\n\nThis is actually not bad. The lavender is subtle, but it is a nice non-astringent lavender. After a few minutes it is mostly vanilla and woody. It is a little too woody for me, however. 6/10\n\n**Let Me Sleep** (Lavender intertwined with sprigs of rosemary and stems of sage. Balsamic amyris oil. Lilac and geranium florals. Leather bound books on teakwood shelves. A dark musk base of cedar and sandalwood)\n\nReminds me of this lancome face cream that my mom had. No lavender. I kind of detect some other floralness though. 5/10\n\n**Sleeps With Butterflies** (Honey, vanilla notes, lily of the valley, orange blossoms, sweet violet, yellow cake, coconut cream, candied lavender)\n\nStinky florals and coconut cake. 2/10\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Mythpunk Olfactive***\n\n**Huskin** (‚Äòblue‚Äô lavender, violet petals, cocoa-dusted marshmallows, creamy sandalwood, Stuffkin vanilla bean, pillowy tonka)\n\nThis is the best lavender perfume I have smelled. The lavender is very pretty. There is not too much woodiness and the vanilla is very nice. 9/10\n\n**Dozykin** (‚Äòblue‚Äô lavender, golden amber, and vanilla bean custard)\n\nThe same pretty lavender. For some reason, this kind of smells like lychee-flavored jelly. It also reminds of **Strings of Light in the Forest**. Maybe they share the same materials that contribute to milky-ness. 6/10\n\n**After the Night‚Äôs Shade** (an ambery fougere-chypre hybrid of earl grey, lavender, golden amber, osmanthus, rosewood, tonka, vetiver, patchouli, and oakmoss)\n\nI can‚Äôt pick out the lavender from this. I would say it is a nice, masculine-leaning scent that is a little bit powdery. I think I‚Äôm getting the osmanthus as well. 7/10\n",

Let's take a bite, before the sun comes up!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brooding Wings** *(spilled red wine, narcotic opium, wild fir branches, the leathery wings of a bat, black musk)* \\-- This one is weird in that I had an idea of what it would smell like based on other scents with similar notes, and then that idea was entirely wrong. Smells kind of like Vick's at first for some reason. There's a bit of leather and some kind of sweet, dusty smell I can't really place. Maybe the opium? I thought this would smell richer or fruitier from the wine, but alas! Nothing but vaguely sweet leather dust. Tragic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Castle Dracula** *(wolf‚Äôs fur musk, cold stone, layers of dust, a drop of blood, and a distant burning fireplace)* \\-- Goes on as cold, mineralistic stone, then quickly fades into the faint, slightly acrid smell of firewood and a hint of musky fur. Oddly weak, I could barely smell it once it dried down, so I don't have much to say about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Children of the Night** *(inky black tea, vanilla lace, distant bonfire smoke, ivy climbing up an ancient stone wall, and a soft bite of pepper)* \\-- Very astringent when wet, and to be honest, I almost scrubbed it at first, but decided to give it a fair try, and was very glad I did! Poesie's tea note almost never lets me down, and here it's accompanied by cool, bitter greens and a sharp pepper zing. The vanilla slowly comes out as it dries, adding a touch of sweetness. Makes me feel like I'm drinking midnight tea in the courtyard of my ominous castle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Scholomance** *(ancient castle walls under a forest floor, dragon‚Äôs blood incense, a wicked blend of green herbs and rich spices)* \\-- This one mostly just smells powdery and indistinct? Maybe slightly savory. I'm not even sure what it is I'm smelling, because it certainly doesn't smell like dragon's blood lol. Oh well!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sweet Sleep** *(caramelized pumpkin flesh, pumpkin pie spices, creamy vanilla, blonde woods, natural lavender essential oil and absolute)* \\-- My favorite of the bunch, this is soft and creamy and oh so soothing! The cool, sweet lavender plays very nicely with the warm pumkin spice and vanilla. A simple but intriguing combi! I've been wearing this to sleep for several days now lol.\n\n \n\n**The Dead Rise** *(dark roasted coffee beans spiked with fresh cardamom pods, cubes of brown sugar, ambroxan, cedar)* \\-- Opens with dark, rich coffee and cardamom, but the ambroxan sort of edges it out soon after. The drydown becomes more of a dry papery-woodsy scent with a hint of coffee. The brown sugar is absent, which is disappointing, because I think the scent goes a little bracing and I would've liked some sweetness to warm it up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Weird Sisters** *(voluptuous milk chocolate, damp leaves dotted with mushrooms, overturned earth, three broken caskets)* \\-- The surprise breakout hit I wasn't expecting! The chocolate is smooth and creamy, but not annoyingly sweet. The earthy & woody notes add a pleasing funkiness, but the scent never feels gross or discordant at all. Kind of a \"sexy undead\" vibe, I think. Like seductively eating chocolate in the decrepit wine cellar they tried to get rid of you in. I may just be weird, though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost of these may have been busts, but the three I liked, I really liked! Regardless, this was a fun pre-Halloween Smell Journey, and I look forward to Poesie's next fun collection! Thanks for reading-- I gotta go crawl around on the walls of my castle now. Seeya!",

It was new information to me while reading up on her that she is associated with the horse multiple times in ancient depictions. Finally, I ended with a deep meditation and confided in her my thoughts and worries. \n\nIn the Chaldean tradition, the horse is a creature of fire, symbolic of Hecate‚Äôs fiery soul. It brings great pleasure to me to honor one of her symbolic animals in such a way, given that this piece is very sentimental to me as it belonged to my great-grandmother who also practiced witchcraft in her time. I've been raised in a family of witches, but only recently have I branched off and decided to explore my faith individually. If anyone has any suggestions or pointers I'd be very greatful! ",

(On your feet with socks. Behind your ears, on your chest, and under your nose)\n\nLavender essential oil! (If you get the right ones. I use the sleep ones. Put it on your feet, neck, and behind ears.) it just helps calm you down. Just close your eyes, prop yourself up in bed on your pillows(don‚Äôt lay flat), and just take in the smell. Think of other things. \n\nPlay a game on your phone or console! (It takes your attention away.) (try mind games on your phone. Like little thinking puzzles)\n \nI also always like to think it‚Äôs better down and out than u* and out. So let yourself go to the bathroom(#2) if you need too. It‚Äôs gotta get out some how, and it‚Äôs so relieving!\n\nDon‚Äôt over drink water. (Slow consistent sips. And breathe!!)\n\nA lot of it is a mental game. If you work yourself up you will feel n*. Just have someone talk to you about random things. Like movies, shows, celebrities, etc \n\nColor! (Sometimes it just takes away the stress and takes your focus.

        "body": "> \"... Increase the superfat because I have dry hands this soap is a little drying....\"\n\nIf the soap is freshly made, it's too early to judge the soap just yet. Let it cure for about 4 weeks (minimum) and then evaluate whether the soap is drying to your skin or not. \n\nAlso don't automatically assume raising the superfat is the best answer to making a soap milder and less drying. It can be, especially if you want to use a high % of coconut oil, but the downside of more superfat is less lather. \n\nAnother option to consider is adjusting the relative proportions of the fats -- less coconut would certainly help, but I'd probably increase the % of tallow and/or shea rather than increase the olive. Just my preference, though. \n\n> \"...I am going to use full water the next %38 percent of oils to slow down trace...\"\n\nMore water does not necessarily slow the time to trace. It's been my observation that overmixing with a stick blender, overly high temperatures, the use of sugars, etc. are more often the culprits. \n\nAlso a setting of \"38% water as % of oils\" doesn't necessarily result in more water, depending on the recipe. \n\nYou're better off to base your water calculations on the weight of alkali (NaOH) rather than the weight of fats. I recommend avoiding \"water as % of oils\". Switch to using either lye concentration or water:lye ratio. These settings are mathematically the same, so use whichever one makes the most sense to you.\n\nFor many soap recipes, a 33% lye concentration (same as 2:1 water:lye ratio) often works well as a starting point. Tweak the water content up or down from there as you gain more experience with the recipe.",

    "body": "In discussions about the rules and regulations around selling handmade bath and body products in Facebook groups and soapmaking forums, I see it time and time again. Usually, someone asks for advice on how to comply to the rules. A stream of fantastic responses give recommended resources, advice, and input.\n\nUnfortunately, in the mix, there are always some who think they are too small to really matter. A handful of soapmakers who think that because they don‚Äôt make a living from their craft, they shouldn‚Äôt have to foot the bill to comply with the rules. Or some soapmakers who think that the FDA (or other regulatory organization) is just too big and they are so small, that they won‚Äôt even bother with their small time operation. And even more dangerously, they recommend that others follow in their footsteps: ignoring the regulations set forth to govern our businesses.\n\nYes, I may be a goody-two shoes who follows the rules to the best of my ability. I do my best to comply with FTC guidelines about sponsorships, product endorsements, and reviews. I try my hardest to follow the FDA cosmetics regulations when creating tutorials and recipes to ensure that anyone who uses them will also be in compliance with the information I give. I won‚Äôt write about how amazing ingredient XYZ is for such and such medical problem, or claim a recipe here on Modern Soapmaking will cure a disease.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that the FDA is not too big to enforce the regulations, and no soapmaker is too small to blip up on their radar. Yes, they really are paying attention.\n\nLast fall, a soapmaker found out for herself that the FDA does pay attention to small businesses, like yours and mine. I talked with her a bit to to find out what happened, so we could both help other soapmakers see the light.\n\n---\n\n**One Soapmaker‚Äôs Experiences with Cosmetics Regulations Enforcement**:\n\nRobin of [River County Soapworks](http://rivercountysoap.com/) makes handmade soap and other bodycare products, like lotion, lip balm, and lotion bars. She had done her best to research and comply with all applicable regulations on her own, using [the FDA as a resource](http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/default.htm) and following closely along with Marie Gale‚Äôs book, [Soap & Cosmetic Labeling](http://www.mariegale.com/soap-and-cosmetic-labeling-book/). Her labels on her products were completely up to spec, thanks to all that hard work.\n\nAs of last fall, Robin was in the process of working through Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) compliance. Again, she had turned to Marie Gale‚Äôs expertise and was using her book, [Good Manufacturing Practices for Soap & Cosmetics Handcrafters](http://www.mariegale.com/announcing-new-book-on-gmp/), to work through it. However, she just hadn‚Äôt finished the process to be 100% compliant quite yet.\n\nOne early morning in October 2014, there was a knock at her front door in the rural area where she lived. She had been going about her life as usual, folding laundry in her pajamas, preparing for a day of working from home in her converted garage turned soap studio and homeschooling her son. At the door, she found an FDA inspector flashing a badge, and asking to see her operations. She later learned that the first inspection visit is always unannounced, and if you work from home, they‚Äôll allow you to make an appointment in the future.\n\nDespite other soapmakers‚Äô claims that the FDA will only take notice of you if you get reported for adverse effects or medical claims, Robin hadn‚Äôt been reported by anyone at all. The inspector had said she was looking at websites online, came across River County Soapworks online, and noticed two products that sat in a problem area for regulatory compliance. On one product, Robin had used the word ‚Äúmedicinal‚Äù to describe a soap‚Äôs fragrance and in another product, she had mentioned that both tea tree and lavender essential oil had antibacterial properties. The inspector drove two and a half hours from Tacoma, Washington to conduct the inspection at Robin‚Äôs studio on these two errors alone.\n\nThe inspector took the time to review Robin‚Äôs website with her, and explained what she could and couldn‚Äôt say. The inspector conducted a walk-through of Robin‚Äôs studio, looking at how raw materials were stored, what overhead lighting was being used, and the scales and equipment she was using. It‚Äôs not unusual for the inspector to ask to see manufacturing processes in action, but Robin was allowed to explain her soapmaking process rather than demonstrate it, since she was so shocked to be in the midst of the inspection. The inspector took three product labels with her, and ensured Robin understood that this was an introductory visit. She made it absolutely clear to Robin that she was there to help her get in compliance.\n\nRobin wasn‚Äôt fined or otherwise penalized for her mistakes, and was given a few days to change the two issues on her website. She also had a list of other compliance issues to tackle, including:\n\n* Putting non-breakable sleeves on the overhead lighting in the shop.\n* Raising all raw materials off the floor.\n* Having her scales calibrated once a year.\n* Making a platform to put soap buckets onto when making soap.\n* Starting to keep batch records of her production.\n\nRobin did her best to correct the issues, but struggled with how to maintain batch records. Luckily (depending on how you look at it!), Robin was scheduled for a follow-up visit this past summer. This time around, she was able to make an appointment and didn‚Äôt have the surprise of a knock on the door in the early morning.\n\nAt the follow-up visit, the inspector made sure Robin was aware that she was happy with the progress, and even helped her work out the kinks in batch recording. During that second visit, the inspector noted a few more areas to work on, including:\n\n* A few lights over her desk and in the drying room needed cages.\n* A Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) Manual needed to be written to address the processes of receiving, production, packaging, distribution, and complaints/recalls.\n* Packages shipped to customers in plain kraft shipping boxes needed to have a label on the outside with her logo, company name, and contact information.\n* A Pinterest board Robin had compiled about herbs needed to be removed as some pins (links to other websites) indicated medicinal use.\n\nRobin is confident that she will have her ducks in a row for her next visit, and hopes to completely check out in compliance. It‚Äôs been a long process for her, but she isn‚Äôt ever going to be done: she expects an annual visit from an inspector for as long as she is in business.\n\n---\n\n**The Truth About Cosmetics Regulations & Compliance**:\n\nDespite what other people might say, the FDA and other regulatory organizations are not out to get you. They are there to enforce the laws passed in your country, state, or city. By manufacturing and selling your products in the locations governed by them, you agree to be in compliance. Their goal isn‚Äôt to put you out of business, and as Robin learned, they may even try to help you.\n\nWhile following good manufacturing practices and labeling products correctly may seem daunting, it‚Äôs our responsibility as business owners to follow the rules and regulations in place. The truth of the matter is that it‚Äôs not impossible for any of us to follow the regulations to the best of our ability, nor is it impossible for us to access the resources out there to make that happen.\n\nAnd if we don‚Äôt like the rules, we need to work together to change them by advocating for our industry. Outright ignoring the rules and regulations will not make them go away!\n\nHere‚Äôs Robin‚Äôs takeaway advice for other soapmakers:\n\n*\"Take it seriously.*\n\n*Even if you only make some soap, lip balm, lotion bars, etc., in your kitchen to sell at a farmer‚Äôs market, you must follow FDA guidelines and you can have the FDA show up on your front step.*\n\n*I don‚Äôt know of many people that only sell soap and only label as just soap. Most of us make cosmetic claims on our soaps, in addition to making other products.*\n\n*I know there are many, many sellers out there not following the rules and it is frustrating because there isn‚Äôt a level playing field. However, the FDA knows this, too. What my inspector told me was, it doesn‚Äôt matter what everyone else is doing, and she is right.*\n\n*I was even asked for referrals of other makers in my area. They are looking.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Resources for Regulatory Compliance & Advocacy**:\n\nWhile I‚Äôm happy to encourage regulatory compliance, and work hard to advocate for our industry, I‚Äôm not an expert by any means. However, there are plenty of resources available:\n\n* [The FDA‚Äôs Website](http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/default.htm): All of the regulations are plainly available via the FDA‚Äôs website, and a treasure trove of resources can make compliance easier, including guidance documents, labeling guides, fact sheets, and so much more.\n* [Marie Gale](http://www.mariegale.com/): Marie Gale has dedicated years to educating the handmade soap and cosmetics industry in regulatory compliance, including books like [Soap & Cosmetic Labeling](http://www.mariegale.com/soap-and-cosmetic-labeling-book/) and [Good Manufacturing Practices](http://www.mariegale.com/announcing-new-book-on-gmp/), articles, and more. Her website alone houses enough information to get you started.\n* [Lucky Break Consulting](http://www.luckybreakconsulting.com/): Lela Barker has developed a comprehensive GMP program to help you get in compliance. She offers a live version occasionally directly through [Lucky Break Consulting](http://www.luckybreakconsulting.com/small-group-classes/live-webinar-gmp-for-micro-manufacturers), as well as [an independent study class via Bramble Berry](http://www.brambleberry.com/GMP-Good-Manufacturing-Practices-Master-Class-P5607.aspx?bb=9).\n* [Coalition of Handmade Entrepreneurs](http://www.coalitionofhandcraftedentrepreneurs.com/): Anne-Marie of Bramble Berry and Soap Queen heads up the COHE, which she formed to support small businesses in the soap and cosmetic industry. COHE works hard to advocate for small manufacturers like us, and it‚Äôs easy to get involved by signing up for the newsletter.\n* [Handmade Cosmetics Alliance](http://handmadecosmeticalliance.org/): Debbie May of Wholesale Supplies Plus established the HCA to seek to preserve the freedom to buy or produce and sell handmade soap & cosmetics in the USA. Again, it‚Äôs easy to get involved, just visit the HCA website.\n\n**SOURCE: [MODERN SOAP MAKING](http://www.modernsoapmaking.com/follow-the-labeling-rules-and-cosmetics-regulations/)**",

Be aware of the regulations, but don't drown yourself in paperwork either or overstress to have every tiny detail worked out because you might end up in analysis paralysis. Just make a good product, and get your products out there. Don't let yourself be scared by all the stuff that might go wrong with your business, take calculated risks and improve as you go. \n\nKeep in mind that rules and regulations are there to help you, and as shown in the article, if an inspector shows up at your door, he is there to help you improve the way you're manufacturing your product. Just do your best to follow the regulations but don't let them stop you from putting a really great product out there because you were too scared that it would sound medicinal or have claims that it shouldn't. Your customers will be the first to vote on that anyway, and chances are, if it's a crappy product, it will one way or another self-regulate into the trash.\n\nI see huge brands (Lush for example), routinely break rules and regulations over labelling and claims, and yet it's the small folks with higher quality products who end up stressing over these issues way more than necessary. I'm not saying that every DIYer should be putting their booger-infested lotion up for sale, but that many small businesses take such great care in researching and making their products that they end up scared out of their minds when it comes to regulations compliance, and just drag their feet on product release. \n\nAs a small business, you need to have your priorities straight. First the customer, then the product, then the money, then maybe the process. The reality of small business is that typically, good process comes only after growth. Don't be the goodie two shoes who has it backwards, because those don't make it.",

    "body": "As we count down the days until West Egg drops, I was about to write my usual Scent Notes column on the website but realized this would probably be a much more appropriate place for it. So here it is, the nuts and bolts of West Egg. It was a fun one to make, especially because I‚Äôm so used to working through the ideas in my head that following a creative brief was a new and exciting challenge. This year I‚Äôm working on creating a private label fragrance line for a brand and so this really helped me get my mindset right for that kind of thing. So thank you, Reddit, for the help! \n\nBut I digress, on to the main event. The starting point of West Egg is the champagne accord that makes up the entirety of the fragrance in the soap, aftershave and toner. To begin, I started with green cognac essential oil, which smells like a white wine without the elements that the barrel and aging process impart into it. A blank slate of a white wine, if you will. To make this a little bit more robust and reflect the minor notes one gets when they are tasting wine, I added other notes of fruit, oak wood, and other (very minor) floral and nutty notes to add to the barrel notes and the crisp bite of the wine. \n\nHowever, we are popping the bubbly here, not sipping on a fine white. This is a celebration! This is where a very era-specific element turns the course from white wine to champagne: aldehydes. While they are sometimes described as fresh and soapy, I always thought a carbonation or champagne analogy was apt, especially when talking about some of the more fruity aldehydes. The largest aldehyde dose is C-10, a citrusy aldehyde that leads the way in the euphoric bubbliness of the champagne accord. On the bottom end, a couple of clean, fresh musks (NOT animal musks, but rather the kind you might smell in dryer sheets) are used in low doses to further exalt the top notes, including the coincidentally named Exaltolide and Cosmone. \n\nSo now that we have the champagne note, we move on to the EdP. I had previously been working on a more somber, wine foug√®re accord, so when I was asked about creating a complementary foug√®re fragrance for the project, I immediately started thinking about how I could modify the foug√®re base to match the vibrancy of the champagne top note as opposed to the smooth, cold white wine top note of a green cognac essential oil that was previously in place. \n\nThe base, of course, is oakmoss (using a combination of a synthentic replacer and a natural oakmoss absolute, with the atranol removed so that it is not violating any bans), coumarin (complemented by bicyclononalactone, a creamy note), and lavender. I used a lavender absolute that is sweeter and more green than a standard lavender essential oil because it seemed befitting of the champagne note, plus an Italian bergamot helps bridge the gap between the lavender and the fruitiness of the champagne. Additionally, the lushness of the coumarin/lactone note is further enhanced by a small dose of a creamy sandalwood note, plus benzoin and a bit of orinox, a rosy/labdanum smelling material. \n\nBeing a fragrance inspired by the Roaring 20s, the oakmoss was enhanced by more rich greenery in the form of the leathery green isobutyl quinolone and traces of various musks (animalic leaning this time). Additionally, floral complements of tuberose and geranium add a bittersweet bite while black currant bud absolute gives those florals some weight. All of those work in tandem with a good dose of helichrysium, a rich floral/tobacco note. \n\nThis was a lot of fun to make in that I got to explore new accords and reimagine ideas in a whole new light. I'm excited to introduce you all to the concept along with Storybook Soapworks to kick off this Gatsby project. ",

UGH!\"\n* more stan greetings.\n* more phone complaining: she \"really loves the pixel\" but it's caused \"a lot of issues\", etc. she keeps making the frustrated \"UGH\" sound through gritted teeth, quite the sensory experience.\n* time to hack up a lung! lodane suggests she's been \"smokin' that dank before stream,\" and cynthia denies it bc \"too paranoid\" üôÑ\n* uh oh! we're getting dangerously low on rosemary! we're also low on sage and lavender. i'm sure that's not a hint, tho.\n* \"tornado?! we had a tornado warning the other day but nothin' ever came,\" and we're right back to talking about her and her *lovely, magical, wonderful* day hiking in the north woods like nbd, y'all.\n* looks like 5 ppl here + me\n* ooo, she's using her emotional support meat grinder box that's never been opened for a tripod.üé∂ *memories / light the corners of my mind / misty watercolor memories / of the way we were* üé∂\n* cheap, steel sauce pan on the scale, 1/2 oz of rosemary ( good for hair growth), 1/4 oz lavender, 1/4 oz of sage ( both good for brunette hair ), 2 cups spring water.\n* she's knows her latest vlogs have been \"light hearted\", but don't worry! she's got \"some heavy sh\\*t\" to drop on us in the next vlog. oh, goodie.\n* it's not tea, tho. it's just therapy and recovery stuff. stuff that she's been goin' through, personally. is there *ever* any other sort of stuff, cynthia?\n* the dickus' beer is still in her fridge but it's cool, guys. she hasn't gotten rid of it bc she figures, eventually, someone will come over and drink it.\n* \"it feels wrong to throw away away beer! that's not how i was raised!\"\n* pot on stove, heat on medium, herb saturation commences.\n* she's not prepared, and now it's time to drag us through the apartment to search for a funnel.\n* desktop PC is still broken, which is why no sims streams, but she's excited to share the little \"command center\" ( *cyber altar?* ) she's got sprawled out on her dining table. 2 desks just are not enough to contain her flow.\n* \"i trust in my ability to navigate through life's changes and uncertainties.\" - positive affirmation on the herb cabinet. \"and i really do! i believe my positive affirmations now... I THINK I AM AN AWESOME PERSON AND I LOVE MYSELF!\" mother earth have mercy.\n* time to complain about how much doing everything on the laptop sucks -- she says lodane is gonna help her fix the desktop.\n* she's been feeling very happy over the past couple of weeks, y'all. she has so many projects planned even tho she regularly overwhelms herself by planning so many projects lol the absurdity.\n* she's filming a new vlog tomorrow which will include stuff she's been dealing with, stuff she's been going through, and some of the realizations she's had about herself + a house cleansing / blessing.\n* babbling at chat -- she just cindy'splained post-it notes üòÇ someone aced a job interview and cynthia had exactly 1, \"that's awesome!\" for them before going right back to talking about herself.\n* like about her new state of being: \"i'm just letting everything flow in and out of my life as it will, i'm just here, i'm just riding the wave, you know what i mean? where ever it goes, where ever it takes me,\" she says, red-faced and laughing. huh.\n* cynthia is giving everyone a short history lesson about [the hot springs, arkansas world's shortest st patrick's day parade](https://shorteststpats.com/history/) and seems salty that this years z-list guest of honor was a dallas cowboys cheerleader.\n* she insists that **she went by herself,** you naughty lil snarkers, and is describing how she met some people and how great she is about pushing herself outside of her comfort zone. her face is bright red, she can't stop playing with her hair and smirking, tho.\n* nervously detailing her schedule -- vlog yesterday, therapy on monday, lots of babbling about how wonderful EMDR has been for her, even tho she's only been doing it for a few weeks lol and they do other stuff, too, y'know. *cynthia gets resources.* like \"the 4 agreements\" by don miguel ruiz.\n* apparently, if you live your life by these 4 agreements, your whole life will be better. this sounds right up cynthia's alley.\n* **1.** **be impeccable with your word. speak with integrity, say only what you mean, avoid using the word to speak against yourself? or to gossip about others. use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.** lol uh oh **2.** **don't take anything personally. nothing others do is bc of you. what others say and do is a projection of their own dream. when you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won't be the victim of needless suffering.** predictably, she really likes this one. peak smug. **3. don't make assumptions. find the courage to ask questions and express what you really want. communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness, and drama. with just this one agreement, you could completely transform your life.** she thinks this one is great, especially for her, for all of the reasons you presume lol *\"i'll just go along with stuff that i don't really want to go along with and then i'll end up resenting the person that i'm going along with.\"* huh. you don't say. **4. always do your best. your best is going to change from moment to moment. it will be different when you're healthy as opposed to sick. under any circumstance, simply do your best and you will avoid self-judgement, self-abuse, and regret.** hooo boy, this is all pure gold for a severely disordered, cluster B youtuber. she can't even pick the one she likes the best.\n* everyone is very impressed with her newly acquired, superhuman ability to simply push any negative thoughts she has right out of her pretty little head bc they simply aren't true and cynthia's not here to live her life based on lies.\n* lots of self-congratulatory, self-help prattling goin' on. 99% cured. happier and happier!\n* she doesn't really mind being alone anymore. when she remembers having *somebody else* there in her space, she thinks that it sounds \"so annoying\" now.\n* she's asking us about the weather lol dogs are doing well.\n* lodane expresses great gratitude for living alone and cynthia concurs. she's only had 1 roommate for about a year between 1st and 2nd husband, and it wasn't too bad. she had one end of the trailer and he had the other. he wasn't too hard to live with *until his girlfriend moved in* el oh el oh el oh el\n* she doesn't want to live with anyone unless she's \"bangin' them\", and even then...\n* time is finally up on her over-boiled and fully steeped herb mixture -- time to strain it directly into the bottle!\n* add however much castile soap you feel like to your rosemary-lavender-sage tea, add however much rosemary essential oil you have left, alert the audience for the 10th time how low you're running on everything, add 5 or 6 drops of lavender essential oil, add 1 dropper full of geogard ECT preservative so it doesn't get all \"moldy and funky\" in your shower, keep talking about how many supplies you need replenished, shake, and voila! shampoo! it looks like literal swamp water ü§≠ but smells amazing.\n* she's moved the dark mystery pilea \"shadow work\" plant ( it's a *him* now for anyone keeping track ) from the plant shelf to the coffee table and if it's important enough for cynthia to document, it's important enough to mention.\n* rent in hot springs is \"insane\" and she's feeling lucky that she got the deal that she did. she's loving apartment life as a single lady bc she can just call maintenance and not have to be worried or be bothered with all of that. she's no longer even interested in buying a house any time soon bc she's not going to do it alone, btw.\n* she's been out of coke zeroes for 2 whole days and she hasn't bought any, but mostly bc she doesn't want to go to the store lol still, a win is a win is a win when you're cindy. \"i'm gettin' healthy by bein' lazy.\"\n* oopsie daisy! the PO box auto-renewed for 6 months after she ignored the letter they sent her about it.\n* we're at the part of the stream where stans just ask inane questions, so, it's about to get random, y'all.\n* she likes to burn incense in the kitchen bc her entire apartment reeks when she burns the bacon, she hates silicone ice trays and prefers the $0.50 hard plastic \"cracky boys\", but loves the silicone trays for making wax melts, and other crafts she doesn't do, nothing in the apartment needs fixing atm, she keeps empty soda boxes and plastic folgers coffee containers in her \"empty, sad, and dirty\" fridge, thinks she'll need to take an entire day to wipe her fridge out, cletus' condiments ( weird mustards, horseradish, peanut butter, etc.  ) are all still in there bc she'd never, ever eat any of *that* stuff.\n* someone suggests a \"clean your fridge livestream\", which she could be doing right now rather than bore me to death about why she keeps coffee in there when the internet tells her not to or why she keeps the pepto in it, she doesn't drink beer, she says it's disgusting and tastes like carbonated piss in case anyone cares to remember oktoberfest 2023, she used to keep her coffee in the cabinet when *someone* was there and the fridge was always full of food, the apt complex sends an exterminator to spray for bugs every 3 mos, there are spiders outside in the summer ( ?? wtf, y'all üòÇ ), and cynthia's terrified of spiders. one time, cletus opened a door and a spider fell on him. riveting.\n* 3 biggest fears are buried alive, heights, and spiders, she experiences the call of the void and cannot trust herself anywhere high up, \"big ass, hairy tarantulas\" used to come out at one of her old places in hot springs, someone made a saw joke and she didn't get it, her sister was once stung by a scorpion while their parents weren't home, cynthia would never bungee jump, skydive, or scuba dive bc she's also afraid of the ocean, she once went down a reddit rabbit hole about cave diving and decided that those people are all stupid, needs to go to the grocery store after the stream to get food and coke zero, has to feed and walk the dogs, make a hair rinse, work on her website, and do some meditation and \"some spiritual stuff\" ( with jazz hands ), and watch self-help youtube videos,\n* she's stopped listening to all true crime bc it was just putting her on \"a bad vibration\" and although she finds it fascinating, she needs that out of her life bc she's \"cleaning up her mental space\", she's stopped listening to \"certain music\" ( as yet, unnamed ) bc it was bringing her down, she's only listening to things that are uplifting and positive, she's disappointed with the stan who mentions old fashioned coca cola recipes without mentioning \"THE COCAINE!\", she didn't tell her therapist ( singular ) that she's into true crime but she's sure the therapist would tell her not to listen to it, but she just decided that all on her own bc she could tell how it makes her feel and omg, please F'ing kill me now, and she's really trying to stay in tune with her inner self and how she feels about things and keep things out of her life that are \"toxic\".\n* she wants no negativity, only positivity, blah blah blah.\n* she likes diet coke but prefers coke zero, she's really trying to stick to \"spring water\", trying to get healthier in all aspects of her life, mostly focused on her mental health but also on her physical health, she's still working out, has been unsuccessful at avoiding fast food, she spent all of her teenage years in downtown hot springs \"causin' trouble\", cynthia wishes she could grow opium poppies, she wants to grow roses on her covered balcony, she wants to come up with more projects to do for streams instead of her just ranting about pOsItIvItY aNd sH\\*t, cynthia wants and wants and wants, she's thinking of doing \"extended versions\" of her vlogs in streams.\n* time to wrap it up!  F\\*CKING FINALLY! more vlogs to come, maybe sims streams if lodane can help with her computer, no sims streams if they can't, we all saw how sad her fridge was, we all know she needs to go to the grocery store, and she'll *try* to resist the coke zero / diet coke. lucky us.

    "body": "So over the last two months, I ordered a bunch of Solstice Scents samples. I also had a tiny sample collection from last year so I figure that I might as well compile all my notes into a review. \n\nIt might be too early in the year to say this, but Solstice Scents has quickly risen to one of my more favorite brands as far as indie perfumes go. The TAT is incredibly fast (I literally got the shipping notification for one order within the hour of ordering. It's insane.) and Angela is quite active in the Facebook group and has helped me (and others) pick out and narrow down what we might enjoy. The members in the group are also so sweet and helpful and there were more hits than there were misses as far as suggestions go. \n\nAnyway, these are all based off of the notes I took down as I tested them and some I've already destashed. They won't be very long, but I hope that it at least helps someone out if they're thinking about ordering from SS.\n\n----------------------\n\n**Basilica** - Rich labdanum absolute paired with effervescent frankincense, polished rosewood, dark myrrh, exotic woods and a waft of heavenly sweet and rich vanilla absolute and fragrant ashes. \n\nSmoky and woody right off the bat, frankincense being the most prominent on my skin. Slightly sweet with just the right touch of spice. Reminds me of an old wood church with polished wooden pews. \n\n**Blackburn's Parlor** - Vanilla Waffle Bowl, Vanilla & Chocolate Ice Creams, Sliced Bananas Smothered In Caramel Sauce & Topped With Whipped Cream.\n\nVanilla and bananas stood out first for me, but then the warm waffle bowls and caramel started to show up and it smelled just like an ice cream parlor. Reminded me of Coldstones lol. \n\n**Black Leather, Red Lace** - A stirring blend of Amber, Vanilla and Leather.\n\nSmooth leather pretty much on my skin and nothing else.\n\n**Chantilly Cream** - Whipped Cream, Peach Nectar, Vanilla & Yellow Mandarin EO\n\nI got this awhile back and have long destashed it, but I still have the notes on it. It's a fairly straightforward scent: sweet and creamy fruits. Like one of those fruit salads! It was nice, but I already had other fruity scents that I liked better. \n\n**Conjure** - Blend of Amber, Vanillas, Cedar, All Spice, Cauldron Smoke and lots of other Essential Oils. \n\nSpicy-sweet smoke and warm amber. It becomes a warm vanilla with a touch of spice on the dry down. Definitely let this rest. I made a mistake when I first got this over a year ago and tried it fresh out of the mail--it was all spice and it turned me off from it. I let this sample sit for a week and I got this beautiful scent. \n\n**Conjure Dark** - Amber, Frankincense, Sweet Incense Smoke, Dried Rose Petals, Sandalwood, Vetiver, Woods, Oud, Vanilla\n\nStrong incense, heavy on the frankincense when first applied, and deep amber. The vanilla comes out and softens everything up on the dry down, but it's still a pretty dark and deep scent. Not as sweet as Conjure, though there is a touch of sweetness that takes the edge off of the frankincense. The rose lingered in the background for me and wasn't very prominent. \n\n**Estate Vanilla** - Raw Vanilla Pods, Vanilla Infused Sugar, Cream & Vanilla Extract. Our Rich House Vanilla\n\nThe only EDP sample I have that someone was generous enough to give to me. At first it smelled like sharp vanilla extract, but as it dried it became this smooth, rich vanilla. I can see why a lot of people love it. If it weren't so out of my budget, I'd be snagging a bottle of this. \n\n**Foxcroft Fairgrounds** - Cotton Candy, Cream Soda, Vanilla Taffy, Gridling's Funnel Cakes, Powdered Sugar, Crisp Fall Air, Woodsmoke & a Tendril of Incense.\n\nThis was an autumn festival packed in a vial. It smelled of sweet treats carried on cool fall air, the powdered sugar on fresh out of the fryer funnel cakes, the scent of distant woodsmoke, and soft incense just wafting around everything. It really did smell like a fair in the middle of a perfect fall day.\n\n**Gehenna** - Red Musk, Dragon's Blood Resin, Amber, Burning Wood, Somalian Myrrh, Egyptian Musk, Oud\n\nDeep red musk, smoky resins and wood. There's a touch of sweetness/floral here that rounds everything up nicely, but I don't know where it's coming from. The dragon's blood maybe? The scent makes me think of a very deep, dark red color.\n\n**Incensum** - Amber, Frankincense, Palo Santo, Myrrh, Spices, Attars, Oud, Vetiver & more. \n\nThis one is similar to Basilica, but lighter and sweeter. The amber comes off as warm and golden. The incense is a bit strong at first, but softens as it dries.\n\n**Inquisitor** - A Dark Resinous Blend of Leather, Labdanum, Beeswax, Frankincense, Benzoin, Palo Santo, Vetiver & Fire\n\nThis one was... wow. It comes at you right off the bat. Leather, fire, almost sharp and bitter frankincense, and dusty beeswax. As it dried, the beeswax warmed and sweetened, softening the bite of the leather. It's still dark and resin heavy, with incense smoke just curling around everything. It's quite masculine on me so I tried it on my husband and it's just so. damn. good on him. <3 The leather is a bit more prominent, but after the initial sting, it becomes this soft, supple leather note with a warmer, dare I say, sexier beeswax. This was one of my favorites.\n\n**Lavender Vanilla** - Simple blend of Lavender Essential Oil paired with sweet creamy vanilla and smooth French Vanilla.\n\nBeautifully simple lavender and vanilla. Another lovely bedtime scent. It's creamy lavender at first, herby but not sharp, and it fades off into a warm, cozy vanilla. I also bought a glace of this and using both makes for a very relaxing bedtime.\n\n**Manor** - Woody-Vanilla Musk, Vanilla & Glorious Aloeswood\n\nI don't know how else to describe this but as a wonderful, smooth woody-vanilla. So wearable and subtle, making it a great everyday sort of scent. \n\n**Manor Fire** - Manor, Smoke, Charred Wood, Melted Beeswax (Vegan), Wood Resin, Dry Wood, Burning Leaves, Worn Leather.\n\nThis one is Manor, but smoky, dark, and dusty. The leather note is the softer, supple sort.. different from the one in Inquisitor. Manor is still present and helps round all of the sharper notes out.\n\n**Minister** - Sandalwood, Amber, Cassia, Elemi, Sweet Smoke & Somalian Frankincense\n\nThis one was a fail on me, so take my thoughts with a grain of salt. I don't know what happened, I'm guessing skin chemistry though, but this smelled like sweet, damp, rotting wood. That's all. No amber, smoke, or frankincense.. just damp, rotting wood.\n\n**Nightgown** - Vanilla, White Chocolate, Tuberose & Tiare Flowers\n\nI loved this at first, but as it rested, something about it became incredibly powdery on me. Before that though, it was sweet vanilla'd white florals and rich white chocolate.\n\n**Nightwatcher** - Forest Floor, Tree Tops, Bark, Mountain Air, Fir Balsam, Juniper, Moss, Oud, Dried Herbs, Cedar Tips\n\nOverwhelmingly green, sharp, and herby that I ended up scrubbing it off after a few minutes. I think it was another case of cedar taking over and that was the sharpness that I was picking up. I also have a bad history with fir and juniper, so go figure. \n\n**Rose Mallow Cream** - Moroccan Rose absolute, Bulgarian Rose absolute, Marshmallow Fluff, Strawberry Nectar, White Chocolate, Vanilla, White Musk \n\nI'll admit that even after resting, I ended up scrubbing this one off after a few minutes. It was super sweet and powdery rose.. the same kind of powdery that I noticed with Nightgown. Maybe it's the white chocolate and my skin not playing nice?\n\n**Scrying Smoke** - Natural and meditative melting Frankincense Resin, Frankincense Smoke, Vanilla, Sandalwood, Cedar, Petitgrain, Vetiver, Labdanum & much more.\n\nAnother one that my skin decided to screw up. This one was mostly sharp cedar for the longest, longest time. If I really concentrate, I can pick up the incense, but the incense here doesn't come off as soft and warm but more 'cool' and 'crisp'. After smelling like I've been rolling around in my dog's bedding all day, all I'm left with at the end is smoky vanilla.\n\n**Smokewood Apiary** - Smoked Honey, Creamed Honey, Beeswax, Amber, Wooden Frames, Ginger & Vanilla\n\nI had some reservations with this since honey and I typically don't get along. But this one... this one! Oof... so, so good. It's creamy, smoky honey that sat close to my skin and never overpowered. The woody and amber notes come out in a little bit and it becomes this soft and cozy scent. It reminded me of Arcana's Snug, except Smokewood Apiary had just the faintest touch of spice that toned down the sweetness.\n\n**Smoky Mountain Mallow** - Wood Smoke, Fossilized Amber Resin, Lapsang Souchong CO2, Guaiacwood, Labdanum, Nutmeg EO, Marshmallow. \n\nSDFKSLJDLSKDJF I LOVE THIS!!! I have no idea how Angela does this, but this smells like I'm sitting next to a roaring bonfire, toasting marshmallows and the smell of both are just wafting together in the wind. Later on when dry, it's toasted, maybe slightly burnt but in a good way, marshmallows. Love, love, love!\n\n**Snowshoe Pass** - White Amber, White Musk, Vanilla Accord, Peppermint Cream, Cold Winds\n\nSnowshoe Pass was the loveliest, softest peppermint I think I've ever smelled. Reminds me a bit of those butter mints, but without the artificial sweetness. It's a little 'cold' at first, but dried it's this fluffy, cozy peppermint. A mintier White Fox, if you will.  \n\n**Sycamore Chai** - Vanilla Chai Tea & A Ginger-Pumpkin Roll Filled With Marshmallow Creme.\n\nSo, I'll be honest. I don't really enjoy the smell of pumpkin and had I seen that this had a pumpkin note, I probably would have not picked this out. It's very much pumpkin right off the bat with chai spices blended in with it. The pumpkin smells soft, warm, and fluffy which I'm guessing is the marshmallow creme. I thought the spices would overwhelm everything like it normally does on me, but the pumpkin was the star of the show here. \n\n**Whispers in the Night** - Jasmine, Tuberose, Vanilla Orchid, Coconut, White Amber, Sandalwood, Amber, Ylang Ylang, EotN Base\n\nTwo words: cat pee. I could smell it before I even opened the vial. I was hoping that SS would be another house whose jasmine notes my skin would play nice with, but nope. It sucks, because this blend sounded really lovely and I wish that I could have experienced it.\n\n**White Fox** - Vanilla Musk, White Fur, Wood Blend, Frozen Dirt, Snow\n\nWhite Fox reminds me so much of my doggy <3. It's a fuzzy, cozy scent that's a little 'cold' when you first apply. It reminds me of the smell of my dog after just taking a walk on a rather cool day, if that makes sense? It's makes for a lovely bedtime scent for me. ",

This course made use of the Rita Mulcahy curriculum, including the textbook, flashcards, and FASTrack software. My other 5 hours came from a leadership course I took through my company. From those two elements alone, I had 47 education hours total. So I was definitely set for my education hours.\n\nI am a previous home-schooler, so I've learned how to study on my own, what works/doesn't work for me, and broke up my study sessions accordingly. I broke down my studying in three phases.  **I don't know if I would necessarily recommend this study plan for others for two reasons: 1. I'm a slow reader and 2. I‚Äôm an overly conscientious study nerd.** It easily would take me 3 hours to read 30 pages because I would read a sentence, not understand what I read, and re-read it. When it's fiction, I'm a speed reader, but this sort of material makes my eyes glaze over. So I have to be super intentional and focused while reading. As you can imagine, reading through the text three times took me quite a while!  I wish I didn't get distracted so easily.\n\n# Study Phases\n\n\\------------\n\n**Phase I - Focus on orientation and digesting all the new information - June to August (Perceived effort level - Hard)**\n\n1. Complete the 10 week PMP education course.\n2. Read through Rita's text while reading the corresponding chapters in PMBOK. I highlighted like crazy and did all the exercises.\n3. Take the chapter quizzes. I was averaging 74% on those, BUT I was \"cheating\" by going back through the chapter if I became stuck on a question. Obviously not the ideal way to do this. I'd be curious to know how much lower my scores would have been had I not done this.\n4. Ask tons of questions. I'm sure I drove my teacher crazy with all the questions I asked him.\n\n\\------------\n\n**Phase II - Deep dive into the material, really starting to understand the concepts and develop my own study guide - August to October (Perceived effort level - Intensive)**\n\n1. By this point, my class was complete. I read through Rita's text a second time. It's true, the concepts that were previously vague and confusing somehow just become more clear when you start speaking PMI's language. It was kind of crazy going back over my questions I asked of my teacher. I would read my questions to him and be like \"You're such an idiot for not understanding that! It makes perfect sense now.\" Things just started to click.\n2. This read-through of the text was different though. I wrote out my own flashcards of the \"Terms to Know\" listed at the beginning of each chapter. Yes, this was in addition to the flashcards included in the curriculum. Overkill? Perhaps, but like hell if I had to re-take this test and pay the fee. These self-made flashcards were going to become part of my study guide to utilize in Phase III. I re-did all the exercises in Rita's text. To reinforce my highlights, I underlined. If there was a call out for tips, tricks, or \"PMI-isms\", I typed those out or made copies. This material was intended to be part of my self-made study guide as well.\n3. Instead of reading the corresponding chapters in PMBOK this time around, I just read the pages referenced in Rita's text. For example, if I was in Rita's Cost Management chapter and there was a reference to \"pg 123\" in the PMBOK, I would skim that section in the PMBOK and continue my reading in Rita.\n4. At this point, I **didn't** re-do the chapter tests. That was saved for Phase III.\n5. I tried to average 2 chapters every week. At the end of each week, I would:\n   1. go through my (free) phone app quizzes - *see bottom of post for list of apps I used*\n   2. review all flashcards for the corresponding chapters\n   3. review all PMI-isms and Tricks of the Trade for the corresponding chapters\n   4. read over related study material I found online - *see links at the bottom of post*\n   5. review the class presentation for the corresponding chapters\n   6. write out the process groups and play Rita's process game\n6. At the end of this phase, I took my first practice test using Rita's FASTrack (200 questions in 3 h, 39m). I scored a 76%. I reviewed all the wrong answers in addition to my marked answers. I felt pretty good about this score.\n7. Ultimately, my self-made study guide was comprised of:\n   1. Process summaries I wrote out as I read\n   2. Rita's Tricks of the trade/Things to memorize/PMI-isms\n   3. [ITTOs print out](https://www.examspm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ExamsPMMindMaps.pdf)\n   4. Frequently used tools and techniques (not sure where I found this)\n   5. Documents versus plans - in PMBOK pg 559\n   6. Flashcards (self made and Rita)\n   7. PMI Code of Ethics\n   8. PMP Handbook\n   9. PMP Exam Content outline\n   10. Phone apps\n8. During this phase, I completed my application.  I spent 16 hours collectively compiling my application information.  I reviewed several different templates before settling on one I found acceptable.  [Highly recommend it](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gE-WgurUB4QipvQKxvPM-KNIUoMigRWA/view?usp=sharing).  I did my absolute best to prevent an audit.  I read articles online ad nauseum with tips and tricks on how to prevent an audit.  It didn't matter - I was audited less than 1 minute after submitting my application.  So that was annoying after all the time I spent trying to prevent it.  Luckily, because I spent so much time trying to prevent the issue, I was fully prepared for the audit and passed it within a week's time.  All projects I included involved folks still at the company.  That was absolutely intentional, so I had them on standby ready to review and back up my project work.  There was a part of me worried that PMI would say, \"No your application is still insufficient.\"  But everything fell into place.\n\n\\------------\n\n**Phase III - Skim Rita a final time, only reading highlighted or underlined sections and review my self-made study guide - October to November** **(Perceived effort level - Moderate)**\n\n1. I averaged at least 19 pages daily for 3.5 weeks. I re-took the chapter tests, comparing them against my old scores. Overall, I averaged a 90% which is a **significant** improvement from my 74% average. And no cheating this time!\n2. I took another FASTrack practice test (200 questions in 3 h, 29 m) while skimming the book a third time through. I scored an 82% and again reviewed all incorrect and marked questions.\n3. After I finished my third skim through, I wanted to see how I would do with a non-Rita practice [test](https://www.oliverlehmann.com/contents/free-downloads/200_PMP_Sample_Questions.pdf). I'd become used to her format. So I wanted to try a different format to see how I did. I finished 200 questions in 3h, 50 m and scored a 77%. I found this practice [test](https://www.oliverlehmann.com/contents/free-downloads/200_PMP_Sample_Questions.pdf) frustrating because there were questions related to project management articles that had nothing to do with PMBOK. I tallied those questions and **didn't** calculate them as part of my exam score.\n4. I took several smaller practice exams ranging from 20 to 75 questions.  *See links at bottom of post.* I also took 20 question quizzes on each of the KA's in FASTrack. Always checked my wrong answers to understand why I got them wrong.\n5. I read through the study [guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tcfq22MdUzyF3dfD-EYVqfu4--b3T7by/view) someone posted.\n6. I went through my self-made study guide and asked my teacher any residual questions I had.\n7. I took one last non-Rita practice [test](https://www.examspm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/200-PMBOK-6th-Edition-Practice-Questions.pdf) (200 questions - not sure on time). I scored a 75%. Like the previous non-Rita [test](https://www.examspm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/200-PMBOK-6th-Edition-Practice-Questions.pdf), I found this practice test frustrating because there were questions related to project management articles that had nothing to do with PMBOK. I tallied those questions and **didn't** calculate them as part of my exam score.\n\n# In the days leading up to my test‚Ä¶.\n\n1. I reviewed the PMBOK glossary and key concepts at the beginning of each KA in the PMBOK.\n2. Took 20 question quizzes on each process management group in FASTrack.\n3. I started to develop a brain dump and then realized I didn't want to do a brain dump before starting the exam. My time was too valuable and I hadn't done one for any of my four practice tests. I instead used this as a condensed study guide in the final days leading up to my exam, along with my [ITTO diagram print out](https://www.examspm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ExamsPMMindMaps.pdf).\n4. I skimmed the PMP handbook, PMI Code of Ethics, and PMP Exam Content outline.\n5. I reviewed test tips and tricks I found [online](https://www.pmbypm.com/how-to-answer-pmp-questions/) and in Rita's text.\n6. I did Rita's process game several times.\n7. I did one last 75 question practice exam in FASTrack. I got an 85%. At this point, I felt as ready as I ever was going to be.\n8. I started having sinus issues - quite common in my area of the country around this time of year where the weather is bipolar.  I immediately made an appointment with the doctor for preventative action.  Came out with a steroid shot.  The last thing I wanted was to be sick as a dog for the exam after all this prep.  I loaded up on zinc, Vitamin C, and Sudafed.  I really think this helped because I felt okay on exam day.\n\n# The night before‚Ä¶\n\nI reviewed my brain dump sheet and [ITTOs diagram](https://www.examspm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ExamsPMMindMaps.pdf). I did all the self-care things: bedtime yoga, lavendar bath, gave myself a manicure, massage from my hubs, face mask, ate a cookie, etc. I went to bed early, but woke up throughout the night, worried I was going to sleep through my alarm.  (I even had my husband set his alarm just in case!)  I don't think I got the best sleep possible, even though I took melatonin.\n\n# D-Day‚Ä¶.\n\nI have anxiety, so I called the test center ahead of my appointment to determine if I would have physical paper or a whiteboard, a physical calculator, etc. I wanted physical scratch paper and a physical calculator.  I was pleased to have both.  I was also pleased to find out I was able to bring my own earplugs.\n\nThe woman was super understanding, saying \"Sure! Anything to help with your test anxiety.\"  She gave me very descriptive directions and gave me recommendations on what to wear to the testing center. **Basically don't wear pockets if you want your break times to be as seamless as possible.**  They have to do verification **every** time you come back from break(s), so if you're worried about being in a time crunch, be mindful of this.  In fact, this is why I only took one five minute break.  They went as far as verifying my signature on my DL and checking my DL picture against my face.  Very nice staff though.\n\nThe woman I spoke with also told me to get there when the doors opened and I could possibly get started early. She said it was going to be a busy day.  That concerned me because I get distracted very easily.  Yes, the center was busier than usual, but my earplugs and the center's noise cancelling headphones REALLY helped.  (Unfortunately, this also amplified my racing heart the entire time.)\n\nI left my house with **plenty** of time to get there.  I snorted some lavender essential oil before going in. (I'm only half joking. I was a complete ball of nerves.)\n\nI was the first one to sign in to the center.  The guy joked saying, \"You're ready to go!\"  To which I said, \"You have no idea!\"  Took no time to sign in and get my belongings sorted.  I get seated and expect TWO tutorials from what I had read from online articles.  The first tutorial was supposed to be for the exam center and the second was supposed to be PMI specific.  I just went through the center's tutorial and BAM I was looking at my exam.  So that threw me off a bit since I was expecting something after that first tutorial.  It took my 10 minutes to read through the exam.  Knowing the strike through and highlight features helped me, so I don't recommend skipping the tutorial.\n\nBefore going into the exam, I received the best advice from a friend: \"Because you're a ball of nerves, you should review your first 10 questions after you get in the groove.\"  I did exactly this.  In my initial moments of panic, I thought there wasn't a \"previous\" button - meaning I *thought* I wasn't able to go back through my first few questions I had answered.  I had clicked the \"review\" button and it somehow made the \"previous\" button disappear briefly.  I managed to figure it out, but feel this wasn't covered well in the tutorial.\n\nThe questions that seemed to come up most frequently were around QUALITY and CHANGE MANAGEMENT.  There were some questions on risk, communication, procurement, and stakeholder engagement.  Seemed heavily weighted toward quality and change management though.\n\nThere were roughly 5 EVM questions - a couple on CPI, one on EAC, a few on CV/SV.  Nothing on PTA.  There was 1 network diagram.  The graph used in the question was formatted in a way that took me a moment to decipher, but once I interpreted it, it was an easy question.\n\nThere were some questions that were so easy I thought they were trick questions. There were others where any of the four options seemed viable!  Every question I answered, I tried to ask myself, \"Do you feel good about that answer to move forward?\"  The main thing I was worried about was, \"Will the questions look anything like FASTrack?\"  If they didn't, I think I would have been thrown off.  But I felt the format was quite similar to Rita's software thankfully.  In fact, it made me feel like I was taking a practice test in FASTrack.  I believe all questions were new.  None were incredibly lengthy either.  Some were short to the point I couldn't sometimes tell what process the question was referencing.\n\nI DID end up doing a \"brain dump\" of sorts.  I wrote out the planning process according to Rita's text.  This helped me on MAYBE 2 questions though.  I also wrote out exam tips: \"What should I do NEXT?\"  \"What option is BEST?\"  A self-encouragement note was written across the top: \"You got this!  Congrats!\"  The last three months of my study, all I did was visualize the congratulations page.  I couldn't imagine any other scenario except me passing.\n\nI don't think my heart slowed down the entire test time.  I set a pace for myself - 1 question per minute.  This put me at finishing all questions at 3 hours and 20 minutes.  So that left me 40 minutes to review.  After 86 questions, I took one 5 minute break to go to the restroom and eat a few walnuts.  I read the best foods for focus were eggs and walnuts.  So naturally, I had a hard-boiled egg for breakfast and had some walnuts for snacks.  I can attest to not wearing pockets really helped my check in process quicker.\n\nI finished all 200 questions on pace at 3 hours and 20 minutes.  I debated taking a bathroom break, but realized I had 65 questions marked for review.  This meant I had less than 1 minute to review each question.  So I didn't want to risk it.  I quickly skimmed all my marked questions, changing 8.  In the long run, it's probably best I didn't have more time to review my marked questions because I probably would have second guessed myself and made changes to my detriment.  In practice tests, when I changed answers, my changed answers got me 10 questions more right, so I felt good about my 8 answer changes.\n\nThe worst moment was right before I hit the \"Submit\" button.  I had 5 minutes left and asked myself, \"Did you do your best?\"  I answered, \"Yes, and at this point, it doesn't matter because there are only 5 minutes left.\" So I hit \"Submit\", QUICKLY went through the survey.  I would have felt bad not completing the survey because the staff was so nice.  So I selected \"Satisfied\" for all 9 answers.  The worst part.... \"Please wait...\"  And then, \"Congratulations on passing your PMP Exam.\"\n\nI was so over-stimulated from nerves, anxiety, and countless hours of studying, I literally started crying.  I wanted pomp and circumstance to play as I walked out of that center.  I've never been more proud of myself.   I'm more proud of this than my B.S. degree.\n\n# Lessons Learned\n\n* I became frustrated with some of the material I came across. Granted, I tried to use all free resources. But I downloaded probably 8+ free apps that claimed they were using the 6th edition, only to realize they were referencing old PMBOK processes.  I deleted those and didn't include them in my list below.  The same thing applied to some of the practice tests I took.  If you're going to claim to be up to date, be up to date!\n* Additionally, some of the practice tests I took that were recommended included questions related to project management articles, **not** the PMBOK.\n* I wouldn't have \"cheated\" my first round through the chapter quizzes.\n* I would have waited to read the PMBOK until after reading through RITA the second time. Most of the concepts went over my head my first time through. I feel like I would have understood the PMBOK better after my second round of Rita's text.\n* I would not have studied the weekend before the test. I wish I relaxed more. I just wanted to make sure I was as ready as I could possibly be.\n* I noticed some disparities between Rita's text and the PMBOK.\n   * Sources of conflict in PMBOK are ordered differently than in Rita.  In PMBOK, it is scarce resources, scheduling priorities, and personal work styles.  In Rita, it is schedule, priorities, and resources.\n   * In PMBOK, the last closing task is to measure customer satisfaction.  In Rita, the last closing task is to archive project documents.  (I think this is the reason I got NI in closing.  I did well on the practice tests in this process management process.  I would have loved AT in all processes, but I don't care.  I passed above target overall.)\n\n# iPhone Applications\n\n* PMP Mastery\n* Grey Campus PMP ITTOs\n* PMP Exam Prep\n* PMP Smart Practice Test\n* PMP Pocket Prep\n* PMP Formulas\n* PMP Exam Mentor\n*

    "body": "Poesie's \"Fall Favorites\" collection is coming on this Friday, October 20! This is a mixed bag of past autumnal scents, chosen in part from a poll in the Poesie Facebook group where we all voted for ones we especially wanted to see return (and then from there Joelle presumably also took other factors, like component availability, into account). Since the initial list of perfumes was quietly [posted on their \"Upcoming Releases\" page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/171hspz/poesies_upcoming_returning_fall_favorites/) (I posted it here on IMAM and we had a lovely discussion), she has added another one to the upcoming release: **Introvert Goblin**, which is *spectacular* as far as I'm concerned because I *really* want to upsize my decant and missed it when the Ghosts and Goblins miscellany were briefly around earlier this fall.\n\nAnyway, I have tried all but one (**Autumn Shadows**) of these returning Fall Favorites, so I thought I'd offer my thoughts in case they help you make your wishlist. If you've tried these too, I'd love to hear what you think - do your experiences line up with mine? Which one is your favorite?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Autumn Shadows** \\[Spiced peach butter spread on sweet brown bread, a vase of chrysanthemums in the center of a mahogany table, a lingering hint of amber perfume\\] - This is the only one of these returning Fall Favorites that I haven't tried. I don't get along well with Nui Cobalt's spiced peach note; how does Poesie's compare? (If you've tried both?) And how much literal foody bread is there?\n\n**Black Cat Cuddles** \\[Sweet coconut milk spiked with clove, cinnamon & black pepper, incense-dusted fur, flecks of black vanilla bean, a distant pine forest\\] - On me, this one is mostly a milky, almost buttery coconut milk, with some underlying autumnal spices (but they're not nearly as strong as I expected). After a few minutes for the coconut milk to settle, some evergreen trees (mostly pine) join it. Personally I would call this atmospheric rather than snuggly, though I know a lot of folks consider this to be a really cuddly perfume. I won't be upsizing it because for me the balance of this perfume is off - I get *no* incense (though I know some folks get almost *entirely* incense, so it's clearly a my-skin-chem thing) and mostly just buttery coconut milk.\n\n**Cozy** \\[Spicy cardamom + rich vanilla featuring our favorite 100% natural cardamom\\] - Too few notes? Probably. But I don‚Äôt care - it's vibrant spiced cardamom and a snuggly, buttery vanilla, and I am *happy*. On my Poesie cardamom enjoyment scale, this falls below **Comfort** \\[Toasted cardamom pods, pink peppercorn, precious resins, sandalwood flower, cashmere blankets, warm vanilla musk\\]; right around **Habibi** \\[Cardamom, amber honey in the comb, cinnamon + ginger, an opulent amber blended of precious resins and dark vanilla, henna flower, sandalwood incense\\] and **Cardigan** \\[Creamy Mysore sandalwood spiced with cardamom pods & pimento berries, French vanilla, white chocolate, comforting sweater musk\\]; and above **S√∂tnos** \\[Freshly baked buttery rolls filled with cardamom-spiked sugar and drizzled with a sweet glaze of vanilla and condensed milk, a small cup of sweet black tea\\].\n\n**Introvert Goblin** (this was originally released as \"**Introverted Goblin**\" and I'm not sure why the name changed) \\[Chai tea with extra cardamom, a cozy stack of old books, marshmallow, sweet pumpkin flesh enrobed in warm pumpkin spice\\] - Pumpkin and chai spices with EXTRA CARDAMOM, over the Poesie marshmallow base? Sign me up!! Last year the Goblins were only released as 5 mls and I couldn't commit to a blind-bought full-size, so I ordered an Ajevie sample and crossed my fingers that I wouldn't regret missing out on the chance to buy a full bottle. Marshmallow and pumpkin make a fluffy, creamy base; above it are beautiful baking spices (fellow cardamom lovers will want to know that cardamom is definitely here, but not nearly as prominent as in **Cardigan** or **Comfort** or **Cozy**). The \"old books\" notes is here as a strongly-present but gentle and velvety leather. I'm not usually one for leather notes, but Poesie has slowly convinced me that theirs works for me; for example in **Tempus Fugit** \\[Precious sandalwood, spilled blackberry wine, wheels of golden amber, antique lace, a forgotten rose pressed in the pages of an ancient leather-bound book\\] especially, and also in **Myself Invisible** \\[Stacked books, spilled ink, black tea, shy violets hiding deep in the forest\\]. **Introvert Goblin** also blooms beautifully for a few hours, the creamy pumpkin coming a bit more forward...but then after just a few hours it's gone. That's the only downside, that it has lower longevity than most Poesies for me. Last year I considered it \"a gorgeous cozy autumnal scent and one I'm enjoying very much\" but also one I didn't need to upsize. This fall, however, I've been wearing it *all the time* and I'm so glad to have this chance to get some more - given the low longevity, I've been going through my decant quicker than normal.\n\n**Sweet Sleep** \\[Caramelized pumpkin flesh, pumpkin pie spices, creamy vanilla, blonde woods, natural lavender essential oil and absolute\\] - Creamy pumpkin pie with all the pumpkin spice, and a kiss of fairly herbal lavender. It dries down to a snuggly, creamy pumpkin-vanilla. I liked this perfume better last year when it was new, though - at the time, the lavender was fairly sweet and light, but aging has made it sharper and more herbal. That being said, I'm still keeping it - I have tried a *lot* of pumpkin+lavender scents (I went on a whole pumpkin+lavender spree last year and sought out a lot of versions from different houses) and this is the my favorite of all of them.\n\n**Thrushcross Grange** \\[Creamy pumpkin flesh & soft vanilla creme, caramelized sugar, a faded whisper of honeysuckle\\] - It's sweeter than my usual taste, but I enjoy this one - it's perfect for early fall. Sweetened cooked pumpkin with a hint of nutmeg (yet this is not a pumpkin pie), along with an almost burnt sugar note and vanilla extract (not the same vanilla as the typical Poesie vanilla musk base, which I do not get here). I'm not certain I make out honeysuckle on its own, and yet there is something floral wafting ethereally through this scent that really helps to make it a late summer/early fall scent rather than a \"depths of autumn / give me all the pumpkins\" perfume. This one was *all the rage* (and sold out, like, *immediately*) when the Reissue leftovers came out at the end of this past summer, which made me really glad I had sprung for mine with the Reissue pre-order. I know a lot of folks are really relieved this will be part of Fall Favorites so they can get a chance to try it.\n\n# Personally...\n\nThe only one I'm going to upsize this time around is **Introvert Goblin** (with great glee!). (The only reason I'm not upsizing **Cozy** is because I already have plenty. Any cardamom-lover should *absolutely* try it!!) Meanwhile, should I try **Autumn Shadows**? (Convince me!)\n\n# Where these live in my collection:\n\n* **Thrushcross Grange** is in the \"Early fall\" subsection of my fall perfumes\n* **Black Cat Cuddles** is in the \"Not pumpkins\" subsection of my fall perfumes\n* **Introvert Goblin** is in the \"Cozy\" subsection of my fall perfumes\n* **Sweet Sleep** is in the \"Pumpkins\" subsection of my fall perfumes\n* **Cozy** is in the \"Cardamom\" section subsection of my fall perfumes\n* (None of these were ever destashed! It's a really excellent set of perfumes.)\n\n&#x200B;",

Black Cat Cuddles is pretty incensey for me, and I don't really get the coconut milk at all.\n\nI'm pretty sure I'm going to order Cozy because I can't seem to have enough cardamom these days, and I'm still debating all of the pumpkin ones - I really like the few pumpkin perfumes I've tried (all Arcana Wildcraft) but I'm trying to figure out if I need more of that in my life. Maybe I'm happy enough with just those, you know?",

        "body": "Lovely reviews as always! Thank you for posting! \n\nI find Poesie's peach note to be a bit sweeter, more juicy, and more realistic than Nui Cobalt's. For me, the peach in Autumn Shadows doesn't feel spiced, it feels more like a subtle spice in the bread if anything. It's not very strong spice, mind you - the balance for me is fresh ripe peaches, brown bread, and amber, that fades into a lightly sweetened, cuddly, bready golden amber. The bread is pretty literal for me for most of the wear (a reason why I love it!!), and it's unsweetened. The amber, along with the supporting notes of wood and chrysanthemum pull the scent away from too literal a gourmand for me, but it's definitely got gourmand aspects present. I find the amber really gorgeous and golden, a bit like that in Stereoplasm's lavender scarab, if that helps too. \n\nI love it, and upsized it, but I can see why you may be hesitant if you're not a fan of literal bread, since it's a fairly prominent component (though far from the only one). I do recommend trying a sample if you love peaches and amber, since they're fairly equal players to the bread! Sorry for the wall of text haha, it's pretty early where I am!",

As soon as I opened it I noticed an unexpected smell, kind of rose-like. I was confused because I didn't see anything particularly fragrant in the ingredients list. But I ignored it and slathered it all over my face anyway. Bad idea. I broke out in hives and itching. I looked online and apparently this moisturizer was reformulated with lavender essential oil, which the company did not list in the ingredients. And I'm allergic. I called the company and they were somewhat apologetic, but I'm kind of pissed. They should not be selling this product until the information on the package is corrected since they are fully aware of the issue. So I just wanted to give a warning to everyone not to buy this unless you want a nice, strong dose of lavender on your face (which no one should want because it's crappy for skin whether you're allergic or not). Now to slather my face in LRP Cicaplast Baume B5 and hope the hives go away quickly!",

    "body": "Hello1 I was thinking this review might be a bit too late for this review, but the Dracula collection, including the collection box, is still up. So here it is\n\n**A little about my taste**: I tend to like ‚Äúheavier scents‚Äù with incense and resin notes, patchouli, dry herbs, and overall earthy and dark tones. On the other hand, I thoroughly enjoy white floral like jasmine, gardenia, and honeysuckle and fresh herbal garden-y scents. I‚Äôm not big on traditional gourmands but I‚Äôve developed a real affinity for coffee and tea scents, especially black tea and boozy coffee.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI‚Äôll try to rate all scents on a scale from 1 to 5 where:\n\n1 = hate it, get it off me now, 2 = I don‚Äôt like it but it‚Äôs not offensive and I see why someone would like it, 3 = I like it but am not sure I‚Äôd reach for it, nothing special to me, 4= I really like it but I‚Äôm not head over heels, 5 = instant love, it haunts me, keeps me up at night and I think about when I‚Äôm with other perfumes\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Brooding Wings** \\-- *spilled red wine, narcotic opium, wild fir branches, the leathery wings of a bat, black musk* \n\nThis is honestly the one I was least excited about and it did not do much for me. Red wine and opium are definitely at the for front and Poesies has a very distinct opium note that smells a tiny bit like dry coconut to me. The red wine fades over time to a general dark fuzzy scent , I'm guessing that's the black musk.\n\n3 startled bats out of 5\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Castle Dracula** \\-- *wolf‚Äôs fur musk, cold stone, layers of dust, a drop of blood, and a distant burning fireplace* \n\nAside from smoke, this is a pretty conceptual scent and it's hard for me to pick out distinct notes. It's more about vibes and it give a strong mostly abandoned castle t night vibe, which I assume is the intent. That being said, its is actually really cozy with pleasant dust smell? I can definitely pick up just the right amount of Poesies' beautiful smoke note! \n\n4 crumbling stones out of 5\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Children of the Night** \\-- *inky black tea, vanilla lace, distant bonfire smoke, ivy climbing up an ancient stone wall, and a soft bite of pepper* \n\n I was super excited for this one and it did did not disappoint! It is sweet from the vanilla, but the tannic note of the black teas is also prominent. There is just a hint of green that makes the scent a bit more special and unique but I don't get much pepper. That's unfortunate because it would make the scent much more unique. I would definitely be upsizing *except* it smells very similar to Poesie's Balmoral Fireplace, and I already have (and love) a full size of that. \n\n5 out of 5 ‚Ä¶ armadillos\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Scholomance** \\--*ancient castle walls under a forest floor, dragon‚Äôs blood incense, a wicked blend of green herbs and rich spices* \n\nI love both dragon's blood and herbal scent and was expecting a very dark and interesting scent. Alas, this is a Lush bath bomb on me. Not sure which one, but my first though was...this smell like a Lush Store. The herbs a very citrusy and I only get a tiny hint of dragon's blood. It came off verrrrryy soapy, though more in a bubble bath way than like,  hand soap. Still, not what I thinking and I'm fairly disappointed in this one, maybe more ageing will improve it but I don't know. \n\n2 not so magic castles out of 5 :(\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Sweet Sleep** \\-- *caramelized pumpkin flesh, pumpkin pie spices, creamy vanilla, blonde woods, natural lavender essential oil and absolute* \n\nAs I mentioned, I'm not usually a gourmand person but this is about as perfect as pumpkin pie scent could be. It's warm and roasted smelling and there is some definite pumpkin, not just the spice. I don't get much lavender but there is something going on that keeps this from be your typical overly sweet pumpkin pie scent\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **The Dead Rise** \\-- *dark roasted coffee beans spiked with fresh cardamom pods, cubes of brown sugar, ambroxan, cedar* \n\nI love Poesie's coffee scents so I knew this was going to be a good one! Wet it has a generic perfume smell but as soon as it drives it give a blast of cardamom and coffee that is super well balanced. The sweeter brown sugar and ambroxan come out more throughout the wear time and after an hour or so it's pretty sweet coffee scent.  I like this but to me it reads as a cozy cafe scent, nothing really dark that captures the them or the collection to me. I wish it had one more element to make it a little ominous or something and i don't know I like it enough compared to my other Poesie coffee scents to get a full size. \n\n4 caffeinated zombies out of 5\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Weird Sisters** \\-- *voluptuous milk chocolate, damp leaves dotted with mushrooms, overturned earth, three broken caskets* \n\nThis is definitely a unique scent combo. I don't think I have any chocolate perfumes at all so I was not sure what to expect. Turns out, this may be my favorite from the whole collection! It is very true to the listed notes. The chocolate is creamy and rich and the dirt note is just fantastic (and I have a lot of dirt note perfumes). There is a definite dampness, but it does not come off as stale or moldy, in fact it adds to the depth of the whole perfume and is almost refreshing, like a cool autumn night after ti rained that day. Really in love with this one and will definitely be checking out other Poesie dirt notes I see. \n\n5 awakening witches out of 5\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\~\\*\\~ Box Extras \\~\\*\\~\n\n**Poesie 2 oz Water-Based Mist - Dragon‚Äôs Blood Incense** \n\nThis simple and not very strong. It is a sweeter and softer dragon's blood scent and not very \"incense-y\" at all to me. I like for a day I'm feeling like a simpler scent. I saw someone say they used it as base for other scents in the collection nd that sees like a great idea, maybe it will make Scholomance a little more what I was expecting. On its own I like it for what it is. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sihaya & Company Glittering 8 oz Candle in Transylvanian Concubine**: *hypnotic blend of deep red merlot, fleshy plum, black cherry, and glimmering amber, shot through with the blood of the dragon.*\n\nFull disclosure I haven't burned this yet, just sniffed it. I hate candles tunneling and haven't had the time to sit with it for two hours. The main smell I get is red wine, though there is definitely some dark fruit too. Can't really smell the dragon's blood, it's overwhelmed by wine but probably will be able to when I burn it. Also, it is so pretty, there is a opaque layer of super sparkly burgundy pink and holographic glitter. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Poesie Cardamom + Sandalwood 2 oz Fizzy Bath Salt** \n\n Smells super nice and comforting. Sandalwood is in the forefront but I defiantly get the cardamom too. This made the bath smell great and left a good amount of scent on my skin, I also found it pretty moisturizing!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Vampire‚Äôs Kiss Almond Raspberry Crumble**  **tea**\n\nI'm pretty particular about tea and really only like jasmine and mint tea consistently. However, this was a nice dessert tea and the raspberry element have it a nice bit of tartness that I think made it something I like. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Epically Epic Red Velvet Cake Vegan Tinted Lip Balm** \n\nLove, love , love this lip balm. It is super moisturizing and the scent (taste?) is one of the best red velvets I've smelled in a product. A lot of them lean really hard into the frosting smell and come out a more generic sweet cupcake scent, this one has the cocoa part in with the frosting and it is great! The tint is a nice mid tone red and give a cool popsicle lip effect when you apply it the center I really like. Will definitely be check out some more Epically Epic products!",

It was a definite 5/5, and the herbs smelled deep and magical. Actually this is a bit weird, but the smell got me a little revved.\n\nWeird Sisters was definitely a unique blend of scents, not my favorite, but not terrible. My skin really amped the mushrooms, which isn't what I'm typically going for, but never actually smelled bad.\n\nI agree with you 100% on the others though",

    "body": "A while back, I blind bought the Lavender Rice Pudding and Lavender Cloud gift sets from Poesie. While they aren‚Äôt available any more, I thought it might still be helpful to review them in case someone sees them in the Sunday Swaps or is curious about the notes. Especially since Poesie recently let people mix their own combinations of two notes. \n\nFor reference, some of my favorite mainstream fragrances include: Bath and Body Work's Brown Sugar & Fig, Vanilla Bean Noel, and Winter Candy Apple and, for more expensive perfumes, Black Opium by Yves Saint Laurent, Acqua di Gioia by Armani Beauty, and Romance and Beyond Romance by Ralph Lauren. From Alkemia, I realized that I love [Ghost Fire] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/ucu81b/five_alkemia_reviews/). From Cocoa Pink, I love [Grapefruit Sugar, Tihota, and Cozy Blanket] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/v15evt/five_cocoa_pink_reviews/).\n\nMy rating system is generally:  \n1 ‚Äì This was so awful for me I washed it off and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it.  \n2 ‚Äì This isn't for me, but I can maybe see how someone would appreciate it.  \n3 ‚Äì I like this enough that I will might use all of the sample, but I probably won't buy another. I also use this  for perfumes that I think other people would really like or that I think would be popular with people who have different tastes from me.  \n4 ‚Äì Not only will I use all of the sample, but I am already thinking that I'll buy another. I might full size it. I've noticed that I often rate seasonal or really niche scents this.  \n5 ‚Äì I am planning to buy a full size of this or already have and I will use it regularly.\n\n**Lavender Rice Pudding**\n\nDescription:  \n*This delectable gift set will have you vibing with all of the comforting notes of natural lavender essential oil and scrumptious vanilla-laced rice pudding.*\n\nMy thoughts:  \nWith this, I noticed the scent of rice and lavender right away. The lavender scent is not soapy or like a cleaning product, which is a relief to me since I blind bought this. When I bought this and the Lavender Cloud gift set, I hadn‚Äôt tried many scents by Poesie. In general, I‚Äôve tried lots of lavender products and it‚Äôs so common in cleaning supplies that I now usually avoid the scent of lavender in products. However, I still enjoy a lavender that smells like the lavender I plant in my garden, so I keep trying. This lavender is more like that, a plant or herbal lavender. While the perfume is wet, the rice scent dominates and the lavender is more in the background. I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the rice scent at first, but it‚Äôs grown on me. Now, I enjoy the cozy scent of it. I usually enjoy gourmand scents, so I shouldn‚Äôt have been too surprised that I would grow to like this. I actually like it enough that I‚Äôm hoping Poesie will sell it as a single note so I can buy a bunch of it. As the perfume oil dries, the lavender becomes the more dominant scent, and it can be a bit strong. But, it might just seem that way because I miss the rice pudding scent. I use this as sleep scent and really enjoy it for that. Trying and enjoying this scent made me decide to try the other rice pudding scents that Poesie makes.\n\nRating: 5/5  \nBecause this is a cozy gourmand lavender scent\n\nWho is this?  \nSomeone who has a grandmotherly personality who offers comfort and food to those with heavy hearts\n\n**Lavender Cloud**\n\nDescription:  \n*Float away in a cloud of cotton candy and natural lavender essential oil with this delightful gift set.*\n\nMy thoughts:  \nThis scent is sweet and sharp. Both the lavender note and the cotton candy note are noticeable and go well together. The lavender is a bit herbal and a little sharp, like the lavender in Lavender Rice Pudding. It might seem a bit more sharp in this scent since it‚Äôs combined with the sweet and light cotton candy note. It‚Äôs not exactly a floral lavender as I thought with Lavender Rice Pudding, it seems more herbal. The cotton candy note adds a light sweetness to the scent. I have been using this as a sleep scent, too.\n\nRating: 4/5  \nBecause this is a sweet lavender sleep scent\n\nWho is this?  \nA serious, yet kind, children‚Äôs doctor\n\nFor both of these, I blind bought the gift set since I didn‚Äôt have a lot of experience with Poesie at the time. I generally spray my bed linens and plushies with the water-based mist that was a part of the gift set and then apply the perfume oil so that I am surrounded by the scent. I definitely enjoy layering the scents. Sometimes, I even reapply in the middle of the night if I wake up. \n\nI‚Äôve used each of these multiple times since they arrived and plan to use all of them. I would likely buy the Lavender Rice Pudding scent again if it was available. I might not buy the Lavender Cloud again since I like to try new scents and, so far, my favorite sleep scent is Cozy Blanket by Cocoa Pink.",

    "body": "Here I am again, back for my second review ever. I used a lot of Reddit reviews to choose perfumes and I hope this can help someone.\n\nI ordered from Poesie January 12. The order shipped January 19 and arrived to me January 22. I had waited for her new release set with all the cardamom and was sad that you couldn‚Äôt order samples from that new release, only larger bottles, but I wasn‚Äôt ready to commit just yet as it was my first purchase with this house. I wrote in the little box on my order page that I had really been hoping to try Croquette (it was the only one from the Cardamonth release I really wanted to try) and she sent it as a sample! I thought that was really sweet. She also sent a little note that she hopes I fall in love with the oils. They are small oil samples with an applicator wand. Everything was packaged carefully and arrived to me safely. The scents seem to last for a few hours on my skin, which to me is average. Very few perfumes last longer than a few hours on me and I would say I am pleased with how long these last. Throw is not strong at all, it is more of a personal scent experience.\n\n**Croquette (rose jam laced with cardamom, sandwiched between marshmallow meringues, and served next to a cup of black tea, Dreamwood, pink musk)**\n\nLots of rose right away, then it settles into more of the musk bit with marshmallow. I may be getting some of the black tea note. My friend smelled it and said it smelled like I was wearing scented lotion, not ‚Äúperfumey‚Äù, which I‚Äôm guessing she meant is it‚Äôs softer and not as pungent. This made me want to put on my thrifted wool sweater and rose earrings - then I remembered I was already wearing this so my vibe was on point. Hopefully. It reminds me of a grandma‚Äôs hallway. In a way that I like. Definitely rose, marshmallow and cardamom. I like it.\n\n**Elemental Tea Party (a swirl of autumn leaves on chilly air, brewed black tea with a discreet splash of whiskey, overturned earth, distant bonfires)**\n\nLike a smoker‚Äôs jacket from a distance with a surprising sweetness. When I kept smelling it on myself I really kept thinking it was like inhaling a smoker‚Äôs jacket from down the hall, where the person is very clean and everything else around you is clean but there‚Äôs that distance clothing/smokey smell, but not in a bonfire way. The smoke doesn‚Äôt attack you but it is noticeable.\n\n**Forest Cat (fuzzy paws tinged with earth, night forest, grey fur musk, milky breath)**\n\nI didn‚Äôt know what to expect from this one. It was surprisingly sweet at first in a way I can‚Äôt really describe - maybe the ‚Äòmilky breath‚Äô note? - but after about an hour it smelled kind of like unwashed skin. I‚Äôve seen other reviews where people love this one and FS it, so who knows. Maybe if I put some vanilla on top?\n\nUpdate: I gave it to my girlfriend whose skin chemistry was able to let it smell nice hours after applying. It smelled so nice on her hours later. Good for her.\n\n**Myself Invisible (stacked books, spilled ink, black tea, shy violets hiding deep in the forest)**\n\nThis one is interesting. I ordered from Poesie because I thought their scents were overall very unique seeming. I love an unexpected‚Ä¶anything. At first I was like, what is this? And I kept wanting to sniff it. I really like this one in part because it‚Äôs unique. At least to me who is new to this indie world of perfumes.\n\n**Sleepy Ghost (marshmallow pillows sprinkled with natural lavender essential oil and absolute for sweet dreams)**\n\nI get more marshmallow than lavender, like the lavender is under a pile of sweet, soft marshmallows. Very sweet, maybe too sweet for me.\n\n**Twice to Tea (a strongly brewed cup of Earl Grey tea delicately infused with all natural lavender absolute, sweetened with vanilla syrup, and lightened with a splash of milk)**\n\nThis is the reason I made a Poesie order in the first place. This smells like sweet lavender and vanilla. It‚Äôs lovely. If I smelled it, I don‚Äôt know if I would go ‚ÄúAh yes, that‚Äôs like a London Fog‚Äù. I found Poesie because I was on a hunt to try as many London Fog/Earl Grey perfumes as possible, and I am very early in my journey. This lasts a long time. I put it on before I went to sleep and I could still smell it on my arms when I woke up. I haven‚Äôt tried wearing it throughout the day yet. Very nice smell.\n\n**Velvet Moon (cardamom, a wood-paneled library filled with old books, black pepper, a velvet dressing gown, paper + ink, flickering beeswax candles (new!)**\n\nSimilar to Myself Invisible, it‚Äôs a unique one, and I like unexpected. I liked this less than Myself Invisible but I did keep going back to smell it.\n\n**Villa Diodati (pungent wild rosemary and fresh balsam pine, crystal clear lakewater, dry, dark vanilla)**\n\nTo me this is pretty straight rosemary. I can tell there‚Äôs something else behind it, but I couldn‚Äôt tell you what it is specifically.\n\n**Village Bakery (stacks of delicious Japanese milk bread)**\n\nThis smells like cinnamon bread. It‚Äôs very yummy and cozy.\n\n**Whisper Your Bitter Things (pressed coffee beans, dried clove bud + cassia bark, jasmine and neroli blossoms, roasted vanilla pods)**\n\nUpon initial application, I get a lot of coffee. After a few minutes the floral side comes out. Then after an hour it seems to go bad on my skin. I can tell it‚Äôs a nice perfume, but like Forest Cat it just isn‚Äôt vibing with me.\n\nOverall, Poesie is a lovely house. It seems everyone on Reddit loves them and I can see why. For me, the perfumes all seemed to dry down with a noticeable and not so enjoyable undertone of‚Ä¶something. Maybe it‚Äôs the carrier oil? I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt fault Poesie for it at all, especially because when I tested these on my girlfriend they seemed not to go bad like some did on me. I also am learning I think I am more of an EDP person and may be leaning away from oils, and I really value products with a looooot of throw. The more throw the better for me and this was all of the oil‚Äôs weakest point. So, do I recommend these perfumes? Absolutely. Will I be FSing any? No. If someone is wearing Poesie will I ask to sniff them? Absolutely.",

        "body": "Hi, I‚Äôm a vet!\n\nAnything that diffuses particles into the air can be a respiratory irritant in cats, including essential oil diffusers, glade plugins, cleaning products, aerosols or room sprays, cigarette or vape smoke, incense sticks, or candles. I would stay away from almost all of these entirely when it comes to use around cats, because their respiratory system is pretty sensitive. These things basically all act as physical irritants to their lungs.\n\nBeyond the physical irritation, some of these things also have direct toxic effects to cats. I‚Äôll skip over the obvious hazards of smoke inhalation, bleach fumes, etc. and get right to your question. Many essential oils are toxic to cats, when applied topically OR when inhaled. Even if the oil has been diluted, when it gets diffused those little particles of oil can be inhaled, so your cat can actually absorb a decent amount of the oil that way. Cats are small and have sensitive lungs, so it doesn‚Äôt take too much to reach a toxic level. Cats can also rub up against you and get essential oils on their fur and then groom them off. \n\nEssential oils to NEVER use around cats are citrus (lemon, lime), eucalyptus, and tea tree oil.\n\nLavender is technically toxic in higher doses, but can be tolerated by cats if diluted, but it‚Äôs just hard to say exactly how much to dilute, and then you still have the aforementioned physical irritant properties to contend with. I don‚Äôt diffuse any essential oils because of this. I just don‚Äôt want to risk it.\n\nYou can use lavender candles in a well-ventilated area, and this is much safer than diffusing oils. Just make sure it‚Äôs a clean burning wick to minimize smokiness.\n\nHope this helps!",

Combine this with the fact that cats groom their bodies a lot and have thinner skin than most other mammals which makes it easier to chemicals to penetrate and get into their blood stream. A good rule of thumb is to never use essential oils in spaces that kitty uses, since if it‚Äôs in the air or on a surface they come in contact with, it‚Äôs guaranteed to find its way into their bodies. Lavender oils contains linalool, which is toxic to kitties. As long as your kitty isn‚Äôt grooming your skin after handling and applying it, it might be fine to use in the manner you‚Äôre used to, but you‚Äôll want to look for any adverse signs that your cat may be reacting to it (vomiting, diarrhea, etc).",

I've since done a bit of searching, and I've found great essential oils by a company called US Organic. Their essential oils are 100% pure and certified organic. Their packaging has the green-and-white \"USDA Organic\" label, which means they've been evaluated by the United States Department of Agriculture and found to **actually** be organic. You can read more about the \"USDA Organic\" label here: https://www.ams.usda.gov/grades-standards/organic-standards. Basically, if you want to buy organic, you're going to want to find this exact label on the product in question before purchasing. \n\nWithout further ado, here is the web site of US Organic: https://www.us-organic.com. I love their lavender essential oil in particular. It smells lighter and more pleasant than whatever fake garbage I was using before. If you care about sustainability and are in the States, I recommend either their essential oils, or other essential oils that boast the \"USDA Organic\" label. \n\n(BTW, I'm not getting any kickbacks or perks for recommending this company.)",

    "body": "\nPrior to my laparoscopic surgery, I did not know I had endometriosis until a month before surgery. Background, I have always had painful periods, at times I could not uncrumple my body from fetus position on hard days. I truly thought this was normal, and that most women went through this. Endometriosis never crossed my mind. \n\nI went to my obgyn with irregular periods and bloating. After an ultrasound I found out that I had two large endometriomas on each ovary (6 and 8 cm). I am 31, and I do very much want to become a mother. \n\nFirst lap on Friday June 18th.\nArrived at the hospital Friday an hour before surgery. They took my vitals, and led me to my bed. They placed my IV and gave me a little lavender essential oil when I let them know I was nervous as this was my first surgery. Unfortunately after my IV was placed I found out my surgery was going to be delayed by 2 hours. About an hour after that my anesthesiologist came by to talk me through what was to come. She was extremely kind and reassuring about being right next to me the entire surgery. I realized at this moment that I was about to go into the OR and I got very anxious! My surgeon came by to let me know they were ready. My surgery was with a robotic Davinci machine, and I fully trusted my surgeon. I was wheeled into the OR around 3:30pm. I was surprised that I hadn‚Äôt received anything to put my to sleep yet, so it really stressed me out when I went in and saw all of the operating room and materials. As soon as I was in though, I was given the ‚Äúhappy‚Äù fluids and before I knew it I was out. I highly suggest making sure you‚Äôre given something before being wheeled into the OR if you‚Äôd be uncomfortable with that scenario. \n\nWaking up and the next moments are all very much a blur to me. I was not in my recovery room yet, but seemed to be on a group bed floor. I think I called out for my husband, and I definitely had the shakes. After that I feel back asleep. \n\nWhen I awoke again I was in my recovery room and it was 9:00pm. My husband was in the room visiting me, and he let me know that I needed to spend the night in the hospital. My surgery ended up being much more extensive than I imagined. So much endometriosis was found. I was told that I have a severe case of stage IV endometriosis, they were able to remove almost all of the tissue except for a small amount below my liver. They were able to remove both endometriomas on each of my ovaries. Sadly, after performing chromopertubation, they found that one of my Fallopian tubes was blocked. This was all obviously a lot to take in that evening. I was still very out of it from the anesthesia and meds, and I just remember constantly being checked on through the evening by several nurses and not really sleeping.\n\n By morning I really felt the pain from the surgery, especially due to the extent of what needed to be removed. Walking the first time to the bathroom the next morning was torture. I don‚Äôt want that to scare anyone, it‚Äôs different for everyone, but that first time off the hospital bed was absolutely miserable and I thought I was dying. I used a walker and that helped, I don‚Äôt know how I would have made it without it. Luckily I was able to urinate right away. The second time I walked it was ten times easier than the first, so unfortunately you just have to will yourself past that first walk and it will get better, I promise!\n\nWhen my surgeon came to talk with me the next morning I was told that I would likely need more surgeries in my future given the severe stage I am in, as well as immediately contacting a fertility clinic to help move me forward with conception if we want children.\n\nAfter I was able to walk the second time, I was discharged and went home just about 24 hours after my surgery. \n\nRecovery:\nThe first 3 days were very, very difficult. I couldn‚Äôt imagine it without the help of my husband. If you live alone I strongly suggest you reach out to family and friends to see if they can help you for the first few days. Moving in bed was painful, even just a flinch the first day. I am propping myself up with a pregnancy U shape pillow, which has been life saving. I‚Äôve placed a heat pad on my lower back, and the shoulder heat pad when I‚Äôm having gas pains. I have my husband help me stuff pillows under my knees and heels, and I find it helps relieve abdomen pain. I‚Äôve been using ice packs on my abdomen where I feel sharp pains or cramping. \n\nI am shocked I haven‚Äôt had more of the gas pain I‚Äôve read about on here. I definitely felt it the first day in the hospital, and I still do feel it when I cry or take short sharp breaths, but it hasn‚Äôt been my main pain. I take gas x and drink peppermint tea when needed. \n\nI did have some discomfort urinating the first few days, at first I thought it was a uti possibly from the catheter in the hospital, but now I‚Äôm not feeling it as much. I‚Äôve had some bleeding, but I wouldn‚Äôt call it heavy. I‚Äôve just switched between pads and liners depending on the amount. \nThe main pain I feel is on my left side right under my incision. It feels like a sharp pain or bruise every time I move. I‚Äôve been taking ibuprofen, Tylenol, and hydrocodone (opioid), depending on my pain. \n\nI finally had a bowel movement today (yay!) after 3 days post op. I have been drinking one glass of mirilax a day leading up to this, and just not straining and letting it come naturally. It will come!\nI‚Äôve been eating plain, veggie broth, crackers, applesauce, toast, and today I had plain pasta for the first time. Just been taking it really easy on the stomach. \n\nI am still having a hard time walking, and have my husband hold my hand anywhere I go for now. It has been getting better each day, but it‚Äôs a slow progress. \n\nI am still coming to terms with being diagnosed with an incurable disease, especially one that has and will impact my ability to have children.  I am still coming to terms with the fact that I‚Äôve been through a major surgery, and that I may have more to go in my life. It‚Äôs heartbreaking, but I am also so grateful to know what‚Äôs happening within my body. I‚Äôm really grateful for the support from everyone who is going through this, no matter what stage of endo you have, we really are all warriors battling our way through a very painful (physical and emotional) disease that we didn‚Äôt ask for.",

It helps connect me to my body gently. I'd include a box fan for afternoon nap and evening bath (a hot bath with a cool fan is lovely) (if my heart rate increases too much bc the bath is hot and i start to feel jittery, i splash cold water on my face and rinse my hair in cold water until my body calms down again) a space heater location, to perch at in the morning with coffee.

    "body": "Epically Epic has so far been my favorite indie brand because:\n1. EE def has the most fail-proof scents for me (I like fruity, creamy, slightly herbal and clean). They are all very well-blended \n3. really affordable \n4. free lipbalm with every order (over $30)\n\nI think the brand is taking a pause on their general collection July 12th to make room for a lip balm event.  I wanted to pass on my experience  if you wanna place an order before some of the spring/winter collection leaves.\n\n**Custom:**\n**Basmati Rice + Creamsicle!**\nInspired by the rice note in Poesie‚Äôs ‚Äúmadar‚Äù I chose basmati rice to kinda make it a rice pudding topped with orange zest. I think for the cost (I think it was $15 for 10 ml) and note options you have, this custom perfume is a no-brainer. I‚Äôm not usually a citrus perfume fan so it‚Äôs really gotta be sugared and creamed down for me to like. It smells like the ripest orange topped off with a  melted creamsicle. Not really getting any basmati but I could just be comparing it to my experience with poesie. During drydown, it‚Äôs kinda like the orange drink powder, tang! The customs are only occasionally in stock so have your notes ready when it comes time to order! If I were to do it again, I‚Äôd definitely play around with mixing more notes since I kept it simple this time around.\n\n**Solid Lotions**\nThis is my favorite indie product. Formula is great: not as greasy as typical solid lotions but leaves your skin smooth. The tins are tiny and travel friendly but provide a ton of use! I have an almost finished tin of **ceiling stars** which is a scent I will keep repurchasing (Cozy strawberry, lavender essential oil, and fluffy vanilla marshmallows). The lavender is pretty relaxed in this one. It‚Äôs like 50% fruity cotton candy and 50% lavender. **Bizarre Bazaar** is my newest solid lotion scent (Honeydew melon, dragonfruit, pear, spring rain, and eucalyptus). I typically don‚Äôt like herbaly scents alone and liked that epically epic makes them alot more approachable. It has the cooling effect of vicks rub but 1. not as strong 2. Melony and fruity\n\n**Lip Balms**\nThe formula is really worth the hype. Not too greasy, not too waxy. I‚Äôve tried in a few scents and all were 10/10.\n**Ube Halaya** is like a vanilla shortbread, hint of cinnamon, starchy ube. Very strong. **Mango Lassi** true to scent just wish it was stronger. **Peach Coconut Milk** this was my freebie. Smells just like a Starbucks pink drink!!\n\n**Oil Mist/Hair Mist**\nI think in terms of a hair product, this is to be used sparingly (just one spritz in the hands and use for ends). I bought it for the body oil purposes in **Ginger Peach Turmeric**. This scent is spot on and very peachy. My only regret is that this bottle will last a while for me and I didn‚Äôt pick the most universal seasonal scent (prob won‚Äôt want to wear in the winter). The mist is not very fine and shoots out in a single stream for me. A little goes a long way. I‚Äôve also tried this product in the **coconut snowfall scent**. (It‚Äôs like a muted icy vanilla mint with a hint of coconut). Probably won‚Äôt rebuy this format since I love the solid lotion. Pros: Gives you a nice glow, comes in aluminum\n\n**general catalog perfume**\nI‚Äôve tried **lavender lychee**. It‚Äôs very true to description but I bought it during a lavender phase and will probably destash since I‚Äôm moving out. As for perfume longevity, the strength is about a 6/10 and lasts on my skin about 2 hrs before needing a reapplication.\n\n**TDLR**\nYou gotta try a perfume custom, lip balm, and solid lotion from EE.",

Lavender essential oil is an exception to the standard requirement of diluting an essential oil: lavender essential oil is gentle enough for most people that it can be applied neat (i.e., undiluted) to the skin. That said, a patch test should always be performed first to check for allergic reaction or skin sensitivity.\n\nDue to lavender‚Äôs sedative and anxiolytic (‚Äúanxiety-reducing‚Äù) effects, it is theorized that it could potentiate central nervous system depressants like benzodiazepines and opioids, so consult with your doctor about potential drug interactions. [1]\n\nPeople who are pregnant or breastfeeding should consult with a healthcare provider before using lavender, as certain of its chemical constituents can freely pass the blood-placental barrier and reach fetal organs. [2]\n\n**Other Names**\n\nMost modern European languages use a similar term to English‚Äôs ‚Äúlavender‚Äù to refer to the plant, and many other languages have adopted variations of this word. It is commonly held that the plant name comes from Italian ‚Äúlavanda‚Äù meaning ‚Äúto wash,‚Äù a reference to the plant‚Äôs supposed use in laundering. \n\nHowever, this etymology is considered implausible by the *Oxford English Dictionary*. Instead, the earliest form of the plant name seems to be the Latin ‚Äúlivendula‚Äù and is thought to be connected to the word ‚Äúlƒ´vƒìre‚Äù meaning ‚Äúto be livid; or, to be dark bluish or purplish.‚Äù Compare to our word ‚Äúlivid,‚Äù which still has the meaning of being a ‚Äúbluish- or purplish-grey colour.‚Äù [3, 4]\n\nA notable exception to variants of this name is the Portuguese ‚Äúalfazema‚Äù (and the less common Spanish, ‚Äúalhucema‚Äù) both of which come from the Arabic word for this plant: ÿßŸÑŸíÿÆŸèÿ≤ŸéÿßŸÖŸéŸâ (al-·∏µuzƒÅmƒÅ). [5]\n\n**Habitat/Growing**\n\nLavender is considered an easy to grow plant, as well as being easy to grow from cuttings. It is best planted in spring, in free-draining soil and thrives in full sun. It is a drought-tolerant plant. It is recommended to be regularly pruned to avoid a woody, scraggly appearance. [6]\n\n**History/Folklore**\n\nIn Welsh folklore, lavender was believed to repel evil witches and spirits, and in Italy, it was worn by children to avert the evil eye. [7] From the Tudor period through the Stuart period, lavender was one herb of many used as a strewing herb, strewn on the floors of homes and churches for its sweet smell and to repel vermin. [8] In Hannah Glasse‚Äôs 1747 *The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy*, she lists it among other herbs to make a ‚Äúsweet powder‚Äù to scent clothes. [9] \n\nOther examples of folk belief about lavender include the curious belief that it was an omen of bad luck if worn by a groom, which foretold that he would ‚Äúbe distrustful and jealous.‚Äù [10] In the Victorian language of flowers, lavender signified ‚Äúmistrust.‚Äù [11] \n\nIn the United States, beginning in the late 1920s, the word ‚Äúlavender‚Äù came to be associated with homosexuality, especially the behaviour, lifestyle, or interests stereotypically associated with gay men. [3] (The late 1920s to mid-1930s was also when the word ‚Äúgay‚Äù would take on similar meanings.) This use of ‚Äúlavender‚Äù is the reason why the ‚ÄúLavender Scare‚Äù of the 1950s has its name, which was a moral panic which sought the removal of actual or perceived gays and lesbians from state employment as national security risks and communist sympathizers. The term parallels McCarthy‚Äôs ‚ÄúRed Scare‚Äù moral panic of alleged crypto-communists. Other uses of lavender to refer to queer identity include the term ‚Äúlavender marriage‚Äù to refer to a male-female mixed orientation marriage, and the Lavender Menace, a lesbian radical feminist group.\n\nLavender was an ingredient in the famous Four Thieves‚Äô Vinegar (Vinagre deus quate panaires), developed in Marseille during the Great Plague of Marseille in 1720. There are various legends associated with the vinegar, but the basic idea is that the herb-infused vinegar was believed to prevent infection with the plague. During the Covid-19 Pandemic, a recipe for Four Thieves‚Äô Vinegar was published on the blog of the Institut d‚ÄôEstudis Occitans by S√≤fia Jacques-Serano, which includes lavender. [12]\n\n**Medicinal Uses**\n\nLavender has extensive historical use in herbal medicine for anxiety, stress, and insomnia. Modern herbal medical texts suggest using it as an oil chest compress or a full-body wash for this purpose. [13] In the 1980s, the German government‚Äôs Commission E advisory board approved the use of lavender as a sedative and antiflatulent. [14]\n\nSome otherwise reliable sources for information about the medical use of plants will say that there is no evidence for the efficacy of lavender in treating symptoms of anxiety, stress, insomnia, or other mental health complaints. These sources generally do not take into consideration the considerable amount of research that has been conducted on lavender within the past 15 years or so. Double-blind, randomized, peer-reviewed studies have established that preparations of lavender oil are as comparable in efficacy as lorazepam or paroxetine in the treatment and management of anxiety, safe to use even while driving, and safe even when abruptly stopped (without needing down-titration). [15, 16, 17, 18]\n\nThis evidence seems to corroborate traditional herbal medicinal uses of lavender, such as that recorded in Lydia Fisher‚Äôs circa 1788 *The Prudent Housewife*. In that work, Fisher includes lavender in a ‚Äúmethod of cure‚Äù for what she terms ‚ÄúHystericks,‚Äù explained to be ‚Äúan intercepted breathing‚Äù which we might recognize as a panic attack. [19] Paul Huson, in his *Mastering Herbalism* recommends a simple lavender tea sweetened with honey ‚Äúto relieve nervous tension and exhaustion.‚Äù [20]\n\nIn his 1597 *Herbal* John Gerard also recommends ‚Äúthe distilled water of Lavander smelt unto, or the temples and forehead bathed therewith, is a refreshing to them that have the Catalepsy, a light migram, and to them that have the falling sicknesse, and that use to swoune much.‚Äù [21] What is interesting is that, to the extent that varying amounts of this work are believed to be plagiarized from the work of Rembert Dodoens‚Äô 1544 *Cruydeboek*, Gerard omits certain uses of lavender. In Dodoens‚Äô work, lavender is recommended to stimulate menstruation, to deliver the placenta, and to clear the contents of the uterus following a spontaneous pregnancy loss. [22] Modern research has also suggested lavender‚Äôs efficacy in relieving menopausal symptoms following aromatherapy massage, as well as premenstrual discomfort following aromatherapy inhalation of lavender oil. [23]\n\n**Culinary Uses**\n\nIt was interesting to me that in researching this Plant Profile, I had such a difficult time finding information about the culinary use of lavender. As it turns out, the culinary use of lavender is really quite recent. The famous ‚Äúherbes de Provence‚Äù herb blend was actually developed in the 1970s by the French spice company Ducros, and it‚Äôs only in North America that lavender is even included in herbes de Provence blends. [24]\n\nMany of the more famous historical cookbooks omit lavender entirely. A couple notable exceptions are its inclusion in a fish aspic recipe in the ca. 1300 *Le Viandier de Taillevent*, and as a syrup drizzle in a 13th-century Sephardic recipe for challah in the *KitƒÅb al-·π¨abƒ´·∫ñ*. [25, 26]\n\nIn contemporary cookery, lavender sees use as both a sweet and savoury herb. In sweet applications, lavender has been included in lavender sugar, cupcakes, shortbreads, and recently, frappuccinos. In savoury applications, lavender is included in the aforementioned herbes de Provence mix in North America for use in meat dishes. I‚Äôve also used it to make a wonderful pasta alla lavanda, which I recommend if you enjoy a lavender flavour. However, some people find that lavender ‚Äútastes like soap.‚Äù\n\n**Correspondences**\n\nNeither Agrippa, Lilly or Al-Biruni explicitly list the planetary associations of lavender. John Gadbury and Nicholas Culpeper agree that it is ruled by Mercury. [27, 28]\n\nScott Cunningham maintains the Mercurial rulership of lavender and also assigns it to the Masculine polarity and the Element of Air. [29]\n\n**Magical Uses**\n\nIn keeping with folkloric uses noted above, Cunningham recommends lavender for spiritual cleansing and protection. It also finds use in promoting peace and tranquility, whether as restful sleep or in harmonious relationships. However, lavender is perhaps most commonly used as an herb in love spells, and Cunningham explicitly mentions its use in attracting men. [29] This use seems to combine its folk magical use as a love herb with the more modern use of ‚Äúlavender‚Äù to mean gay or queer. A famous example of lavender for use in same-sex love magic is the spiritual product line, Lavender Love Drops. [30]\n\nIn her *excellent* research on Southern hoodoo and rootwork, Zora Neale Hurston records the use of lavender for feeding a mojo hand, business success, reconciliation, peaceful home, and friendship. [31] These magical uses for lavender are maintained in the works of more contemporary writers, including James E. Sickafus, catherine yronwode, and Starr Casas. [32, 33, 34] In the magico-spiritual traditions of the Caribbean, ‚Äúred lavender oil‚Äù (a compounded formula including lavender once part of popular pharmacopeias) is used to remove baneful magic from jinxed fishing boats, as well as to spiritually cleanse a home.

    "body": "Greeting fragrance lovers,\n\nToday , I would love to dive in one of the more polarizing floral note in perfumery. Full disclosure, I am quite lukewarm about the note but both my sister and mum adore it. I do love having it in my [garden](https://i.imgur.com/pIDbdwv.png)as it attracts pollinators and add a soft touch to the more arid & neglected  part. Without further ado, let's get to it.\n\n# Lavender in perfumery:\n\nThere are many varieties and cultivars of lavenders out there. Most avid gardener would be more familiar with the Spanish lavender (Lavandula stoechas) and the English lavender (Lavandula angustifolia ). A third type of lavender is the French lavender  (Lavandula dentata) that is  used to hybridridize with Lavandula lanata.  This hybrid is  called lavendulin and has industrial implication for  distillation and essential oil . While the hybrid lavendulin is the stronger and more powerful smelling, I find it's camphorous quality to be not as pleasant as the citrusy English Lavender. Spanish lavender, unfortunately, lacks the beautiful scent of English and French lavender .. and mostly grown for its showy flower. It does have a rosemary-like  scent when smelling up close or crushing the flower. ¬†An ancient natural remedy, lavender comes from the Latin word Lave which means  wash and traditionally use in cleaning  There are many  types of lavender that are used in perfumery.\n\nThe composition of lavender essential oils varies depends on the varieties and the distillation process. However, the three main aroma chemicals that make up the bulks of lavender oil are linalool  and its acetate esterl (lily, white floral), camphor (wintergreen)  and eucalyptol (eucalyptus). A perfumer might choose to re-create a lavender accord by available aroma chemicals. However, natural essential lavender oils are often used due to its availability and affordability. There are many synthetic and natural lavender-forward fragrances out there and I'm thrilled to eventually get to experience them all.\n\n# The Ruview\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **French Grey - Elizabeth and James** 4.11/5 Soft and musky lavender that is quite affordable. I snatched this up at the discount store and couldn't be happier with the performance. She is a step up from your lavender essential oil but still retains much of its relaxing property. \n* **Burning Barbershop - DS. & Durga**  4.65/5 Smoky and citrusy lavender with a minty opening. REFRESHING! Who needs a shower when you have such a great grower like him. I am falling slowly for him .. yes he is light, yes he is a barbershop scent, yes he is quite expensive. I might need to acquire a bottle once i finish my sample.  \n* **1725 - Histoires de Parfums** 4.57/5  Ambery, honey and vanillic lavender. One of my favourite dessert I made with lavender is a lavender cr√®me brul√©e and this one remind me so much of it.  She is delicious but still has that herbaceous touch. Whatever she is selling, I will take a small sample.\n* **Invasion Barbare - MDCI Parfums** 4.31/5 Green and slightly bitter lavender with loads of citrus and a touch of rose. If it ain't green, I ain't interested, okurr. As much as I love the scent, the lavender is overshadowed by the green aromatics in the there. A real glow-up for our Brut if you ask my honest opinion. \n* **BUEN CAMINO -  Chronotope 4.78/5**  If you know me, you know how much I adore this scent. A slightly civet forward aromatic fougere that shines in the heat and glows in the cold. A shapeshifter with a heart of softest and calming lavender. What do you say? Winner winner chicken dinner. \n* **My Bush - Munstead Lavender - 4.29/5.0** Beautifully massive  silage and unbelievable  foliage accompanied by the most gorgeous soft lavender scent accented by hints of camoladin. The scent  could stop anyone in their track. The monstrous performance of 2 months + with proper pruning is nothing to scoff at. There is really nothing in perfumery that is quite comparable to it. The only drawback is its seasonability and well limited availability. Yup, we are talking about my plants here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading. What lavender forward fragrances do you enjoy? Do you like the  note in generals? What are your favourite pairing? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHappy June - the best month for  pride and gardening. Please remember to hoe responsibly.",

    "body": "Hey fragrance fam! \n\nSo, I've finally sampled and reviewed my Poesie perfume haul, and I thought where better to share my thoughts than the ole reliable of indie brand subs r/Indiemakeupandmore. I'll try to keep it short and sweet which coincidentally pretty much sums up many of the Poesie perfumes I tried! \n\n  \n**Soft** - *soft, nutty, musky fragrant basmati rice -* Wonderfully simple! It's rice plain and simple. Very cozy, lightly creamy in a perfectly steamed rice kind of way. I'd say photorealistic. Great base for other scents, but I love it on its own. Nice sleep scent. 10/10\n\n  \n**Madar** - *creamy basmati rice pudding flavored with orange flower water, saffron, cinnamon, cardamom, dried rose petals, and pistachio -* Lovely, period. impeccable rice note, getting the pistachio and dried rose petals, maybe a little orange flower water. Don't know that I can differentiate the notes too well, but this is a lovely gourmand. It's almost not a gourmand because of the gentle flowery notes, but it is actually pretty dang photorealistic to Indian desserts that sometimes use honied flower waters. I'm not a gourmand lover, but this one has piqued my interest! 7/10 it's a little sweet for me, but I will use the entire sample, I'm sure.\n\n  \n**Josephine Baker -** *creamy banana, fresh banana leaf, vanilla orchid, tuberose, bergamot, warm amber -* Incensy banana, not a creamy banana on my skin, very green, almost masculine, reminds me of banana runts candy (a tad synthetic), woody dry down. Not what I thought it would be - letting it mature and will try again later 4/10\n\n  \n**Secret Boyfriend** - *a mountain of fluffy marshmallows, your secret boyfriends leather jacket, pine and cedar, a wisp of smoke -* Definitely has that soft rice-like Poesie base which I do like and works on my skin. This scent made me realize I do like a leather note! It's done very well and balanced nicely with the marshmallow. I don't get the pine, cedar, or smoke unfortunately. It's a simple two-phase experience to me vanillic marshmallows that give way to a light leather note. This one may shine brighter in the fall and winter as it's late spring now and leather is a bit heavy.\n\n  \n**Freebie! Sleepy Ghost -** *marshmallow pillows sprinkled with natural lavender essential oil and absolute for sweet dreams -* Similar DNA to Secret Boyfriend. While I don't mind the sweet vanillic Poesie base it does lend a sameness to some of the scents. Lavendar is nice, but the scent profile is quite linear. I would rather a pure lavendar essential oil layered over Nemat Vanilla Musk for this one. Nothing groundbreaking but it's still nice for a sleep scent. 5/10\n\n  \n**Oyster!** - *Grey musk, ocean brine, bitter cucumber, a twist of lemon, elemi resin, angelica* - A bit put off by this one, but need to try again. I got a bit of a light acetone like base with a touch of cheap marine themed candle floating on top. Reminds me of a coastal bathroom scent. Definitely not the sweet brand of aquatic/marine with splashy fruits and sunscreen- which is great imo. Still, something reads synthetic and more like a decorative candle with shells and sand layered at the bottom than an actual sea scent I was looking for. I think it may be the cucumber that's reading fake fresh to me. 3/10\n\n**Twice to Tea -** *cup of earl grey tea, infused with lavender absolute, sweet vanilla syrup, a splash of milk -* Impressed with this one for sure! Smells just like a London Fog on a rainy day. The rain note folks have mentioned is light for me which I was actually hoping would be more of the main event. As tea accords go this one is DAMN GOOD for earl grey but if you were like me and are looking for petrichor and rain with earl grey in the background this may not do the trick. Still, it's exactly what it's described to be, so execution is 10/10! I won't be full sizing as of now because I'm still on the hunt for the perfect rain showers earl gray experience. but may in the future.\n\n  \n**Full Moon at the Temple -** *fragrant white rice, shiso leaf, bitter yuzu zest, hinoki wood, green tea, lake water -* This one is awesome! That lake water note is photorealistic, but so wearable! Definitely getting the wet green notes and the rice is there just enough to soften the cooler notes. I'm probably nose-blind from sniffing it so much, but the lake water dissipates too fast (although that maybe makes it even more magical?). I would happily smell that note all day. Such a beautiful and perfect unisex scent. 10/10\n\n2nd impression:  \nGave it a week to sit. Tried it a second time on a rainy spring day with the windows open and it's even better and feels a bit more blended and a bit louder in a good way! Would FS this one 10/10. Sillage and longevity are truly lacking like the scent from start to finish lasted about an hour on me. I might still FS though\n\n  \n**Athena** - *Sun-baked mediterranean herbs and earth, resinous vanilla spiked with incense and spice, exquisite grey musk -* Couldn't wait to try this one! I'm having a baby in June and we've settled on Athena as her name, so the whole concept of this one intrigued me. First impression, a strooong like, but because there are quite a few notes I think it needs time to macerate. The impression is 100% there on this one! I get a claylike earth, the gentle incense throughout, realized I do enjoy a grey musk! (Didn't love it in OYSTER!), and while I'm not sure which \"sunbaked mediterranean herbs\" I'm smelling there's something softly herbal here as if you've run your hand through sage or thyme and the scent is lightly dusting your fingers. 9/10 Can't wait to try again after some time. Would consider FS based on first impression.\n\n  \n**Amaterasu -** *golden sandalwood incense, rice milk, bright cardamom, amber, dry wheat, and sunflowers -* First whiff there's the familiar vanilla and rice note again which lends a gentleness to these scents and makes them lean a little feminine. The sandalwood is the main event for me here- I absolutely adore this sandalwood! Light and warm. The aura is golden in color and the scent as a whole feels like the end of summer on a dry, sunny and breezy day. There's something experiential about this one, the all-enveloping clear golden warmth it evokes feels like the way I remember summer feeling in childhood. But not the active part of the day, more like the strange period of time after lunch and before dinner when the day seems to be stretching into a timeless pool of honey-hued, warm, late-afternoon sun and only the breeze through the leaves and tall grass can be heard. If bathing in that kind of light quality was captured in a bottle. For me 1000/10! I don't mind the sillage being intimate because the memory feels intimate, but wish the longevity was a little better (It's not bad on this one 3-4 hours on me)...BUT I WANT TO BE DROWNING IN THIS SCENT ALL DAY! 100% Full sizing to infinity and beyond. This one is a lifelong scent for me. \n\n  \n**Freebie! Champs Elysees -** *swaths of cherry blossoms, a thin-rimmed porcelain cup of black tea infused with citrus, honey, and rose petals, a tempting display of pastel-colored macarons, crisp linen tablecloths -* Too sweet and floral for me. Definitely mellows out on the dry down and gives Parisian garden party vibes. It very much enjoying rose flavored macarons while sipping black tea in a clean well decorated parisian home. I don't dislike the scent, but I'd rather smell it on someone else I think...but i don't know it may grow on me. I actually can't stop sniffing. \n\n2nd impression: I've decided this is a slightly cleaner and more interesting Twice to Tea. The note that evokes \"crisp linen tablecloth\" sold me. Once it dries down this feels sophisticated and girly, but not fussy. What the French might call \"Tres Chic\". Not sure if i would full size, but I like it.\n\n  \nAll in all, I really enjoyed my first round of Poesie perfumes! Not all winners, but a good 80% were enjoyable -complete winners. Longevity is pretty much not great, but as someone that likes to switch up my scent throughout the day that's not a big deal! I do wish sillage was a bit better- would love for Full Moon and Amaterasu to throw a bit more. I definitely understand what others have mentioned about the Poesie base having a vanillic, rice-like quality that's pretty constant throughout all of the frags, but fortunately it works well with my skin chemistry. Hoping to try out **Faraway, Nearby, Charm of Making, Goldfish Princess, Zitkala-Sa, Mysterious Fossils, Versailles, Always With Me, Enchanted Forest, We Fly With Our Spirit, Heartless, Artemis and Villa Diodati** from this house as well. If anyone has tried these ones, please let me know what your thoughts are!",

It's really warm and sunny; I have a FS and a water based spray of this one. \n\n**Charm of Making**- Smoky! It's very smoky and herbal, with the smoked lavender and chamomile notes being most present for me. The honey note sweetens it a bit, but I'd say it's mostly herbal-smoky. Really pretty fall scent. \n\n**Faraway, Nearby**- It's super dry, hot, and sharp. If you don't like woods I would steer clear of this one, but if you do like them, the pinyon pine note is really beautiful. I wear it a lot on hot sunny days. \n\n**Villa Diodati**- My very first indie love and a staple I always have a bottle of. It's beautiful. The vanilla is not  the thick, buttercream, gourmand type at all- it's cold and airy, just softening the rosemary and lakewater notes a bit. Definitely a cold and foggy type of scent. If I wore anything often enough to be a signature scent, this would probably be it.",

Congrats on your own Athena, I‚Äôm sure you can‚Äôt wait to meet her at this point haha! \n\nAs far as the others you‚Äôre thinking about, I‚Äôve tried Always With Me, Goldfish Princess, Mysterious Fossils, Enchanted Forest and Villa Diodati. I highly recommend Villa Diodati, especially if you like Athena. It‚Äôs stunning. It‚Äôs more of a late summer/early fall scent to me, with a lovely aquatic lake note and rosemary and woods and ugh it‚Äôs just so pretty. \n\nAlways With Me is one of my favorites, but it is spa-like so if that‚Äôs not your thing it may be hit or miss. I love the aquatic note in it. It really does invoke steam which is so cool. I get compliments on this one and it‚Äôs pretty strong on me! This one almost smells like a sister scent to Villa to me. \n\nMysterious Fossils hits the nail on the head of the theme, but it smells dusty to me in a similar way that Amaterasu smells dusty‚Ä¶but I think it‚Äôs supposed to because of the fossils haha. I actually do like it, but I have to be in the mood for it. Strange combo of dry and creamy and dusty and woody\n\nGoldfish Princess I‚Äôve only sampled a few times. It‚Äôs interesting, for sure.

I loved having an actual reason to browse and search for the perfect scent. And THANK YOU again for such a wonderfully curated box. It was really hit after hit. A way better ratio than I ever have for myself. I'm already obsessed with quite a few scents (Area of Effect-Stardew & Solstice Scents-Lace Draped Spectre being two that I wore just while typing this up). You really have a gift for this!\nI put together some mostly first impression reviews on all of the scented goodies if anyone is interested. I tried not to ramble too much but some scents just inspire a good ramble. \nThere were also some very great  non-scented items! If you have the chance to try the tea Poesie sells I have to highly recommend Geneva. (And if you can't get around to trying Geneva yourself or don't do green teas I would recommend adding a sprig of rosemary to your favorite plain tea. You can thank me later). The other edible goodies did not last very long. I devoured the little banana cakes in no time at all and the other goodies shortly after. The yarn is exactly what I need to finish a tank top I've been knitting! I'll have to share a photo whenever that gets finished!\nOnce again, thank you so much! It was a blast!\n\nBlack Soybean Barley Tea\nBanana Cream Cakes\nHokkaido Milk Caramels in a Melon Flavor \nSchachenmayr Cotton Yarn\nTudor Rose Tea\nPink Moon Tea\nGeneva Tea\nCoin purse\nFeather Butterfly Clip\n\n\nArcana Wildcraft-Cascadian Mermaid: Cannabis concentrate accord, uplifting grapefruit, cotton candy, Moroccan blue chamomile, vanilla-laced sugar cane, warm rain, wild-harvested spruce tips, and shimmery mermaid musk\nMy Thoughts: This is unique and refreshing. The cannabis is there but it's all the best parts of the flower without the stoner, if that makes sense. The grapefruit, rain, and spruce come together in a way that really feels tropical but also grounded in the PNW. Will definitely be reaching for this in warmer weather.\n\nArea of Effect-Blupee!:Lilac, lavender, marshmallow, cream\nMy Thoughts: incredibly floral and clean. The lilac is more forward than the lavender. On application there is something bitter and unpleasant but it pretty quickly becomes lilac baby powder! I tried this on my husband and on him it becomes a lovely clean lavender. Skin chemistry is just so cool.\n\n Area of Effect-Lon Lon Milk: Cream, marshmallow, vanilla, carnation, grass, nag champa\nMy Thoughts: This is a scent that is best enjoyed after it's been on the skin for a bit. It's a little too sharp on application but blooms into a creamy incense with just a hint of carnation. I'm pretty sure the marshmallow is the same culprit from Blupee! giving me a bitter jab on application but again it fades pretty quickly into the incense.\n\nArea of Effect-Stardew: Honeysuckle, peach, sweetpea, apricot, hay, corn pumpkin pie\nMy Thoughts: I feel like I can't quite get enough of this.it's comforting and warm in a way that feels like fall, but somehow also spring? I think the pumpkin comes through like its been oven roasted. The sweetpea is spot on to the sweetpea bouquets I'm overflowing with come summer. This is lovely. If you sit here trying to find all the mentioned notes you can, but if you just want to enjoy them as a whole? It all comes together beautifully. 10/10 my farmer would wear this. \n\nArea of Effect\tMs. Bumbleflower \thoneycomb, wax, carrot cake, gardenia, sweet potato, autumn breeze, cashmere, pumpkin waffles, harvest spice\nMy Thoughts: In the bottle this smells like some kinda yummy sweet potato cake with maybe a patch of flowers around it? On me? It's mostly cashmere, beeswax and white flowers. There is a hint of spiced sweet potato. Overall very cozy.\n\nAstrid Perfume-Caramel Popcorn: Buttery salted popcorn, caramel\nMy Thoughts: This is the kind of perfume that needs a do not drink warning on it. Smells exactly like a bag of buttery kettle corn. I will be on the hunt for more buttery popcorn scents.\n\n\nLucky 9-Lucky #13: Black Cat (Pear, pink pepper, orange blossom, coffee, jasmine, bitter almond, licorice, vanilla, patchouli, cedar), bonfire smoke, pumpkin pie with a gingersnap crust with roasted marshmallows on top!\nMy Thoughts: There's a lot going on in this one. I'm definitely getting classic fall spices and sweet licorice. It's giving fall candle but isn't waxy at all. Maybe a little too spiced for me.\n\nMoonalisa-Mocha Chai Cookies: Roasted Mocha coffee, and chai spices with essential oils of Cardamon, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger, with swirls of nutmeg, cocoa, vanilla, and frothed cream. Rich baked cookie accord of tonka bean, sandalwood, maple sugar, rolled oats and coconut.\nMy Thoughts:This is reminds me of one of my favorite scents. Alkemias Misdeeds after midnight but without the salted caramel or raspberry (so pretty much nothing alike). It gives coffee shop vibes. The coconut is very light but elevates this above being an average coffee scent. It doesn't scream chai but it is perfectly spiced and doesn't give me even the slightest headache. For me it's an everyday kind of scent.\n\nMoonalisa-Strawberry Sugar Shortcake:\tRipe juicy strawberries, crushed and rolled into sweet cane sugar. Then, gently folded into fresh whipped cream on top of a warm buttery shortcake.\nMy Thoughts: Starts very juicy and tart but somewhat artificial. The cake note is there but is overshadowed by the strawberry. It reminds me a bit of a strawberry chapstick or lipgloss. Incredibly long lasting on me.\n\n\nOsmofolia-Dream Bean: Italian coffee beans, decadent cocoa beans, warm vanilla beans, and seductive tonka beans, with patchouli leaves, ribbons of caramel, and wafts of sandalwood incense\nMy Thoughts: Dry, woody, with a soft coffee note. It doesn't smell like drinking a coffee at a cafe but walking by one. Wondering if you have the time to step in for a drink but then wondering if you want a $10 drink or a new perfume. I kinda love it\n\nPoesie-Elemental Tea Party: A swirl of autumn leaves on chilly air, brewed black tea with a discreet splash of whiskey, overturned earth, distant bonfires\nMy Thoughts: This is a beautiful fall tea scent. The whiskey note is subtle, and the leaves and bonfire are the stars of the show. They make a very pleasant woodsy vibe. Probably a scent I'll want to reach for more as the weather stays cool.\n\nPoesie-Madar: Comforting, creamy Basmati rice pudding flavoured with orange flower water, saffron, cinnamon, cardamom, and dried rose petals, then piled high with sugared pistachios.\nMy Thoughts: This is fantastic. It's creamy and in a far better way than most perfumes can achieve on me. The rose is perfectly prominent with a soft hint of orange blossom. I'm not getting any of the spices per say but I am getting an overall delightful dessert!\n\nPoesie-Village Bakery\t: Japanese Milk Bread\nMy Thoughts: This smells like sweet milk bread 100% then the bread fades into a light spiced vanilla? It's giving cinnamon sugar mixed into milk and I dig it\n\nPoesie-Sleepy Ghost: Marshmallow pillows sprinkled with natural lavender essential oil and absolute\nMy Thoughts: A wonderful example of an amazingly done simple perfume. It is exactly as described. And Poesie has a killer marshmallow note.\n\nPoesie-Twice to Tea: Earl grey tea, infused with natural lavender absolute, sweetened vanilla syrup and a splash of milk\nMy Thoughts: This is really lovely. It's sharp and a little tingly in the nose. Does it smell like a strong cup of black tea with lavender and milk? No. Does it smell like a lovely perfume you might wear to a tea party? Absolutely \n\nPoesie-Green Girl: Pistachio, wildflower honey, oatmilk matcha latte, heliotrope blossoms, marshmallow musk\nMy Thoughts: It's definitely a Matcha Latte. Very very light throw. This pistachio doesn't work very well on me but that particular note disappears so quickly its not even an issue!\n\nSolstice Scents-Thornwood Thicket:\tSugared Blackberries, Amber, Oud, Guaiacwood, Oakmoss\nMy Thoughts: Ever gone camping and eat a bunch of wild berries? But now you're covered in berry juice with no way to wash it off because you got lost in the middle of the woods?!? That's this perfume. I'm obsessed. This is both the best blackberry and wood scent I've ever tried\n\nSolstice Scents-Lace Draped Spectre:\tVanilla Musk, Spicy Pink Carnation, Pink Pepper, Rose, White Musk\nMy Thoughts: I like this so much that I would scrub this scent from my memory just to experience trying it on for the first time again. It's creamy and drinkable when first applied but quickly becomes that beautiful spicy carnation. It's not quite sweet or truly spiced. Just about perfect and absolutely suits it's name.\n\nSolstice Scents-Rose Mallow Cream: Moroccan Rose absolute, Bulgarian Rose absolute, Marshmallow Fluff, Strawberry Nectar, White Chocolate, Vanilla, White Musk\nMy Thoughts: On application this smelled JUST like a rose milk tea I used to be obsessed with! My skin does devour this scent.\n\nSolstice Scents-Wilcox Potting Soil: Damp Soil, Wooden Rafters, Spicy Basil, Mossy Terracotta, Mushroom, Leaves, Stone Floor\nMy Thoughts: This is a TRUE garden scent. Or at least my garden. Like being wrist deep in soft black soil while you prepare a spot to transplant your basil plant. There's a soft. wood note that is the star on the dry down. This is one of those scents Ive been actively looking for.\n\n\nSolstice Scents-Postprandial: Vanilla, Irish Cream, Coffee, Chocolate, Bourbon, Pipe Tobacco\nMy Thoughts: In the bottle this smells like an incredibly boozy delicious cocktail. On me it disappears so quickly I couldn't tell I put it on. On my husband it was a very masculine Boozy scent.\n\nSolstice Scents- Solstice Magnolia: Daffodil, jasmine, citrus blossom, osmanthus, magnolia, cypress wood smoke, sun-warmed Earth\nMy Thoughts: This is the first time I've not liked something in the bottle but adored it on me. It is giving bright almost lemony summer Magnolia flowers. There's a wood note that grounds the whole experience with a warmth that my nose reads as an aged vanilla almost? I'm a big fan of Magnolia flowers so this is an instant favorite.\n\nSolstice Scents-Chantilly Cream: Fluffy Whipped Cream, Peach Nectar, Vanilla & Yellow Mandarin\nMy Thoughts: This reads like a peach candle on me. But I only tried it once before bed so honestly that's probably not a fair take \n\nSorce-Venus in Fleurs: Ripe mango, carnivorous plants, humidity, jasmine sambac absolute, vanilla absoluteRipe mango, carnivorous plants, humidity, jasmine sambac absolute, vanilla absolute\nMy Thoughts: I get less mango on the skin than in the bottle. This is mostly jasmine flowers but the single best jasmine flower I've ever smelled. This is a perfume for the floral people out there.\n\nSugar Spider-Softer: Honeyed pistachio, pistachio cream, roasted pistachio, sweet almonds, french vanilla \nMy Thoughts: I don't have any thoughts on this one. I caught a cold before I could test this one and have had a strong case of the sniffles since. What I can smell is very strong almond extract\n\nLoreworks Bubble Milk Tea body wash/bubble bath\nMy Thoughts: Fantastic gentle body wash. The scent is best experienced in a bubble bath and I will be purchasing from Loreworks when I run out.\n\nEpically Epic Lip Balm- Strawberry Buttermilk\nMy Thoughts: Great lip balm with a fantastic strawberry scent.\n\nMoonalisa Apperscotch Hair Detangler \nMy Thoughts: Leaves my hair soft and smelling absolutely delectable!\n\nAgain thank you so much!",

    "body": "\nPrior to my laparoscopic surgery, I did not know I had endometriosis until a month before surgery. Background, I have always had painful periods, at times I could not uncrumple my body from fetus position on hard days. I truly thought this was normal, and that most women went through this. Endometriosis never crossed my mind. \n\nI went to my obgyn with irregular periods and bloating. After an ultrasound I found out that I had two large endometriomas on each ovary (6 and 8 cm). I am 31, and I do very much want to become a mother. \n\nFirst lap on Friday June 18th.\nArrived at the hospital Friday an hour before surgery. They took my vitals, and led me to my bed. They placed my IV and gave me a little lavender essential oil when I let them know I was nervous as this was my first surgery. Unfortunately after my IV was placed I found out my surgery was going to be delayed by 2 hours. About an hour after that my anesthesiologist came by to talk me through what was to come. She was extremely kind and reassuring about being right next to me the entire surgery. I realized at this moment that I was about to go into the OR and I got very anxious! My surgeon came by to let me know they were ready. My surgery was with a robotic Davinci machine, and I fully trusted my surgeon. I was wheeled into the OR around 3:30pm. I was surprised that I hadn‚Äôt received anything to put my to sleep yet, so it really stressed me out when I went in and saw all of the operating room and materials. As soon as I was in though, I was given the ‚Äúhappy‚Äù fluids and before I knew it I was out. I highly suggest making sure you‚Äôre given something before being wheeled into the OR if you‚Äôd be uncomfortable with that scenario. \n\nWaking up and the next moments are all very much a blur to me. I was not in my recovery room yet, but seemed to be on a group bed floor. I think I called out for my husband, and I definitely had the shakes. After that I feel back asleep. \n\nWhen I awoke again I was in my recovery room and it was 9:00pm. My husband was in the room visiting me, and he let me know that I needed to spend the night in the hospital. My surgery ended up being much more extensive than I imagined. So much endometriosis was found. I was told that I have a severe case of stage IV endometriosis, they were able to remove almost all of the tissue except for a small amount below my liver. They were able to remove both endometriomas on each of my ovaries. Sadly, after performing chromopertubation, they found that one of my Fallopian tubes was blocked. This was all obviously a lot to take in that evening. I was still very out of it from the anesthesia and meds, and I just remember constantly being checked on through the evening by several nurses and not really sleeping.\n\n By morning I really felt the pain from the surgery, especially due to the extent of what needed to be removed. Walking the first time to the bathroom the next morning was torture. I don‚Äôt want that to scare anyone, it‚Äôs different for everyone, but that first time off the hospital bed was absolutely miserable and I thought I was dying. I used a walker and that helped, I don‚Äôt know how I would have made it without it. Luckily I was able to urinate right away. The second time I walked it was ten times easier than the first, so unfortunately you just have to will yourself past that first walk and it will get better, I promise!\n\nWhen my surgeon came to talk with me the next morning I was told that I would likely need more surgeries in my future given the severe stage I am in, as well as immediately contacting a fertility clinic to help move me forward with conception if we want children.\n\nAfter I was able to walk the second time, I was discharged and went home just about 24 hours after my surgery. \n\nRecovery:\nThe first 3 days were very, very difficult. I couldn‚Äôt imagine it without the help of my husband. If you live alone I strongly suggest you reach out to family and friends to see if they can help you for the first few days. Moving in bed was painful, even just a flinch the first day. I am propping myself up with a pregnancy U shape pillow, which has been life saving. I‚Äôve placed a heat pad on my lower back, and the shoulder heat pad when I‚Äôm having gas pains. I have my husband help me stuff pillows under my knees and heels, and I find it helps relieve abdomen pain. I‚Äôve been using ice packs on my abdomen where I feel sharp pains or cramping. \n\nI am shocked I haven‚Äôt had more of the gas pain I‚Äôve read about on here. I definitely felt it the first day in the hospital, and I still do feel it when I cry or take short sharp breaths, but it hasn‚Äôt been my main pain. I take gas x and drink peppermint tea when needed. \n\nI did have some discomfort urinating the first few days, at first I thought it was a uti possibly from the catheter in the hospital, but now I‚Äôm not feeling it as much. I‚Äôve had some bleeding, but I wouldn‚Äôt call it heavy. I‚Äôve just switched between pads and liners depending on the amount. \nThe main pain I feel is on my left side right under my incision. It feels like a sharp pain or bruise every time I move. I‚Äôve been taking ibuprofen, Tylenol, and hydrocodone (opioid), depending on my pain. \n\nI finally had a bowel movement today (yay!) after 3 days post op. I have been drinking one glass of mirilax a day leading up to this, and just not straining and letting it come naturally. It will come!\nI‚Äôve been eating plain, veggie broth, crackers, applesauce, toast, and today I had plain pasta for the first time. Just been taking it really easy on the stomach. \n\nI am still having a hard time walking, and have my husband hold my hand anywhere I go for now. It has been getting better each day, but it‚Äôs a slow progress. \n\nI am still coming to terms with being diagnosed with an incurable disease, especially one that has and will impact my ability to have children.  I am still coming to terms with the fact that I‚Äôve been through a major surgery, and that I may have more to go in my life. It‚Äôs heartbreaking, but I am also so grateful to know what‚Äôs happening within my body. I‚Äôm really grateful for the support from everyone who is going through this, no matter what stage of endo you have, we really are all warriors battling our way through a very painful (physical and emotional) disease that we didn‚Äôt ask for.",

If the hydrocodone is actually hydrocodone/acetaminophen, that's actually Vicodin and it's highly addictive.

This is not a smart thing to do, as a lot of perfume houses and I just Don't Get Along, and even when I do, various notes can be hit or miss.\n\nGeneral info about me for matching preferences, etc: I tend to find stuff I like from a few categories, and then stick with those things; I'm not a scent collector or connoisseur and my palette is not terribly developed. I like smoke, cardamom, petrichor, wet dirt, dry dirt, a lot of green smells, some herbs, some florals (usually atmospheric and tempered with a big dose of green or dirt). I like the smell of food and water in real life but very very rarely find gourmands or aquatics that work for me, but occasionally I'll try anyway and get disappointed (foreshadowing!). \n\n**The Dead Rise** *(dark roasted coffee beans spiked with fresh cardamom pods, cubes of brown sugar, ambroxan, cedar)*: Oh, so close. This has, like, 5% of the cardamom I was hoping for, and morphs rapidly into a moderately pleasant brown sugar note. It's a nice brown sugar note - excellent, even - but it's not very interesting and tips into slightly too sweet for me. The coffee was nice for the two seconds it stuck around, but was a bit more abstract than I expected, missing some of the acidity in exchange for being more pleasant. I really want to try this layered over straight up cardamom. There is no hint of cedar on me, although there's a whiff in the bottle. \n\n**Black Cat Cuddles** (*sweet coconut milk spiked with clove, cinnamon and black pepper, incense-dusted fur, flecks of black vanilla bean, a distant pine forest*): I had hope for this because it sounded not too sweet, and the spiced coconut milk sounded like something I'd enjoy in real life. Unfortunately, there is some note in this that is going very bad on me. It doesn't smell like urine, but it definitely makes me think about it before deciding it's not urine. The vanilla is not great on me, either, much more plastic and cloying than I'd expected, and combines with the not-urine in upsetting ways.\n\n**Villa Diodati** *(pungent wild rosemary and fresh balsam pine, crystal clear lakewater, dry, dark vanilla*): I got this because I like rosemary an unreasonable amount, and I had a clear picture in my head of what it would smell like. Unfortunately, either the pine or vanilla note or both together are giving the same not-urine sense as Black Cat. This time, I can tell I'd really like the rest of whatever is in here - the rosemary smells awesome behind it. Maybe eventually the acrid, pungency would wear off, but I can't wait until then. :(\n\n**Forest Cat** (*fuzzy paws tinged with earth, night forest, grey fur musk, milky breath*): I got this one because someone said it actually smelled like their cat. It's very much humid, hot forest. It's got a trace of the note that's bothering me in Villa Diodati and Black Cat, but submerged underneath some nice dirt. I'll probably pass this along to someone who can appreciate it, but I might wear it a few times before I do.\n\n **Always with Me** (*citrus fruits bobbing merrily in wooden tubs filled with spring water, eucalyptus branches, hot steam*): Fuck yes. The eucalyptus has a nice menthol-y kick to it, like a very very classy spa version of a Hall's cough drop. The wood is dark and polished, and the citrus is more an impression than a specific fruit. I really like the humidity of this one - it would be great if you're feeling sick. There's something kinda sweet and vanilla-y at the base that takes a pretty prominent position. As a day-to-day scent, I think I might prefer it a little less sweet. This could just be a skin chemistry thing, so I'll try it on hair/pillowcases to see if that helps modulate it.\n\n**Sweet Sleep** (*caramelized pumpkin flesh, pumpkin pie spices, creamy vanilla, blonde woods, natural lavender essential oil and absolute*): In my past life I did something to vanilla and now it hates me and will haunt me to the ends of the earth. I can smell the lavender trapped by the vanilla, and it smells great, along with the most distant cry for help from a tiny scrap of cinnamon rubbed on a raw pine plank, and then there is only vanilla. (This is not a criticism of the scent - this is why I don't get many gourmands.)\n\n**Children of the Night** (inky black tea, vanilla lace, distant bonfire smoke, ivy climbing up an ancient stone wall, and a soft bite of pepper): inky definitely is the word - dark dip pen ink, and some stone-cold tea left out for at least a day, and yeah, thankfully this vanilla is subdued, crushed by some ivy that was ripped out by its roots, dipped in sugar and then smoked slowly. I really like the bitter, smoky green note in this - it's a very convincing ivy. There's something that reminds me of the smell of new Keds - not exactly a literal rubber note, but something clean and squeaky when wet. I ... like it? I think? I'm not sure I want to smell like dark academia school supply list, but I don't NOT want to smell like that either.\n\n**Madar** (comforting, creamy Basmati rice pudding flavored with orange flower water, saffron, cinnamon, cardamom, and dried rose petals, then piled high with sugared pistachios): lotta roses, a little orange blossom right at the beginning that blows away, some dried roses, the heat of an afternoon in a very lovely, dry courtyard. (That courtyard has roses in it, and outside it, and there are vases of roses inside the house.) There's a bit of a baked/hot quality to the note that's very atmospheric; I wonder if that's how my brain is interpretting the saffron? Eventually there is a rice pudding note,  if I concentrate very hard, and there is a trace of cinnamon, and it's ... really nice. Yay! Gourmand note that I like! There's also a bowl of water with some roses floating in it. The description is right - Madar is comforting, but it's a good thing I like roses.\n\nNothing was an instant favorite, but I'd definitely try more things. I really love some of the notes, and I'm really impressed with the gourmand notes that my skin didn't hate (brown sugar, rice pudding). I will probably try layering some of these with another note or two - I think I might prefer the balance a bit more smoke/spice forward, but I really would like to play more with Madar, The Dead Rise, Children of the Night, and Always With Me.",

Like I enjoy a lot of them but not enough to FS any of the samples I‚Äôve got. I keep finding that I love their smells fresh in the bottle and then a lot of them dry weird for me which is such a bummer. On one hand I want to keep trying samples from Sunday swap in hopes that I‚Äôll find one that really works for me since I feel sooooo close, but on the other hand I‚Äôm like is it worth it if so many of them are just missing what I want üò©\n\nSide note, you might like Athena. It‚Äôs the only one I‚Äôve tried that really works for me (though I don‚Äôt reach for it enough to FS) and I have similar tastes. The earthy vanilla reads kind of bread-y to me but I‚Äôm also super picky with gourmands. If anything I like it for layering",
