    "body": "I've copy/pasted this text multiple times now and decided to just make a separate post about it (and I admit I want to be lazy and just post a link instead of repeatedly copy/pasting a comment). Some of you may recognize a good portion of this, but I've added some points because I'm trying to make this post as comprehensive as possible.\n\nIn order to determine whether a product is water-based or silicone-based, you have to look at the ingredients. -Cone/-methicone, and -siloxane words near the top of the list tend to signal a silicone-based product. Water will be at the top of the list for any liquid product because water makes it liquidy. It doesn't mean that a product is water-based. Without water, the product would not be spreadable/blendable. For example:\n\nMAKE UP FOR EVER HD Microperfecting Primer Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Aqua (Water), **Dimethicone**, **Trisiloxane**, PEG-12 **Dimethicone**, **Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone** Crosspolymer, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Squalane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18 Methicone, Phenoxyethanol, Ceteth-10, Laureth-4, Ethylglycerin, Panthenol, Potassium Sorbate, Polysorbate 60, Parfum (Fragrance), Argania Spinosa Extract (Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract), C12-14 Pareth-12, Hydrolyzed Algin, Dodecene, Sorbitan Isostearate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Tromethamine, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. [CI 19140 (Yellow 5 Lake), CI 75470 (Carmine), CI 77007 (Ultramarines), CI 77288 (Chromium Oxide Greens), CI 77289 (Chromium Hydroxide Green), CI 77491 (Iron Oxides), CI 77492 (Iron Oxides), CI 77499 (Iron Oxides), CI 77742 (Manganese Violet), CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide)].\n\nSee the bold words? Definitely silicone-based! Again, the water keeps it a more liquid-y consistency so it's easily spreadable. It doesn't mean that the product is water-based. Particularly with primers, I can always tell because it has that \"silicone\" feeling. Now let's look at a water-based primer:\n\nLaura Mercier Foundation Primer - Oil Free Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Isodecyl Isononanoate, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, C22-20 Alcohols, Squalane, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Esters, Phenoxyethanol, Boron Nitride, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin Tocopherol Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hamaelis Viginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Cucumis sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Retinyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Polyamino Sugar Condesate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Chlorphensin, Benzoic Acid, Polysorbate 60, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Saccharomyces/Xylium Black Tea Ferment, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Potassium Sorbate, Green 5 (CI 61570), Yellow 5 (CI 19140).\n\nSee how there are no -cone/-methicone or -siloxane words near the top of the list? That means that it's water-based. This primer does contain dimethicone, which is a silicone, but it's relatively low on the list, which means that it contains a very small amount of silicone (ingredients are typically listed in order, beginning with what is in there most and ending with what is in there the least). Thus, because this primer contains much more water (and other ingredients) than silicone, it is water-based.\n\nOil-based foundations are exceptionally rare. After much searching, I finally found one: Alexandra de Markoff Countess Isserlyn Cream Makeup (another is NARS Balanced Foundation, which has been discontinued, so I could not find an easily copy/paste-able ingredients list). Let's look at the ingredients:\n\nWater (aqua), **Decyl Oleate**, **Lanolin Oil**, Propylene Glycol, Talc, Isotearic Acid, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetyl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Fragrance (parfum), Emulsifying Wax NF, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, PPG-12-PEG-65 Lanolin Oil, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben. May contain Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI77492, CI 77499, Ultramarines (CI77007)\n\nYes, water is listed as the first ingredient, but that is to keep the product more blendable. The second and third ingredients (in bold) are definitely oils. Phew! You don't know how many ingredients lists I went through to find that! I swear unicorns are easier to find! ANYWAY, they should play well with silicone-based primers. However, this is unlikely to be of concern to you because chances are you're not using an oil-based foundation (if you are using an oil-based foundation, check your closet for a herd of unicorns).\n\nIn general, you want water-based primers with water-based foundations (or tinted moisturizers, BB creams, CC creams, concealer, or any other base products; I'm just going to keep typing \"foundations\" for the sake of brevity), and silicone-based primers with silicone-based foundations. The two different bases (water and silicone) can cause your foundation to pill when layered on top of each other. In particular, using a silicone-based primer with a water-based foundation on top of it often causes the foundation to pill because the primer creates a silicone barrier. When you try to apply a water-based foundation on top of that, the silicone repels the water in the foundation, and the water in the foundation does not absorb properly into your skin, resulting in unevenness.\n\nPlease remember to moisturize well underneath your makeup (and to give your moisturizer time to absorb fully, meaning your skin should no longer have that \"tacky\" feeling that you have right after applying moisturizer). If you use sunscreen (which you should, especially with summer coming up), you need to let that absorb as well. The base of your moisturizer/sunscreen is irrelevant, because if you allow them to absorb completely, they will not affect makeup application at all. If you begin applying primer and foundation before your moisturizer and/or sunscreen has fully absorbed, they can cause your makeup to break up sooner, which is the opposite of what you want.\n\nAlong the same line, your powder is irrelevant to the base of your foundation/primer. There is no such thing as a water-based powder (it then wouldn't be a powder). If your powder isn't working with your foundation/primer and giving you the look that you want, it is not related to the base of your foundation/primer. Also, not everybody needs to use powder on top of their foundation, so if you're not liking the look, you may consider skipping powder altogether.\n\nAdditionally, you only need a small amount of primer for your face (a very thin layer is sufficient... your face should not feel too slippery). Do not apply too much primer. Water-based primers will absorb into your skin better, but silicone-based primers tend to sit on top of it. Using too much will create a slick film that causes your foundation to slide off much sooner. Remember that it is easier to add more (and I recommend that you add more gradually, little by little) than to take primer off of your face. Over time, you'll get used to the amount you need for your face.\n\nWhile pore-filling primers, such as Benefit Porefessional, NYX Pore Filler, and Too Faced Primed and Poreless, are designed specifically to fill in your visible pores, you can also use any primer to do this (though in my experience, they do not do as well at filling in pores as pore-filling primers, and silicone-based primers work best for filling in pores). Just make sure that you tap the primer into your pores rather than rubbing. Tapping gets the product into your pores to fill them in. Rubbing does not do the same (though you can rub afterward to make sure the surface is smoothed out) and will not give you the same pore-filling results.\n\nFinally, please remember that just because you are using two products with the same base, it doesn't necessarily mean that the products will work for you. Not every product works for every person. You may need to experiment to find the right combination for you. I highly recommend asking for samples, as they are a much cheaper (i.e. FREE) method of trying out a product. You can ask for samples of any product that can be sanitized and put in a small sample jar, such as primer and foundation.\n\nI hope this post has been helpful.

Xane doesn't  specifically refer to any chemical group, it's a mishmash of -ane with an x placed on it. In other words, totally made up.\n\n -siloxane on the other hand is a functional group. For reference, -ane refers to saturated bonds (completely full of hydrogen) \n\n-cone is an abbreviated \"-methicone\" so that still works.\n\nYour rules should therefore list -siloxane and -cone/-methicone as the silicone identifiers instead of -xane.\n\n\n\nExample:\nHexane - not a silicone containing chemical, it's just C6 H14.

    "body": "I’m about to drop a lot of information here, but please read! I learned a lot about how to properly use sulfates and silicones, so I want to share!! \n\nSo here’s what I’ve learned from Sarah Tran, who has thigh length hair. \n\nEdit: People have brought up genetics. Of course genetics is a huge factor in hair length, but the point of this post is to maintain *healthy* hair, so that it will grow with minimal breakage and split ends. I bring up her length because it is *healthy* as well as long. \n\nAlso note: silicones and sulfates won’t directly contribute to hair growth, but will make your hair stronger and less likely to break and fall out, indirectly resulting in longer fuller hair\n\nFirst off, silicones and sulfates are NOT bad. In fact, if she didn’t use silicones, she couldn’t protect her hair and have such long hair without split ends. The way most people USE silicones is bad though. \n\nThink about it like this: If you have a pair of high heels that are comfortable and you love them, but your friend asks you to go jogging, the shoes are not the problem, the *use* is.\n\nSilicones do the following: \n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair which makes it easier to detangle \n\n-Provides UV protection\n\n-Seals in moisture to prevent dryness\n\n-Makes hair look shiny\n\n-Reduces frizz and adds definition to curls\n\n-Softens and smooths cuticle\n\nSilicones do all these amazing things!!!! However, there are 4 types: airy, friendly (easy to wash out), resilient, and NO GO silicones\n\n*\n#Airy silicones: \nThese evaporate out of the hair after 10 minutes to a few hours. These do not have any negative effect on hair:\n\n-Cyclomethicone \n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n*\n#Friendly silicones:\nThese wash out of the hair with sulfate free shampoos:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate) \n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n*\n#Resilient Silicones:\nThese do NOT build up on the strand, but are non soluble and *require a sulfate* to remove:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone -Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n*\n#NO GO Silicones:\nThese require multiple washes with sulfate shampoo to remove. NEVER USE THESE!:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone \n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone \n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18 \n\n-Cetyl Phosphate \n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiylamodimethicone \n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n*\n#Mild Sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nThese are Best used to remove airy and friendly silicones and in your regular, daily mild shampoo. These do NOT remove resilient silicones. \n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n*\n#High Strength HARSH sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nTreat these exactly like harsh sulfates and avoid them when looking for a regular, daily mild sulfate-free shampoo. BEST USED FOR REMOVING RESILIENT SILICONES:\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate \n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n*\n#SULFATES that remove silicones:\nThese strong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Mild sulfates May require more applications to remove resilient silicones:\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n*\n#Also here is a list of cationic (anti-static) ingredients:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n*\n#So basically:\n\n1. Get a good sulfate free shampoo\n\n2. Get a good shampoo that HAS sulfates\n\n3. Use airy and friendly silicones ALL the time\n\n4. Use resilient silicones once or twice a month. This will protect your hair more than friendly silicones. Resilient silicones must be washed out with a SULFATE shampoo at the max FIVE DAYS AFTER APPLICATION\n\n*\n#And one last thing!!! Avoid these ingredients in hair care products: \n\nhttps://airtable.com/shrXz5xqoqRg8yKI2/tblol3s4T5YH103yY\n\nIt is hard to find a product with NONE of these ingredients, so make sure that these

        "body": "Hi! Guys please do your research and don't trust everything you hear. Having thigh length hair is a great achievement but it doesn't make someone a science expert, so posting this on a science sub is so misleading. \n\nI'm seeing some red flags. First off, no scientific sources. Second, commonly demonized ingredients in the push for \"clean\" beauty are again demonized here without proper given cause. And third, there are a few things that stuck out to me as glaringly false from what research I've done. Lastly, fourth, the phrasing at all of \"no go silicones\" and just the incorrect categorization of silicones that assigns them value (better to look at the truer category names: volatile, amine-modified, etc.)\n\nMost ingredients on that \"blacklist\" have little or absolutely no evidence of being bad. \n\nAnd the thing that strikes me as absolutely false is the list of cationic surfactabts as static causing, when most research and literature says the exact opposite - that they're anti static ingredients. Give me a minute and I'll add a few sources for the anti-static claim for cationic surfactants.\n\n> The widely used cationic surfactant docosyltrimethylammonium chloride was overall well performing, especially when it came to reduction of friction force and reduction of flyaway hair during combing. It was superior to the other cationic surfactant tested regarding reduction of frizz. This study suggests that the silicones and protein derivatives showed less promising results regarding the overall manageability. Preliminary data has implications that the efficiency of anti-frizz is correlated with cationic charge and high hydrophobicity of the conditioning agent. \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DYduaceeTnvMJ \n\n> Behentrimonium chloride and Cetrimonium chloride are known to be very effective hair conditioners with detangling, anti-frizz, and anti-static  \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D0FbAuscGO8AJ",

If the terminal length of your hair is way shorter, no amount product is going to fix that, at least not to that extent.

I know there's some research with using brown rice water (I think) to improve the terminal length, but I'm not sure how accurate it is, how much it's been tested, or the details.\n\nNot a scientist, so please correct me if I'm wrong!",

I think 9 times out of 10, they hit the genetic lottery and are trying to capitalize on it. The stuff about some silicones being easier to wash out is true, though people disagree on whether dimethicone needs sulfates to fully wash out, what PEG number something needs to be truly water soluble, etc. And it's true that sulfates are harsher than other cleansers.",

Also some of the other information seems to be inline with what this \"challenge\" promotes. Some of the information might be true, but I've seen this trick before. A service will give some true information, and then make other information appear overly complicated (sometimes twisting information as they go) so customers of their service will eventually get frustrated trying to figure it out (but not before giving them money). give up, and buy their \"good\" products (for more money).",

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

    "body": "Hey there! So I have extremely damaged hair that is breaking off every time I brush it (got a straight perm when my hair was bleached). In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I’ve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or “glucoside”.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or “methosulfate” (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application.

Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt’s best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the “feeling” of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this “protein overload” is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it’s wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

    "body": "I did a [first impressions](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/fc7lcw/regimen_lab_skincare_first_impressions_ingredient/) on the Regimen skincare kit I got almost 3 months ago. \n\nI got a little overexcited (blame my ADHD) but after using them for like 2 months and 3 weeks or so, I have a better idea about how they worked out for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*My skin type:* Dehydrated, **SUPER dry** skin. I mean, **REALLY dry.** Already had dry skin but with tret every other day, it's crazy, crazy dry. I can't do regular tret either, gotta be microsphere. \n\n*Climate:* Dry, desert Cali. Not too cool but not disgustingly hot as of yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, let me eat my words. I figured out that my skin does best with many different hydrating AND nourishing/fatty layers. Trying to simplify my routine made my skin drier and drier and I found myself missing my old products. Anyways.\n\n\\------------------------------------------\n\n# LEVEL Serum\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Propanediol, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Betaine, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tranexamic acid, NAG, Alpha Arbutin, Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Hexanediol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizinate, Tetrahydrodiferuloylmethane, Hexylresorcinol, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Salix Alba Bark Extract, Salix Nigra (Willow) Bark Extract, Dimethylmethoxy Chromanol, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** Light, liquidy, slightly gel-like. Has a \"glycol\" feel rather than completely water-like. I think people who have never felt the raw glycols before describe it as something slightly \"oily\". Dimethyl isosorbide also feels similar to glycols, but much lighter and not sticky like them. Absorbs quickly. Non-sticky. Layers well with others. \n\n**COLOR:** Pale yellow-tinted transparent gel.\n\n**SCENT:** None.\n\n**RESULTS:** Light texture/pore refinement. Noticeable, but not hugely so. \n\nI am ***extremely*** prone to dark spots. I only get breakouts on my chin. The PIE/PIH that gets left over from acne are only on my chin. The other spots are from sun damage. Aaaand, as you can see from the before and after pictures, my dark spots have actually gotten slightly worse, and more numerous. It's easier to tell irl than in pictures. \n\n[Before/After pics](https://imgur.com/a/SAWwCqK)\n\nI feel like I haven't given it enough time to see real results since I used it for less than 3 months. 3 months is the standard time you should give skin-brightening products time to work. But from the results I can glean from this limited time, I am not super impressed. \n\nHowever, I'm willing to give it another try if it comes out for $35 instead of $45, because I *mostly blame the switch to a new sunscreen* on my spots darkening/getting more dark spots. \n\nI know many people love the Purito centella sunscreen, but it just is not protective enough for my skin type. I am super diligent about sun protection, and the 99% of the sun I get is from commuting in the car once or twice a week (\\~20 min) and sitting in front of windows for meals. I have blackout curtains in my room and only exercise during the night. \n\nSorry for the rant, but I'm honestly kind of upset that the progress on my dark spots that I worked so hard on for years have been reversed a little. \n\nAnyways, the ingredient list is absolutely fantastic. It's definitely a much better deal than Skinceuticals' 3% tranexamic + 5% niacinamide serum. So perhaps if I use a better sunscreen and give it longer, LEVEL may work better for me. \n\n**PRICE:** *$35-45 /30ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** Maybe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# VITAMIN X Serum\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Propanediol, Ascorbic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Propylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Acetyl Zingerone, Glycerin, Hexanediol, Tocopherol, Epigallocatechin Gallate, Ferulic Acid, Resveratrol, Genistein, Glutathione, Quercetin, Silymarin, Hesperidin Methyl Chalcone, Dimethylmethoxy Chromanol, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** Also has a \"glycol feel\". Lightweight, absorbs quickly. Feels like I should use it after watery toners, but since it's vitamin C, I used it before anything else. \n\n**COLOR:** Orange tinted transparent gel. It did not change color the entire time I have had it, but I can't be sure of course, because of the original color. I imagine I will only be able to tell once it oxidizes heavily and turns brownish. \n\n**SCENT:** None.\n\n**RESULTS:** Light texture refinement. Like the LEVEL serum, I started out only using it once a day. Then I switched to using it twice a day after about almost a month in or so. \n\nGave my skin a subtle, soft glow. \n\nCompared to the Timeless Vitamin C serum, I just didn't see nearly as much texture/pore refinement and glow factor. I have the type of skin that sees zero results from ascorbic acid derivatives (SAP, MAP, etc).\n\nA bit disappointing on the visual results department, but perhaps other people may like it for all the other antioxidants loaded in this serum that may be protecting the skin without visual refinement. \n\nI was still happily using it up, BUT, I had to stop several days ago. I noticed that it was suddenly filled with tons of little grains??? \n\nI'm not sure if you can [**see it in the pictures**](https://imgur.com/a/PkTvttF), but it almost seems like the vitamin C in the serum spontaneously changed back to powder form.\n\nWhat the hell happened? Stability issue? I am not sure. \n\nAmbitious little serum, but it didn't work out for me in practice.\n\nI'm testing out Maelove Glow Maker at the moment, and so far Timeless is winning out but since it's only been a very short time, we'll see. Am planning to try a Skinceuticals sample next. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$50-60 / 30ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# WAVE Serum\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Betaine, Glycerin, Urea, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Saccharide Isomerate, Sodium PCA, Sodium Lactate, Sorbitol, Lactic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Pectin, Proline, Serine, Arginine, Glucose, Fructose, Maltose, Trehalose, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Allantoin, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** A thin gel. Thicker and heavier-feeling than LEVEL & VITAMIN X. Absorbs a little slower. Still lightweight.  \n\n**COLOR:** A slightly cloudy, transparent.\n\n**SCENT:** None.\n\n**RESULTS:** It has a ton of beneficial ingredients, and was pretty hydrating. But for some reason, I found myself reaching for this less than my other, more watery hydrating essences/toners. \n\nIt may just be my personal preference, but I've been more into thinner, watery layers more than thicker ones as of late. \n\nFelt similar to Hada Labo Premium lotion but a little less hydrating? I still quite enjoyed using it. \n\nThis would be plenty of hydration for most people probably, but I have exceptionally dry skin, and this by itself was not enough to really plump out my skin. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$40-50 / 30ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** Maybe, if it was cheaper. Urea in serum form is a really rare find. But I can probably get a similar effect with a couple of different serums and a urea moisturizer combined for cheaper. If my skin wasn't so darn dehydrated and dry, this would be a fantastic all-in-one sort of convenient step for me since it really has every humectant your skin can use/has naturally. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TABULA RASA Cleanser\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Betaine, Propanediol, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate (and) Aqua (and) PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Acrylates Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, Phenylpropanol, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic acid, Citric Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin.* \n\n**TEXTURE:** A fluid gel. It doesn't foam up a whoooole lot, but the ideal amount foams up to a thick, luxurious feeling foam if you keep rubbing. It has more \"slip\" than Sunday Riley's Ceramic Slip cleanser if you've used that before. (If you use too little, it fails to foam.)\n\nIt feels really similar to my drugstore HG cleanser, Garnier SkinActive Gentle Sulfate-Free Cleanser initially. But that one doesn't create nice, thick feeling foam. That one cleans well but foams out to very small, non-substantial foam. \n\n**COLOR:** A opaque, white gel. \n\n**SCENT:** A strong, glue-like smell? No masking fragrance. \n\n**RESULTS:** I'm not always a gel-cleanser type of gal, but I actually really enjoy using this cleanser. It really *does* feel MOIST after washing, like my initial assessment. I personally have not used a cleanser with that sort of after-feel before. As a dry-skinned person, I *really* like that!\n\nIt didn't end up drying me out. I found it a really nice, hydrating second cleanser. The only issue was the strong smell, but I have a sensitive nose. I prefer it to smell a little weird than it be loaded with fragrance, personally. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$17-20 /100ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** Yes, I really like this cleanser and would not mind having it on my sink if it came in pretty packaging! I can find other cleansers that can do the job just fine, but if it was pretty and maybe came in a bigger size, I can definitely see myself repurchasing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# C.R.E.A.M.\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Squalane, Capric/Caprylic Triglycerides, Propanediol, Glycerin, Glyceryl Glucoside, Isosorbide Dicaprylate, Phospholipids, Ursolic Acid, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Bisabolol, Isoamyl Laurate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Cholesterol, Stearic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Tocopherol, Dimethoxymethyl Chromanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** Picture of texture [here](https://imgur.com/EhE4aHM). A *very* thick, nourishing cream. A little hard to spread. Layered well with other things, cosmetically elegant.\n\n**COLOR:** White, opaque. \n\n**SCENT:** None. \n\n**RESULTS:** I have this MIGHTY NEED to try out as many ceramide/pseudo-ceramide/barrier repair creams as I can get my hands on. So I was REALLY excited to try this cream out. \n\nThis cream was really moisturizing and felt protective on the skin. However, I had to use quite a lot to moisturize my skin. So I ran out of it pretty fast. \n\nIt felt really good, but it failed to keep my skin completely flake-free under sunscreen & makeup and throughout the night by itself. \n\nBut **please** keep in mind that I have *incredibly* dry skin; My skin is an asshole and it's not enough to merely slug life with Vaseline/Aquaphor/CeraVe Healing ointment. It needs lots of humectants and lots of FATS & occlusives to keep it from feeling tight. (I have eczema-prone body skin as well and go through moisturizers by the bucketloads..)\n\nNone of these creams *by themselves* can prevent me from waking up to skin tighter-feeling than I'd like despite *slathering* them on: CeraVe cream & First Aid Beauty UR creams - *way* too light & matte, Atopalm MLE, Zeroid Intensive, Zeroid Oint-Cream (almost!), Real Barrier Extreme, Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Cream, La Roche Posay Lipikar AP+ Baume, Udderly Smooth, etc. \n\nI have to layer multiple of these on in order to wake up to moisturized skin. The only ones applied by themselves that give me the same results as layering multiple on are Aveeno eczema therapy cream & Ceradan barrier repair cream so far.\n\n(I have a big review post coming up sometime in the future on all these but it's gonna take a while.\\^)\n\nI've seen other reviews saying how much this C.R.E.A.M. has helped their dry skin, so I think it should work well for most folks. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$45-55 / 50ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** No, unless somehow they come out with an actual bucket-sized option for cheap lmao. \n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\nHope that helps! I had a lot of fun trying this kit. The company's customer service was incredibly helpful and nice. I hope they can tweak and improve on some things and their actual release goes well!",

I tried a bunch of the zeroid products (oint cream, soothing cream, and 5% urea cream) and the oint-cream is my favorite for night time, urea for day, and the soothing cream is alright but has a stickier consistency that I don’t like as much. Would repurchase the other 2 probably but none of them made me go WOW. \n\nMeanwhile I’m still hoarding the tiny sample of the skinceuticals cream I got and it’s been my go-to whenever I get a random dry patch.

    "body": "• There aren’t that many reviews of products by Bonajour online so I decided to make a review post. All of the products were purchased from Amazon through the official Bonajour seller. \n\n(Obviously not sponsored)\n\n1.) Coconut Oil Body Moisturizer (300 ML)\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Cetearyl Olivate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sorbitan Olivate, Pinus Densiflora Extract, Saussurea Involucrata Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Olivoyl Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Glyceryl Oleate, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Arginine, Carbomer, Fragrance, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n- Review: I’ve repurchased this body lotion multiple times already. The scent is so heavenly and it feels so good on my body. This moisturizer is lightweight but moisturizing. 5/5\n\n2.) Sensitive Skin Body Wash (500 ML)\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Disodium cocoamphodiacetate, Lauryl Glucoside, Propanediol, Sodium cocoyl glutamate, Sodium chloride, Glycerin, Centella Asiatica Extract, Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosmary) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Aniba Rosodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil, Octyldodecanol, Echium Plantagineum Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Butylene Glycol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hexylene glycol\n\n- Review: I love this body wash, I’ve purchased it 2 times and it lasts for a while too (even with daily use). It has a relaxing smell and it lathers well. I put this body wash on a Salux washcloth and the body wash doesn’t dry out my skin. 5/5\n\n3.) Mugwort Cream Calming Mask (1.9 fl. oz)\n\n- Ingredients: Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract(32.20%), Water, Kaolin, Butylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Bentonite, Sorbitan Olivate, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Apium Graveolens (Celery)Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Brassica Rapa (Turnip) Leaf Extract, Solanum Lycopersicum (Tomato) Fruit/Leaf/Stem Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Brassica OleraceaItalica (Broccoli) Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Cinnamomum Cassia Bark Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosmary) Leaf Extract, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Enantia Chlorantha (Bark) Extract, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pusatilla Koreana Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Citrusparadisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Octyldodecanol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant) Seed Oil, Oleanolic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder (4,000ppm), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Powder, Tocopherol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Artemisia Vulgaris Oil(500ppm), Sod\n\n- Review: I’m still going through my first purchase of this and it’s grown on me. Although I prefer the I’m From Mugwort Mask, this mask is skin calming too. I use mask this during my menstruation cycle (where my skin is more prone to having skin inflammation) and it felt very nice. I also like how the date when opened can be written on the product + it’s a cheaper mugwort product. 4/5\n\n4.) Propolis Serum (100 ML) \n\n- Ingredients: Propolis Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Water, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Cinnamomum Cassia Bark Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Ulmus Campestris (Elm) Bark Extract, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Gleditsia Australis Thorn Extract, Angelica Dahurica Root Extract, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Bletilla Striata Root Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Seed Extract, Trichosanthes Kirilowii Root Extract, Broussonetia Kazinoki Root Extract, Eugenia Caryophyllus (Clove) Flower Extract, Amomum Xanthioides Seed Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Sodium Carbomer, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Epigallocatechin Gallate\n\n- Review: I have mixed thoughts about this product. The price is really good especially for the size (100 ML). I would recommend this serum for oily skin types. This is more of a skin calming serum rather than a hydrating one. It did calm my face but did little for my acne. This product is also unscented. I didn’t repurchase the serum. 3/5 \n\n5.) Seaweed Lotion (150 ML) \n\n- Ingredients: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Butylene Glycol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Water, Sargassum Fulvellum Extract, Gelidium Cartilagineum Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycerin, Panthenol, Polyglutamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Allantoin, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n- Review: I also have mixed thoughts about this lotion. This product is unscented and the smell of the moisturizer doesn’t bother me. This is a very basic moisturizer. Sometimes this would make my face feel itchy but my face was dehydrated at the time I was using this. I wouldn’t repurchase it and am now using it as a hand lotion (which works). 3/5\n\n6.) Seaweed Skin Toner (150 ML)\n\n- Ingredients: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Water, Sargassum Fulvellum Extract, Gelidium Cartilagineum Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Polyglutamic Acid, Panthenol, Allantoin, Betaine, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n- Review: This is a great toner but after I started using the Matsuyama Hadauru Moisturizing Infusion Balancing Lotion, I used this one less. I haven’t repurchased it. I also used it before applying lotion on my body (which feels nice and cooling). This is a lightweight toner that can easily be layered. This product is also unscented. 4/5",

Doesn't lather much and does not dry out the skin either. I use it when i need a light cleanse, for example after an oil cleansing balm that emulsifies. I wouldn't recommend using it after a first cleanser like a carrier oil that doesn't emulsify on its own as it it won't be able to remove the oil. Will not recommend it to use to remove sunscreen alone it is really gentle for that. I got it on a 30%+ sale from vanity wagon, hence it was a good deal at that price. While finding out the ingredients list for this post, I realized it has so many fragrance components that a lot of people in this sub wouldn't appreciate, but YMMV I guess?!! (I got it a year ago when I didn't have any skincare knowledge and was attracted to ayurvedic brands. Having said that I don't regret this purchase at all and I still believe SoulTree is one of the better ayurvedic brands. Personally I'm not allergic to fragrance yet, so I don't mind it) It maybe perfect for a gentle morning cleanser too as its the perfect amount of gentle but personally I don't use a cleanser in the morning. It has a pH of 5 as per the website. Haven't tested myself.\n* *Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status: WRP if I don't find a better alternative (only if it is on sale, I don't believe in spending 600 on a cleanser, the only purpose of which is to clean).",

Would I personally be willing to pay to live the Loopha lifestyle? No but I’m curious to see how long this line will last.\n\nI’m looking forward to seeing some reviews on this. I don’t see any glaring issues with the formula. It’s a body wash so the fragrance is fine by me. If I want to “splurge” on a body wash/shower gel, though, I doubt that I would that I reach for this over a shower gel from Lush even though this product is way cheaper per oz.\n\nEdit: a word",

    "body": "Product: Youth To The People Kale + Green Tea Spinach Vitamins Superfood Cleanser\n\nProduct Size: 8OZ/237ML\n\nProduct Consistency: Lightweight Gel-Style Cleansing Fluid\n\nProduct Start Date: October 6th 2019\n\nWhen I Use It: Morning and Evening Routine - Daily \n\nHow I Use It: I apply a half to three quarters of a pump of Product into my damp hands and work it into a lather. Then, I massage the lather into my Skin for 1-2 minutes…making sure to do a gentle yet thorough job of cleansing. Then, I rinse with warm water.\n\nWhy I Use It: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* After having such a positive experience with the Facial Mist and slowly becoming more interested in “Clean” Skincare/Sustainable Packaging…I began collecting the rest of the Youth To The People Line. This Cleanser was particularly interesting as the version I have was for Pride Month. All of the proceeds for these Limited Edition Cleansers went to the support of GLSEN…an organization dedicated to safe and inclusive education for LGBTQ students (up to $50,000 USD). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Aside from that, Youth To The People in particular has some really long Product Names…but they totally draw me in. Seeing Ingredients like Kale and Spinach was intriguing to me.\n\nOverall Review:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* When I first used this Cleanser I immediately thought “Okay, I can just go ahead and give away/sell all of the other Cleansers in my Stash…shut it all down…we have a winner.” LOL! I wish I could say that I wasn’t totally impressed by this Product immediately so as not to seem biased…but here we are. Let’s dig in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Some of the initial things that I liked were the packaging and size of this Cleanser. The glass bottle will be SUPER easy to re-use for another Product like Hand Wash or something. And, even though this Cleanser is a bit pricey at first glance…the amount you pay per OZ is actually much less than some of my other favorite Cleansers (the Peach & Lily Power Calm Hydrating Gel Cleanser and Sulwhasoo Snowise EX Cleanser come to mind). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The consistency and feel of this Cleanser isn’t necessarily “mind blowing” by any means. It looks and feels a lot like a basic Gel Cleanser. But, although this is a gentle/low pH Product…it lathers up quite nicely and holds that lather throughout the cleansing process. Many gentle Cleansers like this offer little to no lather or one that dissipates really quickly. I’ve learned to love the no lather way of life…but its nice to find a Product that is gentle and gives me that foamy satisfaction LOL!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* As for the Formula…thats where things get extra interesting. Panthenol makes it pretty high on the Ingredients List followed by Vitamin E, Ascorbic Acid, Kale Leaf Extract, Spinach Leaf Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, Chamomile Flower Extract, Alfalfa Extract, and Aloe Leaf Extract. There are of course various texturizes and preservatives…but the concentration of them seems pretty low with a bigger focus on the Featured Ingredients.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What really surprised me about this Cleanser is the focus on hydration/nourishment…which is almost as key as the cleansing when you look at the Ingredients List. And I totally found this to be the case as I used it. This Cleanser is honestly one of the most hydrating and gentle ones I have tried. I have to say it is at least on par with the Peach & Lily Power Calm Gel Cleanser…but maybe just slightly more intense. After each cleanse my Skin feels soft and almost dewy…like I’ve just used a hydrating Serum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Aside from that...the “Superfood” Extracts in this Formula are also surprise winners. I typically don’t put too much stock into soothing, anti-oxidant, or brightening Ingredients when they are included in Cleansers. This is a Product that is washed off of the face rather quickly…so those Ingredients don’t have a ton of time to do their magic. However, over time I did notice an overall brightening effect from using this Cleanser (along with the other Youth To The People Products). I cant say specifically that this Cleanser alone made it happen…but I have to think it didn’t hurt. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* By the second or third week of using this Superfood Cleanser…I was hooked. The incredibly refreshing scent of “cut greenery” is probably one of the best around…all without Synthetic Fragrance. This in addition to the results I was seeing and I was really happy I decided to give this Product (and Brand) a try.\n\nSo thats it, I love it, love it, love it. It comes in a bottle I want, its a relatively decent value compared to other Cleansers/Brands in this category, and its probably the most gentle and hydrating Cleanser I have used second to the Peach & Lily Power Calm Gel Cleanser. But, I have to give this Superfood Cleanser a couple of bonus points for all of the antioxidant rich, brightening, and soothing Ingredients. Peach & Lily’s Cleanser is also quite calming…but I think I just saw more “in your face” improvement to my Skin with the Superfood Cleanser supporting the rest of my Routine.\n\nThis is a Product that I would absolutely recommend to all Skin Types as it was super gentle yet offered enough of a cleanse that I think those with Combination/Oily Skin will get along with it just fine. That plus the addition of hydration and antioxidants makes this a real winner to me. I know I said I’m ready to say goodbye to the rest of my Water based Cleanser Stash…but you know I cant do that LOL! I’ll continue to try/Review but I’m keeping a back-up bottle of this Youth To The People Cleanser on hand at all times!\n\nThings To Note:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I just wanted to give you all a quick Per OZ price breakdown of my top three Water Based Cleansers to give a better idea of the “value” I saw in this Youth To The People Product:\n\nYouth To The People Superfood Cleanser: $4.50 USD Per OZ (as priced on their website)\n\nSulwhasoo Snowise Brightening Cleanser: $7.72 USD Per OZ (as priced on YesStyle)\n\nPeach & Lily Power Calm Hydrating Gel Cleanser: $8.28 Per OZ (as priced on their website)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nWater (Aqua), Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Butylene Glycol, Brassica Oleracea (Kale) Leaf Extract, Spinacia Oleracea (Spinach) Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Medicago Sativa (Alfalfa) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Natural Fragrance, Lecithin, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Chlorophyll\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3r7jttoe39p41.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc83beec429adbdf289f87ad9a3facccf90897ad",

I bought it on a whim and didn't expect much, but my skin has been absolutely incredible since then so I feel like I have to share it with everyone.\n\nIt is *super* gentle. My skin never gets red using it (and my skin gets red from literally anything touching it) - in fact, it looks much calmer than usual while the cleanser is on it and immediately after. It does sting my eyes when it gets into them, which is sad for a 'sensitive' cleanser because usually that's a fun little magic trick to try, but my skin never stings from it and feels really soft afterward. It also foams up beautifully, so using it with a konjac sponge can be really fun but not completely necessary. I haven't broken out much since using it - and every time I have can be directly tied to me falling asleep in makeup because bad decisions.\n\nI also tested its pH with the strips that I have. I always see bloggers put disclaimers to take pH strip results with a grain of salt, so I guess take this with a grain of salt, but: it showed up as a nice 4.5, so this definitely counts as a low pH cleanser.\n\nI haven't been this satisfied with any 'second cleanser'  (non-oil cleanse) for a while, so I'm delighted I found this and that it's only $10 and has a good low pH. I really recommend it to try for anyone still struggling to find a good cleanser (plus, if a bunch of people buy it because of me it'll probably be available and not in danger of being discontinued for longer, heh).\n\nIngredients (from Ulta website, I think they misspelled some things though): \n>Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Aloe Vera Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Gluconolactone (Corn), Cetearyl Glucocide, Capric/ Caprylic Triglycerides, Aqua (Purified), Caprylyl Glycol, Proanediol, Gylceryle Undercylenate, Sucrose State, Decyl Glucocide, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Glyceryl Caprylate, Lactobacillus/Punica Granatum Fruit Ferment Extract, Bioflavanoids, Potassium Sorbate, Parfum (All Natural), Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Calendula Flower Extract\n\n(My only beef with this product is that Pacifica NAMED THE PRODUCT after quinoa when it's the second to last ingredient, but I can let that slide, because it's a fantastic product)",

    "body": "Just to put into perspective, I'm 32F and started tretinoin a few months ago, which has caused my skin needs to change. My skin is combo/leaning towards dry (used to be combo/oily) and more sensitive (I can NOT tolerate niacinamide). \n\nLike many others, my skin did *not* like the new Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser formula and I've been struggling to find something ever since. The Differin Gentle Cleanser is listed a lot, but it appears that this facial cleanser has also been discontinued.\n\nThe ingredients aren't completely the same, however on my quest to find a cleanser that is both gentle, doesn't sting, doesn't cause redness, and doesn't dry out my skin, I came across the [Japanese Curel Foaming Face Wash](https://kao-h.assetsadobe3.com/is/image/content/dam/sites/kaousa/www-curel-com/curel-japan/master/global/curel-foaming-facial-wash-front.jpg?fmt=jpeg&qlt=85&wid=588). For those that double cleanse, they make a Make-Up Cleansing Gel as well (I can't vouch for it, but I did see that it exists).\n\n\n#**INGREDIENTS**\n**Japanese Curel:** Water/Aqua, Glycerin, Maltitol, Propylene Glycol, PEG-150, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Lauroyl Aspartate, Lauryl Hydroxysultaine, Polysorbate 60, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Potassium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben.\n\n**Old Cetaphil Formula:** Water, Cetyl Alcohol, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Stearyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben\n\n\n\n\n**Since I've become aware of the formula change, here are other face cleansers that I've tried and my skin did not like:**\n\n* **Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser** -  not gentle enough/stripped my skin. Did NOT cause redness.\n* **Aveeno Calm+ Restore Cleanser Gentle Nourishing Oat Face Cleanser** - First night was fine, after that my face got itchy, tight, and red.\n* **Belif Aqua Bomb Jelly Cleanser** - I had this lying around from a sample pack I had. It was fine to bridge me between cleansers for a day or two, but would not work as an every day cleanser.\n* **Olay Regenerist Collagen Peptide 24 Cream Cleanser** - I had this one lying around in my graveyard of face washes. It didn't dry out my skin, but my face was super red (niacinamide). \n* **The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser** - I genuinely don't know if you can use this as just a one-step cleanser. I don't really wear heavy make-up, so I don't need to double cleanse. Either way, sometimes my skin liked this, sometimes my skin ended up drier. Caused redness.\n* **ETUDE SoonJung pH 6.5 Whip Facial Cleanser** - Gentle, but my skin still felt dry after. I think this would work better for combo/leaning towards oily skin. \n* BONUS: Garnier Micellar Water Rose Water/Vitamin C - Both feel the same to my face and I'll admit I have no idea what I'm doing with micellar water. I started using this to take off sunscreen/eye make-up before cleansing my skin or to clean the shell of my ears on a non hair-wash day. \n\n\n*Side note, I'm in the market for a chemical sunscreen without niacinamide. Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun : Rice + Probiotics feels amazing but causes redness like no other. I currently use Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch, which is fine.* \n\nApologies if the formatting is atrocious.",

Another gem was the Philosophy Purity cleanser (original formula). They only changed these because of the paraben mafia, mind you. Phenoxyethanol has been the \"preservative dujour\" of the moment but,  it is far more dangerous than parabens; it will cause contact dermatitis/acne on site. Hopefully, people wake up to that.",

I got pH strips and have been entertaining myself looking for things to test; here are some new products in my collection.  \n\n**Sonia Kashuk \"Resurface\" Gentle Exfoliating Wash, Target, $15/4.2 oz/125 ml, pH ~7 [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_011a202371.html)**  \n*ingredients*  \n> Water (aqua), diatomaceous earth, glyceryl stearate se, stearic acid, glyceryl stearate, cocamide mea, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sodium lauryl sulfoacetate, propanediol, cetearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, glycerin, vitis vinifera (grape) seed oil, glycyrrhiza glabra (licorice) root extract, rheum rhaponticum root extract, cyathea medullaris leaf extract, ethylhexylglycerin, steareth-21, ceteareth-20, panthenol, polyquaternium-7, aloe barbadensis leaf juice powder, methyldihydrojasmonate, carbomer, disodium edta, sodium hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, chlorphenesin, potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, benzyl alcohol, methylisothiazolinone, titanium dioxide (ci 77891)  \n\nThings I like:  \n* Not expensive  \n* Great for exfoliating legs pre-shave  \n* Unscented and fragrance free  \n* Licorice root extract (!)  \n* Non-foaming, non-oily  \nThings I don't:  \n* Fine grains (diatomaceous earth) but too rough for most face use  \n**Sonia Kashuk \"Renew\" Micro Exfoliating Toner, $15/5.7 oz/170 ml, pH 4, Target**  \n*ingredients*  \nNot listed online, and I'm too lazy to type it out right now. Good: more licorice! Bad: citrus fruit extracts! Meh: witch hazel!  \nThings I like:  \n* pH okay  \n* seems to be doing something  \n* no fragrance  \n* is an okay toner, packaging/dispenser is nice    \n* no alcohol   \nThings I don't:  \n* lacks straightforward/proven exfoliating ingredients  \n* unknown quantities of AHA from fruit sources  \n**Pacifica \"Sea Foam\" Complete Face Wash, $8-10/5 oz/147 ml, Ulta/Target/etc, pH ~5, [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2c68115146.html)**  \n*ingredients*  \n>Purified Water, Cocomidopropyl Betaine (Coconut Source), Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate (Coconut Source), Sodium Cocoyl Sulfoacetate (Coconut Source), Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Decyl Glucoside (Corn Source), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycerin (Vegetable), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Glycol Stearate, Carica Papaya Extract, Lemon Bioflavanoids, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, , Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Citric Acid, Tocopherol Acetate, Panthenol, Napca, Allantoin, Nori Extract, Garcinia Mangostana Peel Extract (Mangosteen), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract (White Tea), Sea Algae Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance (All Natural).  \n\nThings I like:  \n* Nice amount of lather (on par with other low-pH cleansers)  \n* Does a good job removing sunscreen, makeup, and everything else in one go  \n* Good pH  \n* Leaves my skin feeling clean but not tight/dry  \nThings I don't:  \n* Coconut oil content means this isn't for everyone  \n* Includes fragrance (mild/coconutty and last on list, but still)  \n* Burns my eyes really, really badly if it gets in them at all  \n  \nI don't know if I'll repurchase these in the future (since I'm just starting out using them) but figured others could use the reference. Also: the Sonia Kashuk face oil is dumb and don't even bother with it. Also: once the SK face mask shows up at Target, I'll be trying that also. Also!  \nAny tried any of these and have insights? I'm looking forward to what comes out of the Sonia Kashuk skincare line--there are supposed to be several new products being launched throughout the next few months.  \nEdited: formatting.  \nETA: [Toner ingredients.](http://imgur.com/wGCV3oi)\n",

I don’t have a kid and personally would probably not use anything that has actual feces in it, but short of that my only rule for greywater has been “no touching leaves I’m going to imminently eat.” Every drain in my house (except for the toilet) goes into hoses that go right onto the soil of veggie patches and fruit tree guilds. So far everything’s thriving and I’ve never gotten sick in 6 years of this. I also never store my water for any amount of time, even in winter I make sure the hoses stay clear and shunt everything onto the land. My philosophy is that the pathogens that the greywater contains, if it’s not allowed to sit for any amount of time and reproduce, are going into hostile territory when they reach the soil and will get promptly eliminated by either the sun or other microbes. I also wash produce thoroughly (with the water going back into the yard) and prefer cooking or fermenting vegetables, so that probably helps too.

I use one pump, twice a day, and when it comes in contact with water, it generates just the right amount of beautiful foam.  It is super easy to rinse off, nothing lingers behind.  My skin feels refreshed and clean but not dried out.\n\n**Results:**  I fell in love.  This is my holy grail cleanser, hands down.  It helps my skin retain moisture and cleanses without aggravating redness.  And a huge bonus for me is that it smells like lavender, but I know that isn't for everyone.\n\n**Packaging:**  Standard plastic bottle and pump.  Nothing remarkable in that aspect.\n\n**Repurchase?**  Already did!  I've had a bottle on stand-by since July because I kept thinking I'd run out faster than I actually did.

They are both smooth whitish liquids; The bariesun is a tad more runny and shiny but leaves no whitecast, whereas the bioderma has a minimal one. \n\nI suspect the reason I like the photoderm slightly better is that it hasn't dimethicone, unlike the bariesun. It didn't cause me any real problems(not very high in the list), I just felt my skin wasn't as smooth as when using the photoderm so I went back to it. Other than that I was happy with it, it does what it says; doesn't sting the eyes, makeup applies nicely on top, no tanning.\n\n So if you aren't prone to clogging  I'd definetely recommend trying it.",

There was a baby shampoo product we used to use that made the boys' coarse hair quite soft.

I bought it as soon as I saw it came out, and unfortunately have been a little meh about it but I think that's partially my own fault for getting myself overhyped. I think it's a generally good cleanser, not very drying, skin feels clean but not stripped. I just think the glow mud cleanser is leaps and bounds better. The rose cream cleanser is a lot softer and creamier in texture than the glow mud in a way I personally don't prefer. Also I'm in love with rose scented products so I couldn't wait to lather up this cleanser's rosy glory, but the smell is kinda weird to me. It says on the packaging \"rose and chamomille\" and I onlyyyy smell chamomille (which could be a good thing if you're into that!). I'm not irritated or bothered by fragrance usually and actually seek out good smelling products, but this just did not do it for me in the smell department. I think it's a good product that is worth trying, and I think some people will love it, but it wasn't for me. I will definitely use it up but not repurchase. Hope that wasn't too much of a downer lol",

I used it once in the morning and once at night.\n\n\nNow, I have relatively sensitive, yet strange skin. Tea tree oil makes me itch, but I can tolerate retin-a and aha almost daily. Certain lotions and washes make me break out as well. I have extremely mild acne that is influenced a lot by the environment (water especially.) I typically only need a gentle wash containing either SA or BP, some light moisturizer, and some jojoba oil to dislodge any clogged pores and I'm golden. AHA and tea tree oil for spot treatments helps me out as well.\n\n\nI desperately wanted to like this wash. I really enjoyed it for the first month, and it did keep everything on my face relatively neutral. No extreme breakouts or anything. Unfortunately, it didn't do much for any of the closed comedones that the cerave PM moisturizer gave me, or even just regular pimples I had before I started using it.\n\n\nIt also seemed to inhibit the clearing/fading of dark marks. I'm not sure, but it seems to have actually made them worse. I had popped a medium-ish pimple about a month and a half ago, in early july. It was on my cheek and left a decent sized dark mark. I had just gotten this face wash around that time. Now, normally my dark marks fade really quickly, lasting only a week or two at the most. I use AHA on them and that really seems to help. This time around, nothing was helping. It seemed to spread and get bigger too, if you can believe that. Once one portion of it decided to go away, the other part would get bigger. So strange. Anyways, I switched to a different cleanser, and the mark that had started out at less than the size of a watch battery, but that had progressed to 3 or 4 spots about the size of half of a dime each, is finally going away. The wash also made my skin look faintly red in spots, something I had never noticed with any other wash. After I'd wash and dry off, my cheeks, skin to this side of my eyes, forehead, and neck would look flushed in spots. My face didn't feel irritated at all, but I'm so glad I switched, because the redness doesn't happen anymore. It didn't hurt, sting, or itch, and it even went away after about half an hour, but it was a bit unsightly right after I washed my face. \n\n\nI have no idea what was in that cleanser that made my skin behave so strangely, but I'm just issuing a heads-up to this sub. Don't be afraid to change something if it isn't working!\n\n\n4/10 cleanser, would not bang.",

I Shampoo/Condition my hair 2-3 times a week and dried with a T-shirt. Everything was going great until a week ago where I noticed my hair didn't feel the same anymore. I don't know how to describe it, but it almost feels rough and in need of conditioner? and my ends feel drier that normal. I am not sure whats happening my first thought was damage since I've been growing it out for almost a year without a trim or a cut. Now i'm starting to think that there is some sort of build up?

Rinsing your hair will have the shampoo run down your strands to clean them. You can also consider combing once your hair is saturated with conditioner and not rinsing all of it out.",

I don't know how to describe it, but it almost feels rough and in need of conditioner? and my ends feel drier that normal.

These have sodium cocoyl isethionate and sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, none of the other surfactants\n\nYour skin may react to ingredients differently from mine, however I've read that allergies to cocamidopropyl betaine and glucosides are quite common. So I suggest avoiding cleansers, shampoo, soaps that have those ingredients if you have eyelid issues. And yes, I tried petroleum jelly, different lotions, creams, moisturizers on my eyelids - none of that worked for me. I still had eyelid eczema. Only avoiding irritating surfactants has worked to let my skin heal\n\nHope this helps!",

I got rid of all products that I checked to contain Cocomidopropyl Betaine however the eczema/dermatitis has returned. \n\nI’ve now been prescribed all the steroid and Protopic treatments available however I am very reluctant to use them as they just mask the problem when I need to prevent it.\n\nBased on your post the soap I’m using did contain cococate, albeit sodium, not sucrose.

Checked washing detergent and conditioner which all seem to be fine.\n\nI’ve just ordered the Kitsch product and another brand which doesn’t contain any of the above ingredients you’ve listed so hopefully it’ll have a positive effect as there is nothing else I can pinpoint which is causing this.\n\nWhat’s frustrating is this appeared October 2022 from out of nowhere.

I would probably by a few to stock up and would definitely pay you for the cost of shipping. Please do let me know!\n\nAlso, for other DIYers, do you think I would be better off just buying the ingredients from scratch? I was thinking of mixing/heating the water, propylene glycol, and xylitol since these two are water soluble.

(sometimes, I have the feeling it will only end with the inevitable decline in testosterone that awaits us all, but I digress...)\n\nFor the last 2 months, I've been religiously doing **NOTHING** about my skin.  \n\\- Sleeping in the same dirty pillowcase (y, gross...)  \n\\- No moisturizer, toner, active, clay mask or whatever.  \n\\- Only using the same BODY cleanser to wash my face once a day and that's it.  \n\n\nThese are the ingredients in the body cleanser I used (**Douche Soin Corine de Farme KIDS 2en1 Corps & Cheveux**) : *Aqua, Lauryl Glucoside, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Glycerin, Parfum, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Citric Acid, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Coco-Glucoside, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Aloe Barbadensis Extract\\*, Viola Tricolor Extract\\*.*  \n\n\nDespite this one being marketed toward kids, it made my 28 yo skin tight, dry and flaky even on the first use. No surprise there, as it happens with every cleanser (even the most gentle ones) if I don't moisturize afterward.  \n\n\nRESULT : **not a single pimple in 2 months.** Skin would get dry and flaky, then oily... and that's it.  \nI'd gladly keep this weird new routine, but fine lines started to show more as a side effect of dryness. So I started to moisturize again 2 days ago (LRP Toleriane Sensitive Cream) and... pimples are back.  \n\n\n**TLDR ; What would be the more minimalist, simplest moisturizer to avoid breaking out ? I've read about Sebamed Gel and ordered it but it looks loaded to me (12 ingredients, Propylene glycol, Vit B5...)**  \n\n\nPure squalene oil, The ordinary HA + moisturizing, aquaphor are already out of the equation. Dimethicone / panthenol are also out.  \n\n\nThanks for reading and answering :)",

I’ve always wanted to try a local brand too so for fellow Singaporeans, maybe you guys can give it a try too and share your thoughts on it? \n\nThey’re available on Shopee and their website I think? Do check out their Instagram account if you are interested in them @5to5skin. \n\nMan I guess it’s time for me to quickly use up my current cleanser XD. What are your thoughts on their current products and maybe even their brand as a whole?",

I've not heard of the brand but looking at the price and ingredients, the price looks reasonable based on singapore standards, but really depends on your budget. \n\nThe cleanser based on the ingredients should cleanse relatively fine but can be slightly moisturizing. 1% mark should be at Propanediol. Personally i'd prefer the Glutamate to be the main surfactant but it's probably lower in percentage due to the cost. It's short of an amphoteric surfactant to bring down the potential harshness. \n\nThe moisturizer based on the ingredients should slightly rich due to the number of emollients in the formula. 1% mark should be at Stearic Acid. It should take some time to \"absorb\" due to the Jojoba slightly higher on the list.",

    "body": "Ursa Major Fantastic Face Wash\n\nIt’s not right...but it’s okay…\n\nThe Ursa Major brand is one that I came across a few times at Ulta but never really gave it a second look. But, after seeing their amazing photos on Instagram and looking into the brand story a bit more I was very intrigued. \n\nThis Vermont based skincare line is focused around a more outdoors/active kind of aesthetic...they really put an emphasis on “less is more” as well. Cleanse, tone, and hydrate are pretty much all you get from their offerings (which is not a bad thing at all).\n\nEvery beautiful mountain landscape pic from Ursa Major just called to my personal love of hiking, rock climbing, and simply being outside. So, without reading too much into the formulations I took the dive with their Fantastic Face Wash. \n\nBut now looking back...I wish I would have used my brain instead of my heart and researched more deeply (I guess not even that deep...turn the bottle around Anthony!).\n\nI did initially really enjoy using this product. The slightly watery cleansing gel/fluid applied to my skin very nicely. Even though this is a low pH cleanser...the later that I was able to create was quite dense and luxurious (especially with my whip maker). Using it with the Foreo Luna 3 also created a fairly dense foam.\n\nIn addition, the wonderful woodsy/bright aroma that the Fantastic Face Wash provides had me quickly falling in love. The scent immediately reminded me of the Sulwhasoo Snowise EX Cleansing Foam that I adored (now discontinued). But...it’s this forest wonderland-like scent that ended up being this product’s downfall (for me).\n\nRather than using synthetic fragrance...the Ursa Major Fantastic Face Wash uses a whole host of essential/fragrant oils. Black Spruce, Fir, Rosemary, Lime, Lemon, Grapefruit, Cedar, Vetiver, and Spearmint Oils all make an appearance here. \n\nDuring the first week/few uses I didn’t see any negative reactions to this product...and for me that was so good to see. “Okay Anthony...you aren’t seeing the typical sensitivity this time around. Maybe the warnings about essential oils you are seeing everywhere aren’t as big of a deal.” I thought to myself.  \n\nBut soon enough...I started to notice little flashes of redness, the occasional angry blemish, or odd warmth on my skin popping up. By week three, my skin started to make it apparent that something was wrong. \n\nI decided to work the Ursa Major Fantastic Face Wash out of my routine in favor of something that I have used in the past (the 23.5n Rice Soothing Cleansing Foam) and my skin seemed to quickly calm down and several blemishes began to recede. I have been using some awesome soothing products in my routine (reviews coming soon) and they just seemed to immediately feel more effective. It was like the rest of my routine had less to work against to provide a benefit.\n\nSo, I think three weeks is enough for me when it comes to this cleanser. I really, really wanted to like it and be one of the few that truly can put nearly anything on their face LOL! But...the trend has been that products using a large amount of essential oils (specifically citrus oils) have a tendency to anger my skin.\n\nA lavender oil here, or a small amount of rosemary there seem to be okay...but there really is a tipping point for me and the Ursa Major Fantastic Face Wash pushed things a bit too far. It will however make an excellent body wash!\n\nFull Ingredients List: Aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf juice\\*, aqua/water/eau, lauryl glucoside, coco-glucoside, sodium cocoyl glutamate, caprylyl/capryl glucoside, inulin, glyceryl laurate, sodium lauroamphoacetate, gluconolactone, sodium lauroyl glutamate, xylitylglucoside, anhydroxylitol, xylitol, oryza sativa (rice) extract\\*, camellia sinensis leaf extract\\*, saccharum officinarum (sugarcane) extract, citrus limon (lemon) fruit oil, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) fruit extract, vaccinium myrtillus fruit extract, acer saccharum (sugar maple) extract, picea mariana leaf oil\\*, pseudotsuga menziesii branch/leaf oil\\*, rosmarinus officinalis leaf water, lavandula angustifolia (lavender) flower water\\*, citrus paradisi peel oil, citrus aurantifolia peel oil, artemisia ludoviciana (owyhee) leaf oil, juniperus virginiana wood oil, tanacetum annuum flower oil, nardostachys jatamansi oil, vetiveria zizanoides root oil, mentha spicata leaf extract, sodium phytate, PCA glyceryl oleate, citric acid, calcium gluconate, leuconostoc ferment filtrate, sodium benzoate, soybean peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, limonene \\*Denotes organic\n\nWhere To Buy (Ulta $28.00 USD - 236 ML): [https://www.ulta.com/fantastic-face-wash?productId=pimprod2017694](https://www.ulta.com/fantastic-face-wash?productId=pimprod2017694) \n\nOne Thing To Note:\n\nThere are so, so, so many things that can potentially cause sensitivity/irritation. You may find this product to be absolutely amazing and if so...I’m jealous. My reasoning for pointing to the fragrance here is just trial and error/looking at what has caused a problem for my skin in the past. The common theme has been an overabundance of essential oils...especially lemon and orange oil. Let me know if you spot anything else here that stands out as a potential trigger. On the flip side, I don’t think I can recall my skin reacting to a product that uses a low amount of synthetic fragrance...but time will tell.",

        "body": "I had a very similar experience! I've been wanting to find more natural options & this one checked off so many boxes: All natural, made in the USA, cruelty free, simple approach/routine...I've also been trying to find a moisturizer with more \"oomph\" for the winter. Given that they're based in VT, I thought they might be a good choice. \n\nI, too, usually have to avoid any fragrance but convinced myself this would be OK because it's all natural.\n\nTried the Fortifying Face Balm & the Fantastic Face Wash & basically realized very quickly I should have gone with my head instead of heart.\n\nFace Balm:  Very little went a long way in terms of coverage. I didn't find it very moisturizing overall. But, I'm used to a heavier feeling moisturizing cream & this was a nice, light gel, so I decided to keep trying it thinking maybe I just needed to get used to the lighter weight. Also, I had been having some more redness than usual & Ursa Major said this would calm skin (among other things) & several ingredients were listed as soothing\n\nFace Wash: Loved the scent & the feel of the wash. It felt very cleansing & pleasant without being drying\n\nHOWEVER\n\nOne week of the Balm & my face was redder than before. I could see a line of where I had applied the balm (not near my eyes) & where I hadn't.\n\nOnly tried the Face Wash 3 times over the course of the week. I was worried about trying both at once & not being able to tell which one worked/didn't work but temptation got the better of me & I tried both those few times. My skin was *not* happy. Somehow even redder with the combo. It would fade after maybe half hour so, but it would overall by redder than normal.\n\nI gave up after a week & am now trying to figure out how to calm my skin back down.\n\nSuper bummed because I really wanted to like this product line. I think it could work for people with less sensitive skin.\n\nI do appreciate that they offer good sample/travel size options so at least I'm not feeling guilty over throwing out a ton of product.",

    "body": "i've been contemplating and over thinking this post for far too long now, i'm new to SCA and i have plenty of unrelated questions but i didn't want to spam the community, so for now i've decided to focus on this topic. i know i've procrastinated far too long but my birthday is next week and its my goal to start a skincare routine by then and to have the best skin i can have by then. here's my issues:\n\ni'm a 16 (soon to be 17) year old girl without a job and living in a low income family. i've been on SCA long enough to know that good skincare isnt cheap,  i don't have the money to but a $15 cleanser. idk why but i've been hesitant about starting a SCR probably because i'm fearful i'll do it wrong or the purging & potential for a product not agreeing with me will be too much to handle. i have a lot of new mini kits that i got for christmas and i thought i'd ask for your guy's reviews on these products (because i haven't seen anyone post on most of these yet) and your recommendations for me on creating a routine with what i currently have instead of going out and buying some the the HG products of this community. \n\nfirst, here's some history of my skin:\ni've known about skincare since i was about 11 from watching yt, before that i had did nothing but let water hit my face in the shower. at first i went to walmart and target trying any product that interested me and was cheap. i never stuck to a routine and to this day i've never consecutively washed my face for more than 5 days. the good news is in the last couple of years i've been educating myself more and watching out for certain ingredients and staying away from harmful products. i know i probably sound crazy to you all but i've never even used sunscreen. thankfully, it seems as if i'm crazy blessed because i've never had bad skin issues or a lot of acne, in the last 2 years though my skin has been the worst i've seen it, i don't really know how to rate it because sometimes i look at my skin and think \"ah its not that bad it's practically clear\" and other times, especially when i'm wearing makeup or in good lighting i'm thinking \"goodness, my skin is awful\". my main issue are blackheads on my nose, texture all over my face especially on my forehead (but pretty much unnoticeable unless you're up close or in good/dim lighting), whiteheads on my chin, and a few persistent zits on my cheeks and a few others that pop up here and there. \n\nnow to the products. i'm going to list all of the products i've accumulated and not used recently, most of them are sample sizes from gift sets. my request is for you to give me a mini review on any of the products you've tried and from the skin issues i've relayed for you to tell me what you'd suggest my routine to be with the products i have. if you need anymore information please let me know, and i apologize if i've one anything wrong or worded things weird i'm new to this site and new to skincare at this level.

Skincare actually doesn’t have to be expensive to be effective.

Here, you could alternate and  use The Ordinarys Salicylic Acid 2% Solution.\n\nMoisturizer \n\nSunscreen daily \n\nPm: \n\nCleanse with same gentle cleanser\n\nExfoliate 2-3 times per week - I’d recommend The Ordinary  Glycolic Acid 7% Toner \n\nSerums/Acids: Here you can use either the salicylic acid or Niacinamide again. Or you can use one of these in the morning and one at night but don’t mix them together. \n\nMoisturize",

The days I don't have a pimple going, I still have pretty bad pigmentation from picking(I know, could'nt help it).\n\n25 Male. Normal to Oily skin.\n\nI started an actual routine about a month ago:\n\nAM:\n\n* Cerave foaming facial cleanser (I sweat if the temp is over 60F, so my face can feel dirty)\n\n* Cetaphil Fragrance Free Moisturizing Lotion\n\n* Elta/MD UV Shield\n\nPM:\n\n* cerave foaming\n* stridex red box\n* cetaphil lotion\n\nNow, i've been using the cetaphil for 4+ years and I do not think that is the problem. I use [burts bees multicare toothpaste (no whitening or fluoride)](http://www.amazon.com/Burts-Bees-Natural-Toothpaste-Multicare/dp/B00394DVIC) and I use [naturoil shapoo](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P7VX24) every other day. I don't drink milk, but I do eat cheese (although the manufacturer claims it's hormone free)\n\nI just purchased Silk naturals AHA, BHA, and super serum. (hoping combo of BHA morning, AHA night will kill this shit).\n\nSorry for the potatos. Examples of my acne:\n\n[Starts like this. Skin colored, only visible when I smile big or push my tongue underneath](http://i.imgur.com/fALTx1s.jpg)\n\nThen, it eventually gets irritated for no reason (i'm sure there is a reason, bleh), and[ get's very red, big and starts forming a whitehead](http://i.imgur.com/RFSuOJ7.jpg)\n\nI should probably go see a derm, but I never thought it was that bad. It's just really annoying now, and happening more often.\n\nAny tips as to what I can do to kill these little spots underneath my skin?\n\nedit: toothpaste ingredients:\n\nGlycerin, Hydrated Silica, Xylitol, Calcium Sodium Phosphosilicate, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Titanium Dioxide, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (cranberry) Fruit Powder, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Powder, Stevia Rebaudiana Extract, Chondrus Crispus (carrageenan), Silica, Flavor*, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Maltodextrin *natural Flavor.",

    "body": "  \n\nIn the 2023 Trader Joe's 12 Days of Beauty sampler there's a small pouch with a white powder in it called Rice Polish Face Cleansing Powder and I like it. Normally I don't use physical exfoliants but sometimes I just want a little something other than my chemical ones, and this seems gentle, leaving my skin softer but not feeling abraided or damaged.\n\nGiven TJ's seems to sometimes create these duplicate products for expensive skincare I can only hope they'll release this in a big bottle someday. In the meantime I'd like to know what other products are out there that are similar. I haven't tried a rice powder exfolient before but I would like one with a similar feel. I think this might be a dupe for Dermalogica's microfoliant. Are there any other products that have a similar feel or might perform similarly?

I have sensitive skin and this hasn’t broken me out. It has made my lips peel though. I’m not a huge fan of lip balm. \n\nI’ve been using it for almost two months twice a day with nothing else except for Supergoop’s mineral matte tinted sunblock during the daytime. I’m still using the same bottle. I don’t have to use very much. Product is white and has a moisturizer consistency. Spreads easily. Very little smell unlike the very chemical-smells of TO retinol products. It’s easy to get too much product out of the little container. \n\nThis gives me similar results to The Ordinary’s granactive retinoid 2% emulsion that uses an encapsulated form of retinol so it is less irritating. I haven’t gotten any bad photosensitivity from it which is nice unlike retinol. \n\nThis gave me a lot of smoothness like the ordinary’s above mentioned product, but I still haven’t seen a big change in scars. I didn’t see a big change with my scars or discoloration/uneveness with other retinol products. I don’t have wrinkles so I can’t say anything about that. \n\nI wouldn’t say this is enough alone as a moisturizer if you have dry skin. My skin is normal to dry and I’m okay with putting on a second layer in areas that are drier. No greasiness. Absorbed by my skin quickly. I’ll probably have to go back to putting my Saturday skin glacial water cream and or my le prunier plum elixir on in the next few months though. \n\nIt’s really cheap and I like that it gives my skin a poreless look. I think I’ll keep buying it until something nicer comes along without EOs and other irritants.",

Any other ingredients are (mostly) to make a good story without having too much of an impact on how it actually works. \n\nGlycerin and butylene glycol are humectants that will help hold moisture in the mid-layers of the skin. \n\nSodium silicate, sodium magnesium fluorosilicate, and magnesium aluminium silicate are typically added as texturizers and can help create a powdery sensation upon drying.\n\nDipeptide-2 and palmitoyl tetrapeptide-7 are supposedly the actives that should contribute to de-puffing from the eyes. There's not a lot of support for this, and so the mechanism is not known. \n\nDipeptide-2 consists of the dipeptide tyrosine-valine (NH3-VY-COOH) and palmitoyl tetrapeptide-7 is a palmityl group connected to the amino end of the tetrapeptide glycine-arginine (CH3-(CH2)14-CO-NH-GQHR-COOH).\n\nThe rest isn't doing too much as far as being super effective.

        "body": "I'm not gonna explain every ingredient because I honestly have a lot of homework to be doing and reddit won't give me the room for it all in one comment, but I'll give you the highlights and a general conclusion.\n\n**Shampoo:** \n\n- Has mid-strength anionic surfactants (e.g. sodium cocoyl alaninate, disodium and sodium cocyl glutamate), so a good sulfate-free alternative but there are even gentler things out there. The up side is these surfactants also function as conditioners.\n\n- The main surfactant sodium bis-hydroxyethylglycinate coco-glucosides crosspolymer is a non-ionic which is the gentlest kind of surfactant. It's a cleansing, foaming, thickening, as well as conditioning agent. Also biodegradable, which is helpful when we think about how much of all these products get washed down our drains.\n\n- Glycerin is a common humectant that pulls water into the hair and is thus very beneficial in a shampoo where you want the shower water to replenish your moisture content.\n\n- Parfum (fragrance): The fact that this is so high up on the ingredients list gives me a little worry. Fragrance can be almost anything, and most fragrance ingredients contain phthalate esters which have been linked to many health ailments. The presence of this ingredient in the first third of the list leads me to believe that it is likely in a concentration near or above harmful when used in long exposures (but almost all plastics we have around us also emit harmful levels of these chemicals into the air so it's not like the absence of this shampoo will make everything all better, nor are you guaranteed to get diabetes or breast cancer just from being exposed like this. It just raises the risk). \n\n- Arginine: an amino acid with significant protective abilities. When used in the presence of bleach, [reduces protein depletion](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15645092). Also improves hair growth by [stimulating blood flow to the follicles](http://www.aminoacid-studies.com/areas-of-use/hair.html?PHPSESSID=jof4d69o6cc5gonk508kplsd04).\n\n- The others are mainly conditioning agents to coat the hair strand and improve it's softness, shine, and manageability or are emulsifiers to hold the whole mixture together. \n\n- **Conclusion: Pretty good shampoo. Not the best thing you could ever find, but this will be better for most people than sulfate shampoos. For your SD though, it may still be too harsh so pay close attention to see if you get itchiness, redness, and flakes when using this shampoo, especially because most people with SD need to wash every day and that means more exposure to it.**\n\n**Conditioner:**\n\n- Cetyl alcohol: a common fatty alcohol used in hair products. It coats the hair to protect it from protein damage and loss as well as seal in moisture, both of which this compound is pretty good at. May clog follicles and weigh down fine hair, however, so try not to use this much on your scalp. \n\n- Avocado oil: Another conditioner that coats. Rather thick, so this plus the cetyl alcohol may mean this conditioner is too heavy for fine hair, but avocado oil also has some vitamins and amino acids to protect from protein loss. Not penetrative however, so not a ton of this benefit. \n\n- See above for fragrance, arginine, protein.\n\n- Citric and ascorbic acid are lower pH than your hair, so they will tighten up the hair shaft and help make it shinier. [Some evidence](http://www.ergo-log.com/vitchair.html) also suggests that exposure to ascorbic acid can help protect hair follicles from the hair loss effect of androgens. \n\n- Nearly all of the other ingredients are various conditioners. \n\n- **Conclusion: I don't think this is the best conditioner for you. It might be too heavy on your thin hair, and will probably irritate your SD. You could try pairing it with a clarifying shampoo though and see if that makes it more bearable.**\n\n**Serum:**\n\n- cyclomethicone and cyclopentasiloxane: silicones, but the gentlest class of silicones. Most penetrative to water molecules and easiest to evaporate and remove in the shower. \n\n- [C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/700898/C12-15_ALKYL_BENZOATE/): A fairly long-chain alcohol and thus conditioner. Suspected to be an environmental toxin. Soluble, won't build up. \n\n- Silk amino acids are great at strengthening the hair and partially rebuilding damage. \n\n- Shea butter is a heavy but effective emollient. \n\n- Coconut milk and oil are some of the best conditioners out there and also penetrate to deliver moisture and reparation. \n\n- Egg whites and acetate have some reconstructive power, but probably aren't doing much this far down the list. \n\n**Conclusion: sounds pretty good, but will probably work best if you apply it to damp hair rather than dry so that it don't lock out moisture and doesn't feel greasy.**",

    "body": "Hi curlies, I need some help troubleshooting. I feel like I have zero way to predict whether my scalp will like a shampoo or not; some with supposedly \"harsher\" ingredients work great for me and others that are \"gentler\" make me super dry and itchy! I have to stick to low-poo because my low-porosity, medium-thickness 2C hair gets weighed down really easily. I desperately want to experiment with new shampoos but I have no way of narrowing down which ones might work for me!!\n\nHere are some of the products I've tried, how my scalp liked them, and their ingredients.\n\nTHE BODY SHOP GINGER SHAMPOO - Somehow? this is the nicest of all the shampoos I've ever tried on my scalp?? I legitimately don't understand why, it's one of the only things that leaves my scalp feeling calm. I'd like to be able to use something else though because I know all the sulfates are probably really harsh on my curls.\n\nIngredients: Aqua/Water/Eau, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Piroctone Olamine, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Sodium Benzoate, Polysorbate 20, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Gluconate, Dimethicone Propyl PGBetaine, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium Salicylate, Salix Alba Bark Extract/Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Parfum/Fragrance, Linalool, Limonene, Betula Alba Bark Extract, Zingiber Officinale Root Oil/Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Citronellol, Citral, Isopropyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, sr-Spider Polypeptide-1, 1,2- Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n-\n\nPANTENE NUTRIENT BLENDS COMPLETE CURL CARE SHAMPOO - Made me unbearably itchy, red and flaky. The worst of the bunch.\n\nIngredients: Water, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Fragrance, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Polyquaternium-10, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Salicylate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Acrylates Copolymer, Panthenol, Panthenyl Ethyl Ether, Histidine, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil\n\n-\n\nBRIOGEO SCALP REVIVAL MICRO-EXFOLIATING SHAMPOO - This one feels pretty good, but sometimes it leaves my hair feeling too \"squeaky clean\" and I'm not sure if I should be exfoliating my scalp every wash day. \n\nIngredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate*, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil*, Glyceryl Stearate*, Glycerin*, Microcrystalline Cellulose*, Cocamidopropyl Betaine*, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate*, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate*, Hydrogenated Castor Oil*, Lithium Magnesium Sodium Silicate, Panthenol, Xylitylglucoside*, Charcoal Powder*, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil*, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil*, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil*, Mentha Viridis (Spearmint) Leaf Oil*, Anhydroxylitol*, Bisabolol, Menthyl Lactate*, Xylitol*, Polyquaternium-7, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Fragrance (Parfum), Citric Acid*, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n-\n\nBRIOGEO BLOSSOM & BLOOM VOLUMIZING SHAMPOO (which I guess was recently discontinued?) - Feels pretty good as well, some itchiness.\n\nIngredients: Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate*, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine*, Lauramidopropyl Betaine*, Glycerin*, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate*, Polysorbate 80*, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate*, Soyamidopropyldimethylamine Oxide*, Maltodextrin*, Biotin, Panthenol, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate*, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Citrus Tangerina (Tangerine) Peel Oil, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Mentha Viridis (Spearmint) Leaf Oil, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil, Sodium C14-18 Olefin Sulfonate*, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate*, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate*, Polyquaternium-7, Polyquaternium-71, Fragrance, Citric Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid\n\n-\n\nBRIOGEO CURL CHARISMA SHAMPOO - Moderate itchiness on my scalp and also just way too heavy for my hair.\n\nIngredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Lauramidopropyl Betaine*, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate*, Glycerin*, Glycol Distearate*, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine*, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter*, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract*, Rice Amino Acids*, Lactobacillus/Tomato Fruit Ferment Extract*, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil*, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil*, Acanthus Mollis Leaf Extract*, Tocopheryl Acetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice*, Keratin Amino Acids*, Coconut Acid*, Hydrolyzed Quinoa*, Sodium Hyaluronate*, Acyl Coenzyme A Desaturase*, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil*, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil*, Polyquaternium-71, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate*, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Isethionate, Polyquaternium-7, Anhydroxylitol*, Xylitylglucoside*, Xylitol*, Fragrance (Parfum), Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol",

I’m happy to keep using that as my shampoo but I’ve been trying to work out what the ingredient that seems to make my scalp angry is so I can avoid it in other products, and I’m starting to think it could be polyquaternium 10 (or polyquaternium in general). The body shop shampoo doesn’t have it in, but I’ve tried the only curls cleanser & umberto giannini scalp restore and got really itchy both times - and they both have polyquaternium 10 in! It could just be complete coincidence though obviously! I’ve also found I get slightly itchy with boots extra firm mousse which has polyquaternium 16. \n\nI’ve also found that my hair feels instantly dry (as in not wet, not as in straw like) to the touch soon as the water isn’t on it when I’m washing it as if there is a film on it and that doesn’t happen with the body shop shampoo either. \n\nI could be completely off the mark here but I’ve never seen anyone else have the same issue!",

    "body": "# Recommended Product Ingredients\n\n​I always have clients review their hair care routine with me during appointments, which helps me recommend better products for their needs. The most common issue people share is experiencing a loss of effectiveness in their products over time. This results from a need to balance cleaning your hair with moisturizing it. Below I've provided a guide to help balance your hair care routine based on the recommendations I usually give my clients, complete with a list of the most effective ingredients for each category. I purposely left non-detergents (soaps) off of the list because they use oils to remove contaminants, which I've found does not clean hair as well.  (This is the full blog but if you want to screenshot the ingredient lists the post is a bit better organized on my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-recommended-product-ingredients.html))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Surfactant Cleanser **Definition:** Surfactant cleansers are detergents or cleaning agents. They work by surrounding and lifting residue off of the hair strand so water can rinse it away. On a product's ingredient list you generally see them listed towards the top. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Detoxes, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used by all hair types. Helpful for oily hair. See [How Often Should I Shampoo?](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html) ​for frequency.\\*\\*Ingredients:\\*\\*​\n\n* Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n* Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n* Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n* Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n* Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n* Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n* Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n* Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate \n* Ammonium lauryl sulfate ​\n* Ammonium laureth sulfate\n* Sodium polystyrene sulfonate\n* Cocamidopropyl betaine\n* Coco betaine\n* Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine\n* Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n* Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n* Sodium lauroamphoacetate\n* Sodium sulfosuccinate\n* Cocamidopropyl betaine\n* Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n* Sodium lauryl sulfate \\*\n\n*\\* Sodium lauryl sulfate is not recommended for daily use.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Non Surfactant Cleanser **Definition:** This cleaning agent does not completely lift oil and grease off of the hair strand, meaning it does not fully remove them. Doing so lightly cleanses your hair while also retaining moisture (i.e. conditioning it). It is not recommended for use with silicones, mineral oil or petroleum products because these ingredients deposit a [residue](https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/493588) under the hair's cuticle that require a surfactant cleanser to remove. I usually suggest using a clarifying shampoo once a month with this type of cleanser. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Detoxes, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair. See [How Often Should I Shampoo?](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html) ​for frequency.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil\n* Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil\n* Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil\n* Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil\n* Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Detox **Definition:** While similar to the Cleanser category, the Detox category is stronger. These cleansing agents remove product build up and help with demineralization of the hair. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used once a month by all hair types. Helpful for oily hair.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Disodium EDTA (Ethylamine Diamine Tetraacetic Acid)\n* Pentasoidum Pentetate\n* Sodium phytate\n* Phytic acid\n* Citric acid (needs large enough quantity to be effective)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Humectants **Definition:** T​his ingredient helps retain moisture from water by attracting it to the hair strand in humid climate conditions. However, in dry weather humectants have the opposite effect and will transfer moisture from your hair into the atmosphere. This can leave your hair dehydrated, which may not be what you want depending on its current state.*Tip: Humectants are complementary to silicones and plant oils.* **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** Can be used daily by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair. Using a detox once a month is recommended with this category.\\*\\*Ingredients:\\*\\**Hydrolyzed Proteins*\n\n* Hydrolyzed Elastin, silk, keratin, collagen \n* Peptides (wheat, oat, soy...)\n* Amino acids (wheat, oat, soy) or glycine, alanine, proline, etc.\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (source of protein, i.e. keratin, silk, rice, soy)\n* Cocoyl hydrolyzed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (source of protein)\n* Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (source of protein)\n* Hydrolyzed oat flour\n\n*For Use In Humid Weather​*\n\n* Vegetable glycerin\n* ​Sorbitol\n\n*Plant Gels*\n\n* Panthenol\n* Flax Seed Gel\n* Okra Gel\n* Aloe Vera\n* Hydroxyethylcellulose\n* Pectin\n* Xanthan Gum\n* Guar Gum\n* Marshmallow Root\n* Slippery Elm​\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Soluble Silicones **Definition:** This ingredient coats the hair shaft to lock in moisture, reduce frizz, add slip, and give hair the coveted soft and silky feel. Soluble silicones can be washed out with non surfactant cleansers. **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** Can be used daily by all hair types. Using a detox once a month is recommended with this category. \n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Any silicone with PEG as a prefix\n* Bis-peg/ppg-16/16 peg/ppg-16/16 (This is an emulsifier - not for shine or lubrication)\n* Cyclomethicone\n* Dimethicone copolyol\n* DEA PG-Propyl PEG/PPG-18/21 Dimethicone\n* Dimethicone PEG-8 Phosphate\n* Dimethicone-PG Diethylmonium Chloride\n* Hydrolyzed Silk PG-Propyl Methylsilanediol Crosspolymer\n* Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n* Hydrolyzed Wheat protein/hydroxypropyl polysiloxane and cystine/silicone co-polymers\n* Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Silanetriol\n* Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol\n* Lauryl methicone copolyol\n* PEG-40/PPG-8 Methylaminopropyl/Hydropropyl Dimethicone Copolymer\n* PEG/PPG-14/4 Dimethicone\n* PEG/PPG-20/15 Dimethicone\n* PEG-12 Dimethicone\n* PEG/PPG-20/15 Dimethicone\n* PPG-8 Methylaminopropyl, Hydroxypropyl Dimethicone Copolymer\n* PEG-7 Amodimethicone\n* PEG-8 Disteramonium Chloride PG-Dimethicone\n* PEG-33 (and) PEG-8 Dimethicone (and) PEG-14\n* Silanetriol\n* Silicone Quaternium-8\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Plant Oils **Definition:** This ingredient is used to retain moisture, condition hair, protect from damage and minimize dryness. **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** Can be used daily by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair.  **Ingredients:**\n\n* Coconut (Cocos Nucifera) Oil \n* Sunflower (Helianthus Annuus) Seed Oil\n* Olive (Olea Europaea) Oil\n* Argan (Argania Spinosa) Oil\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Preservatives **Definition:** Additives that prevent spoilage. Most consumer products contain preservatives because without them any water-based solution will eventually grow mold or bacteria. **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** A routine is not applicable for this category since it's included in most products, but pay attention to whether your products cause scalp irritation. That could be a sign to switch to, or alternate with, preservative free options.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Sodium Benzoate\n* Potassium Sorbate \n* Benzoic acid\n* Dehydroacetic acid\n\n*​Sources:* [*Cationic Compounds in Cosmetics*](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/search?q=surfactants)*, Science-y Hair Blog*[*Detergents Which Remove: Silicone*](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2016/05/detergents-which-remove-silicones.html)*, Science-y Hair Blog​*[*Essentials of Hair Care Often Neglected: Hair Cleansing*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3002407/)*, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)*[*Glycerin and Humidity*](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2015/02/glycerin-and-humidity.html)*, Science-y Hair Blog*[*Film Forming Humectants - What They Are And Why You Need Them*](http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2014/07/film-forming-humectants-what-they-are.html)*, Science-y Hair Blog*",

There are a lot of products on the market that contain a lot of chemicals, many of which have by now become familiar sights in ingredients lists. There are an awful lot of them derived from coconut and palm exclusively, but there are also a lot of them that can be derived from other sources. There isn't any regulation currently in place (at least in the United States, that I am aware of) that requires manufacturers to disclose the source of their chemicals, which can lead to a lot of companies falsely claiming that their products are coconut and/or palm free, when they are just the opposite. Some of the chemicals you will see are things like Vitamin A-palmitate. This one in particular can be tricky as it can be found naturally in beef fat, or it can be derived from coconut or palm plants. You see it a lot in milk, particularly milk that is 2% or less milk fat, which would make you think that it is derived from beef fat, but when you start digging, you find out that it is far more readily available (and therefore cheaper for dairies to buy in the quantities they use) to acquire a palm derived version. Now, devil's advocate here, it may be simply that the dairies do not actually know that they are adding a palm derived product into their milk, as they are likely going through a bulk supplier.\n\nI have also come to realize that there are a lot of companies who advertise things as being coconut and/or palm free and are completely unaware that the chemicals they use come from those sources.

    "body": "Hello,\n\nI've been following a simple routine consistently for about a month, just cleanser and toner w/salicylic acid, added a moisturiser for about a week, then switched that and added a spot-on acne gel. Just wondering if some products of the ones I have are better than others, if some might be a bad idea and need switching, and what to be looking to add in. Maybe some from The Ordinary? I understand I need to go slowly, so if you tell me 'wait a few weeks, then add [product]', I can do that. I am, Ok, tempted to try some kind of drastic acid peel-all-the-skin-dramatically-off treatment in the vague hope of getting to start with a cleaner slate, but I guess that's probably not wise?\n\nIf there's anything I should do with spacing/timing and order to use things in, please suggest that too, I'm just layering products. Should I still be using everything first if I'm going to put make-up on in the morning too?\n\nAge: 33\n\nSkin type: Combination I think, but so oily on face it might as well just be oily\n\nConcerns: Acne, probs. hormonal, suspect seb derm which may be related issue (have salicylic acid shampoo). Noticeable sebaceous filaments. Visible oiliness. Some redness. One very fine line, may be vertical frown line, may be a scar.\n\nMake-up: Only recently got any again, have rarely used it.\n\nSuitability requirements: Vegan\n\nOther notes: I quit using products before as a teen because it wasn't working. The only thing that has ever made a significant ongoing difference, as a happy and unexpected side-effect, was switching to a dairy-free diet. I really don't like that one fine line due to the placement. I get that 'pores are normal', but the visibility makes me want to do something drastic involving strong acid. I have nerve damage so anything I use is prone to feel tingly/burny, making it hard to use that as a gauge, but my skin doesn't actually seem very sensitive in terms of real reactions to products. Not sure it absorbs products well. I'm not using SPF at present because I'm most often housebound currently, but feel free to advise on how to add this in for times that's not the case.\n\nCurrent products:\n\n**Cleansers**\n\nPrevise Dermapothecary Purify Botanic Wash\n\nI've liked this. Noticeable improvement just from using it and the toner dabbed on the worst problem areas, it seems to have fixed the flaky itchy skin under my eyebrows, skin is softer. Possibly pretty much anything would've had the same result, admittedly. The instructions don't actually say to wash it off with water, so, eh...?\nDid not seem to help with removing new mascara, as it dawned on me that I was not actually sure *how* to remove mascara.\n\nIngredients: Water, Algae Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Xantham Gum, Pentylene Glycol, Helianthus Anthus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Quillaja Saponaria Bark Extract, Organic Cedrus Atlantica (Cedarwood) Oil, Organic Citrus Aurantium Dulcis Peel Oil, Diglycerin, Polyglycerol-2 Laurate, Citric Acid, Silver Citrate\n\nSukin Clearing Facial Wash\n\nNot yet used.\n\nIngredients: Water (Aqua), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Cydonia Oblonga Leaf Extract (Quince), Punica Granatum Fruit Extract (Pomegranate), Epilobium Angustifolium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (Willowherb), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract (Green Tea/White Tea), Moringa Oleifera Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Glycerin, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Eucalyptus Citriodora Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Limonene, Linalool\n\n**Toner/Salicylic Acid**\n\nSukin Pore Perfecting Toner\n\nSmells satisfyingly medicinal, but results have varied from 'I'm almost sure this is helping' to 'I'm not sure this is doing a darn thing', which is possibly just usual breakout fluctuation.\n\nIngedients: Water(Aqua), Glycerin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cydonia Oblonga Leaf Extract(Quince), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract(Green Tea/White Tea), Zingiber Officinale(Ginger)Root Extract, Mentha Piperita(Peppermint)Leaf Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Eucalyptus Citriodora Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia(Lavender)Oil, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Salicylic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-6 Oleate, Sodium Surfactin, Sorbic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Limonene, Linalool\n\nSukin Spot-Banishing Gel\n\nI was hoping this would have the same kind of near-instant spot drying-out effect I remembered from the gels I'd used as a teen, but while it might be a little better, eh, not really, so far. Think might be a little drying.\n\nIngredients: Water (Aqua), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Epilobium Angustifolium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (Willowherb), Cydonia Oblonga Leaf Extract (Quince), Salicylic Acid, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Moringa Oleifera Leaf Extract, Zingiber Officinal (Ginger) Root Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract (Chamomile), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract (Green Tea/White Tea), Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Eucalyptus Citriodora Oil, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Sorbic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Limonene, Linalool\n\n**Moisturiser**\n\nDr Organic Rose Otto Day Cream\n\nWas a little burny.

        "body": "It definitely sounds like you’ve been taking the right approach so well done for being patient (it took me YEARS of throwing new harsh stuff at my face every other week to realise a slow and simple routine worked better for me!)\n\nI’m not super knowledgable and unfortunately I have zero experience of the brands you’ve mentioned, but one thing I’ve noticed from the ingredients is that the Sukin products have a lot of botanical oils and in general the products all have a lot of ingredients. Have you tried simpler “dermatology” brands like Avene, La Roche Posay, Cerave, Cetaphil or at a cheaper high street level Simple? It may be worth reading up about some of these, they’re a staple on subs like this and obviously not everything works for every person but a lot of people see results when using their targeted but quite sensitively formulated products. For example the Sukin moisturiser says it’s oil free, which sounds great if you have oily skin, but there are a lot of plant extracts which can be quite reactive on some skin so could be less than ideal. Also I know it sounds strange but being oily is often to do with being dehydrated and your skin overcompensating, so you don’t always have to shy away from rich moisturising products - I didn’t use moisturiser at all for years because I thought it would make oily ness worse, but the moment I started to use a plain moisturiser my skin (including spots) was so much happier!\n\nI am waffling now, basically I don’t have very wise or specific words for you but you are definitely taking the right approach but maybe products from different brands or with simpler formulas might help? It’s such a pain figuring this stuff out, I wish you luck!",

    "body": "Long story short I am new to actually caring for my skin and am needing some help. I used to cleanse and sometimes moisturize only. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am allergic to everything under the sun from plants, animals, mold, dust, foods, and chemicals. I've had pretty extensive allergy testing done at the doctor. Tested \"positive\" for 60 of 60 \"natural\" allergens (I reacted to all plants, pollen, animals, mold). I reacted to the tape done for the chemical test, so that has to be redone. I have not yet done the food allergy test. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs far as chemicals go, I know for sure I am allergic to Stearyl Alcohol. I have also decided to try to avoid Cetyl Alcohol and thus Cetearyl Alcohol (Cetyl and Stearyl alcohols combined). I also prefer fragrance free or very low fragrance/odor (due to other allergies and migraine triggers)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have combonation skin, leaning towards dry. I get very flaky skin easily (it will peel off in patches or sheets). I also have relatively sensitive skin, turning red very quickly and also breaking out into hives, rashes, and contact dermatitis. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBelow is my current skin care routine with products I use with a link to the product and the ingredient list. (the links are just generic to sephora mostly because that is where i bought these products)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I am wanting help with a few things\n\n1. are all of the products i have listed safe from the above alcohols?\n2. Is this the right order?\n3. do I need to add or subtract anything from my routine?\n4. any other suggestions or advice?\n5. several product replacements i need\n   1. eye cream\n   2. exfoliate \n   3. lotion!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will update later with my makeup list, but one step at a time.

Sadly, last week my dermatologist diagnosed me seborrheic dermatitis  (I was suspecting that I was troubling with fungal acne since months). She prescribed me Elidel + Noviderm Boreade Cleansing Cream. I've been using the cleanser, which is supposed to be gentle, but after using it my face becomes red, with \"fine lines\" (like if it were dehydrated maybe), a bit tight and veeeery flaky (the only cleanser that has never produced flakes in my skin is the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser). Also my forehead gets irritated. After one/two hours those symptoms disappear, but I don't know if that's a good sign. \n\nAlso, according to [sezia.co](https://sezia.co) the ingredient list has some feeding ingredients for Malassezia, so rn I'm a bit confused. The ingredient list:\n\nAqua (Water), Cetearyl Alcohol, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Zea Mays (Corn) Starch, Coco-Glucoside, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydroxypropyl Guar, Glycerin, **Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, Capryloyl Glycine, Glyceryl Caprylate, Phospholipids, Parfum (Fragrance), **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Bisabolol, **Butyl Avocadate**, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Gluconate, Citric Acid, Glycolipids, Potassium Sorbate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterols, Sodium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Chenopodium Quinoa Seed, Maltodextrin, Propyl Gallate\n\nHave you ever tried this before? Should I keep using this cleanser until my skin gets used to it?  Or should I ask my dermatologist for a change? Sorry for so much questions but this is a new world for me and now I feel a bit frustrated :(\n\nThank u!",

I have combination skin:\n\ncheeks: dry to normal\n\nforehead: larger pores and tends to become a bit red above eyebrows\n\nnose: my main problem, larger pores and clogged, a bit red\n\nleft/right side of nose: large pores, a bit red\n\nchin: normal\n\nSo basically what I did when choosing my products was to only pick ones which are meant to be for combination or sensitive skin. I just wanna take care of my skin to give it a healthy look but I feel like my products make things only worse, although I don't have huge skin problems. I don't have any pimples but I don't like my big pores and I just want my skin to look more even and want it to stay healthy.\nProblems that occured two days after doing my routine: \n\n1. A strange taste in my mouth, a bit bitter, could possibly be alcohol. The taste doesn't fade\n\n2. My forehead and nose look shiny, that's not what I expected from products that are meant to be for combination skin, the forehead shouldn't be shiny right?????? Or should healthy skin be shiney and a bit greasy? \n\n3. Even the inside of my nose is a bit irritated\n\nMy products: \nCleanser/Toner: I am using a cleanser and a toner from a brand called \"Lavera\".

    "body": "I started to suffering from acne when I was around 14yo, there were hard times, but this was in the past. Now I still can't achieve a fully clean face. I'm testing 0.1% gel Differin now from two months, and I'm not sure if this even affects my acne. My acne just disappears in one place and materialize in another. It feels like lost fight, like tilting at windmills. Maybe I'm doing something wrong?\n\nI have habits of not touching my face, and my daily routine is: morning - face wash, cream if my face is dry or cream with sunscreen if going outside. At evening I face wash, wait around half an hour and use medicine, then after next half, I use cream if my face is dry. I try not to squeeze, and if it happens, I disinfect it. I'm eating very healthy; now paleo; mainly veggies and meat with little sweets, going vegan don't make any difference to my skin. I take supplements: zinc, vit d6, and creatine. \n\nI used: \n\n* adapalene - (now) little or not effective\n\n* azelaic acid gel - little or not effective \n\n* clindamycin gel - it was effective at the beginning then I got used to it(?) and stopped working\n\n* benzoyl peroxide cream - as above\n\n* zinc oxide cream - little or not effective\n\n* tetracycline pills - at my worst moment in my acne story, helped me a bit but taking antibiotic daily isn't good option\n\nIn a few months i tried few face cleaners:\n\n* la roche posay effaclar purifing foaming gel cleanser\n\n> Water • Sodium Laureth Sulfate • PEG-8 • Coco-Betaine • Hexylene Glycol • Sodium Chloride • PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate • Zinc PCA • Sodium Hydroxide • Citric Acid • Sodium Benzoate • Phenoxyethanol • Caprylyl Glycol • Parfum/Fragrance. \n\n* ziaja senstive skin creamy wash gel for face & body\n> Aqua (Water), Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Coco-Sulfate, Glycerin, Coco Glucoside, Panthenol, Propylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cocamide DEA, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, DMDM Hydantoin, Sodium Benzoate, Lactic Acid\n\n\n* himalaya herbals gentle exfoliating daily face wash\n> Aqua, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate & Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Polyethylene, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus MedicaLimonum Peel Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Parfum, Phenoxyethanol, Prunus Armeniaca Seed Powder, Lens Culinaris Fruit Extract.

However, after burning my face with benzol peroxide, I'm talking red and extremely puffy for 3 days, I realized that all of these acids and what not are just terrible. I was looking on my moms Pinterest acct and YouTube and found tons of healthy ways to try getting rid of acne. Try minimizing to a very simple gentle face wash like cetaphil, something for non acne. Watch videos about apple cider vinegar for acne, it can possibly be a miracle worker. Also read about aloe Vera, also a miracle worker. A face mask I recommend is using an egg with cinnamon, it burns but is very effective if you face doesn't react bad to cinnamon. Just some tips :)",

I've never experienced anything like this. I've washed my hair four times with regular shampoo and twice with dish soap and sprayed an ethanol and isopropyl alcohol mixture on it, with minimal effect. That being said I used very little of the ethanol and isopropyl alcohol and of the dish soap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm mainly looking for suggestions on what could dissolve the ingredients in the hair mask or in other ways remove them from my hair.\n\nI'm sorry if this is a little off topic to this subreddit, but I figured it might be related to 'cosmetic chemistry' in some ways.\n\nI might also ask a hair dresser again.",

We don’t know what products you normally use, what your hair type is, if you’ve done any chemical treatments to your hair, etc. so find a professional in this field.\n\nI can say though, the hair mask has a lot of hydrating elements but has silicones which create a film over your hair. They’re relatively safe, but usually bad for people with textured hair as it can build up and make the hair shaft weaker over time since less moisture gets in. \n\nTry using a shampoo with a sulfate surfactant. If your shampoos do have sulfates, then find a good clarifying shampoo. That’s my advice. Absolute last straw as it could damage your hair, acetone is a good solvent, you could use it extremely carefully.",

        "body": "Just some insight - Tea tree oil is great at ridding the skin of bacteria and such, if you have acne that's the best natural choice. Chamomile and lavender are anti-inflammatory - reduce swelling and redness. The tea tree oil soap you picked is good, but honestly I'd take a look at Thursday Plantation's tea tree oil soap or Desert essence's tea tree therapy soap (both in bar form). (see below as to why)\n\nI actually used Desert essence's thoroughly clean facewash for a bit and didn't really help my skin. The ingredients you listed aren't up to date if I remember correctly - the bottle I had had lots more variety in the way of oil extracts. IMO this takes away from the quality - keep it simple and search for products with higher Tea tree oil concentration - i.e. higher up on the ingredients list. For this reason I'm not a fan of the tea tree oil soap you posted from trader joes.",

But i had no time to go to the doctor again.  I also had no idea that ferritin 28 is low back then, cause they didn't marked it with black, and i also used to have super low ferritin in past so i thought 28 is great. From the start of 2022 i am using the same shampoos. 1st hand with a 92% natural ingredient shampoo that is it for hairloss and 2nd hand with a pharmaceutical dandruft shampoo. After that i was keep loosing a lot of hair, even if i started taking folate. But i didn't had a blood panel done. (I have checked thyroid though A LOT of times in my life and never had an issue). I didn't managed to grow my hair really thick after that, some times i was loosing a lot of hair, some others not so much. \n\nI got covid and had 40 fever for 3 days and after exactly 2 months, April of 2023, a CRAZY hairloss started. I was in shock. I also had 34 ferritin though. Hairloss stopped or stopped being so severe in Late August. And gradually my hairloss came to normal. Normal for me is loosing 2-3 hairs after the wash day, and as i go further to the next washing day i loose more hair but nothing serious. After that i managed to make my hair a lot thicker ! Sure though the were 2 areas were they were still not thick. But in general i was happy, cause they looked good. i just wanted to grow them longer.\n\nAnd OUT OF NOWHERE in July i started loosing A LOT of hair.  I checked ferritin and it was 49. Pretty good and better than before. It could be higher but i guess its not so low to cause hairloss. 1 year before doctor had told me that 34 it COULD possible cause hairloss, and in order to exclude it, it should be higher. So 49 cannot be that bad.\n\nI know my body, and i know that in the first days after the washing day i am just loosing 2-3 hair per day, and as i go closer to washing day (day 7) in the last 2 days i see some more hair shedding but nothing crazy. All summer though  was loosing A LOT OF HAIR every day, it was pretty shocking. Even in the first day after washing.  Even some hours after washing. I was shedding a lot.\n\nI run out of the 92% natural shampoo i use on the 1st hand. So i putted some water on it to use it and i saw LESS hairloss but still not normal it was just better. The next week i had run out of it so i only used the other shampoo i have in 2-3 hands cause it does not foam. And my hairloss came back to NORMAL. Exactly after the wash i didn't used it !\n\nI am pretty sure its from the shampoo, it was just a pitty to loose ALL MY PROGRESS and now be on point zero and trying to grow back my hair again. I just wonder how i didn't had hairloss when i was using it on winter and now it caused me hairloss? All this 2,5 years i was using it i never managed to grow my hair really thick and i didn't checked my ferritin regurarly, so i don't know if shampoo also was an issue.

I have very fine hair, just below my ears long. Curl type is 2a or 2b. It's bleached. Gets greasy fast (I use Lush dry shampoo atm - waiting for my Batiste order to arrive).\nNow, I love the Balea conditioner for co-washing, as it leaves my hair nice, soft, shinny and gets rid of the grease, but it irritates my scalp. If some of it accidentally goes on my forehead, I can see a red trail of where it's been. So, I'd like to buy something else. The problem is, that I can't find any products that are recommended here in my country. I live in Slovenia. My budget is also somewhat limited (as I have acne problems and already spend tons on skincare :P ). Are there any Europeans here with some recommendations?\n\nI would also love to ask about S2C.. do you think it would work for very fine oily hair? My curls are usually more like waves, because I comb my hair after washing, and I would love to take care of them properly and show them off.\n\nHope this post isn't too confusing. Thanks for reading, and any kind of help is appreciated.",

I wonder if I need to use a different cleanser in the morning or evening to target those problem areas and use what I'm currently using to continue the quality of skin I'm experiencing now. Also there is a quite prominent blackhead on my nose that multiple people have asked me to squeeze out. I tried once, but it was difficult and it hurt, so now I'm just self conscious about it.

        "body": "you really wanna incorporate some chemical exfoliation to fight against those closed comedones/blackheads. a combination of an AHA and BHA is what most people recommend. Paula's Choice has samples you can buy of both her 2% BHA liquid and 8% AHA gel. you wanna ease into it first by using the BHA one day then the AHA the other day, but some people can do BHA in the morning and AHA at night. make sure to use a sunscreen during the day as well bc the AHA makes your skin photosensitive. the AHA will slough off the layers of skin on the closed comedones and the BHA will penetrate them. If that doesnt work, you can go to the derm for a retinoid which will help the closed comedones and blackheads also.",

Bạn có thể dùng tẩy da chết vật lý chứa các chứa các hạt scrub siêu nhỏ để khi massage trên da sẽ cuốn theo lớp sừng và da chết đi ra. Hoặc có thể dùng sản phẩm tẩy tế bào chết hóa học  có nồng độ axit nhẹ rồi từ từ nâng dần lên, với sản phẩm tẩy tế bào chết có BHA nên sử dụng nồng độ 1-2%, sau 1-2 tháng nâng lên 4%, còn với AHA nên sử dụng từ nồng độ 3-5% sau nâng lên 7-10%\n\nBước 4: Đắp mặt nạ đất sét/ than hoạt tính\n\nĐắp mặt nạ đất sét không chỉ giúp làm sạch sâu bên trong lỗ chân lông mà còn giúp loại bỏ dầu thừa, bụi bẩn trên da đem lại hiệu quả trị mụn tốt hơn. Cách thực hiện vô cùng đơn giản, chỉ cần đắp mặt nạ 1 lớp mỏng trên da và giữ trong vòng 15-20 phút sau đó rửa sạch lại bằng nước ấm.\n\nBước 5: Nặn mụn\n\nSau khi đắp mặt nạ khoảng 10 phút, lỗ chân lông đã được làm sạch và mở rộng hơn giúp dễ dàng tiến hành bước nặn mụn. Bạn hãy rửa sạch tay sau đó sử dụng cây nặn mụn đã được khử trùng sau đó dùng lực quét cây nặn mụn nhẹ nhàng trên da để loại bỏ nhân mụn.\n\nBước 6: Đắp mặt nạ phục hồi\n\nSau khi nặn mụn đầu đen, làn da của bạn bị tác động và trở nên nhạy cảm, vì thế bạn cần được đắp mặt nạ để làm dịu da, chống viêm và giảm thâm sau nặn mụn. Có thể sử dụng mặt nạ giấy, mặt nạ sủi bọt, mặt nạ gel,…\n\nBước 7: Sử dụng Toner/ Serum và Kem dưỡng\n\nVới các bạn da khô, sau khi đã nặn mụn và đắp mặt nạ, bạn có thể tiến hành cả 3 bước dưỡng da tiếp theo: dùng toner, serum và kem dưỡng\n\nVới các bạn có làn da dầu: Sau khi đắp mặt nạ nên chọn 1 trong 3 bước dưỡng da trên để tạo lớp bảo vệ, giúp da mau lành vết thương sau nặn mụn\n\nƯu tiên các sản phẩm không có hương liệu, không cồn, kết cấu mỏng nhẹ và chứa ít gốc dầu gây bít tắc da\n\nBước 8: Chấm mụn\n\nNếu là người mới bắt đầu sử dụng các sản phẩm chấm mụn, bạn nên sử dụng các dòng sản phẩm có chứa hoạt chất Benzyl Peroxide 2 – 5% hoặc Adapalene. Sau một khoảng thời gian, khi đã quen với các hoạt chất này có thể đổi sang sử dụng Retinol-A hoặc Teetrea oil. Tuy nhiên, Benzyl Peroxide 2 – 5% và Adapalene vẫn là 2 hợp chất được các chuyên gia da liễu khuyên nên sử dụng.\n\nBước 9: Dùng kem chống nắng\n\nSau các bước chăm sóc trên đừng quên thoa kem chống nắng trước khi ra ngoài vào ban ngày nhé! Kem chống nắng sẽ giúp bảo vệ làn da, giúp các dưỡng chất được hấp thụ hoàn toàn mà không bị mất đi, đem lại hiệu quả tốt nhất.\n\n# Một Số Lưu Ý Trong Quá Trình Chăm Sóc Da Mụn Đầu Đen, Lỗ Chân Lông To\n\nGiữ da luôn sạch và thông thoáng\n\nHạn chế sử dụng những đồ uống có cồn, caffeine và các chất kích thích,…\n\nBỏ các thói quen xấu: sờ tay lên mặt, nặn mụn khi chưa sát trùng tay,…\n\nKiểm soát lượng bã nhờn trên da bằng cách: uống đủ nước, ngủ đủ giấc và dùng giấy thấm dầu thường xuyên\n\nBảo vệ da tránh các tác nhân từ bên ngoài: dùng kem chống nắng, đeo khẩu trang\n\nBổ sung dưỡng chất cho da: Vitamin C, A, B3,..\n\nCó thể đến spa nặn mụn theo chu kì 3 – 7 ngày/ lần\n\n Không lạm dụng các biện pháp lột mụn vì sẽ khiến lỗ chân lông to và dễ tổn thương hơn\n\nTại Sao Da Dầu Thường Gặp Trình Trạng Bị Mụn Và Lỗ Chân Lông To\n\n# Nguyên Nhân Da Dầu Thường Bị Lỗ Chân Lông To\n\nNhững người có làn da dầu, da nhờn thường có lỗ chân lông to hơn những người có làn da khô và da thường. Nguyên nhân là do bã nhờn và dầu trên da quá nhiều khiến bụi bẩn dễ dàng bám dính lại, các chất này có tích tụ trên da khiến lỗ chân lông càng ngày càng nở ra, thậm chí gây nên mụn trứng cá. \n\nHậu quả là, sau khi nặn mụn, vùng da bị kéo dãn đó không hồi phục về hiện trạng ban đầu, lỗ chân lông trở nên to và rõ hơn, hình thành sẹo rỗ.\n\n# Nguyên Nhân Da Dầu Thường Bị Mụn Đầu Đen\n\nDa dầu có tuyến mồ hôi hoạt động cực kỳ mạnh mẽ. Chính vì vậy cũng là nguyên nhân hình thành mụn đầu đen. Cơ chế hình thành mụn đầu đen là do tuyến dầu trên da hoạt động mạnh như không thể thoát ra khỏi bề mặt da do lỗ chân lông bị bít tắc bởi bụi bẩn, tế bào chết hay sản phẩm trang điểm và vi khuẩn. Khi các nốt mụn trong lỗ chân lông tiếp xúc với không khí sẽ bị oxy hóa và nhân mụn chuyển sang màu đen sậm.\n\n**Nguồn bài viết gốc:** [Review 10 Loại Sữa Rửa Mặt Trị Mụn Đầu Đen Cực Kì Hiệu Quả](https://odayreview.com/sua-rua-mat-tri-mun-dau-den/)",

I'm so happy for him. ^ _ ^\n\nHowever he has a coconut allergy so it's really hard to find shaving soap or lotion.

Unless there is a really good recipe from some other home soap makers here I am wanting to buy him some stuff.\n\nAs far as I know he just does his shave after a shower and not doing the 'pre-shave' oil or lotion.

You say it's a coconut allergy, but it looks like the sodium stearate would be a salt of stearic acid, and would be dependent upon whether or not it's derived from saponifying coconut oil.   \nIf his allergy is only to coconut oil, and not actually to the stearates, you may be able to find a decent soap that is suitable.  \nHow severe are his allergic reactions?",

    "body": " \n\nLong story short I am new to actually caring for my skin and am needing some help. I used to cleanse and sometimes moisturize only.\n\nI am allergic to everything under the sun from plants, animals, mold, dust, foods, and chemicals. I've had pretty extensive allergy testing done at the doctor. Tested \"positive\" for 60 of 60 \"natural\" allergens (I reacted to all plants, pollen, animals, mold). I reacted to the tape done for the chemical test, so that has to be redone. I have not yet done the food allergy test.\n\nAs far as chemicals go, I know for sure I am allergic to Stearyl Alcohol. I have also decided to try to avoid Cetyl Alcohol and thus Cetearyl Alcohol (Cetyl and Stearyl alcohols combined). I also prefer fragrance free or very low fragrance/odor (due to other allergies and migraine triggers)\n\nI have combonation skin in terms of both seasonal and t-zone combination, leaning towards dry. I get very flaky skin easily (it will peel off in patches or sheets). I also have relatively sensitive skin due to both general sensitivity and allergies, turning red very quickly and also breaking out into hives, rashes, and contact dermatitis.\n\nBelow is my current skin care routine with products I use with a link to the product and the ingredient list. (the links are just generic to sephora mostly because that is where i bought these products)\n\nI am wanting help with a few things\n\n1. are all of the products i have listed safe from the above alcohols?\n2. Is this the right order?\n3. do I need to add or subtract anything from my routine?\n4. any other/general suggestions or advice?\n5. several product replacements i need suggestions for\n   1. eye cream\n   2. exfoliate\n   3. lotion!!\n\nI will update later with my makeup list, but one step at a

Or layer products mindfully. By this I mean your moisturizer would be fine to use if using a cleanser without amino acids/other malassezia triggers, and you can use your cleanser worry free if using a moisturizer without lipids. \n\nI spent a bunch of money on all different cleansers and moisturizers but just ended up picking up Vanicream gentle cleanser. If it’s available to you, I would recommend it. It’s completely safe and after only 3 days my face feels calmer (was using Naturium’s greens cleanser, Curology cleanser, and Paulas Choice clear). I also use iUnik centella gel, and either Cotz or DRMTLGY tinted sunscreen (both FA safe). I also sometimes use pure Squalane oil, but by itself- as a one-and-done kind of thing. Take my advice with a grain of salt, my skin is not perfect. I’m about to go for either the Happy Cappy shampoo or vanicream Z bar to mask every so often like others suggest. \n\nHere is a link to an article from the Facebook group ‘Friends with Fungal Acne’ (I don’t know how to formate links into comments correctly, if anyone does lmk):\n\n\nEdit: like to article didn’t work, link to FB group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/friendswithfungalacne/?ref=share\n\nGo to files, third one down: Fungal Acne Safe Products.docx",

    "body": "My skin is sensitive, acne prone and mildly oily. I usually wear makeup and in the spring/summer i wear an spf as well. I like to use fairly simple products without any actives and I always try to aim for products without conedogenic and/or irritating ingredients. My goal is simply to keep my skin clear and hydrated without any extra fuss.\n\nMy current routine: \nnight - 1. Skintegra Amphibian cleanser/Balea Med Ultra Sensitive cleanser 2. Balea Med Ultra Sensitive Tagescreme, morning - the same except i use an spf instead of a moisturizer \n\nMy first question is would it be okay or even beneficial to stop using a cleanser in the morning and wash only with plain water following it up with an spf.\n\nAdditionally, does anyone else have experience with the products I am using or has a similar skin type and has used these products and if so would you deem them good.\n\nLastly, I've recently switched from the Balea Med cleanser to the Skintegra one and am wondering, based on the ingredients (listed down below), which one seems better and more suited to my skin type and goals. Same goes for moisturizer. \n\nI always check the ingredients of my products and like to do research before i use anything but since I know there are people here that are more versed in skincare I wanted to ask for some help. If anyone has any other products to recommend I would greatly appreciate it and would be thankful for any input :)\n\nIngredients:\nBalea Med Ultra Sensitive cleanser - AQUA, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE, DECYL GLUCOSIDE, XANTHAN GUM, SODIUM CHLORIDE, PANTHENOL, BISABOLOL, CITRIC ACID\n\nSkintegra Amphibian cleanser - AQUA, GLYCERIN, SODIUM COCOAMPHOACETATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, LAURYL GLUCOSIDE, BETAINE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, SODIUM LAURYL GLUCOSE CARBOXYLATE, BISABOLOL, ZINC PCA, COPPER GLUCONATE, MAGNESIUM SULFATE, XANTHAN GUM, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM, DISODIUM EDTA, CITRIC ACID\n\nBalea Med Ultra Sensitive Tagescreme - AQUA, GLYCERIN,  ETHYLHEXYL STEARATE, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS HYBRID OIL, BEHENYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, GLYCERYL STEARATE, PENTAERYTHRITYL DISTEARATE, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, PANTHENOL, ALLANTOIN, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, SODIUM STEAROYL GLUTAMATE, MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE, XANTHAN GUM, CELLULOSE GUM, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, CAPRYL HYDROXAMIC ACID, SILICA, CITRIC ACID, SODIUM, HYDROXIDE\n",

But i really want to get get into non-foaming creamy cleansers because no matter how gentle it is, a foaming cleanser always irritates me now that im on Taz. \n\nI got a creamy cleanser which doesnt leave a film and feels soothing but im not sure if it is effective enough.

    "body": "Every hair care product can be broken down into these two things, bases & add-ins. Bases make up the majority of the product. They can be things like oils, creams, butters, soaps, etc. Add-ins are exactly that, the other things added in. Most of the ingredients are a bunch of crazy long words which are usually, **BUT NOT ALWAYS,** *icky*. I promise you the old joke of \"The less words on the back, the better it is for you.' really isn't a joke. You don't need many of those crazy long words to make a shampoo or conditioner. It's gets a little hazier when we get to \"products\" but that's not for right now. The list of good and bad big words will be at the bottom.\n\nSo, why are bases and add-ins important?  From my experience, finding what bases and add-ins work with you & your body can be an absolute game changer. I have *ridiculously* sensitive skin so I have always been limited in the products I can use. I have realized that if I stick to the bases/add-ins that I know are okay, 9/10 times, the product will work for me too. For example, coconut oil, olive oil, and castille soap are all bases I can readily use with no worry. The add-ins I know that will not end in disaster are honey, lavender, and rose oil. This is because I have thick, coarse hair so olive/coconut oil work well for me. I luckily am not allergic to those specific add-ins, so I can smell nice without fear of a rash. Can't use baking soda or oats though, which are in EVERYTHING. Why on earth is this important? BECAUSE if you know these things, you can easily improve your self care without struggling through testing out 100 products first. Instead of standing there googling, questioning, & struggling all to end in disaster regardless, at least try this method.

It makes your skin feel soft.\n\nSodium Hydroxide - Big word for Lye basically. And Lye is used for the saponification process, AKA making soap.\n\nGlycerin - A type of carb known as a sugar alcohol. It is naturally occurring in the body and helps promote retaining moisture in the skin.\n\nThese are some of the very very bad words\n\nTriclosan, alcohol, formaldehyde, sulfates, parabens, polyethylene glycol, phthalates, retinyl palmitate, silicones, benzine, methylisothiazolinone, and p-phenylenediamine.",

Anyway usually surfactant are used at the critical micellar concentration (CMC), that's around the optimal concentration to have nice foam, nice spreadability (with reduced surfaced tension) and not too much so it's easily rinsed off. It might be called mild but it's always compared to other ones, in any case leaving a surfactant dry on skin will be irritating so you may actually compromise your final product if you put too much of it.",

Generally don't use heat other than diffusing occasionally and very rarely I'll straighten it but that's only a few times a year. Even though it's high porosity it does seem to get weighed down fairly easy. Really the only thing I've bothered to use is aussie instant freeze gel, works okay I guess but I haven't used it enough to really say. Live in a moderately humid area. \nAs far as washing goes I generally alternate between shea moisture coconut hibiscus cowash and acure mega moisture shampoo/conditioner (acure shampoo isn't necessarily 100% cg approved as it has sodium lauroyl  methyl isethionate and sodium cocoyl glutamate but it also has a ton of oil in it so I haven't had any problems with it). \nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated, trying to start putting a little more effort into my hair. Doesn't have to be the cheapest stuff, I don't mind spending on my hair but I also don't want to spend $40 on a bottle of something I may or may not end up liking.",

    "body": "Product: Sailor by Capitan Blankenship Sea Splash Face Cleanser\n\nProduct Size: 4OZ/118ML\n\nProduct Start Date: August 28th 2019\n\nConsistency Of Product: Lightweight Gel Style Cleanser - In Spray Bottle\n\nWhen I Use It: Morning and Evening Routine - Daily\n\nHow I Use It:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I spray 3-4 pumps of Product into damp hands and work the Product into a lather. Then, I apply this lather to my face/neck and gently massage the Product into my Skin. After about 2-3 minutes…I thoroughly rinse the Product with warm water.\n\nWhy I Use It:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* After moving towards purchasing more “clean” Skincare Products…this Brand was one that I found at Target pretty early on. I was drawn to their Products not only for the fairly minimal Ingredients Lists…but the nautical theme as well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I ended up grabbing just a few of their Products (Oil Cleanser, Water Based Cleanser, and Moisturizer)…but Target also carries a Toner, Serum/Spot Treatment, and a couple of Products from their Hair Care Line. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* After finishing up with the Peach & Lily Power Calm Cleanser…I was curious to see how the Sailor By Capitan Blankenship Product stacked up…so it went from my Stash to the vanity.\n\nOverall Review:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Right away…I love the packaging for this Product. The glass bottle should be incredibly easy to recycle/reuse…and Capitan. Blankenship doesn’t put it in a separate cardboard box. Reducing the overall amount of packaging is great and I certainly appreciate it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Having said that, one thing I noticed about this Face Cleanser was the color of the Product itself. Now, there are no Synthetic Dyes in this Formula…and Capitan Blankenship says that the natural blue hue is due to the Blue Chamomile in the Formula. But as you can see from my pics…my Product is this dirty green color. While I don’t find it off putting…its kind of a surprise to see what this Product looks like right from Capitan Blankenship vs. what I got at my local Target. Not sure if this could be avoided by putting the Product into a box of some kind…but I just thought it was interesting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Aside from the Blue Chamomile…this Sea Splash Face Cleanser contains Irish Moss (used for texture stabilization and hydration), Grapefruit Peel Oil, Citric Acid, Orange Peel Oil, Juniper Berry Extract, Kelp Extract, White Lupin Seed Extract, Beach Rose Fruit Extract, Sea Salt, and Aloe Leaf Juice. You’ll also find an array of gentle surfactants and preservatives. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Although I was kind of wary of the spray application of this Product…it really does come out of the spray bottle just fine. This Water Based Cleanser has the fluidity of a Serum more than a thicker Gel Cleanser which I didn’t mind at all. Application is a breeze…just pumps is all it takes to get a fairly decent lather out of this Product (considering it is a pH Balanced Cleanser). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* After just a few uses…I could tell that this Sea Splash Face Cleanser was a bit more intense than the Peach & Lily Product I had been using most recently. It didn’t leave my Skin dry/stripped in any way…it just didn’t feel like it was leaving as much natural Oil/hydration behind. However, the addition of the Essential Oils give this Product a wonderful citrus/herbal scent that I found to be incredibly refreshing and perfect for a morning pick me up lol!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Aside from that…I truly didn’t see any additional results or benefits from this Product. No real burst of hydration, soothing, of calming effects were noticed. After several weeks…I have to be honest in saying that I was kind bored with this Product lol. I’ve just had so many great experiences with other Water Based Cleanser…and even though it is a boring step in general I still found this Sea Splash Face Cleanser to be lacking.\n\nSo there you have it…I don’t think I’ll be coming back to this Product anytime soon. Sure…it is packaged wonderfully, smells pretty great, is really quite affordable, and has a very straight forward Ingredients List. But, it just wasn’t for me. I think those with more Oily Skin or are looking for something a bit stronger for the evening may appreciate the extra cleansing power this Product has compare to some of its pH Balanced counterparts.\n\nBut, if you are looking for something that is as gentle as possible while still providing a decent cleanse…the Peach & Lily Power Calm Hydrating Gel Cleanser is still the one to beat. I absolutely adore that Product and if came in a glass bottle…I probably wouldn’t be continuing my hunt for my HG Water Based Cleanser lol! I’ll most likely keep using the Sailor by Capitan Blankenship Sea Splash Face Cleanser as a Body Wash until I run out…and then reuse the bottle for a Toner or Essence in the future.\n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nWater, Decyl Glucoside, Polyglyceryl-10 Caprylate / Caprate, Coco Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Glycerin, Maris Sal (Dead Sea Salt), Rosa Rugosa Fruit Extract, Lupinus Albus Seed Extract, Ascophyllum Nodosum (Kelp) Extract, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Glyceryl Caprylate, Citric Acid, Polyglyceryl-6 Oleate, Sodium Surfactin, Glycerin, Sodium Levulinate, Potassium Sorbate, Chondrus Crispus (Carrageenan), Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Juniperus Communis (Juniper) Berry Oil, Phytic Acid, Tocopherol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, \\* Guaiazulene, Lactic Acid\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/78nctu2749p41.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a6adbdb59849a3cfc5837c1e9793954dfabb575",

    "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm trying to learn more about detergents and the difference between products with detergents (shower gel, shampoo, laundry detergent, dishwashing liquid, etc.).\n\nDo I understand it correctly that the main (active) ingredients in all these products are detergents whereas shower gel, shampoo and dishwashing liquid generally use 'milder' detergents than laundry detergent? And that they often have different ingredients for their specific purpose, e.g. glycerine in shower gel and enzymes/brighteners in laundry detergent?\n\nThe reason why I'm asking this is because I'm looking for product(s) to use when travelling and less/lighter/non-liquid products are easier to carry than a lot of different bottles.\n\nI've read that a lot of people use (castille) soap (Dr. Bronner's) as a detergent for everything, but I'm not sure whether that's ideal (for the skin) because of the high pH.\n\nI have found two products that look like solid soap bars, but they don't use soap as a detergent and have a pH of ~5.5. \n\nProduct 1.\n>Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Coco-Sulfonate, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Starch, Cetearyl Alcohol, Paraffin, Aqua, Citric Acid, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Bisabolol, Panthenol, Propylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide. \n\nProduct 2.\n>Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Triticum vulgare starch, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Talc, Sodium Lactate, Cera alba, Aqua, Lecithin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Panthenol, Inulin, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycine, Magnesium Aspartate, Alanine, Lysine, Leucine, Benzophenone-4, Parfum, CI 47005, CI 61570, CI 77891\n\nWould (the detergents in) these products be strong enough to wash clothes and dishes with or are they too mild? Would it be smart to buy two bars; one soap bar for washing clothes & dishes and a soap-less bar for the use on the skin? \n\nWhat product(s) would/do you pack when travelling? I'm really curious!\n\nThanks a lot!",
