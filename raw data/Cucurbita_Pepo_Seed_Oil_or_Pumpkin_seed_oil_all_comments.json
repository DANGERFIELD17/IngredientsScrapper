So ill add that to the list as well (she calls it potato mud) \n\n\nThat's about it, and all of those foods also have a spot where she won't eat it (it's a touch too much salt for her, the meat is to chewy, it tastes \"weird\") \n\nShe is the pickiest person I've ever met in my life. \nThe irony is that when she is alone she considers rice with pumpkin seed oil and corn the hight of deliciousness. That and frozen pizza. \n\nI'm just so confused with this girl sometimes \n\nI still love her tho\n\nEdit: shes in her 30s and we manage it like this: ether i make something she knows she likes or i just make whatever and she has her backup foods like rice and noodles in case she doesn't like what i made. \n\nThere are no hard feelings on my side as long as she is self aware and doesn't complain about my cooking.",

    "body": "I wanted to rave and go on a positive mini rant about how incorporating turmeric based products has improved my skin - significantly. I also am going to add my skincare routine for anyone who may be interested as well. I freaking love turmeric man üò≠ whenever I have any type of dark spot appear, turmeric soap and the turmeric scrubs are my go to. That junk literally fades dark spots in like less than 2 weeks . Now, the dark spots that I‚Äôve had on my face, for years, are fading but it‚Äôs of course taking a bit more time. The key is to tackle the dark spots as SOON as they start to appear. AS SOON. I personally don‚Äôt use anything with Kojic acid though, as my sensitive skin wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle that for long periods of time. I just strictly stick to turmeric, and even lemon based skin products to help with lightening and evening out my skin tone. Turmeric soap is fairly cheap too; I‚Äôll list the products I use any case anyone wants to know, and the order I use them in. I‚Äôm not saying my routine will work for everybody, but it may help someone at else ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\n1. I go straight to the turmeric scrub and apply it with water so that it spreads evenly. (I only use this scrub when I need to get rid of tough dark spots)\n2. I let the scrub sit for like, 7 mins or 10 (depends) then I rinse that off and then use the turmeric soap. If my skin is looking really good already, I skip the turmeric scrub and just use the soap.\n3. (Your skin is going to be extremely dry) so then I use an organic aloe vera gel to moisturize. \n4. I then use a pumpkin seed based oil to further moisturize (my skin is naturally oily, but for some reason, using oil has helped with my oiliness). You can use this particular pumpkin seed oil for all over the body as well and hair. \n5. I then finish off with two toner sprays /facial mist \n\n\nProducts- \n\n- [ ] Minimo Glow Turmeric scrub- (Amazon)\n- [ ] Nature Love- Balancing facial toner (rose water and witch hazel- Marshalls (amazon too but cheaper at marshalls )\n- [ ] Pearlessence- Hyaluronic acid hydrating facial mist- Marshalls (Amazon as well, but cheaper at Marshalls)\n- [ ] T.N Dickinson‚Äôs witch hazel (Amazon)\n- [ ] So Rosy Hair oil made with Rosemary, roses and premium organic pumpkin seed oil (it‚Äôs also an amazing body and facial oil, and I know the creator personally. Black owned. The only oil I use. She also has other oils as well on the website) link- https://www.etsy.com/listing/1688789824/so-rosy-hair-oil-with-rose-rosemary?click_key=c95ff6f30dee277af1d82ae279a8489956e36aab%3A1688789824&click_sum=3e49126b&ref=shop_home_recs_4&frs=1\n- [ ] AmVital Natural Turmeric soap (Amazon.

    "body": "Hello! First off, I just want to say how grateful I am for this subreddit, I genuinely don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve had the courage or inspiration to start this journey without it.\n\nSome background: I‚Äôm 24F, and my hair loss started in 2020. Things progressively got worse and really hit a low point in late 2024. I think it was due to a bunch of issues of issues: I had COVID early on (which definitely kicked off the hair-loss), Long-term vitamin D deficiency and iron levels always on the low end (on and off since 2018), weight loss (especially in 2024, I lost 40 lbs), zero understanding of how to care for my wavy/curly hair, and I was just *constantly* stressed out.\n\nI started to realize just how bad it was getting mid 2024. I ordered some 5% minoxidil foam but hesitated for months. I had a hard time accepting that starting minoxidil could mean shedding the little hair I had left before it MIGHT get better, hated the idea of being on it ‚Äúforever,‚Äù and was nervous about the risk to my cats.\n\nBut after seeing those first two photos of my scalp, I finally bit the bullet in Sept 2024. As scared as I was about starting minoxidil, the state of my hair terrified me even more. I started applying men's 5% foam minoxidil every night (sometimes twice a day but I couldn't stick to this routine). I started seeing a little bit of progress, baby hairs growing in, sparsity was less noticeable, but nothing crazy. I also did not have a shedding period, and if I did then I didn't notice, as I was already constantly shedding crazy amount of hair.\n\nDecember 2024: I tried to get a derm appointment. My primary doctor referred me, but the request was denied (apparently my case wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúsevere enough‚Äù ü¶Ö). However, even though I wasn't able to get an appointment, a dermatologist looked at my medical history and diagnosed me with TE, which allowed my doctor to prescribe me oral minoxidil. I started at 0.625mg and bumped to 1.25mg after a month because I wasn‚Äôt experiencing any side effects, while still applying the foam every night.\n\nOther changes I made since then:\n\n* Got a silk pillowcase and started using a silk bonnet.\n* Switched to washing my hair more often (used to be every 3‚Äì4 days, now it‚Äôs every 1‚Äì2).\n* Ditched gentle non-sulfate shampoos and switched to harsher shampoos, my main ones are: Pantene Volume & Body, Pantene Miracles Infinite Lengths, Nizoral Ketoconazole.\n* Switched conditioners to Dove Conditioner Intensive Repair and Nioxin System 3 Conditioner.\n* Religiously taking vitamins:\n   * Iron, vitamin D, women‚Äôs multivitamin (Costco)\n   * Also: pumpkin seed oil, fish oil, and Nature‚Äôs Bounty Hair, Skin & Nails 1‚Äì2x/week (too much biotin breaks me out)\n* I try to eat more protein.\n* Stopped heat styling (I used to straighten my hair 5x/week)\n* Started using products to keep the hair I already have healthy. I hate how pricey these products are but Olaplex No.7 and Kerastase 8H night serum have been great for my super fine hair.\n* This one hurts...I gave up black box dye\n* No more ponytails, I try to keep it down as much as possible, otherwise claw clip.\n\nThings I tried but could not keep up consistently:\n\n* Red light therapy. I got a reasonably priced red light cap, but I couldn't keep up with it for long enough to say whether it helped at all. I hated the sweaty/hot feeling on my scalp.\n* Derma stamping. I only managed to do this 4‚Äì5 times in a month, but I swear I saw progress. Will revisit this.\n* Scalp serums. They make my scalp feel great but I can't justify the cost for the small return I've observed.\n* Reducing my stress. I just don't think it's possible while I remain in the corporate hell hole so it is what it is. \n\nNow it's been 9 months on foam, and 6 months on oral. I‚Äôm using both nightly.\n\nI didn't experience too many symptoms with the foam, I recall there being a short adjustment period where my performance at the gym took a small dip, but that's pretty much it.\n\nI didn't experience any symptoms when I started oral 0.625mg.\n\nWith oral (1.25mg):\n\n* Faster body/facial hair growth (need to dermaplane/shave weekly now)\n* Water retention/bloating after salty meals (only I notice, plus the scale)\n* Resting heart rate went up by \\~10 bpm (was low to begin with)\n* Early on, I had nights where my heartbeat felt stronger than normal, but that faded\n\n**TL;DR**: 9 months on minoxidil. Big lifestyle and haircare changes. Learned not to completely abuse my hair. No magic fix, but progress is happening.",

The first picture was taken a month after I started and I can't believe my temples ever were like that.\n\nAfter the 6 month mark, I stopped applying 1ml twice a day and reduced to only 1ml once a day (my cheeks were growing undesired hair) and started taking 100mg of Spironolactone everyday as well.\n\nA month ago I started incorporating hair oiling into my routine and taking a pumpkin seed oil supplement (works like a natural DHT blocker) but I haven't seen results from it because only one month has passed so what you see in the last picture it's due to minoxidil and spiro.",

But if you have androgenic alopecia, which is the most common hair loss type in both men and women, then I strongly suggest that you jump on finasteride!\n\nMinoxidil only thickens existing hair but does not stop hair loss itself. This means your hair is still falling out, but due to thickness increasing, it gives the illusion that it's working when it is not.\n\nYou have an enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase, which converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT).\n\nDHT then binds to your hair follicles, and depending on genes, your hair follicles can be sensitive to it.\n\nFinasteride blocks the 5-alpha-reductase enzyme, but Minoxidil does not. Minoxidil is still great to add to your treatment, but like I said, it won't halt hair loss. \n\nUnfortunately, not all doctors will prescribe it to women due to sexism. \n\nBoth men and women are expected to not have children while taking these drugs until the drug has been eliminated from your system (1-3 months), and only by then is it safe to get pregnant again. \n\nDue to this doctor prescribe it to men with ease and tell them to use condoms while women, on the other hand, are not trusted to use birth control or have their man use a condom. \n\nTherefore, if you find a doctor or dermatologist refusing treatment to you, show them this message or change doctor until you find one who is better educated!\n\nGood luck!",

    "body": "Ok, so if you're pregnant, or plan to be shortly - no minox is not advised. \n\nBut in almost every other situation it's pretty safe to try\n\n**Is it true its for life? I'd have to use it forever?**  \nYes, but that's only if it works. You brush your teeth forever, you moisturise forever, exercise and eat all for the rest of your life but people really get hung up on this one thing. Bad because it makes your hair sticky? Trust me person-panicking-online about hair loss, you will find a way to make it work. Takes about 4 hours to set in, I apply it when I first get home from work - I'll shower before bed (my hair is short). Once a day is fine, honestly once its 'set in and working' twice a week is fine. \n\n**What if I stop? Will I lose everything?**  \nBasically yeah, you'll return to baseline as in where you would be if you never started. Existing hair wont become dependent. Hairs that would have grown back anyway from deficiency or TE will also stay, this is why men can use min to grow a beard and then stop using the product once they're satisfied with the hair amount. \n\n**I have pets, I can't have that POISON in my home.**  \nIt's true, minoxidil is toxic to cats and dogs, that is both orally and on the skin - so yes be careful. But you're an adult, you know your pet. I have a cat, i apply my minoxidil, wash my hands, don't touch my cat for 15 minutes and carry on with my day. \n\nI know she's not the type of cat to open a cupboard and drink something she shouldn't - after all, she's never drank bleach, toilet cleaner, detergent, soaps, perfumes, isopropyl alcohol etc (just some other things in my house that are highly toxic to cats).\n\n**Will it make me hairy everywhere?**  \nNot in its liquid form, its non systemic. \n\n**Oral or topical**  \nThis is hard, I suggest topical - if you're scared in the slightest topical uses way less to do the same work. It's obviously harder than taking a tablet but a lot safer. There can be heart risks involved with the oral form, after all - thats why minox exists in the first place, as a medication for high blood pressure. \n\nBut it's your body, you can take it - see your doctor, people have great results with oral and it makes sense to me why, but topical is all I have used. \n\n**Will it work for me?**  \nDon't know really. If you have aggressive AGA and you're young, less likely. Diffuse thinning, a bit easier. Unknown cause? Don't know - Known cause? don't know. Not everybody responds to min. \n\n**Dread shed?**  \nMuch like the above, nobody can tell how bad it will be, how long it will last, or if it will even happen. You will at no point really end up \"worse off\" for taking min. People will experience shed from minox and claim it made their situation worse - one of the ways it works is by speeding up the cycle, so miniaturised hairs are shed faster to make room for new healthy hairs again. It can seem aggressive but they were going to fall out anyway, to make way for even smaller miniaturised hairs  \n\n**How does it work?**  \nDon't know! nobody does! but its been working now for 35 years over the counter. \n\n**It was giving me headaches/drowsiness/anxiety so i stopped**  \nSounds kinda of fear mongery to be honest, or maybe knowcebo effect. Or your anecdotal story could be true to you, different people react differently to different things I guess. \n\n**I'm scared to try/start**  \nI was more scared wait, scared to leave my hair to see what happens. People will happily rub all sorts of other things on their head if it sounds natural enough - pumpkin seed oil? rosemary? The appeal to nature fallacy is massive in the 'niche solution' to cosmetic health world, especially when the alternative is big bad pharma.",

I was experiencing a lot of hair thinning/hair last year, so in November of last year I decided to start my hair Regrowth journey and go ham. I decided to make a post because I‚Äôm honestly shocked that my routine is actually working, so I wanted to share what I did to help whoever I can and return the favor to all of those who‚Äôve shared their regimes on here‚ù§Ô∏è \n\nThis is my routine (I just sent it to someone which is why I have it written out): \n\nPrevent Hair Fall Out:\n1. Detoxing Shampoo (ouai) like once a week or every other week to get rid of build up that doesn‚Äôt go away really with just regular shampoo and clogs follicles\n2. Vegamour Advanced Gro+ Shampoo (I didn‚Äôt care for the conditioner and like using something with silicones since I have fine hair (dove scalp+hair therapy conditioner)\n\nHair Regrowth/thickening:\n1. Vegamour Gro+ advanced every morning\n3. Kiwabi hair massage root essence daily mid day with a scalp massage right after for 5 mins ish\n4. Dermaroller 2-3 times a week w/ 0.25 needles (should apply one of the products right after for maximum obsorbtion - came with the serum for Vegamour when I got the system) \n5. Pumpkin seed oil & pre-natal vitamins daily\n6. Glass of milk a day (one with omega-3s) \n7. Hair Oiling once a week (I use the JVN pre-wash scalp serum before I shower paired with a hydrating mask on the ends mixed with some of that serum - just wet ends to apply - and leave it on for like an hour ish) \n\nHair repair for ends/ prevent further breakage:\n1. K18 leave in treatment (2-3 pumps once a week after detox, rub in hands until it turns white, then tap into ends, don‚Äôt add any product until you wait 4 minutes, conditioner \n2. STOP USING CLAW CLIPS ESPECIALLY TIGHTLY AND ON THE SAME SPOT - not only did I see a lot of thinning in the area I used the claw clip but also so much breakage\n\nFirst 4 pics are the progress I‚Äôve seen so far and last 2 were what it was like before!

    "body": "Hi everyone, I have been on here in the past because I‚Äôve been struggling with hair loss for about 2 years now. It started getting very bad after starting birth control and then stopping after a month due to depressive symptoms (I have OCD, and recurrent MDD). Most of the hair from my temples had fallen out (visibly) and my crown. However, hair was coming out in large quantities all over my head. I also lost my period for 8 months, had lost 10 lbs (was at 95lbs) and was severely depressed. Basically my hormones were everywhere. I went to 2 derms, a pcp, a gynecologist, endocrinologist and 2 integrative health doctors trying to figure out what the heck was going on inside my body. What was causing weight loss, hair loss, skin issues, fatigue, loss of period, and SEVERE mental health challenges. I had so much blood drawn and most doctors wrote me off and told me it was TE and just stress. One told me to even go to tj maxx and buy some candles as treatment. I was so lost, depressed, and OBSESSED with my hair. To the point where I counted every hair that came out of my head and that decided how my day would go. I was self diagnosing myself left and right. I thought I had pcos, some severe autoimmune disorder, thyroid issues, gut issues, etc. I was so miserable. My labs all came back clinically fine. So they thought it was all stress and mental health issues (I‚Äôd like to state that I was not on any psychiatric medication at this time due to fear of it causing the hair loss to worsen). So what started my journey to heal? \n\nWell first I saw a specific integrative care doctor who ordered a LOT of labs (if anyone is interested in which ones message me!) and she looked at things sub clinically. I was deficient in almost every vitamin which led to the fact that I wasn‚Äôt eating enough (I was 100lbs, I‚Äôm 5 2) she gave me a vitamin d3+k2 supplement, multivitamin, and a cortisol manager supplement. Almost immediately my periods came back. They have remained regular to this day which I have never experienced in my life. Although this helped my hair still wasn‚Äôt growing much and I still had bald spots. However, my hair had a reduction in shedding. \n\nSPIRONOLACTONE EXPERIENCE\nFast forward a few months I had been doing a lot of research on hair loss and was terrified I had AGA. I would count all the miniaturized hairs that fell out and compare them to how much regular hair came out. I could not accept that I may have AGA. It felt like a death sentence. Like I was doomed. Which is something a lot of women and men feel. Regardless, I thought I‚Äôd try spironolactone per my integrative doctors recommendation (because of acne). I thought maybe this is the light at the end of the tunnel, maybe this will be the miracle drug everyone says it is. I had a lot of hope and I am aware that this works for a lot of people. However, I‚Äôd like to shed light on the minority of people who unfortunately have a bad reaction (Jeff Donovan talks about this in some articles)! For some people spiro causes a TE that may actually speed up the underlying AGA. And in my case, unfortunately, this is what happened. I tried it for 2 months at 25mg a day and I lost around 700 hairs a day. That was unlike any shedding I‚Äôve ever seen. I ended up stopping it but I continued to shed. This caused me to be in a very dark place. I needed to do something about this so I decided to look everywhere for a dermatologist that knew something about hair loss. \n\nDERMATOLOGIST, MINOXIDIL, PUMPKIN SEED OIL, 2% KETOCONAZOLE SHAMPOO\nI ended up finding one and going in. For the first time a doctor actually LOOKED at my scalp and the areas I was concerned about. He took a dermascope and looked up close to determine miniaturization. He diagnosed me with AGA and TE. This was very hard for me to hear but part of me felt relieved. For the first time I had an answer, I didn‚Äôt have to feel like I was insane anymore. He told me to start minoxidil 5% and pumpkin seed oil (a good source of omega 3s (helps inflammation, and blocks Dht), and to wash my hair with 2% keto shampoo 2 times a week. I have been doing these things for about 4.5 months only and this is the results. I put my hair in a ponytail today for the first time in 2 years and I don‚Äôt feel insecure and less than. I am so beyond happy and proud of myself. I would also like to mention that my TE from spiro did resolve after 3-4 months (it needs to run its course) I didn‚Äôt really notice too bad of a minoxidil shed because I was already shedding. But I shed less than 100 a day now. \n\nOTHER THINGS THAT HAVE HELPED\nI truly believe that although the things previously mentioned helped majorly, these things I think had contributing factors. I restarted my antidepressants and anxiety medication (once it built up it made a big difference in my everyday functioning while going through this), I also started to eat better and more (I am now 108lbs and so confident), I continue with my vitamin regimen from my integrative health doctor, and I also moved out of my toxic/abusive parents house and joined a sorority at my college (I live in the house) I have a family here and I am no longer alone or isolating myself. I am so beyond proud of myself for getting myself through this (some days are still hard but I power through) I am all the more stronger and beautiful.\n\nPlease message me if you have any questions! I am not a doctor but the amount of research I‚Äôve done on things and experience I have‚Ä¶I may be able to offer insight. NEVER GIVE UP HOPE. YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL. \n",

One or two glass bottles wrapped in a towel should be fine but 10 are definitely dangerous. Also, all the added weight from the glass bottles. Make sure you wrap the plastic bottles in tin foil as UV light degrades the oil quickly.

I don't like it except in ice cream, so I can't recommend a brand or anything.\n\nAs for the rest, I can only speak as to Vienna, but others might be able to chime in if you're going somewhere else.\n\nSemmeln (Kaisersemmeln?) and horseradish you can easily get in the US. They're even called kaiser rolls.\n\nWhat do you mean Bristol toothbrushes? Do you mean bristle? I don't know where you're located in the US, but if there's a Meijer near you, their store brand has hard bristle brushes. You shouldn't use hard, though. Bad for your gums. I know it makes your mouth feel cleaner, but it's really not doing you any favors.\n\nVitamin tablets -- Go to DM and get the store brand. They're 95 cents for a tube.\n\nKleiner Klopfer and cheap wine -- any grocery store will do. Depends on what kind of wine you're looking for, but generally Hofer (Aldi), Lidl, Penny are your cheaper options. Merkur and Billa overcharge. Spar is hit or miss, depends on what kind of Spar and what you're looking for.\n\nKrampus and Gl√ºhwein -- You're only going to get this in November/December and \\*maybe\\* early January.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope you have fun on your trip!

Ever since then, i‚Äôve had debilitating chest pain, chest burning, and it spreads to my back and arms. It feels like an elephant is sitting on my chest all day long and even my asthma inhaler cannot help me. There‚Äôs no question about it, i‚Äôm not getting the second shot. I‚Äôm now terrified every night to go to sleep because I think I might not wake up. I‚Äôve had two ECGs, a chest x-ray and a blood test to test for clots and also a CBC. Was prescribed naproxen but it‚Äôs not doing shit for me. I take turmeric, pumpkin seed oil, Coq10, and Quercetin daily. Not doing shit for me‚Ä¶I‚Äôm literally terrified that I might die and I regret getting the vaccine so much.

        "body": "You will not die. As medical examination has excluded systemic problems,  what you are feeling is almost certainly the response of your immune system itself. This does not cause damage to any body cells, but the accompanying inflammation may cause pain and other unpleasant symptoms. The most efficient way to speed up the process is just giving your immune system maximal resource allocation to complete its job. The way to do this is getting as much rest as possible, and in particular to get as much quality sleep as you can get. Especially the latter can make a dramatic difference.   \n\n\nAssuming this most-likely scenario, what you are experiencing is caused by an active process of reactivation and reinforcement of the immune defenses you built up during your covid infection.  In the aftermath of severe viral infections, the immune system builds up local nodes designed to serve as some kind of military bases and training centers for B- and T-cells, for the purpose of rapid deployment and ramp-up of troops, should the virus make another unwelcome visit. If the infection was particularly severe in specific organs or tissues of your body, those immune system army bases tend to be set up close to these sites.  So, if during your prior natural covid infection, the virus managed to severely infect your deep lung tissue, your immune system will have placed many such bases specifically in the lung area and surrounding tissues in the aftermath of your illness.   \n\n\nThe vaccine reactivates the immune system, and encourages to beef up its defenses even more. The reaction is much more forceful in your case than in the case of people who have not had a prior covid infection, because your immune system is already primed, ready to kick in high gear right away, and very much not in the mood for a repeat of your prior illness. It gets very pissed off upon noticing the spike-protein introduced by the vaccine.  It concludes from that encounter that apparently, it has to do better, and must build more reinforcements of its military bases and armory to ward off this critter it so deeply hates.  \n\nThis causes a flurry of activity, systemically over your body, but in particular in those bases localized near major prior infection problem areas. In addition, because \"flurry of activity\" = \"inflammation\" (in the sense of more blood containing more construction labor force cells of various types being drawn to the sites that are calling those in), there may be some slight swelling, which may cause some pressure on the surrounding tissue, including in particular the tissue that was likely quite significantly damaged by the virus. That will certainly not cause more damage, but it may hurt quite a bit.  Much like when you are applying mild pressure to a pimple.     \n\n\nAt any rate, ordinarily, the immune system's round of reinforcements or whatever it feels it needs to do will typically largely be completed after two weeks. Hence the +2 week timeline you hear in the context of vaccine or natural infection immunity. After that it does continue working on it, but at a much slower pace, not in emergency mode.  The basic timeline is the same for everyone, but the intensity and how much you feel of said activity depends on individual circumstances. You are unlucky in that the inflammation and/or other components of activity are noticeable throughout the entire construction process.  But in contrast to live virus infection, the process has a bounded time scale. In contrast to live virus infection, nothing is reproducing itself inside of your hijacked cells to keep the state of war going. It will get better, and more likely get better suddenly rather than gradually.   \n\n\nIn the meantime I'm wishing you a lot of strength, because, benign or not, the pain is equally real. I hope that the above might put you a bit more at ease, which might make the pain more bearable at least. If you have more questions, let me know. (My comment above was written somewhat superficially in an attempt to quell my tendency to write book-sized comments. Not entirely successfully :)  But can give more details if you want.)",

    "body": "Just to offer some hope to anyone considering Finasteride - this is my 4-month progress. I also started dermastamping 1x/week, but I attribute most of my success to Fin. \n\nBackground: I was diagnosed with CTE, with excessive diffuse shedding that started in 2019. Although doctors insisted it wasn‚Äôt AGA, I suspected hormones were at play, as hair loss runs in my family. I also had previous success with inositol and pumpkin seed oil, however after about a year, they stopped working. All my hormone levels are within range, with some androgens on the higher end of normal. Basically I think I am just hyper sensitive to androgens/DHT.\n\nFin experience: Within 3 weeks of starting Fin, my shedding decreased drastically. I had NO dread shed. I noticed maybe a few more tiny hairs coming out in the shower, but the overall hair loss decreased by at least 50-60%. I have had no side effects on 2.5mg. It‚Äôs fantastic. \n\nI know it‚Äôs still early days, but I wanted to share. AGA vs. CTE diagnoses are not always clear-cut. Just because you don‚Äôt have typical pattern hair loss doesn‚Äôt mean you that you won‚Äôt benefit from certain treatments.",

I was really against doing oral minox bc I already struggle with hair growth on my body from PCOS. Here‚Äôs what worked for me: \n\nGENERAL CARE: \n1. Started washing my hair everyday, or like 5/7 days of the week. 2 days of those I wash with ketaconozole shampoo first and a nourishing shampoo after. \n\n2. NO PONYTAILS EVER.  Literally haven‚Äôt worn my hair in a rubber band or elastic or even a scrunchie since July with the exception of once. I twist and clip up my hair in a claw clip only. \n\n 3. Spraying my scalp with a water based spray that has scalp health ingredients. Some I‚Äôve used: bumble and bumble tonic, As I Am‚Äôs Rosemary Water (Target) \n\n4. At the instruction of my derm: literally blow dry my roots 100% of the time after I shower. I have a Dyson and I use the brush smoothing attachment on medium heat setting and focus on my scalp. My hair gets way less oily less quickly and DHT lives in scalp oil, so‚Ä¶\n\n5. I always use heat protection on my hair first, I‚Äôve finally found one that strengthens my hair too and doesn‚Äôt weigh it down- the Oribe strengthening serum (yellow bottle) \n\n6. I never bush my hair when wet, wide tooth combs only.  Also switched out to a boar bristle brush. \n\n7. Only use hot tools on my hair like once a week max, and I exclusively use my Dyson air wrap bc I can really control how much heat I‚Äôm using (and the cooling button is great)\n\n8. Stopped the dry shampoo. This was hard to imagine but my scalp is so much healthier without it, and I was using the ‚Äúclean‚Äù ones!\n\n9. Shampoo and conditioners: iles formula (both shampoo and conditioner) and oribe strengthening line (shampoo and conditioner and mask and serum) and olaplex no. 3 once a week, and the redken acid bonding leave in treatment like once every two weeks has been great on my hair. \n\nTREATMENTS: \n1. Ketaconozole shampoo twice a week, leave on for 15 minutes after focusing on your scalp, shampoo out. \n\n2. Topical minox at 5% at night.  I‚Äôve  been using the one from Costco and it works but the formula sucks. I recently switched to the one from curology and I like it a lot more- plus it has other effective ingredients in it \n\n3. Dermarolling after the topical minoxidil. I use a .25 dermaroller, sterilize it with alcohol first, then derma roll my scalp to stimulate blood flow \n\n4. Stem cell 3% scalp treatment by act & acre- this shit is expensive but I really noticed a difference when I began using it and unfortunately I will be buying my third bottle soon. \n\n5. Supplements: Pumpkin seed oil, high quality omega 3‚Äôs, ovasitol \n\n\nThings I‚Äôm going to try next: at home microneedling once a week. \n\n\nWill post some photos later once I have enough reception to upload them! \n\n",

    "body": "I was recommended this sub so I thought I‚Äôd reshare my progress in hopes of giving others hope.\n\nPic 1- bald patch before supplements and 2 months after\nPic 2- edges before supplements and 2 months after\nPic 3- shedding on most of my wash days between July 2024 and July 2025\n\nOver the past year I have been experienced increasing and unusual amounts of shedding. It got so bad that my hair line was noticeably thinner and I lost over 50% density in my hair. However, my hair is butt length so while others may not easily notice, I was crying every week on wash day as clumps and clumps of hair came out, wondering if this was ever gonna stop. I can say that stress is definitely a major factor for me as I started to work in a toxic, high stress environment back in March 2024. I don‚Äôt expect this to change anytime soon so ultimately I have been feeling helpless.\n\nAfter weeks of research, complaining and crying, I finally visited the derm on March 28, 2025. She said that I have alopecia areata (bald patch) and my severe shedding was telogen effluvium. She recommended PRP plus stem cells every 4-6 weeks for 3 sessions total as well as minoxidil 5% twice per day. In my country, each PRP session would essentially have cost me $750 USD which did not sit well with me.\n\nAt the office the doctor gave me a TAC injection (corticosteroid) at the site of the bald patch and ordered the following labs (FT3, FT4, TSH, CBC). This was very concerning to me as I asked her about testing my Vit D and Magnesium among a few others and she said ‚Äúyou look healthy, you don‚Äôt need that‚Äù. At this point I just wanted to get out of there because wtf do you mean I LOOK healthy???\n\nNeedless to say that I was extremely disappointed in the Dermatologist‚Äôs approach to my issue. I felt as though she saw that I had long hair and she dismissed my feelings and issues as somewhat frivolous. I also felt like she was really pushy with trying to sell me on doing the PRP sessions which annoyed me.\n\nDissatisfied with that visit, I turned to a friend who is also a doctor and asked her to write me a referral to get some blood work done. I knew exactly which tests I wanted as I had done extensive research and I was not about to do the PRP before I get sufficient blood work done. \n\nI got the blood tests done on March 29, 2025. (For those who want to know what I requested and the specific results, I can share if it will help you.) I received the results on April 2, 2025.\nI also bought the minoxidil April 6, 2025. \n\nLo and behold, I was deficient in some areas and others were simply suboptimal for hair health and hair growth. I cannot stress this enough. Just because you are not deficient in a vitamin or mineral does NOT mean that you are in the optimal range for hair health/ hair growth. Please do your research!!!! Please ask questions!!!\n\nRESULTS:\nI started taking the following supplement stack from May 12, 2025. I have included pics of my progress. Please note I was having 2 issues: extreme shedding all the time and a bald patch.\n\nAM stack\n- Vitamin D3 + K2 (10,000 IU D3 + 100‚Äì200 mcg K2 for the first 3 mths then will switch to 5,000 IU D3 + 100mcg K2)\n- Omega-3 Fish Oil (2,000 mg (EPA + DHA))\n- Pumpkin seed oil (2000mg)\n\nNoon stack (in my daily smoothies)\n- Collagen Peptides 10 g\n- MSM 3g\n\nPM stack\n- Magnesium Glycinate 400mg\n- Ashwagandha 800mg\n\nMy shedding is not gone but has improved. I am no longer shedding outside the shower. I can run my fingers through my hair and there is no hair coming out. Hair only comes out during detangling now.\nMy hair growth, however, has been through the roof. My edges have grown in so much. My bald patch is covered. My hair density is improving. I am over the moon with my results. It‚Äôs only been 2 months and I have not actually started the minoxidil (only took it for like a few days off and on within the first 2 weeks of receiving it).\n\nYES, I have hair growth in other areas such as arms, legs, face but that does not bother me as much as my hair loss bothered me.  It may not be noticeable to others though, just me.\n\n",

I started using minoxidil to help me grow a beard and thicken my eye brow so I can finally shave my head but I noticed it was indirectly changing my hairline. [ Finally settled with the usual 1ml of minoxidil twice daily (for my beard and eyebrow only), 1.25mg of Finasteride everyday (I also do a 1week break every month), dermaroll (1mm) once a week and do regular scalp Massages.

    "body": " Hi all, Today I will share with you some of the best natural and effective things that you can for hair loss. I did face a lot of hair loss and I did manage to reverse my condition to a large extent.\n\nNow let me first tell a bit about the FDA approved medicines for hair loss which are minoxidil and finasteride. These medicines do work but comes with a number of side effects for many people, so I generally advise people to stay clear of these medicines and only use them as a last resort option.\n\nTo better understand the best treatment for hair loss one must first understand the common reasons behind it which are genetic, nutritional, stress, medication or excessive styling related in most cases. Genetic and hereditary hair loss may be difficult to treat but other types of hair loss can easily be taken care of by paying attention to diet, reducing stress and applying less problem causing agents to the scalp.\n\nNow let me tell you the natural things that I used to regrow my hair after doing all the things that I mentioned above.\n\nPumpkin seed oil - This is the first product natural product I would recommend to any male or female who is suffereing from hair loss. Pumpkin seed oil contains phytosterols which could block enzymes and hormones in your scalp that cause hair loss. There are studies that taking pumpkin seed oil as an oral supplement caused 40 more hair growth in people than the placebo group. But i still decided to use it in topical form since I also read a mice study which says that it works well in topical form too. Take 5‚Äì6 drop and mix it with the other oil that I will mention and massage it at night.\n\nPeppermint oil - This is an absolute favourite product of mine and I would like to say use it with caution and always dilute it before using as it is very powerful. I started using this product based on a rat study in which rats were divided into 4 gropus and one group were applied saline water, one group was applied jojoba oil, one was applied minoxidil ans the last were applied peppermint oil. All the rats were examined after 4 weeks and in this study it was noted that peppermint oil group rats showed comparable or even better results than the minoxidil group rats. Now many people may not like the fragrance of pumpkin seed oil and by mixing it with peppermint there is only the fragrance of menthol that remains and it cools the head like no other.\n\nGood DHT controlling shampoo - There are many good DHT controlling shampoos in the market. I would suggest you to look for ingredients like saw palmetto, nettle leaf extract as they are natural DHT blockers.\n\nMoringa - Moringa is a nutritional powerhouse which has a ton of health benefits including protecting and nourishing skin and hair. It is said to contain a whooping 92 nutrients and 46 antioxidants which beside being good for hair also contributes towards heart health, bone health, high blood pressure, stomach problems etc. But people with low blood pressure should avoid this as this has the potential to lower the bp further. You can buy himalaya shigru tablets they contain moringa or use organic india moringa leaf powder or any other which you may find helpful.\n\nI hope it helps someone.",

    "body": "\nFirst photo is from September, second photo is from today. \n\nLongtime lurker, first time poster in this sub. \n\nSharing the full background on my story with hair loss for context. It‚Äôs a lot, but it has been a nearly 5 year long battle with many ups and downs. \n\nI first noticed heavier than usual shedding about 3-4 months after I had my son in March of 2020 (what a time!!!‚Ä¶). I quickly  learned that this was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and seemingly recovered with no extra effort after a couple of months. Most of the loss was in my temple area.\n\nI didn‚Äôt think much about my hair again until April of 2022, when I noticed a lot more hair coming out in the shower than usual. I thought maybe it was triggered by switching to a drugstore shampoo, because I felt like other potential culprits I had faced (illness, starting and then leaving a stressful job, stopping breastfeeding) had all happened way before then to make a difference. The loss was diffuse this time rather than located primarily around my temples. I first became aware of my widening part when photos were taken of me outside in the summer sun in July of that year and was completely mortified.\n\nIt was around this time that I also noticed brain fog, trouble sleeping, horrible and inconsistent periods, and a host of other symptoms that were abnormal for me. I got hormone, thyroid and other lab testing done with very few answers from multiple doctors, other than low progesterone and estrogen. I tried lots of ‚Äúnatural‚Äù products to treat the hair loss: shampoos, serums and a basic hair skin and nail vitamin hoping these things would help. However, I kept having on and off again bouts of shedding. I had recently become a stay at home mom during this time and thought maybe the combination of my hormones and the stress of being home with my spirited COVID toddler full-time had led to more hair loss, but still had no concrete answers or solutions. To make matters worse, I experienced an early miscarriage/chemical pregnancy in November of 2022 and shedding again in March of 2023.\n\nIt was at this time I sought help from a dietitian and made other lifestyle changes to help with my hormone issues, but even with those improvements, it felt like I was taking two steps forward only to take many more back with my hair. I physically felt better, but my hair seemed to shed at what felt like the drop of a hat and became SO sensitive to any changes in routine, stress or health.\n\nI have seen two dermatologists: one diagnosed it as telogen effluvium, the other never actually gave me a diagnosis but prescribed me oral spironolactone and a topical compound with minoxidil, spironolactone and tretinoin (consistent with AGA treatment). I was hesitant to try these remedies due to the uncertainty of wanting another child, and even if we didn‚Äôt want more children, I had worked so hard to get my menstrual cycle back on track that I didn‚Äôt want to ruin that with the possible period-related side effects of spironolactone.\n\nI went the ‚Äúnatural‚Äù route again in 2023 and tried a variety of rosemary-based products along with Nutrafol. I was consistent with Nutrafol for about 6 months and felt like it might have been working before my dietitian informed me that it was not safe for women who may become pregnant, so I stopped taking it but continued to stick with my natural product regimen. \n\nThis seemed to work well and I was making notable progress, until I had yet another bout of shedding in August of 2024. I came down with some horrible illness in May (not COVID), which is also when my grandmother passed away. I got sick again 2 weeks later and then got COVID in June. All of my progress was gone.\n\nI was at my wits end and remember just sobbing in my car in early September, ready to throw the kitchen sink at my hair before it got any worse. While I still wasn‚Äôt ready to try the oral spiro from my derm, I decided I wanted to give the topical RX a try. I also decided to incorporate Nutrafol again along with consistently using the iRestore helmet I had purchased back in June (every other day), ketoconozole shampoo 3-4 times a week, Lia rosemary water spray daily, pur a dor hair serum daily, and derma roll my scalp 2x a week. I also added in vitamin D, iron, omega 3, magnesium, and pumpkin seed oil supplements as well. \n\nI was already shedding at the time I started this protocol, so I can‚Äôt really say if I noticed a ‚Äúdread shed‚Äù - which was kind of nice honestly, because I was always so fearful of that. I figured: my hair is already falling out anyway, it‚Äôs the perfect time to start something with minoxidil. However, I believe the tretinoin in the RX made my scalp itch and flake like CRAZY, so I stopped using it after about a month and a half and replaced it with with Target brand topical minoxidil foam 5%: thankfully, the itching/flakiness stopped. \n\nI have maintained this routine for 3 months, and my shedding stopped about 6 weeks in. Only difference now is that I am down to just 1-2 Nutrafol pills a day instead of the recommended dose of 4 due to some potential impacts on liver enzymes and blood sugar: I might stop it again altogether once I run out of what I have, but I plan to keep everything else. \n\nI was starting to lose hope until I took this photo today. I look in the mirror and still just see so much scalp, especially the sides/back of my head. But this progress is giving me hope. Praying I will be back here in 3 more months with even better results. \n\nI‚Äôm sure the minoxidil is the thing doing most of the heavy lifting, but I‚Äôm willing to continue doing all of it as long as I‚Äôm seeing a difference. Eventually I will probably start removing things one by one to see what has the biggest impact and scrapping anything that isn‚Äôt worth it. But for now, I‚Äôm doing it all and hoping I can maintain some of what has grown back this time, though I do not ever expect to return to the density I had pre-baby.\n\nI also cut 5 inches off today and I feel like it already has made my hair look fuller, healthier and less stringy than it did when it was long. I think I didn‚Äôt want to let go of the length thinking it was a sign that the hair I had left was at least healthy, but all it was really doing was just highlighting the thinness. \n\nThanks to everyone in this sub for encouraging one another and being brave enough to share your stories. It‚Äôs not easy. Sending happy hair vibes to you all. ü´∂ü´∂ü´∂",

It got so bad that my hair line was noticeably thinner and I lost over 50% density in my hair. However, my hair is butt length so while others may not easily notice, I was crying every week on wash day as clumps and clumps of hair came out, wondering if this was ever gonna stop. I can say that stress is definitely a major factor for me as I started to work in a toxic, high stress environment back in March 2024. I don‚Äôt expect this to change anytime soon so ultimately I have been feeling helpless.\n\nAfter weeks of research, complaining and crying, I finally visited the derm on March 28, 2025. She said that I have alopecia areata (bald patch) and my severe shedding was telogen effluvium. She recommended PRP plus stem cells every 4-6 weeks for 3 sessions total as well as minoxidil 5% twice per day. In my country, each PRP session would essentially have cost me $750 USD which did not sit well with me.\n\nAt the office the doctor gave me a TAC injection (corticosteroid) at the site of the bald patch and ordered the following labs (FT3, FT4, TSH, CBC). This was very concerning to me as I asked her about testing my Vit D and Magnesium among a few others and she said ‚Äúyou look healthy, you don‚Äôt need that‚Äù. At this point I just wanted to get out of there because wtf do you mean I LOOK healthy???\n\nNeedless to say that I was extremely disappointed in the Dermatologist‚Äôs approach to my issue. I felt as though she saw that I had long hair and she dismissed my feelings and issues as somewhat frivolous. I also felt like she was really pushy with trying to sell me on doing the PRP sessions which annoyed me.\n\nDissatisfied with that visit, I turned to a friend who is also a doctor and asked her to write me a referral to get some blood work done. I knew exactly which tests I wanted as I had done extensive research and I was not about to do the PRP before I get sufficient blood work done. \n\nI got the blood tests done on March 29, 2025. (For those who want to know what I requested and the specific results, I can share if it will help you.) I received the results on April 2, 2025.\nI also bought the minoxidil April 6, 2025. \n\nLo and behold, I was deficient in some areas and others were simply suboptimal for hair health and hair growth. I cannot stress this enough. Just because you are not deficient in a vitamin or mineral does NOT mean that you are in the optimal range for hair health/ hair growth. Please do your research!!!! Please ask questions!!!\n\nRESULTS:\nI started taking the following supplement stack from May 12, 2025. I have included pics of my progress. Please note I was having 2 issues: extreme shedding all the time and a bald patch.\n\nAM stack\n- Vitamin D3 + K2 (10,000 IU D3 + 100‚Äì200 mcg K2 for the first 3 mths then will switch to 5,000 IU D3 + 100mcg K2)\n- Omega-3 Fish Oil (2,000 mg (EPA + DHA))\n- Pumpkin seed oil (2000mg)\n\nNoon stack (in my daily smoothies)\n- Collagen Peptides 10 g\n- MSM 3g\n\nPM stack\n- Magnesium Glycinate 400mg\n- Ashwagandha 800mg\n\nMy shedding is not gone but has improved. I am no longer shedding outside the shower. I can run my fingers through my hair and there is no hair coming out. Hair only comes out during detangling now.\nMy hair growth, however, has been through the roof. My edges have grown in so much. My bald patch is covered. My hair density is improving. I am over the moon with my results. It‚Äôs only been 2 months and I have not actually started the minoxidil (only took it for like a few days off and on within the first 2 weeks of receiving it).\n\nYES, I have hair growth in other areas such as arms, legs, face but that does not bother me as much as my hair loss bothered me.  It may not be noticeable to others though, just me.\n\n",

Since it‚Äôs done wonderful things for me I want to share the magic lol . Not-sponsored and not trying to sell-you my specific one lol. \n\n-Oils names + brand -  \n(all got from Amazon) \n\n* Black seed oil -  HBNO 4oz\n\n* Pumpkin seed oil - cliganic 4oz\n\n* Amla oil - Velona 4oz\n\n* Grape seed oil - now solutions 16oz\n\n* Avocado oil - Hand craft blends 16oz \n\n* Eucalyptus essential oil - cliganic 0.34oz \n10ml \n\n(Doesnt need to be the same brand but this is what I use)‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n*Remember to shake blend before use!\n* try to use a amber or dark tinted dropper bottle or make sure it‚Äôs not in direct sunlight.\n\n‚ÄîDETAILED Benefits of each of those oils-\n( always do a patch text before using a new product or oil! Regardless) \n\nBlack seed oil : \n1. Antimicrobial, Anti-fungal, Can help combat scalp infections or dandruff. It can help reduce information which may be helpful for people who have psoriasis or eczema. Rich in fatty acids which is especially good for curly hair & or porous hair . There is some information suggesting it can help strengthen the roots and follicles, so it may aid in helping prevent or reducing hair loss and promote/stimulate hair growth.\n2. Black Seed oil can be used directly, but if you‚Äôre using it for the first time or have very sensitive skin make sure you properly dilute and use less drops.\n\nPumpkin seed oil :\n1. Rich in Nutrients: Pumpkin seed oil is packed with vitamins (A, E, K), minerals (zinc, magnesium), essential fatty acids (omega-3 & omega-6). These nourish the scalp + hair follicles, promoting overall scalp health.\n2. May Promote  Growth: Pumpkin seed oil contains phytosterols, which may help block the action of DHT (dihydrotestosterone), a hormone linked to hair loss. By reducing DHT levels, pumpkin seed oil can help promote hair growth and reduce hair thinning.\n3. Pumpkin seed oil has anti-inflammatory properties that can soothe an irritated or inflamed scalp, which is beneficial for conditions like dandruff, eczema, or psoriasis.\n4. antioxidants in pumpkin seed oil, such as vitamin E, help aid in protecting the scalp and hair from damage caused by free radicals.\n5. The zinc in pumpkin seed oil helps maintain a healthy scalp by regulating oil production and reducing the risk of scalp infections.\n6. The nutrients in pumpkin seed oil may help strengthen strands.thus, reducing breakage,split ends, and making the hair more resilient.\n7. Consistent use of pumpkin seed oil can add a nice natural shine to your hair, making it look healthier and more vibrant.\n8. Pumpkin seed oil is generally considered a light and non-greasy oil making it suitable for multiple hair types, including those with oily scalps.\n\nGrape seed  oil :\n1. Grapeseed oil is considered to be lightweight and easily absorbed, makes an excellent moisturizer for the scalp.helps to lock in moisture and prevent dryness\n2. Grapeseed oil is packed with  vitamin E, omega-6 fatty acids, +  antioxidants. These help nourish the scalp and hair follicles, promoting scalp health.\n3. anti-inflammatory properties. grapeseed oil can help soothe an irritated or inflamed scalp, which can be beneficial for conditions like dandruff, eczema, or psoriasis.\n4. Grapeseed oil has antimicrobial properties aswell . This can help prevent and aid in treating scalp infections.\n5. The nutrients in grapeseed oil, particularly vitamin E and linoleic acid, can help strengthen hair follicles thus aid in stimulating/promoting hair growth \n6. The fatty acids in grapeseed oil helps to strengthen & smooth the hair shaft, reducing breakage\n7. Non-Comedogenic. meaning it won't clog pores .This makes it a great option for those with sensitive or acne-prone skin on the scalp.\n\nAvocado oil \n1. It contains vitamins A, D, and E, as well as proteins and minerals that nourish the scalp and hair follicles, promoting overall scalp health.\n2. Anti-inflammatory properties \n3. Can Promote Hair Growth \n4. Antioxidant Properties: \n\nAmla oil \n1. Amla oil comes from Indian gooseberry its packed with wonderful nutrients like vitamin C, antioxidants, flavonoids, and polyphenols. These are excellent in nourishing the scalp and hair follicles.\n2. Amla oil can also help stimulate hair growth by enhancing blood circulation to the scalp. The vit C in Amla helps aid in collagen production, which in return may helps strengthen the roots.\n3. The antioxidants and nutrients in Amla also help in reducing hair fall and breakage. It‚Äôs also thought to help prevent/delay premature graying.\n4. Amla oil provides excellent Moisture. helps to maintain scalp hydration especially after wash day. It‚Äôs also known to help fight against dryness and flakiness. Amla tends to be pretty beneficial for people with dry/itchy scalps.\n5. Amla oil is anti-inflammatory so that can soothe an irritated or inflamed scalp.\n6. Scalp health.Regular use of Amla oil helps maintain a healthy scalp by reducing dandruff and other scalp infections.its antimicrobial properties help the scalp feel clean.\n\nEucalyptus oil (must be diluted) \n1. Antimicrobial\n2. Anti-inflammatory Effects: It can help soothe inflammation,itchiness and irritation on the scalp, making it beneficial for conditions like seborrheic dermatitis or psoriasis.\n3. Stimulates blood Circulation.Eucalyptus oil can stimulate blood flow to the scalp, which may promote healthier hair growth.\n4. Cooling Sensation.menthol in eucalyptus oil provides a cooling sensation that can relieve itching and discomfort. (Don‚Äôt use if you‚Äôre sensitive to cooling products or make sure you use a very tiny amount )\n5. Cleansing.It helps to cleanse the scalp by removing buildup,excess oil, helps to keep the scalp fresh \n6. To use eucalyptus oil safely, dilute it with a carrier oil!!! I don‚Äôt recommend sleeping with it with a double layered bonnet it can spread on the pillow case and make your eyes water kind of like peppermint oil .\n\n\nAdvice ‚Äî feel free to select the ones you think are most beneficial I recommend starting with 2 or three if you want to start trying a hair oil blend. So that way you can tell the difference and better perceive how the individual oils are working for you. And if you want to add one,change the amount depending on your goals it‚Äôll be easier to alter if you incorporate them slower etc. ) \n\n**Very very optional - sometimes I add anywhere from 1-4 sprays of sugar milk co‚Äôs birthday cake oil perfume to make it smell good . If I change my mind on how fragranced I want it  I‚Äôll add more oil with my main desired benefits to dilute it. If im using it just on the scalp I‚Äôll only do 0-1 sprays inside the bottle.if im using the batch on my mids to ends I like adding a a few sprays of oil perfume in the bottle but I also do it without sometimes\n\nI use all of these in my oil blend . Has done wonders for my high porosity hair and doesn‚Äôt aggravate my sebborheic dermatitis. i rlly feel it also helped my density in the front of my head also smells great if you add a oil perfume to it. I oil my scalp 2x a week and I oil my mids to ends esp on wash day after products are applied while hair is still wet. I also use it to add some smoothness and shine to my hair through out the week and also can work as a hair perfume if you add oil perfume . It creates a nice protective layer.\n\n‚ÄîAlso just a reminder that what works for me may not work for you but I think it‚Äôs a really good blends and it‚Äôs very customizable‚Äî- \nI hope someone took the time to read all this lol ü•≤‚ù§Ô∏èüíï \nAny questions lmk !",

The things that stood out to me most that make me want to try this is that it didn't irritate your seb derm, which is hard to not do and I have a very sensitive scalp with oils and am curious about switching from olive lately, and I like that a lot of these are anti microbial, anti inflammatory and some block DHT. Thanks for making such a high effort post. I don't believe in hair growth oils but this seems like it could help with scalp health and just protecting strands without irritating my skin. It gave me something to think about and a reason to keep my mind open to something different. Pretty cool beans, thank you. üê∂\n\nAlso you have obviously fantastic hair!",

Thank you for being you, and for taking time out of your busy college life to be here.\n\n**I have a few questions.** I oil my scalp, but I usually feel like it's not doing anything (or worse, causing me to have increased hair fall). I'm hoping that clarifying the following with you will help me to improve my practice.\n\n**My hair profile:** high porosity, navel-length hair, coily / curly (3C/4A), dries out easily, shiny, thick strands, low density (I am recovering from a health issue, but have been experiencing a lot of shed hair as a result...edges are *very* sparse), currently in long-term mini twists (rarely left unravelled). \n\n**My routine**: heat up jojoba oil and JB castor oil, mix together, add rosemary or peppermint essential oil, massage into scalp (on entire head) with pads of fingers.\n\n**My questions** (please take your time...no rush to answer them <3)\n\n* What is your exact process for massaging the oil into your scalp (e.g, the parts of your fingers you use \\[I use the pads of mine\\], how long you spend on each part of your hair, what kind of massaging technique you use \\[skin over scalp? Or something else?\\]). I've started using a scalp massaging tool with thin bristles, but it hurts...not sure if it's working, sadly.\n* Do you warm the oil before using it?\n* How long do you spend massaging oil into each part of your scalp (back, mid, front, edges)? How many minutes?\n* What kind of amla oil do you use? I mix the gooseberry powder into warm jojoba oil and strain out the powder. Unfortunately, it leaves my scalp feeling itchy, but I'm not aware of any other amla oils that do not contain mineral oil (which I understand isn't the best for hair / scalp health)\n* Do you spray your scalp with water before oiling?\n* Is my understanding of oils correct?\n   * Avocado, coconut = penetrating oils = better for strands?\n   * jojoba, castor, grapeseed = sealing oils = better for scalp?\n* I wear my waist-length mini twists for 4+ weeks or more, so I'm not frequently washing. How would you recommend developing an oiling practice while minimizing build up?\n* I've stopped using pumpkin seed oil because it tends to cause acne when it leaks from my bonnet on to my pillow. How do you balance the butters and oils our hair loves and skincare?\n* And finally, how does your treatment of roots vs mid-strands vs tips differ?\n\nThank you so much, Veah <3 Bless you.",

    "body": "In 2021 I was a 19yo with great hair, I used to see people my age with worse hair than me and think \"wow, i'm so thankful I'm not balding like that guy\". Then 2022 hit. Hairloss and karma hit me very very hard. My dad who's 50 literally had more hair than me.\n\n I tried to cope with it, even buzzed my head clean at one point, but I just could not do it. After tens of hours of watching MPMD, I decided to take Min. I did not want to go near Fin after reading all the stories that went like \"I got on fin and my d*ck fell off, my wife left me and i got fired\" type stuff. So i ordered saw palmetto, pumpkin seed oil, a 1mm derma roller and Min foam. All went great as you can see, i got my hair back fully(i think it was even thicker than before) using those only. \n\nMy happines was short lived, as in that Fall i started noticing that my hair was starting to slowly fall again. I thought \"f*ck it im not taking this shit anymore, I'll just ride it out until I go bald at 30\" . Very very bad decision at the time.\n\nThe min/saw palmetto/pumpkin oil/dermaroll gains lasted about until january and I thought I was all clear. But march came, and oh man, I was feeling like my hair was falling by the day. It started aggresively falling again, more so than before. I buzzed my hair once again on a whim and saw how dire the situation was. I tried to cope and started immediately googling SMP(scalp micro needling) clinics near me and messaged them. They came back to me with quotes that were like 1200$. I'm a broke uni student so no way I'm paying that for some dots on my head(also I've been a gym bro for 7 1/2 years so a month down time from the gym for recovery was no way in h*ll for me). So I decided to give my hair one last try. I went full panic mode, ordered some more Min, a derma stamp, ketoconazole shampoo, and finally got a prescription for oral Fin. Started with Propecia 1mg, all fine for the first month but was costly. \n\nSo for the second month I got a prescription for Proscar 5mg and tried cutting it into 5. It was all good for about 2-3 weeks, but recently I started getting sides (ED-related). I'm sexually active since I was 16 and had sex at least 3 times a week since then. My erections and libido were not what they used to be when I was 16, the novelty did wear off since then,  but I did notice a pretty drastic change since starting proscar. Trust me, it's not placebo and I also don‚Äôt jerk off so it isnt caused by over-stimulation either. I will cut back to 1.25mg thrice a week starting tomorrow and post an update in the coming months.\n\nMy total test was 800ng before starting(I'm natty) and my diet is very good for the most part. My sleep is not that great(of course, I'm majoring in Engineering) but that can‚Äôt be the cause for the issue since I never had a great sleeping schedule. I also have a very active lifestyle, get a lot of sun(vit D), drink a lot of water, eat healthy, etc. etc. Proscar is literally the only thing that can cause it. I will not stop it though because I'm terrified of losing my hair, I invest really much into my appearance so being bald at 22 really f*cks me up. The sides could also be caused by my sh*tty cutting skills, as it is really hard to perfectly split the pill in 5.  So uneven dosing of the pill.\n\nOn the upside, my hair growing results are really good as I'm closing on my 3rd month since starting the treatment. Fin seemed to clear up my acne too, I rarely get it nowadays(I used to get it often on my forehead before starting). I could only imagine where I would've been had I not stopped last Fall. But I'm so glad I did since it gave me a really big shock and all the motivation I need to never quit the protocol again. EVER.\n\nAt the moment I alternate between Min foam and solution 2x/day , ~1mg fin/day, 1mm dermastamp/week(I use 1.5mm for the hairline), ketoconazole once every other day. Will cut fin to 1.25mg/3 times per week.\n\nThe great results I got are because I'm a great responder to Min and my hair thinning pattern is  the best for starting a regrowing protocol, IMO(diffuse thinning).\n\nIf any young guy is reading this, and debating wheter to start min/fin, I advise you to do it. The world is cruel man, I swear everyday I would get funny looks and comments. I've always been the attractive guy, and the dude everyone looked up to for being fit and having that big of a flaw right in the open really f*ucks with your head at this age. I swear once everybody saw one weakness in me they all went for it with the balding trash talk, even 70yo teachers at Uni. If you‚Äôre 30+, it's not that bad, as a large percentage of men that age are already NW 4+ so you don‚Äôt get as many looks. But do yourself a favor and start it now, not later. Don't do the mistake I did, because I lost a lot of potential progress post-poning it like that. \n\nAlways try to do your best and leave nothing on the table, whether it is the hair protocol, going to the gym, studying, your relationships, whatever. Always strive to be better and to improve, never settle. In this world full of copers, effort and dedication goes a long way. Starting is the most difficult part. Once you take action, everything falls into place. Your 2035 future-self will thank you. When all your friends are fat, unhealthy and bald, and you'll look as good as ever, pull chicks as hot as you did in your 20s and you will be so glad you stuck to the grind. \n\nTalk to someone about your struggles. It ate me up inside for over 2yrs before I opened to my mom about it and she totally understood and supported me. Having someone like that really helps. It can be a friend or someone close to you.\n\nAlso thanks to MPMD and Haircafe, we owe these guys the world for their time and effort. Dont listen one bit to the copers like Baldcafe because he almost convinced me at one point that it is okay to let yourself go. IT IS NOT!!!!!! \n\nIf this post gets interest, I will respond to any questions and update in the future. Thanks for reading and stay strong guys, life always beats us up in one way or another, it's okay to be down sometimes, but it's not okay to stay there and not get back up.\n\nTL;DR : Aggressive balding at 20, got on min, got great results, quit. Bald again, way worse than before, started a much more aggressive protocol and got sides. Great results again, trying to clear sides going forward.",

Self confidence and esteem came crashing down as I used to be a super confident extrovert and started getting the piss taken out of me by all of my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù of all my childhood which didn‚Äôt help so I basically just started questioning everything in life thinking everything was just against me and just didn‚Äôt really want to live and just wanted to disappear to be honest especially as it was such a young age, been feeling better recently (past couple months) and started minox at around February/march 2023 and saw decent gains in terms of volume and just made it appear better just less visible than it was to be honest and had hope that it would just magically restore everything after paying ¬£300 to a scammy private dermatologist that told me so üòÇ. Density of my hair is definitely better than it‚Äôs peak thinness around a year and a half ago but have been experiencing more thinning on the crown area and just general no volume - as in individual hairs are thicker and appear better but less actual hair if that makes sense?

    "body": "Hey everyone ‚Äî I‚Äôve been documenting my hair journey since I was 22 (back in 2015) when I first started oral finasteride and topical minoxidil. It‚Äôs been 10 years now, and I wanted to share progress photos of the top of my head, middle part, and temples. For more context, my hair has been thinning since 17 years old and I'm now 32.\n\nEach image is labeled with the year and my treatment regimen at the time. I'm posting this to:\n\n* Show what my journey has looked like over the decade¬†\n* Reflect on what treatments have helped (or haven‚Äôt)¬†\n* Get feedback and advice from the community¬†\n\n**A couple questions I‚Äôd love your input on:**\n\n1. How does my hair look year-over-year ‚Äî especially 2025 compared to earlier years? Do you notice any gains, losses, or general stability?¬†\n2. Is there anything else I could try to improve growth or reduce shedding?¬†\n   * I've been shedding more than usual this past year, and it‚Äôs starting to worry me.¬†\n\n**Current Treatments**\n\n* **1mg Oral Finasteride (Daily)**¬†Been on this since 2015. I feel like this has been the most important treatment in my routine.¬†\n* **2.5mg Oral Minoxidil (Daily)**¬†Started with 0.625mg in 2022 due to concerns about blood pressure.¬†\n   * Gradually increased to 1.25mg, then to 2.5mg (since Nov 2024, per dermatologist recommendation).¬†\n   * I‚Äôm not sure I see a big difference in scalp hair, but I‚Äôve noticed darker, faster-growing hair all over my body such as with my mustache, eyebrows, and legs.¬†\n* **Topical Minoxidil (Rogaine) ‚Äì 1x/day**¬†I‚Äôve used this consistently for 10 years (usually 2x/day).¬†\n   * Recently dropped to 1x/day after my dermatologist said it might be redundant with oral min. I haven‚Äôt fully stopped because I want to monitor any changes before quitting completely.¬†\n* **LLLT ‚Äì Every Other Day**¬†I started using my Therabody red/infrared light mask (meant for acne) on my scalp for 10 minutes every other day.¬†\n   * Unsure if it‚Äôs helping, but figured I might as well try since I already have it.¬†\n* **Ketoconazole**¬†**- 2-3x/week**¬†I've used this on and off through the years. I don't know if it makes a difference through the years I've used it, but I started using it again this year because it's low effort.¬†\n\n**Treatments I Tried and Stopped**\n\n* **0.5mg Oral Dutasteride**¬†Took this for 6 months in 2018. Didn‚Äôt see a difference from finasteride and didn‚Äôt think it was worth continuing. Not sure about now though if I'll have different effects with my hair.¬†\n   * For what it‚Äôs worth, I never experienced any negative side effects from either dutasteride or finasteride.¬†\n* **Supplements (Pumpkin Seed Oil, Nettles, Shark Cartilage, Biotin, etc.)**¬†Took these for years but didn‚Äôt notice any major improvements.¬†\n* **Microneedling**¬†Tried this inconsistently from 2018‚Äì2021.¬†\n   * Couldn‚Äôt keep up the routine, and the post-needling itchiness lasted for days. The effort just didn‚Äôt feel worth the payoff.¬†\n\n**Lifestyle**\n\n* I eat healthy, exercise regularly like swim, and lift weights 3‚Äì4x/week.¬†\n   * I take whey protein/weight gainer, but avoid creatine due to concerns about DHT.¬†¬†\n* I try to manage stress through working out and getting enough sleep (8 hours a night + occasional naps).¬†\n* Overall, I‚Äôd say I live a health-conscious lifestyle ‚Äî which I know many of us here relate to.¬†\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts! Happy to answer any questions, too. Let‚Äôs keep fighting the good fight. üí™üë¥üß¨",

I started Topical Minoxidil on April 27 2024 along with Nizoral shampoo and honestly noticed no results for about 4 months, if anything the whole time I was doing Topical Minoxidil it felt like more and more hair was coming out and like it had no plans to slow down. I ended up seeing a dermatologist because I wasn‚Äôt sure about hims/keeps and the price was a huge turn off. She immediately started me on 2.5mg of Minoxidil because I‚Äôm scared of trying finasteride with the side effects and I almost always have side effects if there are any with any and all medications so minoxidil seemed like a better choice. She also prescribed me 2% Ketoconazole shampoo, Clobetasol Propionate due to some itching I have, and a topical clindamycin topical ointment due to some really bad acne bumps/cysts I get every once in a while on my scalp. Almost immediately as I started all the medications/topical treatments all of my symptoms stopped. Like serious day 2 of treatment my hair loss significantly reduced, my itching was gone, and my acne bumps on my scalp calmed down and now I rarely get any! Proud to report that while I personally feel that I still have quite a bit of hair loss, these pics show me that I‚Äôve made progress. I know my hair being wet may seem like a factor but every picture is taken immediately after the shower with no towel dry to make sure the hair was in the same condition every time. Also, since I started Oral treatment of minoxidil I stopped Topical treatment that same day.\n\nI‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs worth noting but prior to this I had bought and tried several products for ‚Äúhair regrowth‚Äù like the popular rosemary oil, tried oiling my hair every other day at night with scalp massages and also started taking Pumpkin seed oil, Vitamin D, and a Vitamin B complex. Just thought I‚Äôd share that as well and I‚Äôm still taking the vitamins and pumpkin seed oil just in case they‚Äôre supporting my hair at all!",

Started 1.25 oral minoxidil October 15 2024 and then started topical 5% mens minoxidil once daily. I've used a derma roller and scalp stamper 1-2x monthly when possible. Started taking pumpkin seed oil, and a few other vitamins and supplements. Started working out more consistently and using nizoral when washing my hair. Derm also prescribed me topical mometasone furoate 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off for a year for some inflammation I had on my scalp from my job. It got worse before I noticed any growth. I've finally accepted it's just a part of growing older and possibly not taking care of myself for years. The longer you wait the worse it's going to get. The time is going to pass anyway so you might as well start working on a solution instead of hyper focusing on the problem. Remember it often took most of us years of slowly losing our hair so it will take years of consistency for a noticeable difference. I don't think my hair will be the same as it was but I've stopped the thinning and drastic shedding and I'm noticing growth. Derm said they typically throw the kitchen sink at hair loss such as this and often times the treat TE and AGA similarly. Always talk to a Derm. Once you start minoxidil you have to continue using it or you will start to lose your hair again. Keep minoxidil away from your animals. For all you women and young ladies worrying about how you look, be thankful for your able bodies and minds. I am single and don't have anyone to talk to about this. Everyone has told me that it's not as bad as I think it is. I am still too insecure to go out in public without a hat(even though people still comment about my appearance with the hat), but I'm hoping with consistent use of minoxidil and time, ill continue to see further hair restoration. Good luck all. ‚ù§Ô∏è ",

I legit thought follicles at my temple region are just dead and beyond revival at this point, just three months ago the area was completely indistinguishable from my forehead even up close. I just finished my second bottle of Rogaine yesterday (incidentally these two bottles lasted me almost 3 months), now I can see a patch of hairs lined up in what could be a nw1 hairline in the future (if they continue to grow), the fact that they're alive is just shocking to me. My highest hope was that they will barely come back to life by the end of this year, and was mentally prepared for the case that they will never come back.\n\nIn conjunction with rogaine I regularly used rosemary oil, pumpkin seed oil, saw palmetto (both orally and topically for each), microneedled only 4 times since March, and LLLT about every other day. No fin or niz although I'm adding niz soon. Still ways to go but I think it's a promising start.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rrbpgrx301y41.jpg?width=953&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dacef6e7c910bbe52b48d9d81ee640cb70e9331d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/coqtmp6fp0y41.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f7f357d05ddf1bc7ef9fb367534a280ee42078cc",

    "body": "Heya girls, just wanted to share my experience with shedding over the last 12 months and what I‚Äôm *tentatively* hoping is mine coming to an end ü§ûüèº\nI want to share because if you‚Äôre anything like me, you have a tendency to obsess over how much hair you‚Äôre losing & are constantly asking yourself whether it‚Äôs slowing down, more than your ‚Äònormal‚Äô, or a lot compared to others. \n\nBackground for me is I‚Äôve been excessively shedding for 1 year now out of nowhere. Saw a derm for the first time a few days ago and she suspects I‚Äôve had some form of TE that‚Äôs unmasked early AGA. 4 months ago I started topical minox 5%, a bunch of supplements (saw palmetto, reishi, pumpkin seed oil) and some dermarolling here & there. At its worse I estimate I was shedding around 200-300 hairs a day & around 400-500 washing every 4-5 days. The last few months it‚Äôs slowed down to around 100 hairs a day & 150-200 on wash days. \n\nThis whole time I‚Äôve been expending so much time & energy analysing not only my current hair fall but overthinking what‚Äôs my ‚Äònormal‚Äô.  I‚Äôve been constantly asking myself questions like - did I really lose so little in the past? Maybe I‚Äôve always lost this amount but I just never noticed? Apparently it‚Äôs *normal* to lose 100 hairs a day so what I‚Äôm shedding is somewhat normal right? I guess in a way I was trying to convince myself that what I was losing was okay for me, I think mainly as a coping mechanism. \n\nI really hope I don‚Äôt jinx it but last 3 weeks my shedding has drastically reduced. Of course there are hairs falling throughout the day that I don‚Äôt catch, but when I brush my hair once a day I lose about 10-15 hairs & then washing every 4ish days I‚Äôm losing about 50-60. This FINALLY feels like my normal. \n\nOf course everyone‚Äôs normal is different and I‚Äôm not trying to invoke a discussion on that, just trying to say - trust your gut girls! You know yourself best & what‚Äôs right by your standards. I‚Äôm stoked & I feel fortunate that I‚Äôm in a better place now with it all but dang I did myself dirty going around in circles with the guessing game. I assume my progress is most likely due to the minox (no major signs of regrowth yet, sigh) but hey, I‚Äôll take it! I hope this post encourages some of you to 1. Keep at your treatment & don‚Äôt give up hope & 2. Don‚Äôt spiral and obsess so much about what‚Äôs your ‚Äònormal‚Äô - you‚Äôll know when you get back to it. \n\nExcessive shedding is honestly so horrible & my heart is truely with all of you experiencing hair loss. Lots of love \n\n*I tried to keep pics semi consistent but been travelling this month so didn‚Äôt have my usual little reference bottle, car key is similar size \n",

I am going through the exact same process, asking myself if I am exaggerating or not, if I always lost as much hair like I do now but you are completely right, we should trust our intuition and perception, if something doesn‚Äôt feel right or feels off it mostly is. I also used this as a coping mechanism to not go crazy. My hair loss started 3,5 years ago, since 9 months I am experiencing excessive shedding and a reduction in density. I am desperate since no treatment so far seemed to work. But there‚Äôs still a tiny little hope that my shedding will at least slow down or stabilize a little at some point.

    "body": "I first started posting here about a year ago, when I noticed the beginning of a receding hairline.  I quickly learned everything I needed to know:\n\n-Finasteride is very effective at halting hairloss, but comes with a small but very real risk of permanent, life ruining side effects.  Finasteride didn't ruin my life, but I did experience some side effects which made it necessary for me to stop.\n\n-Minoxidil can be effective, especially in the short term.  But it's a hassle to apply, makes your scalp itch, and makes your hair look greasy and thin while it's in.  The best way around this problem is to only apply it at night, which is almost as effective as applying it twice a day.  But from my experience, it's still too much of a hassle, and it's not fun waking up in the morning and going to the gym with minoxidil in your hair.\n\n-Nizoral is one of the \"Big 3\" treatments recommended on this sub, yet no one seems to have had significant results from Nizoral alone.  Nizoral burned my scalp and caused my hair to shed even faster, so I can't use it.\n \n-PRP's level of effectiveness is probably somewhere between Rogaine and Finasteride.  The major drawback is the price.  I can probably afford it if I'm careful with my finances, so it looks like I'll be giving it a try.  Anyone who's skeptical about PRP's effectiveness should take a look at the following link:\nhttps://www.bernsteinmedical.com/research/prp-hair-loss-therapy-long-term-benefits/\n\n-Pumpkin Seed Oil and Saw Palmetto are weak, \"natural\" DHT inhibitors that may cause side effects for some people, but probably never ruined anyone's lives like finasteride.\n\nOnce you have all of this information, continuing to post on this sub will probably cause you more harm than good.  You're more likely to experience amplified feelings of insecurity and anxiety about hairloss than come across new information or insights that can actually help you deal with hairloss.  At least that's been my experience.\n\nDon't get me wrong: it's great if you mainly post here to help *other people* cope with hairloss.  But if you stick around with the hopes that you'll eventually find some risk-free way to permanently halt or reverse your receding hairline, you're going to be disappointed.\n\nIn the real world, balding guys have plenty of friends, date attractive people, and have fulfilling careers.  (Yes, this is even true for men who aren't as good-looking as Jason Statham.)  The older you get (I'm almost 30), the more you'll notice this.  But from reading this sub, you'd think bald guys are social pariahs.  I mean, take a look at [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRiEuegBPsY).  He has a lot less hair than I have, but I could only dream of having his level of confidence and swagger around women.\n\nYes, hairloss sucks, and every man would prefer to have a full head of hair.  But most men would also prefer to be 6'3 and ripped with a chiseled jawline, yet there are plenty of happy men on the planet, most of whom don't have these traits.  And just like it's okay to go to the gym and work on getting ripped, it's okay to attempt to treat your hairloss.  But if you don't end up succeeding, you're still going to be okay.\n\nIf you believe hairloss is the end of the world, the first thing you should do is stop posting here.  This place is filled with insecure men who reinforce each other's insecurities and delusions, and it's going to take you *longer* to come to terms with your hairloss if you keep interacting with people who reinforce your negative beliefs.  \n\nThis is more of a stream of consciousness post than a well-crafted essay, so I apologize if my thoughts are a bit jumbled and scattered.  But I still hope posting these thoughts can help someone out.",

Some serious incel types here that over worry about the most minute things and extremely small chances of side effects. If they cared that much they can just go the gym and get shredded and virtually no girl will care, but no they‚Äôd rather sit on their computers and complain that scientists are laying on their asses (but the posters are not lazing on their asses at all, no no). \n\nA big thing I can recommend to people reading this sub is go bald before you ‚Äòneed‚Äô to. Not permanently, just for a couple of months. I‚Äôm 25 and did this at 17 for a couple of months for shits and giggles (had a full  head of hair and mostly still do now). It was honestly a great experience because my peers honestly cared very little and quite a few commented they thought it looked cool (very nice considering how brutal your average teenager can be).  Made me realise being bald is not too bad and I will happily embrace it when I have no choice, but it is still good to have choice which is why I use the big 3.\n\nHonestly, I have yet to see a single person that looks bad bald. It‚Äôs just you incel mofos have waited so long to go bald and combined with your crippling self esteem have hyper analysed your head to the point where it looks disgusting to you. I repeat I have never actually met a person who I thought looked bad because they were bald. Usually some other feature of theirs like being fat or sporting a ridiculous comb-over - hint hint.",

    "body": "Berberine is a plant-derived compound with potential in treating androgenetic alopecia by inhibiting 5Œ±-reductase (which produces DHT) and reducing TGF-Œ≤2 activity, both key in hair follicle miniaturization. In silico studies show strong binding to both targets, with better docking scores than minoxidil and favorable safety and drug-likeness profiles. However, while lab data is promising, human clinical evidence is still limited.\n\nOther natural compounds show similar multi-target effects. Saw palmetto moderately reduces DHT and improves hair density with fewer side effects than finasteride, but the results are generally milder and slower. Pumpkin seed oil has shown hair count improvement in trials and is well-tolerated, though high-quality, large-scale studies are limited. Nettle root shows DHT-inhibiting and anti-inflammatory properties in preclinical models but lacks robust clinical trials. Reishi mushroom also shows enzyme inhibition in lab studies, but human data is minimal. Green tea extract reduces inflammation and DHT production, with positive effects in animal studies; however, evidence in humans remains preliminary.\n\nNerineri (Nerium indicum) is used in traditional medicine, but current scientific validation for hair growth is weak, and improper use can pose toxicity risks.\n\nBerberine is not found in everyday foods but is present in medicinal plants like barberry, Indian barberry, Chinese goldthread, goldenseal, and Amur cork tree‚Äîtypically consumed as extracts.\n\nCompared to finasteride and minoxidil, these natural compounds generally have fewer side effects and may act on multiple targets, but they tend to work more slowly and lack the volume of clinical validation. Pharmaceutical options remain more potent and fast-acting, while plant-based alternatives may be safer for long-term use with lower risk of adverse effects.

I had lots of successful regrowth in 2020 when I was on both birth control (yaz) and spironolactone (100mg). In 2022, I came off both and had a horrible shedding period! \nIn 2023, I restarted spironolactone (75 mg) and vitamins (magnesium, zinc, pumpkin seed oil, berberine, omega 3 fish oil, vitamin d, and NAC). \n2 years in and I still shed a moderate amount every day, but not a crazy amount. I honestly didn‚Äôt think I was having any success. My middle part is still wide and my pony tail is thin. \n\nI got a haircut yesterday with a blowout and the static from the blow dry made all these  hairs stand up and suddenly I am seeing what I think and HOPE is regrowth! (I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs breakage since I don‚Äôt use heat often at all, mostly air dry) \nI feel really relieved and I‚Äôm unsure if I should still try oral minox since I‚Äôm still shedding or if I should be happy with what I have (scared of side effects relating to blood pressure since spiro already affects my blood pressure) ",

I braided in some extensions into my hair when my dad died just to get a new look and get my mind off of my grief, but I left them in too long and when they came down. They didn‚Äôt detangle well And took out about a third of my hair. So then I bought prescription for topical minoxidil for a ton of money, and I used it religiously for days, and even though I stopped using it a month ago, my hair is still shedding. I have less than a fifth of the hair on my head left than I used to. It‚Äôs absolutely disgusting to me, which is not to say that it should be disgusting to you. But I loved my hair. I am trying to get into wigs and learning everything I can about them, and that‚Äôs been kind of fun. my biggest problem so far is that I have been practicing on wigs that have cheap lace fronts. You are supposed to spray a melting spray on to the lace of your wig so that it will bonds to your forehead and become invisible. Lower end lace does not do this. Also, as I see, you may be fair skinned? If you were buying wigs, you have to watch out and make sure they don‚Äôt send you something with brown lace. Always look for something that says HD, transparent lace. Transparent lace apparently will also work too, but it‚Äôs still a little bit coarse, and I haven‚Äôt been able to finesse it yet. I am getting more confident though and am about to cut the lace on a couple of my higher end wigs and see if that makes a big difference. Hopefully tomorrow. \n\nI like to change my hair up all the time, and you would not believe how many people just do not notice. If you were to get a wig that you really liked and put it on and wore it as a new hairstyle, you would get compliments on your hair, but nobody would know that you were wearing a wig. They would just think you were doing something new with your hair care routine.\n\nBut anyway, the point of my reply is to commiserate with you about the minoxidil shedding. Because so much has been lost, and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any coming back, except for on my legs and arms in my chin. But nothing on my head. I did read that the shedding cycle can take up to four months. And then your follicles go into a resting stage before they start producing hairs again. \n\nSo I don‚Äôt know if or when I will ever get my natural bio hair back that used to be so lovely. It is humiliating to have such thin hair and walk out of the house or have anybody see me and all the bald spots that I have. So I am doing a lot of wigs with hats for quick on and off, or I‚Äôm just gonna have to learn how to glue and melt a wig better and wear it for a couple of days. I just wanted to say I feel you‚Äî that‚Äôs all.",

Male type baldness is characterized by stepwise miniaturization of the hair follicle, due to alteration in the hair cycle dynamics, leading to transformation of the terminal hair follicle into a vellus one. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) seems to be a new technique which may improve hair regrowth. We planned a randomized, double-blinded placebo control trial to see the efficacy of PRP with and without topical¬†minoxidil¬†and to compare with placebo and standard treatment.  \n>  \n>\\*\\*MATERIALS AND METHODS:\\*\\*The study design was a randomized, double-blind placebo control trial. The sample size was calculated, and randomization was done. Patients with male type baldness were allocated into four groups; first group topical¬†minoxidil¬†only, the second group PRP with¬†minoxidil, the third group normal saline (NS), and fourth group PRP only. Interventions were done monthly for 3 months and patients were followed up for the next 2 months. Effects of interventions were assessed by hair density, patient self-assessment, and clinical photography.  \n>  \n>**\\*\\*RESULTS:\\*\\*A total of 80 patients were included. The maximum improvement was found in PRP with¬†minoxidil¬†group. Increase in hair density (in descending order) was PRP with¬†minoxidil¬†group, PRP-alone group,¬†minoxidil-alone group, while a decrease in hair density was found in NS group, after 5 months. The maximum patient satisfaction was found in PRP with¬†minoxidil¬†group followed by (in descending order), PRP-alone group,¬†minoxidil-alone group, and NS group.**  \n>  \n>**\\*\\*LIMITATION:\\*\\*Long-term follow up of patients was not done. Hair counts and hair thickness estimation were not estimated.**  \n>  \n>**\\*\\*CONCLUSION:\\*\\*In our study, we found PRP with topical¬†minoxidil¬†is more effective than PRP alone and topical¬†minoxidil¬†alone.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Topical Ketocoonazole for the Treatment of Androgenetic Alopecia: A Systematic Review](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/)\n\n>Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is common and associated with significant psychosocial distress. Treatment options are needed for patients that do not adequately respond to first line treatments of finasteride or minoxidil. Topical ketoconazole has been proposed as a promising treatment. The goal of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy of topical ketoconazole in the treatment of AGA. A systematic literature search was conducted within the MEDLINE database using the key terms ‚Äúketoconazole‚Äù and ‚Äúalopecia.‚Äù Forty‚Äêseven papers were screened for inclusion, of which 9 were assessed for eligibility. Seven articles were included in the qualitative synthesis, including 2 animal studies (total of 40 participants) and 5 human studies (total of 318 participants). **Murine studies demonstrated a significant increase in mean ratio of hair regrowth to denuded area in the ketoconazole treatment groups compared to controls. Human studies reported increased hair shaft diameter following ketoconazole use. One study reported a significant increase in pilary index (percent anagen phase x diameter) following treatment. Studies also demonstrated clinical improvement of AGA based on photographic assessment and subjective evaluation. Topical ketoconazole is a promising adjunctive or alternative therapy in the treatment of AGA. Randomized controlled trials are needed.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Non-abative Radio Frequency for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia](http://acta-apa.mf.uni-lj.si/journals/acta-dermatovenerol-apa/papers/10.15570/actaapa.2019.39/actaapa.2019.39.pdf)\n\n>**Abstract**  \n>  \n>\\*\\*INTRODUCTION:\\*\\*Medical treatment of androgenetic¬†alopecia¬†(AGA) is mainly limited to pharmacological and surgical interventions. Patients' desire for noninvasive and non-systemic treatments has accelerated research into medical devices that can promote hair growth. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) was the first such device. However, its success has been limited by contradictory and often controversial efficacy claims. Work previously performed in animal models of AGA has demonstrated the viability of the wound repair mechanism as a potential treatment modality. This study therefore explores the use of a non-ablative radio frequency (RF) device in the treatment of AGA.  \n>  \n>\\*\\*METHODS:\\*\\*A single blindedstudy compared a non-ablative RF device versus a sham device in 24 men with AGA. Each subject received four treatments over the 12-week study.  \n>  \n>**\\*\\*RESULTS:\\*\\*In this preliminary study of 24 AGA patients treated with a novel RF device, we demonstrated that 54% showed a clinical response. Furthermore, among patients that underwent four or more treatment sessions, 40% experienced a 30% or more increase in hair counts compared to baseline.**  \n>  \n>**\\*\\*CONCLUSIONS:\\*\\*If validated in a larger cohort, non-ablative RF may prove to be an important clinical tool in the treatment of AGA.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Comprehensive Review: Complementary and Alternative Treatments for Alopecia](https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/492035)\n\n>**Comprehensive Review that discusses natural products (amino acids, caffeine, capsaicin, circuit, garlic gel, marine proteins, melatonin, onion juice, procyadin, pumpkin seed oil, rosemary oil, saw palmetto as well as other methods**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Topical Antiandrogen Therapies for Androgenetic Alopecia and Acne Vulgaris](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40257-019-00493-z)\n\n>**Abstract -** Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) and acne vulgaris are two conditions commonly seen by dermatologists. Androgens and the androgen receptors play an essential role in the manifestation of both conditions, and some systemic therapies function by interfering in this pathway. The use of topical antiandrogen therapies has gained traction in recent years due to their potential efficacy in treating AGA and acne vulgaris, as well as their reduced adverse effects compared with systemic drugs. This review discusses the role of androgens in skin physiology and pathology and assesses the potential efficacy and safety of three topical antiandrogen therapies in the treatment of AGA and acne vulgaris. A literature review utilizing the PubMed, US Clinical Trials, and SCOPUS databases was conducted to search for randomized clinical trials, systematic reviews, cohort¬†studies, case reports,¬†and¬†other relevant published studies on the pathogenesis and treatment of each condition with topical finasteride, ketoconazole shampoo, and cortexolone 17Œ±-propionate (C17P). **The results demonstrated that topical formulations of finasteride, ketoconazole, and C17P are promising treatments for male pattern hair loss, especially topical finasteride in combination with topical minoxidil. Limited studies have shown C17P to have potential in treating acne vulgaris in both males and females. Minimal adverse effects have been reported in clinical trials for all topical therapies, although topical finasteride is still contraindicated in pregnancy. Recognizing the preliminary evidence, more peer-reviewed studies on topical antiandrogen treatments for AGA and acne vulgaris are necessary before definitive recommendations can be made regarding efficacy and safety. There is also a critical need to include more women in study populations for these treatments.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Alopecia as a Systemic Disease](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738081X19301373?via%3Dihub)\n\n>Alopecia is a skin condition of great social and psychologic impact. Primary alopecia originates from the hair follicles and usually does not have systemic manifestations; however, secondary alopecia can affect the hair follicles in the setting of systemic diseases, medications, and external trauma. Connective tissue diseases, granulomatous diseases, bullous diseases, infections, and tumors are some of the systemic diseases that will be covered in this review. Trichoscopy is a useful noninvasive tool that can help with the diagnosis in the office and can guide the selection of the optimal site for the scalp biopsy. Histopathology is the ultimate tool for the diagnosis in most cases of secondary alopecia and can be performed on vertical and horizontal sections. In most cases, treating the underlying condition is the single most important strategy, but topical treatments for the alopecia are also applied.",

    "body": "A year ago, I began noticing the telltale signs of normal hair pattern baldness and decided to take matters into my own hands. After some research, I stumbled upon Pumpkin Seed Oil, renowned for its DHT blocking abilities ‚Äì a hormone often linked to hair loss. Excited about the potential remedy, I incorporated it into my daily supplement routine.\n\nFor the first few months, everything seemed promising. My hair loss appeared to slow down, but I soon began to notice unexpected changes. My sex drive and overall motivation were taking a nosedive. Concerned, I delved into some research and discovered a surprising correlation between my symptoms and the pumpkin seed oil.\n\nIt turns out, while Pumpkin Seed Oil may be an effective natural DHT blocker, it can also impact hormonal balance, leading to a decrease in sex drive and overall motivation. Realizing the source of my issues, I promptly discontinued the seed oil supplement.\n\nThe results were remarkable ‚Äì my sex drive bounced back, and my overall motivation returned to normal. Reflecting on my experience, I want to emphasize that Pumpkin Seed Oil can indeed be a beneficial natural remedy for those seeking to address hair loss. However, it's crucial to be aware of its potential side effects on hormonal balance, particularly in terms of sex drive.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're exploring natural alternatives to combat hair loss, Pumpkin Seed Oil might be worth considering. Just remember, it's essential to monitor your body's response and be mindful of potential side effects. Finding the right balance between addressing hair loss and maintaining overall well-being is key. \n\nFor those wondering, I did recover my lost hair using Minoxidil+Microneedling. If you have any questions please let me know\n\n&#x200B;",

And when I was taking pumpkin seeds habitually before, for some reason I fell into a similar state of depression. I also lost my sex drive. At the time, I wasn't taking any strange medicine or anything, so I was really puzzled. I started taking pumpkin seeds because I knew they were a natural DHT blocker and I thought they were a good source of fat. After I stopped taking them, I gradually started to feel better and my sex drive returned.\n\nI lead a fairly healthy lifestyle and my physical health is basically good, so I think the fact that the only thing that changed was the intake of pumpkin seeds makes it highly credible. I think that people who have experienced side effects from finasteride should also be careful about natural 5ari, such as pumpkin seeds and saw palmetto.",

But I have used it in smoothies and I can definitely say it messed up my libido negatively and I lost most of my drive to have sex for after a couple of months. But what I came here to say is that if you use it topically then you will be fine as long as you aren‚Äôt ingesting it. Heat up some of the oil and apply a little to your fingertips and massage throughout your scalp and the places you‚Äôre experiencing thinning ( you can apply a bit of conditioner just depends on how your scalp takes in the oil). After that make sure you massage for a smooth 5 minutes at least , you can wash it out after or leave it in overnight if you have super coarse hair ( only leave in overnight if you didn‚Äôt use conditioner) But if you do leave it in overnight make sure to wash it first thing in the morning. (Ps. If you‚Äôre genuinely balding bc of genes, etc then this is most likely not gonna work, oil can still only do so much to male pattern baldness but gut health can do more than oil so make sure you‚Äôre good)",

Keep in mind that most of these tips & tricks have varying degrees of scientifically proven efficacy (some do not!), and, as always, YMMV:\n\n‚ú® Minoxidil 5%. It‚Äôs proven to work, folks. Y‚Äôall know how pro-Rogaine I am. Break the stigma üëäüèº\n\n‚ú® Nizoral/Keto shampoo. Jury‚Äôs still out, but is supposedly somewhat effective. Make sure to condition, this shit is d r y i n g\n\n‚ú® Vitamins. I‚Äôm pretty anti-nutraceuticals because I think they‚Äôre mostly snake oil, but there is potentially evidence for blackcurrent seed oil, L-Lysine, Vitamin B, Biotin, pumpkin seed oil, etc. Or just grab a Hair, Skin & Nails supplement. Do NOT spend $80 on supplements, even if they have compelling pics.\n\n‚ú® Sleep in a silk scarf/silk pillowcase. Supposed to be gentle on fine hair.\n\n‚ú® Stop heat treating if you can.\n\n‚ú® Get a trim or a cut!\n\n‚ú® Volumizing shampoo/conditioner/mousse\n\n‚ú® Rosemary seed oil, applied to the scalp\n\n‚ú® DIY hair masks with olive oil & egg yolk\n\n‚ú® Get highlights (makes hair look thicker)\n\n‚ú® Scalp massages twice a day, use a dermaroller if you want to get fancy\n\n‚ú® Tinted dry shampoo for volume & scalp coverage\n\nTry as many or as few as you‚Äôll like.

It had gotten to the point where I was waking up every 2 hours and having to pee, even with cutting off liquids by 5pm. I googled OTC treatments & found information on pumpkin seed oil potentially helping this problem, so I ordered some. Took 2 capsules yesterday & only woke up once last night needing to pee! I highly recommend anyone having this issue to try it. I'm taking the Now Foods 1000 mg, which recommends 2 capsules once or twice daily.",

    "body": "Hi guys! I am the author of the ‚ÄúMy SUCCESSFUL hair loss story‚Äù post. I‚Äôm trying to answer everyone but apparently my karma score is too low! So I wanted to link where you can get the things I use and also clarify exactly what I do.\n\nLABS\nSo for labs I have inserted pictures of everything I got checked with an integrative care specialist! I ended up being subclinically deficient in many vitamins (I wasn‚Äôt eating nearly enough). \n\n\nVITAMINS \nThese vitamins were what was recommended to me per the integrative care doctor. I take these in the morning after breakfast every day! \n\n1. Pumpkin seed oil (reduces inflammation and blocks dht) https://a.co/d/9gDRIEy\n2. Women‚Äôs prebiotic and probiotic (good for hormone regulation and gut health) https://a.co/d/igc1v8N\n3. Vitamin D3+K2 (good for mood, and hair health, k2 is really important in a D3 supplement) https://a.co/d/7lhn7SQ\n4. Hair, skin, nails multivitamin (great for hair and overall health, this one is similar to nutrafol without the price tag!) https://a.co/d/fo6sErH\n5. Cortisol manager (this is great for bringing down cortisol levels and managing your hormones which is so very important) https://a.co/d/dg8qPec \nHonorable mentions: \nI also eat well! I eat a lot of protein, fruits, veggies! And I make sure I‚Äôm getting ENOUGH calories. I eat around 2,000 a day but I don‚Äôt typically calorie count. \nI eat a lot of activia probiotic yogurt (I love it and it‚Äôs very good for your health) this can be found in pretty much every grocery store. \n\nSHOWER ROUTINE (wash hair 3-4 times a week) \n1. I use ketoconazole 2% shampoo twice a week per my derms recommendation (it removes dht off the scalp and helps with irritation/dandruff) unfortunately in the USA you need a prescription for this but you can get 1% over the counter at drugstores https://a.co/d/9V2lbQV\n2. On days that I am not using Keto shampoo I use this one because caffeine is great for keeping hair in the anagen phase! It was recommended through @dermatologysurgeon on Instagram https://a.co/d/6fQl0qf\n3. I use this conditioner to maintain scalp health! This was recommended by @dermatologysurgeon too https://a.co/d/1kVZxDA \n4. I massage my head upside down for 5 minutes before i get in the shower. This stimulates blood flow and feels great! This is what I use https://a.co/d/eWMewyq\n5. I use minoxidil 1-2 times a day EVERYDAY this is key! The one I use is this https://www.walmart.com/ip/Women-s-Rogaine-5-Minoxidil-Foam-Unscented-2-Month-Supply/38695500 \n\nHonorable mentions\nTo keep my hair moisturized I like using Kristen Ess deep masks every so often and also her leave in products. \nI don‚Äôt heat style very often but when I do I always use heat protection (I waited a while before my hair became more stable to start heat styling) \nI use a gentle detangling brush to not pull at unnnecessary hair \nI never sleep with wet hair and I also braid it at night \nI also make sure to wash my scalp effectively because buildup is not good for your scalp and for a while I had an issue with dry skin and build up that was everywhere! This routine eliminated it so my hair can grow in a healthy environment. \n\nLIFESTYLE\nI am on antidepressants 60mg Prozac once a day and 10mg Buspirone twice a day. Medication is not needed but don‚Äôt be ashamed if you do! If you struggle with anxiety, depression, etc this can be very helpful for living quality and bring down your level of stress so hair can grow! \nI have a therapist that does CBT with me \nI make sure to exercise (not intensely) I go for a walk or run everyday and get outside. \nFor the cold months I use a sunlight lamp every morning in my room! This helps a lot with depression.\nI make sure I am making memories and living my life (I know this is hard) but you have to keep living! Things will work out just trust the process.\n I‚Äôd like to mention this is coming from a Psychology major studying to be a Clinical Therapist. So I study the brain and how to make people‚Äôs lives easier! \n\nLet me know if anyone has any questions at all because I know this is a lot of information! Please remember have hope and you are beautiful! \n",

        "body": "Hey! I appreciate you sharing your journey ‚Äî I know how tough and emotional hair loss can be, especially when you‚Äôre trying to take proactive steps.\n\nThat said, I have to ask:\nHave you ever considered starting with low-dose finasteride before jumping straight to dutasteride? Most women with androgenetic alopecia (if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre dealing with) are usually prescribed something like 0.25‚Äì1mg finasteride first to gauge response and tolerance. Dutasteride is much stronger and not FDA-approved for female hair loss ‚Äî and for a good reason.\n\nIt‚Äôs clear you‚Äôre looking for answers, but just being honest here ‚Äî are you fully informed about what you‚Äôre taking and the risks involved?\n\nBecause as a woman of childbearing age, you‚Äôre taking on some very real dangers with daily 0.5mg dutasteride:\n\t‚Ä¢\tIt‚Äôs highly teratogenic ‚Äî even a surprise pregnancy can be extremely risky due to the chance of birth defects in male fetuses.\n\t‚Ä¢\tDutasteride suppresses DHT more completely than finasteride, which in women can sometimes cause unintended hormonal side effects like menstrual irregularities, libido changes, fatigue, etc.\n\t‚Ä¢\tAnd honestly, at just 1 month in, it‚Äôs totally normal to see no visible regrowth yet. New hairs typically take 3‚Äì6 months to even start showing ‚Äî and more like 9‚Äì12 months to fully see the results. So if you‚Äôre expecting big changes this early, it might be a sign that you weren‚Äôt given realistic expectations before starting.\n\nAlso curious ‚Äî was this prescribed by a derm, or did you go the telehealth route? No judgment at all, just trying to get context.\n\nYou might still do well on dutasteride long-term, but it‚Äôs worth pausing and asking if this is the best and safest approach for you right now. Just want to see you win ‚Äî safely and sustainably.\n\nüôèüíõ",

Hair loss is incredibly tough, especially for women, and it‚Äôs not something you can easily hide or ignore. Add to that the frustration of being dismissed or neglected by doctors, and it makes total sense why you‚Äôd want to go straight to what seems like the strongest option.\n\nBut here‚Äôs the thing: just because dutasteride is ‚Äústronger‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the smarter first step‚Äîespecially for women. Finasteride is not ‚Äúweaker‚Äù in women; in fact, because of hormonal differences, it can be significantly more powerful at much lower doses. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs usually the first-line treatment even in more advanced female hair loss cases. Dutasteride is a heavier systemic drug, and the long-term risks‚Äînot just fertility-related but also hormonal, neurological, and dermatological‚Äîare still not fully understood in women, especially in off-label usage.\n\nI totally get wanting fast results. But hair restoration, unfortunately, isn‚Äôt a short game. And jumping straight into the deep end might get you quick wins now, but potentially at the cost of issues down the line‚Äîsome of which might not show up until years later.\n\nYou‚Äôre not wrong for wanting proof or wanting real results. You just deserve to get them safely. I‚Äôd encourage you (or anyone reading this) to do more digging, look into how finasteride behaves in women, and consider that sometimes starting with the ‚Äúmilder‚Äù option is actually the more powerful choice when you‚Äôre playing the long game.\n\nYour story matters.

So picking the right one is crucial to preparing many delicious recipes. \n\nBut amidst health claims and warnings for all kinds of oils and a continuously increasing variety in general, it is hard to keep track which oil is not only tasting good but also benefits one's health. \n\nThe much hyped \"super food\" Coconut oil for example recently received a health warning from the American Heart Association, stating it contained more saturated fats than lard and very negatively affects the Ldl cholesterol level. In other words it's the stuff that cloggs arteries. \n\nOr when I grew up sunflower oil was supposedly very healthy, but in recent years food science changed its mind and now recommends one is to avoid it if possible or replace it with another vegetable oil altogether. \n\nI have therefore retreated into a rather limited selection of coldpressed oils (canola, corn germ and olive) for the majority of my meals. I also have a blended oil in a five liter canister for the deep fryer containing processed canola, sunflower, corn germ oil and antioxidants. Small bottles of sesame, walnut and pumpkin seed oil already complete my collection. \n\nAm I too focused on the reported health benefits of my oils and miss out on awesome flavour experiences or is my selection just fine?

        "body": "Here's an excerpt from a cookbook I'm writing:\n\n**Extra Virgin Olive Oil**\nSmoke Point: 325¬∞\nDescription: Also known as ‚ÄúUnrefined‚Äù olive oil. Extra virgin oil has not been treated with chemicals or heat, meaning the olive flavor and natural vitamins and minerals have been preserved. Extra virgin olive oil has a very low smoke point, meaning it will burn at a lower temperature than other oils. High quality olive oil will have a greenish-gold color and a slight peppery flavor.\nUses: While it is possible to cook with extra virgin olive oil, it is better to use oil with a higher smoke point for frying or baking, etc. Use extra virgin oil for dressing, dips, bread dips, or other cold dishes, where its natural flavor will not be destroyed by heat. \nStorage: Room temperature, away from direct sunlight or heat. \n\n**Pure or Light Olive Oil**\nSmoke Point: 400¬∞\nDescription: Also known as ‚ÄúRefined‚Äù oil. Refined oils have been heated or treated to remove impurities. Refined olive oils have a higher smoke point and are more resistant to heat and cooking, but they lack the flavor, color, aroma, and vitamin content of unrefined olive oils. Typically there are two varieties: ‚ÄúLight‚Äù and ‚ÄúPure.‚Äù ‚ÄúLight‚Äù refers to the oil‚Äôs flavor, not its caloric content. ‚ÄúPure‚Äù is also often referred to as ‚ÄúRegular‚Äù olive oil. Both have a more neutral flavor than extra virgin olive oil. \nUses: Bood for baking, saut√©ing, grilling, or frying. \nStorage: Room temperature\n\n**Butter**\nSmoke Point: 300¬∞\nDescription: Other varieties of butter exist, such as products made from goats milk etc. There are salted and unsalted varieties.Uses: Baking, saut√©ing, sauces, pan frying, etc. Butter can burn at a relatively low temperature, so care should be taken when pan frying.\nStorage: Room temperature, properly covered: 2-3 days. Fridge: 2-3 weeks. Freezer: up to a year.\n\n**Shortening**\nSmoke Point: 370¬∞\nDescription: ‚ÄúShortening‚Äù is a technical term referring to a solid fat used to prevent gluten forming in baked goods, or to keep baked goods soft until baking. Lard, or even butter can be used as shortening. Cookies and other baked goods made with shortening tend to stay soft, whereas those made with butter tend to be crispier. \nUses: Baking, frying, (sometimes deep frying)\nStorage: Safe at room temperature, however refrigeration is a good idea for pastry-like foods, where everything (ingredients, air, rolling pin, work surface, bowls, etc) are kept cold until baking. \n\n**Coconut Oil**\nSmoke Point: 350¬∞ - 450¬∞\nDescription: Refined options have a higher smoke point (but lower flavor and aroma), whereas unfiltered options have a very low smoke point. Coconut oil can be used as a substitute for butter‚Äîuse 25% less oil than the butter amount in the recipe, as coconut oil (unlike butter) is almost pure fat. \nUses: confections, desserts, coatings\nStorage: Room temperature\n\n**Lard**\nSmoke Point: 370¬∞\nDescription: Lard is commonly used as a cooking fat or a shortening in many parts of the world, though it has commonly been replaced by vegetable oils. Unlike bacon fat, processed lard has a very mild flavor. \nUses: Baking, frying, (sometimes deep frying)\nStorage: Fridge\n\n**Sesame Oil**\nSmoke Point: 410¬∞\nDescription: Popular in Asian dishes as a flavoring and marinade. Sesame oil should add a ‚Äúroasted‚Äù flavor to the dish. As a result of its distinct flavor, it should be used sparingly, as a lot can go a long way\nUses: Marinades, roasting, saut√©ing, dressings, or drizzled on roasted vegetables\nStorage: Fridge\n\n**Vegetable Oil (Varieties)**\nSmoke Point: 400¬∞ - 450¬∞\nDescription: These oils have a high smoke point and a neutral flavor. These are often oils made from a particular vegetable such as canola, corn, sunflower, or safflower, but they can also be sold as a blend labeled ‚Äúvegetable oil.‚Äù With a few exceptions, these oils are excellent all-purpose oils with a neutral flavor. Most restaurants use corn oil for deep frying, particularly for french fries. Vegetable oil is probably the most common in households because it is inexpensive and versatile. \nUses: Deep frying, searing, stir frying, baking, saut√©ing\nStorage: Store in a cool, dark place and use within a year.\n\n**Peanut Oil**\nSmoke Point: 450¬∞\nDescription: Peanut oil has a very mild flavor and a very high smoke point. It is very popular in Asian cooking, and is also widely used in deep frying, notably for french fries or even deep-frying turkey. \nUses: Deep frying, stir frying, saut√©ing\nStorage: Room temp\n\n**Clarified Butter (or Ghee)**\nSmoke Point: 485¬∞\nDescription: Clarified butter combines a buttery flavor to a high smoke point.To make clarified butter, heat unsalted butter on low until it stops bubbling and turns clear. This should take about 30 to 40 minutes. Strain and cool, being sure to leave any solids in the bottom of the pan.  \nFor ghee, as soon as the butter liquefies turn the heat up to medium. When it finishes foaming, turn the heat up a bit more and wait for it to finish foaming a second time. It is done when the butter turns golden, which should take 7-8 minutes. Remove brown milk solids from the bottom of the pan, and pour mixture through a fine mesh strainer. \nWhen preparing for a recipe, use at least 25% more unsalted butter than the amount of clarified butter needed. \nUses: frying, saut√©ing, sauces, \nStorage: Clarified Butter: Up to a month, in an airtight container. \nGhee: Room temperature or refrigeration, up to a month.\n\n**Avocado Oil**\nSmoke Point: 520¬∞\nDescription: Avocado oil has a buttery flavor and has a very high smoke point. It is extremely versatile, although it can usually be rather expensive (important to consider when buying enough oil for deep frying).\nUses: Grilling, pan frying, roasting, drizzling, dressings, marinades, stir fry\nStorage: Room temp or refrigerated. Although it will often become cloudy in the fridge, it will clarify when heated.",

        "body": "Yes, you're too focused on health benefits of oils IMO.\n\nMy understanding is that saturated fats as a source of heart disease is on the outs right now in the scientific community.  So don't worry about that.  If you have high cholesterol, do a bit more exercise and call it a day - my understanding is that high cholesterol is mostly a response to something else wrong in your body (i.e. poor health in general).  So far as I can tell, the only types of fats that indisputably cause health issues are trans-fats (hydrogenated oils), so avoid those.  Also apparently over-heating oils is potentially \"bad\" for you, as the oils oxidize when smoking and potentially harmful compounds are formed.\n\nTake with a HEAVY grain of salt any dietary advice saying one food is good for you or another is bad for you, IMO.  Dietary advice seems to ebb and flow with latest research and always seems to be changing.  It's a lot of noise and very little signal.  Like economic theory, dietary advice seems to get highly politicized with a lot of unprovable theories coming in and out of vogue.  Nobody actually seems to know anything, but everyone is dead sure about it.\n\nSo you should just choose your fats based on heat tolerance and flavor, in my opinion.\n\nI use butter as often as possible, but it's bad for very high-heat applications.  I use EVOO for lower-heat applications as well when I want that flavor.  I also use lard whenever possible because it has such an amazing texture (never buy the grocery store block though - it's mostly trans fat.  Get lard from a butcher or make it yourself).  Rendered duck and pig fats are nature's miracles when you can get your hands on them.  Anyway, for high heat, I usually use avocado or peanut oil because they have a high smoke point and taste good.\n\nThere are lots of other oils.  Some of them taste good and some don't.  Coconut oil is great when you want that flavor, for instance.  But some go rancid really fast as well (e.g. Walnut oil).\n\nIn general I'd say don't worry too much.  Cook good, nutrient-dense food that you want to eat.  Dietary recommendations are likely to change over time.",

    "body": "**MPB isn't a singular event but a culmination of several contributing factors**\n\n1. **Chronic Inflammation and Stress in the body:**\n\n**Cause:** **Stress depletes magnesium**, a vital mineral which increases Nitric oxide for ***blood vessel*** relaxation and nutrient delivery to follicles. Additionally, stress blocks vitamin D3 receptors and GAS6 protein, both crucial for hair growth. Mg also blocks calcium ion channels. Increased calcium ion channels causes death of hair follicle (palmitic acid, oxidative stress, and genetics)\n\n**Cures:**\n\na. Magnesium-rich foods\n\nb. sunshine exposure\n\nc. stress-management techniques like yoga or meditation,\n\nd. Vitamin D3 supplements\n\ne. Anu taila through nose\n\nf. Topical Rice bran oil (RBO) increases NO secretion\n\ng. Ashwagandha Oral reduces cortisol\n\nh. Sulphur in MSM etc enhances blood flow\n\ni. Œ≤-sitosterol\n\nj.\n\n**2.** **3Œ±-HSD Deficiency:**\n\n**Cause:**  This enzyme converts the DHT hormone into a beneficial byproduct called androstanol. Zinc and B6 deficiencies involved in the biosynthesis and activity of 3Œ±-HSD. Obesity, metabolic syndrome and severe infections can cause a systemic inflammatory response, all of which lead to **3Œ±-HSD Deficiency. Depletion of type 1 3Œ±-HSD in the liver can lead to cortisol resistance (which ultimately impacts hair as well), while depletion of type 5 3Œ±-HSD in the skin can cause steroid hormone imbalances and affect hair growth.**\n\n**Cure:**\n\n1. zinc, B6, procyanidin B2 and sulforaphane to boost 3Œ±-HSD activity.\n2. Topical Procyanidin B-2 1% has growth-promoting effects on hair epithelial cells that follow MEK activation and their protective action on TGF-beta(1)- or TGF-beta(2)-induced apoptosis that is assumed to trigger catagen induction in the hair cycle\n3. Procyanidin B-2 Ignite Keratin production in hair follicles by inhibiting the pentose phosphate pathway and amino acid oxidation\n4. **Energy Mismanagement:**\n\n**Cause:** Hair growth is a hungry beast, and calorie restriction puts it on a starvation diet. Prioritize **protein intake for healthy follicles**, remember that hair is not essential for survival, so it gets the leftovers during stress. **Any type of stress first effects hair, nails and skin**\n\n**Cure:** Ensure decent protein intake. Protein is needed for iodination reaction of thyroid gland. Iodine and thyroxine combine to form thyroid hormones. If iodine/protein deficiency is there it will lead to hair fall.\n\n4. **Vitamin D3 Receptor Blockade:**\n\n**Cause:** 4. Vitamin D receptors are located on every cell of body. If you do not have enough Vitamin D receptors you will lose hair. These vital receptors are like locks, and if blocked by obesity, medications, or high cortisol, hair growth stalls.\n\nD3 is important for differentiation and initiation of anagen phase of hair cycle. VDR is a key component that influences hair follicle health and growth. Activated VDR leads to thicker, faster-growing hair. Calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, activates VDR.A lowered capacity for vitamin D activation could lead to less circulating calcitriol and lower VDR activation. This theory connects low magnesium levels, responsible for efficient calcitriol activation, to hair loss.\n\n**Cures:**\n\n1. Sunshine\n2. Liver health is very important. Liver secretes Bile, bile is important to stimulate vitamin D receptors. Eat sulphur rich food (like MSM) and taurine to make liver healthy\n3. If vitamin D3 is not correcting your D3 levels, you need B12, Magnesium, Boron, Quercetin, flavonoids, Gamma tocopherol (sub unit of vitamin E), Curcumin and Ginger, Green tea, intensive exercise\n4. **Leaky Gut, Gut Microbiome, and Sebum Overload:**\n\n**Cause:** Sebum acts as hydrolipid layer (waterproofing), and prevents loss of nutrients, natural oils, and protects against pollutants. A leaky gut allows toxins to infiltrate the bloodstream, leading to *altered host response*, and triggering sebaceous gland overproduction. This excess sebum clogs follicles, suffocating hair growth, prevents nutrients from reaching hair follicle andcCuts oxygen supply to hair follicle. It‚Äôs also called epidermal plaque. Gut is connected to liver via portal vein, and so an unhealthy gut also implies an unhealthy liver. If liver is unhealthy, chances of metabolic syndrome is high. It is seen that people with metabolic syndrome have extreme active sebaceous glands. High Sebum is also correlated with high DHT. Elevated Propionibacterium acnes (p. acnes) has been seen in bald scalp areas, which is also linked to gut issues.\n\n*Anecdotes on Faecal Matter Transplant (FMT) curing MPB, you can‚Äôt have a double blind placebo controlled study on this one*\n\n**Cures:**\n\n1. Heal the gut with stress reduction,\n2. Remove gluten and dairy,\n3. Embrace fermented foods.\n4. Topically, use Topical Ketoconzole + zinc shampoos and apple cider vinegar to dissolve sebum.\n5. Probiotics and Prebiotics\n6. Oral Shatavari Root contains quercetin, naringenin, and p-coumaric acid, and reduces steroid 5-alpha reductase gene (SRD5A) expression and lowers sebum production.\n7. Frankincense oral reduces bacteria / fungi and inflammation\n8. Vitamin K2\n9. Nattokinase , kimchi\n10. &#x200B;\n11. **Fibrosis and Calcification of Arteries:**\n\n**Cause:**  Perifollicular fibrosis (or scar tissue) OR excessive cross-linkage of collagen leads to **tight scalp**, and calcium deposits restrict blood flow, both hindering hair growth. Fibrosis is caused by Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEP), which is causes by insulin insensitivity. Zinc deficiency can lead to increased leucine and hydroxyl l-leucine, which are part of amino acid lysine which takes part in collagen formation. Increased leucine and hydroxyl l-leucine can lead to fibrosis\n\n**Cures:**\n\na. Combat with micro-needling (also increases SULT1 sulfotransferase which is a stimulant), improved insulin sensitivity through diet and exercise\n\nb. Insulin sensitivity can be cured with Baikal skullcap\n\nc. Minerals like zinc to decrease lysine and magnesium to boost blood flow and address calcification.\n\nd. Anti-fibrotic agents like taurine, serrapeptase and pirfenidone\n\ne. Fat grafting is also another proven method to grow hair\n\nf. Topical Sildenafil (Viagra) for blood vessels\n\ng. Botox Injections to scalp for fibrosis\n\nh. Topical Rosemary Oil for blood vessels\n\ni. Topical Sildenafil (Viagra) increases blood flow to scalp\n\nj. Topical Adenosine dilates blood vessels, increasing blood flow.\n\nk. Topical Caffeine for blood vessels\n\nl. PLATELET-RICH PLASMA (PRP) works by improving follicle vascularization\n\nm. Hyaluronic acid provides moisture to the skin from inside\n\nn. **Dexpanthenol** (**oral** and **topical**) is a precursor of vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It works as a moisturizer, improving skin hydration and elasticity. It also activates fibroblast proliferation, which is important in wound healing. It also increases vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene expression in dermal papilla cells. It also increases SULT1A1 (sulfotransferase, which is like a stimulant)\n\n7. **Nutritional Deficiencies:**\n\n**Causes:** Selenium, zinc, vitamin C, and iron are hair's essential allies. Selenium fuels antioxidant defences, zinc regulates oil production and inhibits 5Œ±-reductase, vitamin C aids iron absorption, scalp circulation, and in formation of VEGF, and iron nourishes hair follicles. Iron is a cofactor for RNR, which is important for cell growth. Also hair follicle acts as site of storage of iron in the form of ferritin. Hair growth will be compromised in iron deficiency, and you won‚Äôt see iron deficiency. But iron supplementation is dangerous. So take iron through vegan foods only, like Moringa. Vitamin C and Vitamin A enhance absorption of iron. Need highly acidic stomach to absorb iron better, so consume ACV before each meal.\n\nHistidine deficiency was observed in‚Äâ>‚Äâ90% of AGA,\n\nLeucine deficiency in 100% of AGA\n\nAlanine deficiency in 91.18% of AGA\n\n**Cures:** Fill your plate with diverse fruits, vegetables, and supplements of copper, iron, zinc, B vitamins, D, selenium\n\n8. **Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease:**\n\n**Causes:** Excess histamine aka allergic history aka rhinitis aka sinusitis likely means liver issues. This silent enemy disrupts hormone balance and metabolism, impacting hair growth. Address histamine imbalances through diet and consider supporting liver health. The liver removes hormones and toxins from our bodies including free testosterone and DHT. If it starts to underperform, levels of these hormones rise\n\n**Cures:**\n\n1. Silymarin (milk thistle), kutki\n2. If lot of mucus is accompanying hair loss take NAC to loosen the mucous and Anu taila through nose to aid the liver\n3. Oral Aloe vera is great for liver\n4. &#x200B;\n5. **Hormonal Imbalances:**\n\n**Causes:**\n\na. DHT binds to androgen receptors in hair follicles, causing them to shrink\n\nb. The oil glands (sebaceous glands) are like little workshops that can make both estrogen (E2) and androgens (like T and DHT). They do this using a special enzyme called aromatase. The aromatase enzyme converts androgens into E2, boosting its levels in the area. E2 binds to its receptors on the hair follicles, and extend the anagen (growth) phase. E2 can lower the production of DHT, and also increase its own production by ramping up aromatase activity. The hair follicles are like the control centers. They have receptors that listen to signals from both E2 and androgens. If E2 signalling is more potent it remain in anagen phase and if androgens are more in the microenvironment then it enters thinning and shedding.\n\nc. Thyroid hormone (T3 n T4) imbalances can cause alterations in the hair growth cycle.\n\nd. Increased cortisol levels can cause hair follicles to enter the telogen (resting) phase\n\ne. The liver removes hormones and toxins from our bodies including free testosterone and DHT. If it starts to underperform, levels of these hormones rise\n\nf. ***Insulin resistance:*** Hormonal profile of men with AGA and that of women with PCOS is very similar. Major cause of PCOS is insulin resistance\n\ng. Decreased dopamine levels lead to increased GnRH secretion,\n\nh. Deficiencies in iron, vitamins like B6 and B12, and certain amino acids, **chronic stress**, oxidative stress can all lead to decrease in dopamine synthesis by the hypothalamus, Dopamine directly inhibits prolactin secretion from the pituitary gland. When dopamine levels decline, this inhibitory effect weakens, leading to increased prolactin.\n\nWhy do so many people who are addicted to masturbation also see hair loss? People who are depressed have really low levels of dopamine, and these people masturbate a lot (binge eat, eat high sugar foods), to get the experience of dopamine surge for momentary relief from the depression. The excess masturbation does not in itself cause the hair loss, but does lead to Zinc deficiency, and also increased prolactin ‚Äì both of which cause hair loss. Plus, as one loses hair he gets more depressed and the vicious cycle repeats itself.\n\n**Cures:**\n\na. **Ashwagandha**, meditation, and **L-ornithine** can help manage cortisol\n\nb. **Shatavri** to increase estrogen in males\n\nc. Consume sprouted **fenugreek** to safely increase estrogen in the body\n\nd.\n\n10. **Oxidative Stress:**\n\n**Causes:** Free radicals, the villains in this story, damage hair follicles. Increased ROS causes increase in TGFŒ≤-1, leading to fibrosis, and also inhibits hair follicle function. ROS also leads to Altered immune response.\n\n**Cures:**\n\n1. Boost level of intrinsic antioxidants like ‚Äì Glutathione peroxidase which depends on **selenium (Brazil nuts)**, and Catalase and Superoxide dismutase depends of **copper and zinc.**\n2. Antioxidants like vitamin D3, omega-3 oils\n3. Red light therapy\n4. Topical melatonin\n5. Remove pollutants, smoking etc., which cause ROS\n6. Astaxanthin\n7. Oral Tocotrienol / Vitamin E complex acts as an antioxidant\n8. Guava leaf extract acts as antioxidant and blocks DHT\n9. Resveratrol\n10. **Genetics:**\n\n**Causes:** The enzyme 5Œ±-reductase converts testosterone and some DHEA (adrenal steroid) to DHT. High levels of 5Œ±-reductase and high levels of free testosterone lead to increased DHT. Interestingly, MPB patients also have **low total testosterone but high free testosterone. In regular people, most testosterone is bound to SHBG (sex hormone-binding globulin) and some to albumin, leaving only a small portion as free testosterone.**\n\n**The ideal approach to prevent hair loss would be to increase bound testosterone by raising SHBG and albumin levels. Albumin is linked to liver health and thyroid health**. High free testosterone increases TGF Beta 2, leading to hair follicle shrinkage and hair loss. DHT also triggers\n\nhair follicle cell death and regression through DKK-1.\n\nThyroid disorders, liver diseases, or insulin resistance lower SHBG production. Estrogen increases SHBG synthesis.\n\n**Cures:**\n\n1. Eat fiber and reduce sugar to raise SHBG.\n2. High sugar and dairy intake might increase 5Œ±-reductase activity.\n3. DHT blockers like saw palmetto and pumpkin seed oil,\n4. Maintaining a healthy omega-3 to omega-6 ratio,\n5. Avoiding trans-fats\n6. Liver health\n7. Spironolactone acts as a competitive inhibitor of androgen receptors, particularly for DHT, it also inhibits the enzyme 5Œ±-reductase\n8. Topical **ALFATRADIOL** aka estrogen/indirect anti androgen. Alfatradiol acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme 5Œ±-reductase. Approved for female pattern hair loss\n9. Topical FLURIDIL 2% blocks AR receptors\n10. Topical Rice bran oil (RBO) blocks 5Œ±-reductase\n11. Pygeum africanum  contains compounds ike atraric acid and N-butylbenzene-sulfonamide which act as antagonists (cling to) of the human AR receptors\n12. Astaxanthin also lowers DHT\n13. Topical and Oral Mango leaf Juice which lowers DKK1 which reduces DHT\n14. Onion Extract / Black Seed Oil block DHT\n15. &#x200B;\n16. Growth Stimulants: These are items which stimulate hair growth by promoting differentiation and initiation of anagen phase and/or increasing the activity of hair follicle stem cells.\n17. Vitamin D3\n18. Topical REDENSYL\n19. Topical Stemoxydine\n20. 12 grams MSM per day along with 3 grams of vitamin c as it helps absorption of MSM. MSM is thought to either promote the conversion of telogen to anagen or lengthen anagen, mainly due to the deliverance of sulphur to the middle layer of the hair\n21. &#x200B;\n\n**Final Downstream Micro level Cause of Hair Fall which is caused by a combination of all or some of the factors above**\n\n**Micro-inflammation** at the dermal papilla of hair follicle ‚Äì increased IL-1Alpha and IL-1Beta. At a micro level inflammation leads to decreased PGE2 and increased PGD2. Hallmarks of inflammation include decreased blood supply at the root of hair follicle and cut-off of nutrient and oxygen supply.\n\n**Cures:**\n\na. Colourful fruits and vegetables rich in quercetin and kaempferol\n\nb. Green tea's EGCG\n\nc. Topical Diclofenac\n\nd. Topical CBD - Hemp Extract\n\ne. Topical Turmeric oil\n\nf. **Topical Cetirizine** is a well-tolerated antihistamine with anti-inflammatory effect, reduces PGD2 that inhibits hair growth and increases PGE2 that promotes it\n\ng. Topical Adenosine suppresses inflammation\n\nh. Topical Stemoxydine reduces PGD2\n\ni. Hair follicles express specific receptors for PGF2Œ± (prostaglandin), called FP receptors. PGF2Œ± attaches to these receptors and promotes inflammation around the hair follicle. **Latanoprost** and **Bimatoprost** are a prostaglandin F2Œ± (PGF2Œ±) analogues, meaning it mimics the structure of PGF2Œ± and binds to FP receptors and leads to Increased nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI2) production which increase blood flow to follicle. PGF2Œ± and its analogs plays the same role, just that Latanoprost and Bimatoprost are more potent in doing the job. But Latanoprost and Bimatoprost are needed in high concentration and cost is prohibitive.\n\nj. Topical Methyl Vanillate activates the WNT/Œ≤-catenin pathway aka reduces inflammation in scalp\n\nk. VPA inhibits an enzyme called GSK-3Œ≤, which in turn triggers the Wnt/Œ≤-catenin pathway\n\nl. Alantolactone suppresses inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress\n\nm. Oral Tocotrienol / Vitamin E complex acts as an anti-inflammatory\n\nn. Topical Fresh Aloe Vera (with or without skin) accelerates wound healing and has shown great results anecdotally. Potential inflammation killer.\n\no. Ecklonia Cava regulates both antioxidative and anti-inflammatory processes\n\n**Liquorice Tea -- Herb with multiple impact** : As an adrenal tonic, it improves energy & stress tolerance. It aids wound healing, is anti-inflammatory, and builds moisture. It is estrogenic, anti-testosterone, anti-oxytocic & anti-prolactin.\n\nThere are many more such herbs.. please add guys!\n\n**Remember, Patience is Key:** Hair growth is a marathon, not a sprint.

    "body": "I am 57 years old.\n\nI started losing my hair at 14 years of age.\n\nAt 19 I started using a hair unit.\n\nFor the next 30 or so years I just accepted that I was a guy who lost his hair and coped by using a hair unit instead.\n\n**About 2 years ago I decided to try Finasteride.**\n\nI started taking pics of my scalp from that point onwards, every 3 weeks when my hair unit was taken off to be cleaned. So I could see the condition of my scalp only once every 3 weeks.\n\nI could only use oral meds because my hair unit is glued to my scalp. Once every 3 weeks the hair unit is removed, cleaned and re-glued.\n\nI was on finasteride for one year, at which point I saw some minor regrowth on my crown and vertex. However at every hair unit cleaning, much of that hair would wash out with my hair shampoo, including a lot of hair on my sides and back.\n\n**Anyway, at the one year mark I added oral Dut/Min.**\n\nA few months later I started adding various compounds that I determined from clinical studies I was researching.\n\nAll of this was done as oral, as I could not reach my scalp apart from every 3 weeks for a short period of time.\n\n**For about 9 months now I have also been taking in oral form:**\n\n1. Pumpkin seed oil\n2. Grape seed supplements\n3. Saw Palmetto\n4. Resveratrol\n5. Viviscal (for women)\n6. Zinc\n7. Vitamin D3\n8. Iron\n9. I also started microneedling my scalp once every 3 weeks (1.5mm) while I was getting my unit cleaned.\n\n**I also trialed the following product for about 3 months,** but stopped because it gave me gyno or I suspected in was not helping:\n\n1. Estradiol pills 2mg (gave me gyno)\n2. Sildefanil (Viagra) - gave me boners but did not see any benefit to my hair\n\nDuring this time and up until recently (for about 6 months) **I started using topicals/treatments on my hairline**, because it is exposed at the front of my hair unit.\n\n1. Microneedling\n2. Topical Fin/Min\n3. Estrogel\n4. Tretinoin\n\n**About 3 months ago**, due to covid restrictions, I could not go to get my hair unit re-glued every 3 weeks. So the glue disintegrated and for about 2 months I was left with a hair unit that I placed on my head, but it was not glued on.\n\nThis gave me a rare opportunity to try a whole collection of topical meds that I had accrued, but I had never been able to apply on my scalp.\n\nThese topical meds/treatments included:\n\n1. Microneedling\n2. Topical Fin/Min\n3. Estrogel\n4. Tretinoin\n5. Caffeine\n6. Citrizine\n7. Topical Melatonin\n8. Nizoral cream\n9. Plus topical Dut\n\nMy results:\n\n**End of Year 1:** Slow but definite regrowth on my vertex and crown only noticeable at the 1 year mark. However I kept on shedding a lot, including my side and back hair.\n\n**During Year 2:** For the next 9 months I was still progressing, but it was VERY VERY slow, and there were times when I would make zero progress from one hair  appointment to the next, and instances where I lost a lot of hair between appointments.\n\nThe second picture you see is the pic I took before I stopped getting regular hair unit cleanses (and just before the period when I started applying microneedling plus other topical treatments on my whole scalp every day for about 2 months).\n\nBefore I just went in for my first hair unit appointment in a long time, my scalp looked red, was scaly and sore. It also had a lot less hair than in my Aug 2021 pic. I suspect this was shedding in response to the topicals and inflamation due to my daily microneedling.\n\nSo at this point in time I do not know whether my hair has improved because of my topical use on my scalp or not.\n\nI have another appointment in 2 weeks and I will take pictures again.\n\nThis may suggest to me whether I should just stick to my oral meds, or whether adding topicals directly on my scalp increases my response.\n\nBTW, despite my best efforts, my hairline has not shifted at all, despite my oral meds and the topical meds and microneedling that I was able to use because I can access my hairline with my unit on.\n\nAll in all I have had no hair on my scalp for decades, so I never expected to get any regrowth. But as you can see I did in fact regrow hair on scalp that should by conventional thinking only have dead follicles.\n\nHowever my regrowth is not cosmetically significant, so if this is all I regrow it was a good try, but no cigar.\n\nI am hoping my next photos show some new regrowth because of the additional of topicals and microneedling to my whole scalp.\n\nIf anyone has any questions, I am happy to answer them.\n\nWhat this says to me is that 'delayed response' does happen. If I had given up in 9 months I would have concluded that I was a complete non-responder.\n\nI hope this information is of some benefit to some of you, including the younger guys, but also the older guys out there.\n\nAsk any questions you like.\n\n[Sept 2019](https://preview.redd.it/76mugowk5dv71.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=821ae74089a60865115b404787a5ba5faf354ef8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Aug 2021](https://preview.redd.it/i2uzvuiw5dv71.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b840ba6d21cf97ea2c0df134a0487e459c91f0a)",

        "body": "I posted my update not for my benefit or for suggestions for me to remove my hair piece.\n\nIt is more for encouragement to other guys.\n\nWhat my progress tells me:\n\n1. There is such a thing as a delayed responder. Most clinical trials last 3 months or 6 months max. In my case I had virtually zero regrowth before the 1 year mark. And only now at the 2 year mark have I seen broad regrowth across all my vertex and crown.\n\nAnd I have only been able to use orals. If I could have added topicals to my orals, I would have, so I believe I slowed my progress because of that.\n\nFurther, I in fact read a case study recently of a man who was an NW7 who had to take spiro for his benign prostate condition. At the 6 year mark, he started growing hair on his crown and vertex. One has to ask why did this happen only after 6 years of treatment? I don‚Äôt know but perhaps hair follicles need a longer period in some cases to respond once they have been dormant. But it just goes to show that delayed responders are a thing.\n\n2. Scalp fibrosis, or the idea that you cannot revive hair follicles that have been inactive for decades, may not necessarily be true. Clearly its not true in my case, although the thickness so far is not cosmetically significant.\n\n3. I have a really aggressive form of AGA, plus I have significant diffuse balding on my sides and back, plus I started losing my hair at 14. And finally, I am 56 years old.\n\nSo again this should have guaranteed a zero response from me. All cards are stacked against me.\n\nI should be a complete non-responder.\n\nSo if I can grow some hair, then you younger guys with less aggressive AGA, with more hair currently on your scalps, with an earlier stage of AGA, you guys could potentially have much more success than me.\n\nI know what its like to be a young man, and just before you get a chance to start your life, you are practically disfigured and considered less than.\n\nYou guys at least have a chance to save what you have, and regrow what you lost. But perhaps you should commit to at least 2 years of treatment, rather than give up at 6 months.",

The hair unit is glued on its perimeter, so there is a band around my scalp that gets shaved down every three weeks.\n\nThere is no glue on my crown or vertex.\n\nSo when you look at my second pic, you will have to remember that normally, that shaved section would have hair as well.\n\nSo it seems that from the line placed just behind my hairline all the way to my crown (excluding a small vertex island), new hair has grown where it has been slick bald for many decades.",

The only side effects were a few reports of stomach irritation. People were quick to point out that the authors attributed the effects to \"pumpkin seed oil\" even though the supplement (a Korean supplement called Octa-Sabal Plus, originally designed to boost kidney function in men) also contained several other potentially active ingredients, including:\n\n\" Octacosanols (derived from vegetable powder)\n\nGamma linolenic acid (derived from evening prim rose powder)\n\nPolyphenols (derived from red clover powder)\n\nLycopene (derived from tomato powder)\n\nCorn silk extract (from corn silk powder) \"\n\n\\- from [perfecthairhealth](https://perfecthairhealth.com/pumpkin-seed-oil-hair-loss-study-what-you-didnt-know/)\n\nHowever, I think the reasonable response to that point should have been \"Who the hell cares?\" Even if that's true, that still means there's a dietary supplement that's as effective as finasteride! Holy shit, am I missing something? Why aren't we all clamoring to get our hands on this stuff? Even if we can't get the exact supplement, you could pretty easily reconstruct it by mixing existing supplements. It still needs more proof, but why aren't more people trying this?",

    "body": "Ok so I wanted to come on here and share things that have really improved my hair regrowth journey. For context, I started shedding like crazy about 2 months after I got COVID and genuinely thought all hope was lost. I‚Äôve been taking my regrowth journey seriously for the better part of a year now and have had major success (still a work in progress tho!)\n\nLifestyle:\n1. Exercising regularly (even if it‚Äôs just taking talks)\n2. Cutting out stressful people and removing myself from anxiety-inducing situations \n3. Forgoing anything to drink but water and tea for the most part (saving any alc for special occasions)\n4. Getting good sleep, trying to be in bed before midnight as often as possible\n\nDiet\n1. Drinking at least 3800Ml of water (approx 1 gallon) each day is always a goal of mine now\n2. Trying to eat a balanced diet, avoiding ultra-processed foods, focussing on fruits and veggies\n3. Essentially cutting out meat - I know this one is iffy for some people, but I noticed my stomach felt better and my body felt better when I stopped eating meat. I am iron deficient and occasionally will have beef bc iron tablets make me nauseous when I‚Äôm having a deficiency episode (like around my period). But looking at the meat industry and the chemicals that are used in the processing was the catalyst but the unintended boost in energy and feeling less sluggish has kept me away.\n4. Focussing on getting protein from non-meat sources. Even if you do eat meat, getting protein from plants is a 2-for-1 bc you‚Äôre also getting nutrients specific to plants not found in meat\n5. Limiting dairy - this was more for skin health, I noticed my scalp stopped producing as much oil when I limited milk to creamer in the mornings and a dessert 1-2x a week. Plus my acne is more at bay now\n\nSupplements: Ranking Them\nlol I feel like it looks like a lot but I‚Äôve had a history of anaemia and low iron for pretty much all of my life. Iron doesnt count in the ranking bc it‚Äôs specific to my health needs but I will say that it didn‚Äôt cure my hair loss so I give a lot more credit to the other supplements \n1. Nutrafol + Pumpkin Seed Oil - this is so hit or miss so I would honestly invest in the Saw Palmetto ingredient and take with PSO. But with both of these, my hair shedding decreased so much and I saw so much regrowth when I added PSO after 3 months of Nutrafol. But Nutrafol alone did give me a ton of regrowth and my shedding is under control.\n2. Collagen + Folic Acid: I saw so many improvements first in my eyelashes and eyebrows, but I‚Äôve noticed that my hair has a shine now that it didn‚Äôt have before and the strength is amazing. My FA levels have always been lower, but not below the healthy amount, so it‚Äôs not necessary that I take them but the improvements have been great especially with new hairs. Collagen just made my skin and nails better as well so yay\nZinc and Omega : these are my most recent add-ins but the overall clarity I‚Äôve gotten in my skin and the way my scalp feels has changed since taking these for the better. Idk if this‚Äôll make sense, but I feel like TE showed in my overall appearance not just my hair. I noticed that having healthier, fuller hair has been correlated with having better skin. Plus these apparently can help with hair loss.\nExtras:\n1. Almond oil - more more maintaining hair and keeping the scalp moisturised especially (2-3x a week for 30min before shampooing) during dryer seasons \n2.  Scalp massages - daily, 5-10min\n3. Coffee + Green Tea mixture on scalp (not pictured) - before I started doing anything else other than massaging, I would put coffee on my scalp and I do think that helped slow down my shedding. The science isn‚Äôt conclusive is either of these actually help with hair loss, but they‚Äôre good for the scalp‚Äôs health. (Same frequency as almond oil)\n4. Dermarolling - fairly recent but I think I notice some hairs on stubborn places starting to grow back in\n\nOther notes:\n1. Invest in fragrance free shampoos and conditions or ones that are naturally scented.\n2. Be patient - I def didn‚Äôt see tangible results for about 6months\n\nHope this helps!!\n",

    "body": "No surprises with this post as I‚Äôm sure many people already know MCT oil seems to work for most people but I just wanted to say thanks all the users in this subreddit for sharing and being part, without this I wouldn‚Äôt have discovered MCT.\n\nI‚Äôm 26 male in UK and have had sebderm for about 6 years ish. Have tried everything under the sun. Shampoos, oils, eggs, acv, diet changes. I even went 250 miles to London to belgravia clinic to see if they could help as I was experiencing a lot of shedding also. \n\nNothing worked until I changed the shower filter and started using MCT c8 oil. Other oils seem to feed the malassezia (sh*t spelling I know) in my xp. I put it on overnight before shampooing my hair next morning 2-3 times a week. I use H&S derma care shampoo as this seems to get rid of the oiliness the best then nizoral shampoo afterwards to get the benefits from that. I also supplement Biotin, vit D, zinc, pumpkin seed oil and ashwaganda for assoc benefits. Shedding still occurring but much less (30-50 noticeable hairs /day). \n\nI think it‚Äôs mostly in what you treat your scalp with externally rather than inside but everyone‚Äôs different. MCT oil seems to work well at shrinking the flakes without making them pop out like crazy. \n\nFor anyone going through the journey do be patient and be consistent with your routines and the likelihood is you‚Äôll be rewarded at some point. I had to wait 6-7 years and unfortunately doctors appointments aren‚Äôt necessarily the answer. I was prescribed Diprosalic scalp solution and even got my bloods tested to see if there were any autoimmune conditions or biomarkers that may have caused sebderm and hair shedding. \n\nOne of the biggest factors in my opinion is sorting out the mental side of things first and accepting you‚Äôve been given the burden of sebderm but it doesn‚Äôt have to be permanent. Once I was semi comfortable with the fact I had sebderm I could then just crack on with trialling things that would work.\n\nI would say that reducing sugars (at least processed sugars) could help a lot of sebderm sufferers as it is inflammatory so could be a good first step to a good new routine that keeps sebderm at bay. \n\nThanks again Reddit users you legends big love x",

        "body": "I just started using MCT about a week ago after about a decade of having pretty large flakes. At points it was so bad the flakes would be nickel sized and if I so much as ran a hand through my hair I‚Äôd have snowy shoulders. Any attempt to run a brush through my hair would inevitably loosen any flakes and cause them to stick in my hair noticeably. It also have it in and behind my ears, sides of the nose, in my eyebrow and at one point even on my eyelid (ouch). I‚Äôve tried Nizoral, tried washing more and less. Tried hair and scalp treatments and masks. I used to have a habit of nervous picking at any skin imperfections stemming from childhood and when I started getting the flakes badly around 13 or 14 they were no exception, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve cause lasting damage from that but I cringe to think about it. I changed insurances and had to go back down the rabbit hole of trying to get treatment (thanks American health care system üôÑ) and in the process of researching the treatments they suggested I discovered a thread about MCT oil. Total game changer. Literally within a week while I was waiting for my new Nizoral prescription I was just applying oil, every other day with my fingertips to my scalp after showering with damp/towel-dry hair and applying twice a day to any non-scalp locations and wow. I am blown away. I am lucky that my hair is thick and my scalp so not naturally oily so the added oil isn‚Äôt terribly noticeable or greasy looking and it absorbs so well into the skin. I went from having large sections of redness and flaking, extreme snow on the shoulders, to being able to run a brush through my hair with only 3 small flakes in it and zero snow in literally less than a week. Insane. I‚Äôm certainly not ‚Äúcured‚Äù but people that have known me closely for 4+ years have noticed a significant enough difference to comment on it. I use Left Coast MCT oil as suggested in a Reddit thread, I think it‚Äôs 40% C8 and 60% C10. I‚Äôve ordered a dropper and now that I‚Äôve got the medicated shampoo my process is my normal shampoo, then the Nizoral with a long soak, no conditioner, towel dry, apply oil and I‚Äôm set. I make sure not to apply any moisturizer to the patches on my face incase there‚Äôs something in them that could feed it, only thing I put on them is sunscreen when necessary and I wash my face in the evening on those days and reapply oil. Excited to see how much improvement comes after a more extended trial. Thankful for everyone that talked about this solution as well.",

I want to give some context on my hair loss journey for other young women and hopefully provide hope. \nMy hair started thinning almost the exact month I turned 21. That will be exactly two years ago next month, Aug. I was thrown into an extremely stressful situation, lost 20 lbs in two weeks and hardly remember anything from the experience. I started accutane months later and finally saw how bad my hair was getting. Fast forward and right before starting treatment I was losing about 350 hairs a day. Before starting clinical treatment I tried rosemary oil for about 6 months with no change. Tried saw palmetto, pumpkin seed oil, biotin. Finally started minoxidil, then spiro shortly after. About a week into starting spiro all of my shedding completely stopped. ALL. I lose about 5 hairs a day even with showering everyday, washing and conditioning my hair. \nDerm did all labs, everything was normal, ANA normal, no sign of an autoimmune disorder. She did not do a biopsy. \nMy side effects: Spiro has caused extreme dryness, no matter how much water I drink. For this reason, I‚Äôve cut my dose back to 25mg a day for the past two weeks and have not seen a difference in hair fall. My face is more oily though. (I‚Äôve had hormonal acne since I was 17) \nThis is the hardest thing I‚Äôve gone through mentally. I hope everyone in the group is doing okay and finds their solution, because we all react differently to different things. I feel so deeply for every woman going through this. ‚ô•Ô∏è",

Thankfully, she seemed to grow out of it once she hit her twenties.\n\nCoincidentally I started topical minoxidil on the exact same day as you (Feb 23rd) and have  seen regrowth on my temples. However, I'm still losing loads of longer hairs. I know I need something like spiro to stop the hair loss, but you can't get it prescribed for androgenic alopecia here in UK. I'm guessing you're in another country? \n\nAround the time I started losing so much hair a few years ago I noticed the skin around my nose, chin and forehead suddenly started getting very oily, so I'm sure Spiro would help me. I've been taking saw palmetto, pumpkin seed oil and nettle extract for the past 3 weeks, but not holding out too much hope. If it doesn't work I may try to get a private prescription. Have you noticed any other side effects from the spiro besides dryness? Does it give you a dry mouth as well as dry skin?",

    "body": "Hi Everyone! I have recently taken it upon myself to purchase and review body oils from many many different indie brands. I originally was going to post this as one big post but I have gathered so many oils and have so many opinions on them that I think it's best to break it up a little bit into a few different posts as I go along. If there's any oils you want to see reviewed, please let me know and I will do my best to get my hands on some. \n    \n**About my skin:** I have very dry, eczema prone skin. I have had psoriasis in the past but do not currently. I am sensitive on the inside of my elbows and behind my knees where the skin is thin.   \n  \n**What I like:** You will notice I prefer a bit of a thicker oil. I know this is not always everyones preference so I have also reviews some thinner oils. I try all the oils in the same way: Coating my body head to toe and sleeping with the oil on my skin. In the morning, my skin will either feel adequately moisturized  or still a bit dry.\n    \n**Sucreabeille (4oz = 8.00 USD, +/- 2.00 USD/oz)**  \n**Body Oil** (The Listing Attic: spiced apple cider, maple sugar, Kentucky bourbon)  \n**Ingredients:** Sunflower Oil, Rice Bran Oil, Pumpkin Seed Oil, Avocado Oil, Almond Oil, Vitamin E, Fragrance/Essential Oil.  \n**Notes:**  \n**Formula:** This is a good one. I love a true oil to wear, but want something that absorbs quickly. This fits that bill, coating my skin nicely but absorbing in about 15/20 minutes. Skin was very soft in the morning when I woke up. Wish this came in a dropper or spray (it‚Äôs one of those caps where you push the back down and it pops up to dispense, this formula is thick enough that you have to squeeze the bottle a bit, it won‚Äôt run out on its own).   **Also a note, the owner of Sucreabeille has moved her house blends to be their own brand now. Sucreabeille still exists but is used for her copycat / dupe scents. Her new brand ‚ÄúHexennacht‚Äù carries this scent, and from what I can tell the same formula of body oil (ingredients list is the same).**  \n**Scent:** Ooooh, she‚Äôs a boozy one! Off the bat, out of the bottle, I get strong apple bourbon. On the skin, it‚Äôs a really even combination of all 3 elements, very balanced. I like it a lot, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd wear it as a perfume. Really nice scent for Fall / Winter. Nothing left on my skin in the morning after sleeping with this on.  \n  \n**Exoskeletons (1oz = 24.00 USD, +/- 24.00 USD/oz)**  \n**Skin Elixir** (Tobacco: A balanced blend of sweetness and smoke. Blackened spices, deep dark vanilla, sweet resins, and charred wood. Smells like mahogany, like brass, like bookshelves filled with e.e. cummings, like a jukebox singing the blues.)  \n**Ingredients:** jojoba oil, fractionated coconut oil, rosehip oil, castor oil, coq10, alpha lipoic acid, essential oil blend, vitamin e, infused with organic cloves.   \n**Notes:**  \n**Formula:** I do like this formula as far as moisture and application. It goes on very nicely, is easy to spread, and I credit this product with turning my rough elbows baby soft in one application. This does not sink in as quickly as the Sucreabeille, in fact I think it‚Äôs the thickest oil I‚Äôve tried so far. The only reason I won‚Äôt repurchase is because of the price. Of course, this has the nicest packaging out of everything, imo, which explains probably a lot of the higher cost.  \n**Scent:** Very strong. I believe this is a polarizing scent as although I love it, I have made a few people smell it who were either equally appreciative or a little bit revolted. This is mainly a strong clove. If I put this on before bed, the next day when I come home from work my entire room still smells of cloves.   \n  \n**Solstice Scents (4oz = 16.00 USD, +/- 4.00 USD/0z)**  \n**Burnishing Glac√©** (Jack and the Devil: Jack & The Devil is part trick, part treat and all autumn delight. A blend of sugared golden pumpkin, spices, oakmoss, sweet vanilla, aged patchouli essential oil, and dried brown tobacco leaves [absolute]. )  \n**Ingredients:** Cyclomethicone NF, Fragrance and / or essential oil(s), Argan Oil, Rice Bran Oil  \n**Notes:**  \n**Formula:** I just wish this was more hydrating. It‚Äôs a nice, very light spray. I prefer to spray into my hand and then rub into skin as I find spraying directly results in some waste when the spray doesn‚Äôt hit your skin directly. This would be a better formula for summer, when my skin is not as dry. I like this for hair as well, but I don‚Äôt find the scent lingers in hair as much as it does on skin. I will most likely use this as a bath oil, which I will follow up with something thicker.  If you prefer a dry oil, that will absorb completely very quickly, this oil is for you.   **I do want to mention that I did have a little active eczema on the inside of elbow when using this, and it did sting a bit. Not enough that I washed it off, not enough that I stopped using it, but it did. This is something that Solstice Scents warns of on their website, since this is a spicy fragrance. I will continue to use it, but if you suffer from eczema or Psoriasis, I would take note.**   \n**Scent:** Scent is very strong on this one. Lasts nicely on the skin (though not in hair, for me), and this is one of my favourite indie scents for fall. Spicy, sweet, a little gourmand, a little masculine. Can smell it very faintly on my skin the next day, if applied before bed.  \n  \n**Cocoa Pink Silky Soft Body Oil (Greasy formula) (2 oz=5.80 USD, +/- 2.90 USD/oz)**\n(Winchester House Kitchen: The distinct aroma of autumn in the Winchester house kitchen with notes of aged oak, fresh baked pumpkin pie, 5 fold orange essential oil coated in the warm essence of light muscovado sugar, fresh ginger, sticky gobs of benzoin, warm buttery caramel simmering on the stovetop and just the barest hint of clove)  \n**Ingredients:** Sweet Almond Oil, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Fragrance oil, Apricot Kernel Oil, Olive Squalene, Jojoba Oil, Rice Bran Oil (greasy formula), Avocado Oil (greasy formula).  \n**Notes:**  \n**Formula:** I reaaaaaally like this formula you guys. As soon as I started using it I thought to myself ‚ÄúTHIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I‚ÄôM TALKING ABOUT‚Äù. This one definitely has to be sprayed into your hand because it just comes out as kind of a glop, not a spray. NBD because that‚Äôs how I apply them anyways. Really moisturizing, soaked in after about 10-15 minutes, and I woke up and my skin was soooo nice and soft. When I finish up all of these body oils, this is one I will definitely repurchase, in a few different scents.  \n**Scent:** Not at all what I expected! I kind of thought this was going to smell similar to Cinderella‚Äôs Carriage, based on the pumpkin, sugar, etc. but I barely get any sweetness at all. I get mainly ginger and aged oak (HONESTLY, I kind of get ‚Äúrecently polished wood furniture‚Äù) and when I woke up the next morning the slightest hint of caramel (could be in my head). Never got any orange. I don‚Äôt love it but I don‚Äôt hate it, and it doesn‚Äôt really linger so that‚Äôs fine.  \n\nWhew! Let me know if you have any questions about these scents or formulas. I have a lot more reviews to come: Epically Epic, Queen Bee, Alchemic Muse, Witch Baby... and some more Cocoa  Pink! Let me know if there are any formulas you would like to see me compare :)\n\n\n**Edit: Some formatting**",

    "body": "Putting this out there because there is limited info online!\n\nI first took pumpkin seed oil yesterday afternoon and only took half of the recommended to see what it was like. I was surprised at how well it worked! Taking it on top of tolterodine (3 days in) actually totally cut urgency to zero and every time i would urinate it was basically a bladder full! \n\n\nSo then night time came around i decided to take a full dose (2000 mg) and take my usual seroquel (100mg) after stretches. I fell asleep just fine, until i woke up in the middle of the night with shortness of breath, fast heart rate, muscle spasms all over my body, and a headache. I stayed up for about an hour deciding whether or not to go to the hospital before thankfully falling asleep again. \n\n\nSince the tolterodine is newly prescribed, I thought that it was maybe interacting with the seroquel, since it seems there is an interaction that causes rapid heart rate. So i decided to take more pumpkin seed oil before work today, but only half of the dose since I had diarrhea this morning, a possible side effect of pumpkin seed oil. \n\nAs I am driving to work i notice i am getting dizzy. My job is a bit physical and i can tell i feel like dog shit, so I stop what I am doing and sit in the break room for a few minutes. Shortly after sitting down, I VOMMITED in the trash can and asked to go home. I had muscle spasms all the way home.\n\nOnce i get home, i call my local pharmacist, and he told me that tolterodine could have been the cause of the rapid heart rate, but much less likely to have caused my other symptoms. \n\nI THOUGHT that I had done enough research into pumpkin seed oil. The info on side effects does suggest that it can cause discomfort in the gi tract, diarrhea (which i had, but wasnt sure if it was the oil, or food i ate last night) and upset stomach. On web mb it says even having side effects are pretty rare.\n\nWell that is when I found out that pumpkin seed oil is chock full of tryptophan, something that produces serotonin!! \n\nSeroquel not only produces serotonin, but it also lower blood pressure. Guess what else lowers blood pressure? Pumpkin seed oil!\n\nAnd my muscle spasms, rapid heart rate, diarrhea, shortness of breath and headache are all symptoms of SEROTONIN SYNDROME! \n\nSo if you are taking anti depressants or anti physcotics, this is my warning to all of you about pumpkin seed oil. Please be careful if you are thinking about taking it. I thought I had done enough research on it, but to be fair, there isnt much that comes up when you search for the two together. That being said, I also should not have taken a new supplement at the same time as a new medication. I should have been more cautious. \n\nHopefully tolterodine by itself tonight and here on out will not give me side effects, as it has definitely taken the edge off of my urgency. But man, I'm gonna miss that pumpkin seed oil.\n\nTdlr: Pumpkin seed oil and seroquel combo gave me serotonin syndrome and lowered my blood pressure, causing very uncomfortable side effects and caused me to have to leave work",

No doctors want to work with me because nothing worked and their ego just stops them from reassessing. I suffer for months of stretches being sure to do them consistently every f*ing day even despite the most agonizing flares, all for nothing, I got mild relief for the first few days but ever since it‚Äôs just the same. \n\nNo one knows what combination of problems I have. I never know what symptom is coming from what.\n\nUrinary retention and difficulty peeing, is it from my pelvic tightness or because of my voiding dysfunction? If it was pelvic floor wouldn‚Äôt the stretches and PT have made some noticeable difference? but if it was urethral, wouldn‚Äôt the flomax have helped and not have given me retention? Why is it that when I strain I can get everything out, but when I relax I get only dribbles? No matter the medication, gabapentin, baclofen, Valium, they all make it impossible to strain to pee, and then I‚Äôm stick with only relax to pee, but then I only get a weak very incomplete stream if you can even call it that. Then the urge to pee just gets worse.\n\nIf I pee incompletely (like to double visit intentionally or if I lose focus while straining) my urethra becomes on fire. No one understands this and every doctor has just ignored this symptom because they don‚Äôt understand why it would only happen then. Oh and this incompleteness burning happens in the above scenario every time I tried medications that made me only pee Incompletely \n\nEverything I try is an utter failure. Ohhhh so baclofen will help? Botox? Gabapentin? All told me those would help, by everyone around the world, all utter failures.\n\nAnd the doctors just suck, but I also suck. They suck for just rotely suggesting the same three drugs until they‚Äôre blue in the face, or telling me ‚Äúwow you‚Äôve seen (insert number) doctors?‚Äù Then proceeds to judge me and not offer any further advice because they think I‚Äôm crazy for trying to find a doctor who effing understands and maybe, just maybe, could be helpful? I don‚Äôt even know if I should say I‚Äôve seen 6 doctors, more accurately I should say 2 and then 4 who said it‚Äôs in my head and I‚Äôm crazy because ‚Äúif they didn‚Äôt help, it must not be real!‚Äù\n\nBut I suck to. Maybe it‚Äôs my fault. Maybe I‚Äôm the problem since I can‚Äôt do a cystoscope or urodynamics or a uroflow. Cystoscope and urodynamics are impossible since I was already raped by that shit as a child and have severe PTSD from them. As for the uroflow, yet again here are doctors just being stubborn and refusing to believe me: I tell them: ‚Äúmy bladder literally will not pee at all even with straining on any toilet that isn‚Äôt my own, and with people around because I have severe shy bladder and if anything is near my labia like even a tampon string‚Äù, then they proceed to just ignore everything I says then say ‚Äú you have to do this uroflow test where you have to pee on this toilet that isn‚Äôt your own with stickers in your labia and butt all with people waiting on you in the room next door‚Äù. These people seem allergic to all the testing I am able to do, not once have they suggested a cat scan or mri. \n\nIs it PFD? CPPS? IC? VD? all of the above? A combo of some? No clue, no doctor has ever told me ‚Äúyou have x‚Äù, all I‚Äôve got is some doctors comments like ‚Äúhuh you‚Äôve got a tight pelvic floor‚Äù, or a-hole comments like ‚Äúyou need to stop thinking about it‚Äù.\n\nHome remedies have been no better. Lidocaine, magnesium, pumpkin seed oil, all just barely scratch the surface. I even got desperate and tried magic and religion, all for nothing.\n\nAt this rate I‚Äôm never going to leave my damn house. I‚Äôm a prisoner in my own bathroom. Unlike real prison where your body is locked up but your mind is free, not even my mind is free since it‚Äôs being assaulted by pain signals 24/7.\n\nI‚Äôll never get to have a job, let alone one I want. This problem has made me stupider, I used to be smart but I can‚Äôt think because of the pain any more. I‚Äôll never get to be a part of society, fine a husband, get married, go on vacation, have kids, oh man, no kids, the biggest hit to the stomach of all. All my life all I‚Äôve wanted was a family, but I can‚Äôt be a mother if I can‚Äôt even get up to grab a snack from the fridge once I‚Äôm sitting since otherwise pain will shoot through me and cripple me. I‚Äôd never be able to be a mother like this with how severe my case is. Not only that, who tf would even want to marry someone who can barely have sex because touching there just makes me feel like I need to piss and moving an inch does too?\n\nMy life is over, nothing is ever going to get better. I am a prisoner with no means of escaping. The only thing I haven‚Äôt tried is the only guaranteed and permanent one. Never did I think it would come to this, but I have no other option.\n\nYou win pelvic floor, you win. I surrender.\n\nI don‚Äôt see any other choice, now I‚Äôm just waiting for the courage to strike. \n\nEdit: ok yeah so I was right. The only option I have left is to allow myself to be raped again. Thanks but no thanks. Great to hear confirmation that I have no options left. Fucking Great. Awesome. ",

Just because things have not worked out yet, doesn‚Äôt mean the steps you‚Äôve taken for yourself are all for nothing. \n\nTo be completely honest, I did try suicide recently when I felt I had no hope of improving. Obviously I was unsuccessful. And I‚Äôm glad! \n\nIt felt like I had tried everything. There was one thing I wouldn‚Äôt let myself consider because of past traumas: internal work. I finally got desperate, did more research, and bought a wand and vaginal dilators. \n\nI talked with my PT and they showed me what to do on a model. I was very clear about my boundary: no internal work by anyone other than myself. They were supportive. \n\nIt‚Äôs been a lot of trial and error over the past couple weeks. At first, I had horrible flares. I didn‚Äôt give up, much like it sounds you‚Äôve done with various treatments before. This time I adapted my approach and found what has ultimately brought me so much relief:\n\n1. Meditation before any internal work\n2. Wand on vaginal opening and just inside. This preps for step 3\n3. Dilator insertion and usually another meditation, which preps for step 4\n4. Deeper wand work (this is where I‚Äôve gotten the most relief but also learned not to push it or else I‚Äôll flare pretty bad)\n\nNot every day is good but I‚Äôm actually feeling some hope again. I know this might not be what you need specifically but I wanted to tell you you aren‚Äôt alone. Maybe your thing-that-actually-helps will be right around the corner.\n\nEdit: OP, I saw your edit. I‚Äôm so sorry this didn‚Äôt bring you any hope. I had another idea for you: I couldn‚Äôt even start this until I reframed it mentally. Opting to have medical procedures rather than suffer in pain indefinitely isn‚Äôt rape. Yes, the motherfuckers who abused you probably caused all of this. I had to grieve so so so much. The pain is a constant reminder of what you‚Äôve been through. You‚Äôre probably experiencing trigger after trigger. I know I am. Reframing my healthcare decisions as MINE‚Äî not theirs!‚Äî has helped me see this as something other than rape, self care. Yes, you wouldn‚Äôt have to do any of this if your trauma had never happened. But you‚Äôre here now. You still have power. Every step you take toward healing takes the power back. \n\nSuicide completely makes sense in our situation‚Äî and it gives up your power forever. I wish you everything good in life. If karma were real, we‚Äôd both be living in paradise. So keep creating your own paradise. Keep showing yourself you have power.",

Yet still on the surface people would look at me and say how healthy I look. \n\nAs it comes to doctors I am convinced that most of them are just overpaid idiots, not dumb, but idiots. Meaning they dont care or want to look further into things, or to dive deeper into trying to get the anamnesis - diagnosis - prognosis of the chronically ill patient (that is not \"life threatened\" by the disease) right, for example. Ofc for this there are many reasons, but I feel your pain, the way the healthcare system has just abandoned us is just wrong. \n\nWhere I have found my strength is from the idea that \"what doesnt kill you gives you another chance\". I like it, it isnt this \"what doesnt kill you makes you stronger\" bullshit, bc every chronically ill knows that that just isnt the case. I have never felt so weak and unfree in my life as I have been when all this shit started to creep up on me. \n\nIf someone had told me a year ago, that I had r-cpd and pfd, and what I now know about the possible causes for them and treatments, I truly would not have believed you. At that time I thought that my issues were caused by the organs themselves (guts and bladder) bc that was where the pain, discomfort and problems manifested mostly.\n\nSo there has been progress, immense progress. Everyother day I still feel like giving up and ending it all, but at the same time I want to get through this, I want you also to get through this. \n\nSo I just want to say that please dont do it, I hope that this message can be taken as a shoulder to lean on, bc that is truly what we need and what we dont often have. The feeling of loneliness and having no one to turn to or get you is soul crushing, but I want to understand you and I feel like I do in my limited ways. There is always hope!",

Meds like gabapentin actually are only effective for like a very small percentage of people dealing with chronic illness or pain. The medical system is against us. Many of us watch shows like house MD where the doctors go to great lengths to figure out how to help a patient, but that‚Äôs never been the reality of actually having chronic pain or illness. Doctors aren‚Äôt going to tell you this, but it‚Äôs the overwhelming agreement of those who are suffering that most meds or remedies they perscribe don‚Äôt work for most people. I don‚Äôt know your exact situation or details of suffering but it‚Äôs really important not to let ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù gaslight you. Just because someone has a degree doesn‚Äôt mean they know what you are going though. I tried pelvic floor therapy, multiple meds, diet changes, so many things doctors recommended, and I can honestly say while I still suffer, it seems some of my symptoms just got better without explanation. I suffered for years and seriously considered suicide too, in fact my family had me in an institution for months because they were so sure I would off myself. Out of the dozens of doctors I spoke to, only one suggested my insanely painful struggles could be because of sexual trauma. The rest literally told me I just had anxiety and to try yoga or whatever.

Doctors suck at complex issues.\n\nI‚Äôve seen 4 urologists, 1 urgent care visit, 1 emergency visit, an osteo surgeon, 4 pelvic floor PTs and a regular PT. ‚Ä¶ so I get it.\n\nOnly think that‚Äôs helped me is working on glutes and hip flexors, CBD suppositories, doing the stretches in headache in a pelvis plus some other yoga stretches daily. I had to quit alcohol and masterbation ( initially for 2 months now I just do it sparingly and not with my hand).\n\nI get penis deformed shapes because of this issue like an hour glass when I‚Äôm semi erect.

I also have to take 2.5mg of Cialis daily now to maintain normal erection quality.\n\nThis issue started over a 2 week period and has lasted 8months now with 30% improvement after all ‚Äúthe help‚Äù.  I too doubt pelvic PT will ever fix this.  Maybe it would if more pelvic PTs understood what they are getting paid to do. They are too expensive for not knowing much about treatment.\nI‚Äôve been going for 7months I plateaud about 1 month in.  Yet they continue to try the same things.\n\nRead headache in a pelvis or listen on Spotify .. also try to ignore some of the shit about spending 4-8hrs a day for 6 months doing relaxation techniques‚Ä¶ no one has that kind of time. It‚Äôs insane they even put that in the book.\n\nTry CBD suppositories if you haven‚Äôt yet. Those were a game changer for me personally. My asshole stopped hurting/ aching all the time and my penis could relax easier. \n\nIf your female (sounds like it) consider antidepressant to down regulate your nervous system and ease the anxiety that drives this.\nMales are at high risk of losing ability to get erection so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend for guy.\n\nI‚Äôve kind of learned that doctors are not going to help me.

Your just another patient in a long line of patients. This sucks , but it is what it is. That‚Äôs not to say people in your life don‚Äôt care about you or love you.\n\nSuicide while it feels like a final solution to the pain. Really is usually more of a flailing thought about how to control the situation. The idea gives you power over your life again even if you don‚Äôt want to die really. \n\nI don‚Äôt want to die, I just want control of my body again. I want to be well. It‚Äôs an exhausting feeling.\n\nYou may very well get past this condition in the coming months or years if you find the right routine‚Ä¶if you kill yourself you‚Äôll never get there.\n\nHope you have some good days soon to bring back some energy to work on this without it dragging you down. 1 good emotional day gives me energy for 2-3 distress days. Right now my healing has been focused around doing things I think I can‚Äôt or shouldn‚Äôt do in order to break down the barriers I set for myself because of this condition.\n\nI‚Äôve been having sex (altered)\n\nI went to a 5 day music festival (took breaks a lot)\n\nI‚Äôm going to gym ( just benched 190 , can‚Äôt do much lower body but I do a little)\n\nI drank some low alcohol wine on the 4th \n( I can have 2 half glasses spread out)\n\nThings have only really started feeling better because I‚Äôm unwilling to let this ruin my life anymore.

That is typically taken for AGA. And honestly, if you feel like that COULD be the issue despite what your med team says consider swapping  it for saw palmetto. I have better results with it. I take a supplement with it and other goodies like biotin.\n\nThings you haven't yet tried, vit D, iron as previously stated and silica drops. Nizoral shampoo 2x per week (helps with fungal causes and AGA).  I know the minoxidil shed is scary. Let me put it in perspective. The phases of the hair (as I understand) without getting too technical are: growing, resting, and fall out. The hair lost when starting minoxidil are likely already in the resting phase when you start and have nothing else to do but fall out. They have to do so before the follicles can get back into the growing phase. So it gives the impression that the hair is getting worse when it is just the natural cycle. Other things to try to help blood flow and thus hair regrowth are those head massage things and microneedling. Do your homework on the last one. It isn't for the faint of heart and you have to suffer as anesthetics cause shock loss. Same for PRP/PRF injections. Hugs and best of luck!",

Dirty keto, that's delicious, I have some occasionally...\n\nTo be exact our conversation was about how I make every meal with a bunch of vegetables. To be honest I don't count carbs or calories of them. As long they're the ones I know they're safe like broccoli, asparagus, leafy greens, cauliflower, olives, cucumbers, zucchini (notice how they're all green) brussels, cabbage, etc.. in fact i don't really count macros or calories.. I have an OMAD diet and I quit snacking so it's hard for me to go over on calories.\n\nMy meal looks like this: a heaping plate of green vegetables, a source of protein be it a beef steak or chicken steak, usually pan fried on avocado oil, then I'll have 3 soft boiled eggs, and a drizzle of pumpkin seed oil, vinegar, or mayo, whatever I feel like.. I have a handful of raw almonds to go with it.. for my fats I'm having 2 bulletproof coffees in the morning cause one is just not enough..each of them takes 1TBSP of butter, 1 tbsp of ghee and 1 tbsp of MCT oil and a little erythritol. \n\n\nIs my diet a dirty diet? Please someone help clarify this.. FYI I'm losing a bunch of weight and my medical issues have all but disappeared, my lifestyle is clearly working wonders regardless on the label but I would still like to know. Just in case anyone ever asks me, I'd like to share Oh I'm doing dirty keto..or whatever.. thanks for your input.",

Trust me, I tried all the diets and protocols that I read about in books and blogs or heard about in podcasts and YouTube videos. I spent a small fortune on my gut in the last couple of years. I wish I could get it all back and could have tried this first.  What finally fixed my gut? Andreas Seed Oils ([https://andreasseedoils.com](https://andreasseedoils.com)). I don't really know where I heard of or read about the company, and I promise, I'm not advertising or affiliated with them at all, but I'm very thankful I found them. I was so skeptical I almost didn't place the order. But I was  desperate and fed up, I thought maybe I'll just try one more thing and it probably won't work. But dang, if it didn't do the trick. \n\nI read about the founder's background story with Crohn's disease and figured if it could help with that awful disease, maybe it could help with stubborn SIBO.  I had combination, but methane dominant with terrible constipation, but sometimes diarrhea. Full disclosure, I also take prucalopride (Motegrity in the US, Resolor in other countries). This did help with the constipation along with some unique probiotics. I take one called Seed DS-01¬Æ Daily Synbiotic and another called Pendulum Metabolic Daily. The prucalopride I purchase through Canada via Marks Marine Pharmacy ([canshipmeds.com](https://canshipmeds.com)) and that is also who I ordered the Rifaximin through, because both are so expensive in the US. Mark's Marine Pharmacy is great! I ordered the cheaper versions from India for both meds. The prucalopride I use is called Pruease. I've been taking it for about six months, but unfortunately, just getting my motility improved did not solve my problem. I do plan to continue the prucalopride for now because I fear I have permanent damage to my Migrating Motor Complex (MMC) from Celiac. But I may stop the Seed probiotic when I run out. I plan to continue the Pendulum Metabolic Daily for now.\n\nI ordered Pumpkin Seed Oil, Flax Seed Oil, Coriander Seed Oil, Black Cumin Seed oil, and Fennel Seed oil. The combo was called The Immunity Booster Bundle. I purchased it right before Christmas and it was on sale for $152.00, which is not bad compared to what I have spent on supplements and drugs. I received them quickly and started just the pumpkin and flax the first couple of days and added the others one at a time at 1 tsp a day and quickly went to 2 tsp/day because my body's response was so positive. I love the taste of the pumpkin and flax oils. The others aren't yummy but don't taste horrible. I don't put them in water because it left so much residue on the glass. I want every drop! It worked immediately. Within a few days, the bloating and gas went away completely. Before, I could not eat or have a cup of coffee without my stomach immediately blowing up. I love coffee in the morning, but it was really doing a number on my stomach! Now, I can have a cup of coffee and not worry about my stomach blowing up. \n\nWe just returned from a week on the island of Roatan, Honduras and my stomach did not blow up once. Because of the restrictions on liquids with air travel, and that I was afraid the bottles would just get broken, I didn't take any of the oils for the week we were away. I was  worried about travel and my stomach, but it was fine. We rented a villa on the beach and I cooked 90% of our meals because I don't trust restaurants to fully understand the gluten-free diet and preparation requirements to avoid cross-contamination.\n\nI can't believe I can say that I am pretty much back to normal. As I said, I have Celiac disease and Hashimoto's, two of the risk factors for slow motility which can allow SIBO to take hold. I am also a female over 50- aging is also a risk factor and as is being post-menopausal. So, I am going to keep taking these oils. I just purchased a couple of bottles of the Five Seed Oil Blend. I plan to use that as a maintenance oil as I run out of the individual oils. You can also use the oils on foods, like in a salad dressing, for example. The cumin seed oil can be stirred into guacamole or anything cold that you would season with cumin.  \n\nI know we are all different, and what works for one may not work for another, but I can't believe something so simple could make such a difference. And I feel good that it is something healthy for me instead of more antibiotics or antimicrobials. Do your own research. As a side note, I had tried various polyphenols supplements in capsules such as black cumin seed, pomegranate extract, resveratrol, etc. but never noticed a difference. I think the cold pressing and careful processing that this company  does makes the difference. I wish you all good luck and healing! ",

Both of them are suitable for oily skin.\n\nPomegranate oil is very expensive and thicker than maple syrup. It must be diluted with another carrier oil - no more than 20%, I think... Or that is 10%? It's really pointless to use it for OCM. Use it as a moisturizer. \n\nPumpkin seed oil is very rich and shouldn't use more than 10%.

    "body": "Hey /r/ketorecipes/,\n\nhonestly...I was never really *good* at eating loads of vegetables. I cook once a day, but that meal is more a meat/egg and overall fat based meal. I usually just eat a small salad (100g of rucola or lettuce) with it.\n\nI tried to get into the habit of making a greens smoothie daily before, but I always failed keeping it up for more than a few days. I now realize that my approach was wrong. I used to prepare the smoothies fresh every day, which was too much of a hassle to wash, cut, peel the different ingredients each day and a lot of them did go bad in the fridge fairly quickly. So it never became a habit that stuck.\n\nAs for now I came up with a different plan: I'm going to prepare the ingredients in advance for 4-7 days and throw them in the freezer pre-portioned. As summer is coming that might become a welcome refreshment after my morning workout.\n\n**The recipe I came up with is the following:**\n\n* 50g celery \n* 50g leafy spinach (frozen cubes)\n* 30g kale (frozen cubes)\n* 50g cucumber\n* 50g brocoli\n* 5-10g cress\n* 5-10g parsley\n* 5g ginger\n* 30g (1/3 of a medium size) green & unripe banana (for the resistant starches! The carbs won't be processed as \"sugary\" carbs)\n* 10g (1/4) of a lime without the peel\n* 50g coconutmilk (creamy)\n* 10ml MCT oil\n* 1g maca powder \n* 10ml low-carb sirup, flavor \"green apple\"\n* water\n\nThat's Roughly: 300 calories, 20g fat, 7g carbs and 7g protein.\n\n\n**Preparation:**\n\nI washed and cut the vegetables, I only skinned the two fruits and ginger and portioned everything in separate freezer bags, I even scooped the 50g of creamy coconutmilk (it's more a paste) right into the freezer bag. \nI then mixed the MCT oil, maca powder and sirup for 4 days in a jar and added a bit of water. After shaking it well I poured it into a ice cube tray to make it easier to portion. I guess tomorrow, when the ice cubes are frozen I will just add them to the pre-prepped freezer bags for the next days.\n\nMaking the smoothie will be as easy as never before. I'll just have to grab the freezer bag and dump the frozen ingredients into the blender (not a juicer! I want all those celluloses and fibers), add a bit of luke-warm water and blend till creamy-drinkable. Done. :)\n\nBy eliminating the last remaining hassle, that the liquid ingredients needed to be added daily, I have found ways around any potential obstacle.\n\n**Reasoning for the choice of ingredients:**\n\nAs there are not a lot of fruits in there (gotta keep it keto-friendly!) the taste won't be the most delicious in the world, I have to admit. I added a bit of flavor with the green apple sirup concentrate for convenience and to cater for my sweet tooth, but it wasn't too bad without it either. It just really tasted very \"green and leafy\". So not something to look forward to, bad not insufferable either.\n\nI tried to keep the amount of kale fairly low, as its taste is quite dominating. I also tried to neutralize it with the parsley and ginger, as their essential oils can tame other overpowering tastes. And of course Parsley is an all in all vitamin and mineral wonder. And ginger is known for its effect to reduce inflammation (and so much more).\n\nKale of course as a major source of anti-oxidants and for it's overall rumored health benefits (anti-cancer, urinary benefits etc.).\n\nSpinach is in there for vitamins and minerals (spinach: iron especially), so is the cucumber. I like to keep the variety of vegetables fairly high, to be honest.\n\nBroccoli is in there for its sulforaphane, which is supposed to be a cancer inhibitor. Cress is supposed to enhance this effect. \n\nCelery is mainly there to add some more fiber to the mix and add a bit of bitter-sweetness that I personally like a lot.\n\nI added the MCT oil for some quick energy boost and the coconutmilk for taste and to provide energy over the next couple of hours after drinking the smoothie. In addition the high fat content of both of them allows for fat soluble nutrients to bind to them.\n\nThe lime is mainly there for taste, and as it's acidity is supposed to keep a blood-level glucose spike moderate. Drinking the smoothie is still a 7g carb intake all at once. If you stick to the ketogenic diet closely that could be 1/3 of your overall daily carbs in one sitting. I might experiment with higher amounts of lime in the smoothie.\n\nThe green unripe banana is great source of resistant starches, which pass the small intestines and help to improve colon bacteria. I noticed a significant improvement of my gut, after I introduced them into my diet. I can't eat unripe bananas, due to the starchy feeling in my mouth, but mixed in a smoothie it's alright. I try to keep the amount as low as possible to just have the benefits of the resistant starch and not accidentally get too many carbs into my diet.\n\n\n**Potential future additions**\n\nI'm thinking about adding 5ml of flax seed oil (otherwise unbearable taste), half a sheet of sea-weed, a few pistachio and pumpkin seeds (or a bit pumpkin seed oil) and maybe some green tea powder (macha) into the mix.\n\nFurther more I'm trying to find banana flour to replace the unripe bananas with, as it reduces the risk to go overboard carb-wise if they accidentally already are too ripe, but yet I wasn't successful in finding it locally.\n\nAnd I'm considering throwing in a few mungo beans or broccoli sprouts, if I can get them.\n\n\n**What I didn't include, because I eat regularly**\n\nAvocado, it would work great in the smoothie, but I usually eat half a avocado a day with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt and chia seeds as a snack. And honestly I think that adding half an avocado makes it too heavy. It's already a large and very satiating amount. Adding yet another 160 calories (9g carbs, 15g fat, 2g protein for half an avocado) seems to be too much.\n\nAnd blueberries, because my late night snack usually is 150g of greek yoghurt with 50g of blueberries, sesame seeds and a teaspoon of honey, if my macros still allow for it.\n\n**Your opinion?**\n\nWhat is missing, what would you add?\nWhat is your opinion in general?\n\nKeep in mind I want this to be a \"no-brainer\" fuel food that takes almost no time to make daily (a bit of time to prepare for a week in advance) is fairly cost efficient and provides one with the most essential and the most beneficial nutrients. ‚Äì For convenience and peace of mind living healthy. :)\n\nThanks in advance",

If you are concerned about covering up the unpreffered flavor of kale or other greens some cayenne powder or liquid cayenne extract goes a long way to cover that up.

        "body": "**Update:**\n\nAfter getting the ingredients yesterday and portioning the freezer bags for 4 days accordingly, as well as preparing the \"liquid pre-mix ice cubes\", I felt like I should report back with some pictures.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/uETAWb5.png ‚Äì Freezer bag contents (~500g without additional liquid)\n\nhttp://imgur.com/9B61KPg.png ‚Äì Almost fills my 800ml (27 fl oz) shaker entirely\n\nhttp://imgur.com/vvftCs7.png ‚Äì All blended up with roughly added 250ml additional warm water\n\nI was surprised how well the bananas held up in the freezer, almost no browning at all. Still going to switch to 1-2 tablespoons of banana flour in the long run.\n\n**Things to improve:**\n\n* My freezer does a pretty darn good job in turning whatever you put in it into rock-solid icy blocks. I wasn't able to blend the mix at all for about 1-1.5h. I don't want to throw them into the microwave to defrost, as I am fairly certain that the rapid heat increase will kill some of the beneficial nutrients and enzymes. So I'm going to take them out tomorrow before my workout and just let them thaw at room temperature.\n* It is just too much...eating 500g of raw veggies in one sitting is a whole lot. I might decrease the amount of veggies to 2/3s, whilest keeping the amount of MCT oil and coconut milk as it is and see if that makes it easier.\n* I'll have to create the liquid pre-mix ice cubes with less water, which will decrease the overall required storage volume in my limited freezer. Today I needed 7 of those ice cubes, because I added a lot of water being afraid the oily-mix wouldn't freeze well on it's own.\n* I might look into adding some form of protein (either simple whey, BCAAs) and/or creatine to the mix. Going to have to check if adding it to the ice cubes would be a feasible way or if freezing does harm the amino acids.\n* I'm taking alpha lipoic acid on recommendation of my dermatologist to improve skin quality. I might look into integrating it straight into the mix in powder form, once my supply of pills exceeds.\n\nSo far so good :)",

I have been on topical Minoxidil since the age of 16 as well. My brother went bald and lost all of his hair by age 17 so there is definitely some genetic component. At age 20, I was finally diagnosed with PCOS and went on a ketogenic diet that I have maintained for 11 years now (aged 31). \n\nI began Spironolactone in 2020 and got up to 100mg QD but didn‚Äôt notice much difference. I finally sought dermatologic care in July where I was diagnosed with chronic TE and FPHL. The Derm said there was no point in scalp Bx because the treatment would be the same. In July 2023, I added oral minoxidil 2.5mg PO QD and my spiro was increased to 200mg QD. I continued my regimen of weekly microneedling with my Dr. Pen A6 + 12 needle cartridges, twice weekly Nizarol shampoo, daily Inositol use, pumpkin seed oil pills, and Nutrafol.\n\nI also did a round of PRP for my hair in January and had a horrible dread shed. I recently went back to the Derm last month and asked to add Dutasteride. He also prescribed me another topical containing  minoxidil, spironolactone, dutasteride, and tretinoin.\n\nI am barely seeing progress and growing increasing frustrated and sad. I finally bought my first hair topper from Uniwigs and wear it often. I am maybe 25% the density I had prior to the hair loss that began in puberty. I am just so sad and feel desperate that these modalities don‚Äôt seem to be working. I am a physician myself and have the resources and connections but still continue to progress despite treatment.",

    "body": "**TLDR:** Lock & load is cheaper and more convenient than buying the ingredients yourself, in my experience. ($1.92 daily vs $2.94 daily)\n\nBefore the release of Lock & Load, many people on this sub suggested simply buying all of the ingredients separately, in order to avoid whatever markup would likely be put on the official product. Being that I already had Sunflower Lecithin, Pygeum, Zinc, and L-Arginine, I decided to fill in the rest of the ingredients list, via Amazon, once Lock & Load released. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that I‚Äôm in Canada and your personal mileage may vary on any of the costs I encountered. Of course I ended up with bottles containing varying amounts of pills/capsules and for different prices across the board. This was just the pricing I ended up with, after selecting products that were reasonably priced and seemed to come from reputable brands. I broke the prices down to cost per day to compare. \n\n**Amazon:**\n\nVitamin E - $8.04 - 60 days ~ $0.13 daily\n\nZinc - $7.99 - 180 days ~ $0.04 daily\n\nSelenium - $8.13 - 45 days ~ $0.18 daily\n\nVitamin D3 - $6.64 - 65 days ~ $0.10 daily\n\nSunflower Lecithin - $14.99 - 33 days $0.45 daily\n\nL-Lysine - $9.83 - 100 days ~ $0.10 daily\n\nPygeum - $25.99 -16 days ~ $1.62 daily\n\nL-Arginine - $32.49 - 100 days ~ $0.32 daily\n\n**Daily total: $2.94**\n\n**Gorilla Mind:**\n\nLock & Load - $35.10 (after using code PKA)\n\nRoute Package Protection - $0.98\n\nShipping - $21.59\n\n**Daily total: $1.92**\n\n**Daily total if I ordered 2 to mitigate shipping cost per item: $1.54 daily**\n\n\nPygeum stuck out like a sore thumb when I was doing the math for this. The one that I bought also contains Saw Palmetto, and Pumpkin Seed Oil, which possibly is the cause for the much higher price. I couldn‚Äôt find a reputable listing on Amazon that sells Pygeum on its own. It‚Äôs worth noting that with my cost per day for Pygeum, I‚Äôm only getting 100mg compared to the 200mg in Lock & Load. I didn‚Äôt want to take 8 pygeum capsules daily because it would go against the recommended dosage on the bottle, and that would be very expensive and inconvenient.\n\nAfter all that autism I had my answer, Lock & Load would‚Äôve been cheaper for me than buying the supplements and vitamins separately. Aside from that, I have to take 18 pills/capsules daily compared to the 9 from Lock & Load. To keep all of that organized, I had to make a chart of how many of each item to take daily, and get a large pill organizer to make things easier on myself. I‚Äôve only started taking everything yesterday so I cannot speak to how effective the product is, but I recommend buying the official product over trying to get everything yourself. Get out there and fill some deep, deep belly buttons up kids.",

Finally, a month ago I went to see a dermatologist who specializes in hair loss. She did a few blood tests to make sure it wasn‚Äôt an autoimmune issue and put me on ketoconazole shampoo 2.5%. (It‚Äôs also reduced scalp itch and dandruff that I couldn‚Äôt get under control.) I‚Äôve been using it 3x a week, along with daily pumpkin seed oil supplements and have noticed a DRASTIC shift in the amount of hair shedding.  This week I had less hair shedding in 3 washes than I did in 1 wash previously. I never thought of going to a derm for this but recently saw someone mention it on TikTok and it was easy to find someone through ZocDoc. I hope this helps someone! \n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention that the shampoo has a DHT blocker in it which is incredibly helpful for those with PCOS, which is why it tends to work so well. ",

    "body": "Hair fall or thinning hair is a very common problem among both men and women although men are much more affected by hair problems due to their genetics and hormones. I did suffer from a lot of hair fall but I managed to save most of my hair using the methods that I will explain below. \n\nThere are many reasons which could lead to thin hair or hair fall. Now I am going to tell the common reasons hair fall and what natural things a person can do to treat it.\n\n1. Genetic¬†- This is mainly due to the effects of a hormone called Dihydrotestosterone or DHT which when in excess in the body can result in the miniaturization of the hair follicles on the scalp. How DHT will affect the hair in adulthood is largely determined by genetics and the only FDA approved treatment for this are Finasteride and Minoxidil which work but can have a lot of side effects.\n\nHow to deal with genetic hair loss\n\nThis is certainly the most difficult type of hair fall to treat but still there are a few things that people can try.\n\nRegular scalp massage¬†- In a study performed on Japanese male participants it was noted that after 24 weeks of regular massaging their hair they had an increase in hair thickness and experienced less hair fall.\n\nNatural DHT blocking hair oils -¬†Natural DHT blocking hair oils like Pumpkin seed oil and Rosemary oil in scientific studies have been shown to reduce the effects of dihydrotestosterone on the scalp and thus can help with thicker hair growth and less hair fall.\n\nNow you can combine the above two methods for more powerful results. Use DHT blocking hair oils mentioned to massage the scalp regularly.\n\nUse a DHT blocking Shampoo -¬†Instead of using any regular shampoo switch to a mild DHT blocking shampoo. This will also help in reducing the accumulation of DHT in the hair follicles and lead to strong and healthy hair.\n\n2.¬†Nutritional -¬†A lot of people must have heard the term that you are what you eat and it's totally true. Hair loss is very strongly related to poor nutrition. A study performed on Indian participants who had some type of hair loss noticed that nearly every participant in the study has some or the other form of nutritional deficiency. Some of the most common nutritional deficiencies were Iron, zinc, protein, omega-3, copper, etc.\n\nHow to deal with nutritional hair loss\n\nThis is much easier to treat than the genetic hair fall and just if a person pays attention to what they eat on a regular basis can make a huge difference.\n\nNon-vegetarians should go for foods like fish, chicken, eggs and green vegetables to get their daily protein and all the essential nutrients that I mentioned above.\n\nWhereas Vegetarians should include foods like Soyabean, chickpeas, cottage cheese and veggies to get all the required protein and essential nutrients.\n\nVegans should be specially careful as restricted diet can lead to nutritional deficiencies in the body. Vegans should eat tofu, soyabean, lentils for protein and also consider supplementing with a quality multivitamin since some vitamins like B12 are very hard to get from the vegan diet.\n\n3.¬†Stress¬†- Stress can not only wreck havoc on the hair but the entire body and the bad thing is not all type of stresses in life are avoidable like a rough break up or death of a loved one etc. But the good thing is stress related hair loss is mostly reverseable and when the stress levels of a person goes down their hair in most cases start regrowing.\n\nHow to deal with hair loss related to stress\n\nPractice relaxation techniques like meditation and regular deep breathing when going through stressful situations. Also workout on a regular basis as it helps in lowering stress levels.\n\n4.¬†Medication -¬†Many people have¬†health¬†problems for which they use a variety of medicines and some of these medicines can cause hair loss. Certain antibiotics, anti depressants, anti convulsant, weight loss medicines etc. can all cause hair loss. But similarly to the stress induced hair loss this type of hair loss is generally reversable when a person stops using the medicine.\n\nHow to deal with medicine related hair loss\n\nAsk the doctor if an alternative to the medicine is available that is hair friendly.\n\n5.¬†Unnecessary styling -¬†Using a lot of chemical products on hair can lead to hair fall and many other scalp problems. Styling the hair on an occasion once in a while is understandable but regularly doing so can cause unnecessary hair problems which are easily avoidable.\n\nHow to deal with styling related hair loss\n\nThis is the easiest type of hair fall to treat just start using less chemical products to style the hair and within a month there will be noticible changes.",

        "body": "Agree. If we know anything about this condition it's how variable it is between individuals. One of my biggest pet peeves is around the diet. I see a lot of people on IC forums being dogmatic about it, telling others that they MUST follow the diet. If someone responds or posts to say that diet doesn't seem to make much difference they say 'oh you must still be eating 'bad' things you need to be even stricter / you mustn't have been doing it for long enough you need to follow it for longer', it never ends. Yes diet helps a lot of people but it isn't a factor for everyone. The fact that my IC isn't getting better isn't because I'm still eating tomatoes or having caffeine occasionally, and I don't appreciate being made to feel guilty that I'm doing those things.\n\nAnother thing I see a bit is disdain towards others for taking prescription meds or having surgical procedures. It's fine to have a preference for so-called 'natural' therapies and to give suggestions (I won't go on a rant about the problems with defining what is 'natural' and the fact that supplements are still medications and can have their own side effects and issues), but it's not fine to tell people point blank that anything else is bad and dangerous. Things are very rarely black and white when it comes to this condition, and unfortunately the difficulty in finding treatments that work and the fact that most treatments don't have much evidence behind them creates an environment where personal views and judgements can become problematic.\n\nHaving said that, I have also observed that the problematic things I've seen in IC forums are generally far outweighed by people showing non-judgemental, positive support and empathy and respectful sharing of information.",

I've been crafting this review over like a week or two now, and honestly it got pretty fricken long, so i'm gonna cut it into two parts. Some of you may have already seen similar reviews to what's here from me because i've been floating around and talking about these scents a lot; consider this THE OFFICIAL DOCUMENT.\n\nThis is part one: BODY OIL AND PERFUME-A BONANZA.\n\n**First off, a couple notes on Hexennacht's body oils:** they're really lovely. They recently underwent a change in formula, switching out Pumpkin Seed Oil for Hemp Oil, and I know I saw some people mention they were worried about it giving a nutty tinge to the scents. The good news is, i've got like five different Hex body oils at this point due to various circumstances, and none of them go nutty on me. Nothing to worry about there!\n\nThis oil is rich and lovely and soaks into my skin very very quickly - I have a lot of sensory issues with oils and lotions, I HATE feeling greasy, and i'm happy to report this does not leave me feeling this way. Makes my skin nice n' soft and saves me from itchy winter-weather hell - except on my hands, unfortunately, which are evidently the thirstiest things known to man and constantly just feel a little bit dry. (This makes sense, though - I cook a lot and wash my hands like 80 times a day.)\n\nThese also are very, very strongly scented - Caroline posted in the FB group that she did this to make triple sure that no nuttiness could be detected in the oils. I wouldn't say these are overwhelmingly strong, but like... I put these on and i'm in a beaaauutiful haze of scent. In one case, it had my sheets smelling faintly of it for the next two days. Some scents are stronger/more long-lasting than others. If you got a super sniffer, be cognizant. (I do not have a super sniffer.)\n\nSo, with that out of the way, let's move on to the actual scents: **Corpse Bride**, **Morphine**, **Pearanormal Activity**, and **The Grady Twins**.\n\n\\--\n\n**CORPSE BRIDE (BODY OIL)**\n\nNOTES: *Black roses, white amber, damp earth, vanilla, tonka, musk.*\n\nIN THE BOTTLE: Super pretty. This smells surprisingly green and fresh and just a little bit sweet.\n\nON THE SKIN: The vanilla really comes out on my skin pretty hard - and it's weird, depending on where on my skin I sniff, i'll get different notes. I sniff my hands, and I get fresh rose and vanilla. I sniff on my forearm? Fresh dirt. But i'm definitely detecting a lot of different notes here.\n\nThe rose is REALLY good - like, very realistic, sort've green like a freshly-clipped stem, incredibly pleasant floral. The dirt in conjunction with this makes it smell like you're walking through a small rose garden - and then there's clouds of vanilla wafting through that garden. Admittedly, the vanilla seemed a little powdery on me - my SO went in for a hug and asked why I smelled like baby powder - but I didn't hate it. I'm curious to try this out as a perfume.\n\nThis was VERY, VERY STRONG. I was floating in a cloud of roses and vanilla. It was really nice. Also, this lasts... Super long. I put it on the evening before, went to bed, got in the shower, and WOOMF. As the water hit me, all the scent wafted up in this MASSIVE wave. This is also the scent that my sheets ended up smelling like for a couple days.\n\nRATING: **4/5**. I like this a lot, but it's not quite an all-the-time thing for me - I gotta really be in the mood for it. It's a very pretty bedtime scent, though. I just wish the vanilla didn't go powdery on me.\n\n\\--\n\n**MORPHINE (BODY OIL)**\n\nNOTES: *Steamed milk, lavender buds, honeyed apricots, chamomile tea, honey, white amber.*\n\nIN THE BOTTLE: Bright. Like it's like this cool sweetness that almost smells drinkably delicious, and then it's just got this bright, buttery note sitting on top of it that makes me think of maple syrup... But without the maple. I've described the smell before as 'it's like if maple syrup had fruit instead of maple', and by god, i'm standing by it.\n\nON THE SKIN: This is creamy and so sugary-sweet. The steamed milk gives it this lovely silkiness, and the honeyed apricots/honey give it that sugary, buttery brightness, and then the other notes sit under it like this beautifully blended soothingly sweet mystery where it's hard to pick out any one note. This is more buttery in the bottle than it is on my skin, but that butteriness doesn't entirely go away. I smell like... A sugary, sparkly, but just a HINT sleepy fairy.\n\nI feel like this is toeing the line of being cloying - like, i'll sit there and think, boy, this might be TOO sweet for me... But then i'll just keep HUFFING it. What's sitting underneath that bright honeyed butteriness is so pretty, it's worth it. I think it's safe to say that I like this, and it's juuust short of being too much. I keep wanting to use it as a sleep scent, I think I can get away with it, but it's a hint too bright - I tend to just slather it on my hands and call it a day rather than covering my whole body with it. That's enough for me.\n\nThis lasts on me for a good several hours, but not into the morning like Corpse Bride does.\n\nRATING: **3.8/5**. This is a really lovely. If you like real sweet, creamy scents, if you like that BUTTERINESS (which is, honestly, the only note that gives me pause), this will be good for you.\n\nI'm tired of saying the word 'buttery' now.\n\n\\--\n\n**PEARANORMAL ACTIVITY (PERFUME OIL, BODY OIL)**\n\nNOTES: *Bone-white amber, spectral musk, comice pear, ozone.*\n\nIN THE BOTTLE: Oh... So pretty. Mostly it's tart, crisp pear, but the amber and ozone lift it up into the air and make it this delicious, cool scent. My roommate smelled it and said they wanted to drink it. \n\n(Disclaimer: plz don't drink the perfume :()\n\nIMMEDIATE APPLICATION (BECAUSE I AM A GOON): So, in the perfume oil, this was actually a little less airy on initial application - the musk comes out more, but it's mostly just a very nice pear scent. And it's like... I wouldn't say it's a particularly green pear - it's closer to the smell of the innards of a pear, or like, pear juice.\n\nAFTER RESTING: This is so good. The amber and ozone are back after resting, and this basically smells like it does in the bottle: pear at the forefront, cool airy atmosphere in the back that play a stunning supporting cast. It almost smells... Thirst-quenching? Like go watch a 5 gum commercial for something minty - it smells like that feels. Cool and refreshing pear juice.\n\n(Disclaimer no. 2: PLZ do not drink the perfume.)\n\nSmells the same in both perfume oil and body oil. Lasts for a good several hours going strong as a perfume - as a body oil, the scent fades within two hours.\n\nRATING: **5/5**. Love this mfer. Jumped up to my top five scents the moment I sniffed it. \n\n\\--\n\n**THE GRADY TWINS (PERFUME OIL, BODY OIL)**\n\nNOTES: *Apothecary lavender, violet candies, wood, metal.*\n\nIN THE BOTTLE: Perfume oil? Violet candies. Body oil? Apothecary lavender.\n\nIMMEDIATE APPLICATION (BECAUSE I AM A GOON): Basically just the in-the-bottle smell but on my skin. The perfume oil was STRAIGHT violet candies at first, which honestly? Wasn't wild about. The body oil, however, was almost entirely sharp, medicinal lavender, with a SLIGHT tang of metal, and was so harsh on my nose I was like, dang, idk if i'm gonna be able to wear this like ever.\n\nAFTER RESTING: So, if it wasn't apparent, i've had a very interesting time with this particular perfume/body oil. Depending on the format, they came from opposite ends of the spectrum and ended up meeting in the middle-ish. Funny how that happens.\n\nThe perfume is very medicinal lavender-forward now but the violet candies, which are much harder to detect at first, temper it some - it's sitting just on the edge of being so sharp it's headache-inducing and those candies hold it back, make it a little sweeter. As it dries, the candies come out more. I don't detect much in the way of metal, and the wood's just faintly there far in the background.\n\nThe body oil is almost straight violet candies now, with just a hint of lavender sitting on it. My roommate says it smells like baby powder. ...I... Don't think I actually know what baby powder smells like - I don't think i've ever used it in my 26 years of life, somehow...\n\nThe perfume's stronger than the body oil, but they both start fading after about an hour and a half - the perfume smoothing out some as previously mentioned, and the body oil being almost imperceptible.\n\nRATING: **3/5** for the perfume, **2/5** for the body oil. With the notes combined it's not so bad, but i'm not a big fan of the forward-facing (evidently baby powderish) violet candy note. I also wish I could detect the wood and metal a bit more.\n\n\\--\n\nStay tuned for PART TWO where I review **The Bell Witch, Evening Star** and **Holy Water**!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

Overtime, this causes the hair to get lower nutrients from blood and oxygen, which in turn causes hair follicle to minaturize after every hair cycle until it can't pass through the skin, therefore causing hair loss. Now, from what I have briefly researched is that foods can have natural DHT blockers, which will in turn help with hairloss. I understand there are drugs more concentrated to battle hair loss and this is not a hidden gem that will make bald males have luscious locks. But this could be used for mild or moderate hair loss and in case of aggresive hair loss, be used with the drugs such as Minoxidil and/or Finasteride.\n\nNow that I got that out of the way.

My figure was curvy, my skin was clear, my hair was great. I started to suffer from severe dry eye, low libido, low testosterone, and anxiety attacks. I eventually came off both in September 2022.\n\n It‚Äôs been 11 months now off all my pills and I have lost SO much of my hair, got acne, irregular periods, body hair  :( I really thought my PCOS would regulate and that I could go ‚Äúnatural‚Äù and take vitamins and exercise and eat healthy. I have ‚Äúskinny PCOS‚Äù and don‚Äôt think I have insulin resistance. I tried all the holistic approaches, pumpkin seed oil, zinc, multivitamins, low carb, all the methods to get my period back, manage PCOS and grow my hair back. I have low progesterone and low estrogen and this is causing my testosterone to dominate, giving me AGA induced hair loss. \n\nI eventually came to terms with the fact that I will never really get to be natural. My body is sick. And I need pills and that‚Äôs OK. \n\nIn May I went back to the dermatologist, started 50 mg Spiro and 2% keto shampoo. I was doing fine, but just last week I started shedding again like crazy. Is there a dread shed associated with Spiro? Why would I suddenly be shedding 3 months into treatment? \n\nIs there any hope for me? Should I go back on birth control? Should I increase my Spiro dose? I‚Äôm hoping I can reverse all this if I fix my estrogen levels and catch it in time as it hasn‚Äôt even been 1 year since I lost it all. I am contemplating looking into HRT such as estrogen creams transdermally or pills. Do you think this could grow my hair? I see lots of posts in the Trans support groups about how HRT helped women grow their hair back. \n\nI don‚Äôt want to start minox because I know my root cause is hormonal imbalance. \n\nPlease help :( PCOS sucks.

I hope that this post can help someone dealing with this.\n\nMy symptoms for ICS luckily do not include pain or burning. Instead, my issues center around frequency, urgency, and bladder/urethra spasms. At my worst, I would pee every 45 minutes. It's normally an hour or every hour and a half. I'm an insomniac because of this (getting up to pee frequently at night and averaging 4 hours or less of sleep).\n\nOn whim, I ordered Swanson Pumpkin Seed Oil capsules on Amazon because I saw someone recommend them on this sub. It's less than $10 so I figured it was worth a try. I've spent A LOT of money on supplements. I'm used to things failing on me and expected no different from it. \n\nWhen I tell you that this worked IMMEDIATELY...WOW. It's been 2 weeks and it's changed my life so much. Without this, my symptoms do come back...but not as strongly as before. When I feel the signs, I immediately take 2 capsules. I take 2 in the morning, 2 in the afternoon, and 2 before bed. I am now averaging 6 hours of sleep. Sometimes I get over 7 hours, too üòÅ. I now wake up to pee once or twice at night. Before, if I woke up once, I could not go back to sleep because my body would not relax since I would have to pee again soon. Now I can go back to sleep and stay asleep. It means the world to me to be able to sleep.\n\nSo that's it! It's by no means a cure, but this is as close to normal as I've felt in years. Please give it a try! I'm still going to look into physical therapy EVENTUALLY just to improve my life even more.",

I have this MBP according to my dermatologist but I loose a bit of hair on the side of my head.\n\nHere's what I tried :\n\n* Aaaalll the natural stuff during at least 3 months each (Essential oils, saw palmetto, nettle root, pumpkin seed oil, onion + garlic...). Just BS without any results.\n* All the Hairguard stuff with the Bludflow theory. BS\n* PRP once a month during 5 months : Help just a bit by reducing hair loss.\n* Minoxidil doesn't work for me after 9 months (tried 5 months on derma pen 1.5mm and 8 months with tretinoine)\n* 9 months on fin still no result ( EDIT : it helps a bit but not enough)\n* 9 months of Pantostin + serioxyl... No improvement (let's say 5%)\n\nAnd here you might think \"waaa this dude doesn't have any luck\" or \"obviously, it's not MBP\".\n\nWait, it's not over !\n\nI tried RU58841 during 2 months and a half, it was effective BUT I had sides (heart beat) during the last 2 weeks. I don't want to die, so I stopped.\n\nAnd here I am !\n\nI ordered some Eucapil to give a try. I am waiting for it, I am very confident about it if RU58841 worked for me.\n\nSo I stick with Fin (I still have 5 months supply) and wait for this eucapil. I will mix with my Pantostin just to finish it.   Almost 4 years of search now !\n\nI don't give up ! No body succeed by giving up !\n\nI really hope nobody experiments the same journey...\n\nPS : I'm French. It's a nightmare to fight hair loss here. Nothing about Pantostin, tretinoine, ketoconazole shampoo, RU58841 ... Those products are not sell here.\n\nEverybody tells you to take some natural stuff... Oh ! And I don't speak about my dermatologist that was sure that Finasteride is bad and gave me just minoxidil.\n\nHopefully, I understand English and was able to have good information (Thank you, Kevin Mann).",

Eucapil is hydrophobic and I believe pantostin contains water ? So basically as soon as it's in touch with water, it won't work anymore. Make sure you apply it on a dry scalp and do not mix it with anything that contains water.\n\nGood luck for the rest... I'm on my month 2 on eucapil, started pantostin last week. Crossing fingers it'll work for me too....\n\nNb : Keep that box of eucapil in the fridge, if it goes above a certain temperature, it will no longer be effective",

My hair was almost down to my knees in the beginning of 2024, and now I am literally bald. I'm taking vitamin D3, MaryRuth multi vitamin plus hair growth, pumpkin seed oil, biotin, and topical minoxidil, but my hair continues falling out. I took pictures today to check my progress since I've been doing the minoxidil for a few months now....I don't know why I even bother. I just want to scream and cry. I can't be outside anymore, my skin is always red and peeling with the butterfly rash, it caused my left eye to go completely blind and not heal from surgery....and now my hair. My hair was the only thing I had that made me feel pretty. And now I'm literally mistaken as a guy because I have no hair. To top it off my doctor wants me to start mycophenolate which will probably make the hairloss worse. I just want to cry all the time, but that's not gonna do anything except make me feel worse. I'm going to continue  the minoxidil and other stuff, but here are pictures. The picture of my long hair is from 2020 so it's a little blurry, but it shows how long, thick, and beautiful my hair was.

More recently I've noticed a dip--could be the fin or could simply be the time of year. Taking a short 1-2 week break to reset and am planning on resuming at 0.025%.

To my knowledge, Omega-6s make up the bulk of your conventional Sunflower oil unless it's high oleic Sunflower oil meant for frying.\n\nI vaguely remember a conversation from years back where it was claimed that a high amount/percentage of Omega-6 intake seems to increase risk for chronic inflammation and subsequent diseases like coronary heart disease, but I don't know if the evidence strongly supports that notion.\n\nWhich begs the question - is it about the absolute amount of Omega-6 fatty acids or the relation between Omega-3s and Omega-6s?  \nAnd is this the reason why olive oil is generally recommended over sunflower oil despite it having much less polyunsaturated fatty acids?\n\nAny insight is much appreciated!",

        "body": "Olive oil is a fine oil, many consider it healthy because it is the oil used almost exclusively in the mediterranean and thats where people tend to live long and healthy lives (of course diet isnt the only factor but for some reason its the one factor people focus on). They use olive oil there because they have access to a ton of olives, if they were to suddenly switch to any other vegetable oil i doubt there would be a big difference in their health.\n\nAnother reason is because olive oil is minimally processed (just pressed) and the words \"process\"  and \"chemicals\" is some peoples worst nightmare. When vegetable or seed oils are produced they often use chemicals like hexane to increase the yield from the seeds by about a third, and they bleach and deodorize the oil. None of the chemicals are left in the oil but some will still comment \"have you seen have they make these oils\" as if the processing will harm you. This process does remove some nutrients from the oil but it also make the oil a lot more resistant to oxidization. If you want an oil with the nutrients you can look for a cold pressed oil (which most anti-vegetable/seed oil people still will think is bad for some reason) there the process is exactly the same as with olive oil, its just pressed. Those oils should however not be used for cooking as the other nutrients will interact with the PUFA and make it rancid. If you are ever worried that your oil has oxidized, just smell it and it will smell rancid if it has oxidized.\n\nA third reason some have is the omega 3 to omega 6 ratio, somehow conveniently ignoring that canola/rapeseed oil has a ratio of 1:2, well within reason. For a healthy individual, the consensus is that the ratio doesnt matter but both omega 3 (specifically ALA which is found in vegetable oils, DHA and EPA found in algea and fish is not considered essential for adults but still healthy) and omega 6 are essential oils that you need in your diet. Adequate intakes of omega 3 is 1.1g for women and 1.6g for men and for omega 6 its 11-22g (roughly 5% of your total calories). However, if you have an autoimmune disease then there is some evidence that the ratios matter but the ratio where all benefits is seen is 1:2.5 (omega 3:6).\n\nFourth, some talk about PUFAs being naturally prone to oxidation, which on its own is true but most vegetable oils are rich in vitamin E that are a strong antioxidant which protects the oils from oxidation. One exception of this is soybean oil.\n\nThen there are some other crazys you see sometime like \"enjoy eating motor oil\" or \"big pharma, who wants to keep us sick, recommends vegetable oils\" or \"humans for all ages have only eaten animal products so you should only eat animal products\". I dont think i need to go into any detail on these.\n\nQuick note on inflammation, its a over used buzz word that most people dont know what it actually is",

In reddit and other social media nutrition circles there are many enthusiasts who are not very interested in the scientific literature, but rather look for validation for their special diets. For someone who follows e.g. vegan or keto diet, it's sometimes attractive to e.g. embrace that plant oils are toxic (except olive oil for the mentioned reason). Or that all fish foods are toxic because of the mercury. If you read into the wider scientific nutrition consensus (not just single articles, or obsolete theories from 80's by Artemis Simopoulos) it's clear olive oil is not considered \"superior\" healthiest oil compared to other similar plant oils.",

However, I genuinely cannot think of anything else that could have contributed to my hair looking broken and flimsy most of the time.\n\nI have some minor thinning but the, what I think is, breakage made it look worse than it was. As you can see in the second photo, I still have a good amount of hair.\n\nTo clarify, the breakage wasn‚Äôt from mechanical damage.

If you don't have one already, a flat brush does wonders (start brushing from the bottom, rather than your scalp). You might try rosemary oil on your scalp and pull it through the length of your hair about an hour or two before your shower, then follow up with some nourishing shampoo and conditioner and then a leave in conditioner. Throw in some nice hair masks once a week, too! Depending on your hair type, some people definitely have luck with a lighter oil put onto dry hair, too.",

    "body": "Hello! Good morning, & how do you all do?\n\nToday I am going to be delving into skincare! In particular, the indie skincare brand, **Chikyu**. You can find the storefront on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Chikyu?ref=simple-shop-header-name&listing_id=572367388) as well as a personal business [website](https://chikyuskincare.com/). For thorough information about each ingredient & benefits please check the site listings. I haven‚Äôt even made a dent in the items I want to try from the catalog, but I feel as if I have acquired enough product (purchasing & through generous samples) that it was time to do reviews. Be prepared for a rave fest! Also I might break this up in different posts, to keep it from being a slog of reading.\n\nTAT was incredibly swift. The packaging is *the most* thoughtfully packaged item I have ordered from a skincare company. Everything was wrapped so delicately in tissue paper & securely, all secured with a beautiful knotted silky type rope. I have ordered three times now, & there has been a generous amount of sizable samples included each time! Before I even get into the quality of the product itself, I have to mention the quality of the containers & labeling. Absolutely as if you were ordering from a high end, big brand, but in my humble opinion, better than that! \n\nAbout my skincare, if it is of any use. As I have gotten older, my skin requirements have started to change, & I now consider myself in the mature skin category. I can get a mild breakout from time to time if I am on my cycle & irritate my skin at the same time, but it is not as sensitive as it was in my twenties. I do require products that are heavier in terms of moisturizing, & probably have for a while now without realizing it. My main issues are sebaceous filaments, milia on my cheeks, hyperpigmentation, & dry patches. Wrinkles I don‚Äôt see as an issue, just a part of aging, although I do want to be proactive at not accelerating them any quicker than need be.\n\nNow let the reviewing commence!!\n\n# Utsukushii ‚ÄúINDIGO Elixir‚Äù ‚Äì Fortifying Night Oil\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\n1oz (Full Size)\n\n.25ml (Trial Size/Miniature)\n\n1.5ml (Sample)\n\nIngredients: Rice Bran Oil, \\*Tsubaki (Camellia) Seed Oil, Olive Squalane, Papaya Oil, Shiso-Yo (Japanese Perilla Oil), \\*White Chia Oil,\\*Coconut Oil, \\*Jojoba Oil, , Blue Tansy, Jasminum Sambac, Vitamin E, Poris Cocos Mushroom, Marine Algae, Rice Ferment Peptides, Hyaluronic Acid, Pseudocollagen,\n\nAlright folks. This is *the* product that drew me into this brand in the first place. I had been searching for some time, for a blue tansy face serum or a balm. After some deliberation & searching this subreddit for past reviews, I actually found a raving review on this exact product & with communication from the OP I was confident in going in on a FS.\n\nAs you will find out with a lot of the products, this one is a staple in my routine now. The FS comes in a beautiful, quality glass dropper style bottle. The serum goes a long way, & while it feels very moisturizing, it is lightweight & sinks into the skin fairly quickly. The smell is slightly earthy, which I enjoy. It has a very soothing quality & it does not just sit on top of the face. I was worried about the coconut oil, but I am almost done with my first FS bottle (heavy handed use) & I have not had any adverse reactions to it. I do find that my hair tends to absorb the oils at night, but actually I feel as if it has been helping my dry hair so win/win! I apply this only at night, right after a bukachoil serum from another store. I recommend trying sample sizes or a trial size before committing to a FS though, because I did find I have a preference between three of the serums I have tried.\n\n# Indigo (Silk) Face Cream\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\n30ml/1oz (Full Size)\n\n7.4ml/.25oz (Trial/Miniature Size)\n\n1.5ml (Sample Size/Skin Tester)\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\n\\*Calendula Hydrosol, Marula Oil, Prickly Pear Oil, \\*Grapeseed Oil, Sesame Seed Oil, \\*Calendula Oil, \\*Rose Hip Oil, \\*Aloe Leaf, \\*Coconut Oil, Avocado Oil, Jojoba Oil, Witch Hazel, Sunflower Seed Oil, \\*White Willow Bark, \\*Neem Oil, Pseudocollagen, Hyaluronic Acid, Phyto Peptide Complex (Plant Based Peptides), Silk Amino Peptides, Blue Tansy (Moroccan Chamomile ESO), Klamath Blue Algae, Caprylic Triglyceride (Coconut based), Stearic Acid (Plant Sourced), Cetyl Alcohol, Xanthan Gum, Palmarosa Oil, May Chang fruit oil, Benzoin Resin oil, Cedarwood Bark Oil. Magnesium, NonGMO Soybean Germ Extract.\\*Rosemary ESO, Vitamin E, \\*Vegetable Glycerin, Radish Root ESO\n\nI had originally received this as a sample in my first order & ended up ordering a FS. I usually use a different brand of face moisturizer that I honestly prefer over this one. Although for reasons unknown to me, the shop never followed through with shipping out of my order & even though there were communications with the other shop owner, I still don‚Äôt know if I am getting my package or a refund as informed. Either way, with that in mind, I ordered a FS of this because as a replacement, this one fits the bill nicely & Chikyu is always extremely reliable. It doesn‚Äôt feel as moisturizing as my preferred, but it also doesn‚Äôt leave my skin feeling dry by any means. It isn‚Äôt greasy & absorbs fairly quickly. The size is in my opinion slightly smaller than I had imagined, but a little really does go a long way, especially if you are also using her other products. The container is quality glass like her other FS products. I think the price is reasonable though, because this one is packed full of vastly more beneficial ingredients comparatively. So I would definitely recommend this to someone who doesn‚Äôt like a heavy moisturizer. There is a mushroom moisturizer that I am more interested in trying, so before I finish this container, I will order a sample of that one to see if it is better suited for me. Until then I will continue to use this product.\n\n# Hakumai Mizu ‚ÄúRice/Pearl‚Äù Face Cleanser\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\nSize: 1oz (Trial/Travel Size)\n\n4oz (Full Size Glass Jar with Bamboo Fibers)\n\n4oz (Full Size Glass Jar without Bamboo Fibers)\n\nINGREDIENTS: Fermented Rice Water\\*, Coconut Oil\\*, Lavender Flower Extract\\*, Rose Hip Oil, Castor Oil, Rice Bran Oil, Matsutake Mushroom Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple Fruit Essence), Wild Burdock Root Extract\\*, Crushed Pearl Powder, Rice Ferment Peptides, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Bamboo Fibers, \\*Grey Sea Salt, Glucose (Sugar Based), Vitamin C, Vegetable Glycerin\\*, Sake, Stearic Acid (Plant Derived), Cetyl Alcohol, Guar Gum, NataPres (Radish Root, Honeysuckle, Aspen Bark).\n\nI had also originally received a sample of this & ended up FS. I really love this cleanser. The sample does not come with the option for the bamboo fibers, & when I ordered a larger size I opted for the bamboo fibers. This is an extremely sizeable glass container for how little you need to use. It has a pearlescent sheen to it that is extremely beautiful. The bamboo fibers are delicate, but abrasive enough to scrub the skin without having to apply much pressure on your face when rubbing it in. I did notice that using this alone as a cleanser left my skin feeling stripped more than I would like. So with that in mind the next product I will review compliments this one. This is definitely a staple, but I am very curious about her other cleansers & plan on sampling the others to see if I have a preference. I am especially interested in the Matcha Cleanser.\n\n# Facial Cleansing Oil\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\nSize: 4oz (Full Size)\n\n1oz (Trial/Travel Size)\n\nINGREDIENTS: \\*Meadowfoam Oil, \\*Camellia Oil, \\*Grapeseed Oil, Castor Oil, \\*Rose Geranium ESO, Multifruit BSC\n\nI love this cleansing oil. This is admittedly my first foray into double cleansing & boy do I feel like a dingus for not having done this before! In my opinion, if you use the rice/pearl cleanser, this one is a must to use beforehand. I have noticed with consistent use, that my face is left feeling more moisturized & better cleansed than if I had just used the other alone. A little goes a long way, the FS is a glass pump container that is sizeable. No matter what cleanser I use, I will always have this in my routine. The smell is delicate, & does not irritate my skin whatsoever. I highly recommend trying a sample of this product. The sample I originally ordered was enough to carry me through three weeks of heavy handed use. I have no plans on looking for another cleansing oil. I will continue to use this as long as Lyn sells it!\n\n# Kagayakimasu ‚ÄúGLOW‚Äù Face Elixir\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\n1oz (Full Size)\n\n.25ml (Trial Size/Miniature)\n\n1.5ml (Sample)\n\nINGREDIENTS: \\*Watermelon Oil, \\*Cucumber Seed Oil, Rosehip Seed Oil, \\*Olive Oil, \\*Hemp Seed Oil, Sea Buckthorn Oil, \\*Tsubaki (Camellia) Seed Oil, \\*Jojoba Oil, \\*Tamanu Oil, Wheat Germ Oil,Geranium ESO, Lavender ESO, Grapefruit ESO, Pseudocollagen\n\nThe sample size container reminds me of my previous career in histopathology working with antibodies in immunohistochemistry. It‚Äôs a little flip top, sturdy, plastic container, but isn‚Äôt flat on the bottom. Something you would have in a rack while you pipette. Alright, I wanted to love this one. It smells absolutely gorgeous! But it felt way too heavy on my face, almost greasy. I am glad I only ordered a sample size of this, because I did start getting some clogged pores & small breakouts on my chin & forehead after using this one. I will mention that I had started my cycle right after trying this one, so that really could have been the culprit, but my face didn‚Äôt feel as irritated after I stopped using it. I just don‚Äôt feel like this one is for me & that is ok! I believe it is well loved by others here & obviously on her multiple reviews on both store sites. I plan on using up the sample on my d√©colletage‚Ä¨ area & hands. \n\n# Liquid Moisture\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\n1oz (Full Size)\n\n.25ml (Trial Size/Miniature)\n\n1.5ml (Sample)\n\nINGREDIENTS: Cranberry Seed Oil, Pomegranate Seed Oil, Marula Oil, Baobab Oil, \\*Pumpkin Seed Oil, \\*Borage Oil, \\*Grapeseed Oil, Jojoba Oil, Neroli ESO, Jasmine Grandiflorum Absolute, Jasmine Flowers, Pseudocollegen\n\nI ordered the trail size of this product & it comes in a cute little glass dropper style bottle. This serum specifically states on the listing that it will not clog pores & is intended for dry skin. I love this one just as much as the Indigo serum. I would say this is the lightest, in terms of weight & oiliness it leaves on the face compared to the other two. It feels as if it sinks in faster than the other two. I do prefer to use a bit more in my hand to get an even layer spread out, but it is perfect for adding it underneath my daily moisturizer. I only wear this one in the morning since it is so lightweight. I plan on purchasing a FS of this on my next order. Although I am curious about the Silk Serum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, I absolutely love everything about Chikyu. From the amazing customer service, the high quality & intention with each creation, the reliability of knowing I will receive my products & that the turn around time is consistently quick, & the fact that is actually making my skin feel better. In regards to my skincare needs, I have seen a significant reduction in the milia I usually have on my cheekbones, my dry patches that I tend to get on the sides of my nose/under eye area are not an issue, & with proper usage of cleansing & adequate moisturizing of my face, my blackhead/sebaceous filaments have become less apparent. I did not realize that I was over-cleansing & under-moisturizing my face before & that was what was making my pores look so raggedy & sad! Also, my hands have been feeling the love & are not scary lizard skin looking like before. They are soft & happy!! I highly, highly recommend at the very least, ordering some samples if you are curious. There is so much to try, that I am positive you will find something that works for you. If you made it this far, thank you for reading my thoughts!! I would absolutely love to hear about anyone else's experience with Chikyu products, especially ones I haven‚Äôt mentioned! I do have a lot more product samples I haven‚Äôt touched yet, & plan on leaving another review eventually! I tried to be thorough & I hope I didn't leave anything out! Have a nice day!",

One of the clan member's husband said he's a \"super taster\" and loved ALL the food and wants recipes.   Only one person was negative / hostile - he said \"VEGAN?

Less shedding but no apparent regrowth \n\n- Just wondering if anyone else‚Äôs hair looks like this? It‚Äôs a whole bunch of 10-15cm hairs along my hairline that I can easily pull forward out of my longer terminal hairs that sit further back. 1st pic is them forwards and 2nd is them sitting tucked away from today. 3rd is my hair from 3 years ago üôÉ \n\nWhen I saw a derm 2 months ago she said I had ‚Äòevidence of regrowth‚Äô along my hairline but I don‚Äôt think these are that.. they feel like miniaturising hairs which is scary af because they literally occupy my whole hairline! Like if they go I‚Äôm cooked\n\nAnyone have similar? \n\nI have no real understanding of frontal fibrosing alopecia but I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôm misdiagnosed and it might be that! \n\nMuch love, appreciate any help x",

That uncomfortable feeling that makes me get up and try all night. Pumpkin seed oil I cannot believe the effect it has made most nights 80% reduction in getting up. I didn't have to wait 6 weeks to get the benefits it was within days I felt better. Amazing Thank you",
