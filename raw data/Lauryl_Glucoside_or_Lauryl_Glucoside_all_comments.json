    "body": "I’m about to drop a lot of information here, but please read! I learned a lot about how to properly use sulfates and silicones, so I want to share!! \n\nSo here’s what I’ve learned from Sarah Tran, who has thigh length hair. \n\nEdit: People have brought up genetics. Of course genetics is a huge factor in hair length, but the point of this post is to maintain *healthy* hair, so that it will grow with minimal breakage and split ends. I bring up her length because it is *healthy* as well as long. \n\nAlso note: silicones and sulfates won’t directly contribute to hair growth, but will make your hair stronger and less likely to break and fall out, indirectly resulting in longer fuller hair\n\nFirst off, silicones and sulfates are NOT bad. In fact, if she didn’t use silicones, she couldn’t protect her hair and have such long hair without split ends. The way most people USE silicones is bad though. \n\nThink about it like this: If you have a pair of high heels that are comfortable and you love them, but your friend asks you to go jogging, the shoes are not the problem, the *use* is.\n\nSilicones do the following: \n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair which makes it easier to detangle \n\n-Provides UV protection\n\n-Seals in moisture to prevent dryness\n\n-Makes hair look shiny\n\n-Reduces frizz and adds definition to curls\n\n-Softens and smooths cuticle\n\nSilicones do all these amazing things!!!! However, there are 4 types: airy, friendly (easy to wash out), resilient, and NO GO silicones\n\n*\n#Airy silicones: \nThese evaporate out of the hair after 10 minutes to a few hours. These do not have any negative effect on hair:\n\n-Cyclomethicone \n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n*\n#Friendly silicones:\nThese wash out of the hair with sulfate free shampoos:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate) \n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n*\n#Resilient Silicones:\nThese do NOT build up on the strand, but are non soluble and *require a sulfate* to remove:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone -Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n*\n#NO GO Silicones:\nThese require multiple washes with sulfate shampoo to remove. NEVER USE THESE!:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone \n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone \n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18 \n\n-Cetyl Phosphate \n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiylamodimethicone \n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n*\n#Mild Sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nThese are Best used to remove airy and friendly silicones and in your regular, daily mild shampoo. These do NOT remove resilient silicones. \n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n*\n#High Strength HARSH sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nTreat these exactly like harsh sulfates and avoid them when looking for a regular, daily mild sulfate-free shampoo. BEST USED FOR REMOVING RESILIENT SILICONES:\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate \n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n*\n#SULFATES that remove silicones:\nThese strong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Mild sulfates May require more applications to remove resilient silicones:\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n*\n#Also here is a list of cationic (anti-static) ingredients:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n*\n#So basically:\n\n1. Get a good sulfate free shampoo\n\n2. Get a good shampoo that HAS sulfates\n\n3. Use airy and friendly silicones ALL the time\n\n4. Use resilient silicones once or twice a month. This will protect your hair more than friendly silicones. Resilient silicones must be washed out with a SULFATE shampoo at the max FIVE DAYS AFTER APPLICATION\n\n*\n#And one last thing!!! Avoid these ingredients in hair care products: \n\nhttps://airtable.com/shrXz5xqoqRg8yKI2/tblol3s4T5YH103yY\n\nIt is hard to find a product with NONE of these ingredients, so make sure that these

        "body": "Hi! Guys please do your research and don't trust everything you hear. Having thigh length hair is a great achievement but it doesn't make someone a science expert, so posting this on a science sub is so misleading. \n\nI'm seeing some red flags. First off, no scientific sources. Second, commonly demonized ingredients in the push for \"clean\" beauty are again demonized here without proper given cause. And third, there are a few things that stuck out to me as glaringly false from what research I've done. Lastly, fourth, the phrasing at all of \"no go silicones\" and just the incorrect categorization of silicones that assigns them value (better to look at the truer category names: volatile, amine-modified, etc.)\n\nMost ingredients on that \"blacklist\" have little or absolutely no evidence of being bad. \n\nAnd the thing that strikes me as absolutely false is the list of cationic surfactabts as static causing, when most research and literature says the exact opposite - that they're anti static ingredients. Give me a minute and I'll add a few sources for the anti-static claim for cationic surfactants.\n\n> The widely used cationic surfactant docosyltrimethylammonium chloride was overall well performing, especially when it came to reduction of friction force and reduction of flyaway hair during combing. It was superior to the other cationic surfactant tested regarding reduction of frizz. This study suggests that the silicones and protein derivatives showed less promising results regarding the overall manageability. Preliminary data has implications that the efficiency of anti-frizz is correlated with cationic charge and high hydrophobicity of the conditioning agent. \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DYduaceeTnvMJ \n\n> Behentrimonium chloride and Cetrimonium chloride are known to be very effective hair conditioners with detangling, anti-frizz, and anti-static  \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D0FbAuscGO8AJ",

If the terminal length of your hair is way shorter, no amount product is going to fix that, at least not to that extent.

I know there's some research with using brown rice water (I think) to improve the terminal length, but I'm not sure how accurate it is, how much it's been tested, or the details.\n\nNot a scientist, so please correct me if I'm wrong!",

Also some of the other information seems to be inline with what this \"challenge\" promotes. Some of the information might be true, but I've seen this trick before. A service will give some true information, and then make other information appear overly complicated (sometimes twisting information as they go) so customers of their service will eventually get frustrated trying to figure it out (but not before giving them money). give up, and buy their \"good\" products (for more money).",

The rest of the arm is perfectly clean of cosmetics (but full of white dust! 😂). I didn't have any AB sunscreen at the moment but I was thinking of trying foundation with SPF and maybe a before/after in the evening... How much sunscreen stays on my body after X hours?\n\nThe lamp I used, I bought many years ago. I am not able to tell which wavelenght it produces (/u/katherine-the-wild can you help?).  \n\nPhone: iPhone SE\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n>Avéne Lait enfant 50+ INCI: *Avene thermal spring water (avene aqua), C12-15 alkyl benzoate, dicaprylyl carbonate, methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol, water (aqua), glycerin, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol, methoxyphenl triazine, diethylhexyl butamido, triazone, diisopropyl adipate, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, cetearyl isononanoate, lauryl glucoside, polyglyceryl-2, dipolyhydroxystearate, decyl glucoside, benzoic acid, caprylic/capric triglyceride, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, disodium EDTA, glyceryl behenate, glyceryl dibehenate, hydrogenated palm glycerides, hydrogenated palm kernel glycerides, polyacrylate-13, polyisobutene, polysorbate 20, propylene glycol, sorbitan, isostearate, tocopherol, tocopheryl glucoside tribehenin, xanthan gum.* \n\n>Avéne Sunsimed INCI: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene Aqua), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Nano), Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzoic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopheryl Glucoside, Excipients* (being a medical device I wasn't able to find a complete list of ingredients).  \n\n\nEDIT: Sorry but I wasn't comfortable sharing pictures of my face. But the sunscreen showed up reeeally well and I could see all of the spots I missed. I also could see all the sun damage and hyperpigmentation that isn't visible under regular lights. 😭   \nIf anyone else has a blacklight available and could test it with other sunscreens, I would be very curious to see the results! Thanks everyone!",

It might have to do with applying a higher concentration to the swatch than you normally would to your face, and because it’s easier to get even coverage on a small, flat surface than in all little contours of your face. I also found that it only really works with physical sunscreens. The black light is looking for the white pigment in titanium dioxide and zinc oxide to bounce off of, so it works best with physical sunscreens, not as well with combo sunscreens, and almost not at all with chemical sunscreens.",

    "body": "Hey there! So I have extremely damaged hair that is breaking off every time I brush it (got a straight perm when my hair was bleached). In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I’ve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or “glucoside”.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or “methosulfate” (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application. (Volatile just means they evaporate quickly):\n\n-Cyclomethicone\n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n##Easy to remove silicones:\nThese condition the hair, provide UV protection, and wash out with sulfate free surfactants:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate)\n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n##Resilient silicones:\nThese silicones can be removed with a sulfate AND some sulfate-free surfactants:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n##Cationic ingredients List:\n(Anti-static ingredients)\nThese ingredients usually end in “-imonium chloride”. These are in basically every conditioner to reduce static in hair:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate (this is NOT a sulfate, it’s an anti-static)\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n#Sulfates:\n\n##Mild Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are best used to remove volatile and easy to remove silicones. They can only remove resilient silicones with multiple washes, unless paired with many different sulfate free surfactants (a shampoo that has 3-4 or these in their ingredients list):\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n-Sodium Cocoate\n\n-Potassium Cocoate\n\n##Sulfate free surfactants that can remove resilient silicones:\n\nThese can remove resilient silicones, but not on their own, so usually a shampoo will use a combination of 2-3 of these:\n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate\n\n##High Strength Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are technically sulfate free, but they are **just** as thoroughly cleansing as sulfates, so they can still strip hair dye. Best used for removing resilient silicones\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n##Sulfates that remove resilient silicones:\n\nStrong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Do not use if you have colored hair, as it will fade your color\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n#Understanding Protein in Hair:\n\nHair is made of protein, proteins are made of amino acids and peptides. Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt’s best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the “feeling” of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this “protein overload” is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

Hydrolyzed collagen, hydrolyzed wheat protein (5th and 6th ingredient)\n\n##I’ve included this product list more for myself because it is very hard to find products with varying protein types and sizes.\n\n##The above information about protein and sulfates was found on Science-y Hair Blog!\n\n#Ingredients for Scalp Health:\n\n##Aloe Vera Gel:\n\nAloe is a great natural scalp soother and also helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it’s wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

While Western one didn’t really use soap (most aren’t paste but more gel or liquid) so the decision was in between SLS or other milder surfactants like ~~glucoside or ~~ betaine.\n\nWhy do I not see soap-free trend there?

It doesn't prevent moisture from entering the hair strands. It acts like a conditioning ingredient. It will wash out with almost any detergent.

This silicone can be washed off with cocoamidopropyl betaine Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Sodium lauroyl glutamate, Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate all of these can wash out the silicone and all of these are cg approved. \n\nSo, in theory and from a logical point of view, this could be a budget friendly conditioner suitable for curly hair! \n\nAlso if you've used this conditioner please share your experience!",

I started experimenting with combination of products over the last year and realised my hair needs medium level of conditioning and protein makes it very dry. So I stick to a normal routine of washing my hair with SebaMed Anti-dry shampoo(prescribed by my derm) and WOW Morrocan Argan Oil Conditioner. I use a few drops of Nature's Tattva Sweet Almond oil as my leave in and WOW aloe vera gel. This seemed to work for my hair but I still wasn't happy with my hair. \n\nSaw your post and thought of giving the pantene conditioner, Silky Smooth variant in Advanced haircare series a try. And OMG, IT IS CGM FRIENDLY. Still waited a month to be able to judge the conditioner and it works wonders without breaking the pocket. It doesn't have as much slip as a heavy condioner would have though, maybe the damage protection variant might, so I don't recommend it for extremely dry hair. I mainly use it to detangle and am planning to dilute it to use as a leave-in as well.",

    "body": "I've been lurking a while and have commented once or twice already, so this is a little introduction. Sadly I won’t have time I think to build a proper reddit presence, but it’s just rude to stomp in now and then with questions and never interact properly, so … an introduction is a half-arsed excuse for my rudeness. Also it’s an opportunity to warn you all that I don't really understand reddit at all? What happened to plain aul forums? I'll probably make a tonne of mistakes. \n\nI live in Sweden, am 40, and have always, always, always had bad skin. So I thought. Until I hit say 35 and got REALLY bad skin. (This summer I was looking at my wedding photos from 20 years ago and bloody hell I was gorgeous. However, I thought I was ugly, of course. Let this be a lesson to you youngsters. Waste not your time feeling ugly! Not worth it.) Now, I have cystic, probably hormonal, and partly stress-induced, acne along my jawline and down my neck. The rest of my body has always been acne free, incidentally. Because life, eh.\n\nApart from the acne I'm an aging, wrinkled mess, lol. (Not lol.) Sun damage, check. Wrinkles, check. Loss of elasticity, check. Enlarged pores, check. Looking like my granny, check. I've never really fussed much with my skin apart from trying to kill acne, which I realise now is a common story. Everything else was pointless because ACNE. You know? I got interested in skincare as a concept that might work maybe max two years ago when I discovered Caroline Hirons's blog, and thus double cleansing. Imagine how little teen acne I'd have had if I'd known about double cleansing... I realized then that those expensive creams, acne meds or whatever never had a chance of working if my skin wasn’t clean. Using recommendations via Hirons gave me some improved texture, but I stalled fast. I found this reddit via looking for reviews for Missha’s Signature Real Complete BB Cream. Found Fifty Shades of Snail, and here I am! Stalking you lot. So far I'm liking the low ph approach, which seems to make a difference and explains why Hirons only got me so far. She's got no real science, bless her. \n\nWell, basically, Fiddy made me do it, and I've purchased and tried a fair few things already with blatant disregard of our very different skin types, lol. One major problem for me in all this skincare business is that I don't love doing it. I want to be a soap and water and a slap of face cream person. I'd love to just have a bottle of almond oil and use that for everything and be gorgeous. HA. And the AB thing of patting in layers of stuff for hours? Jesus it stresses me OUT. It takes so looooooong. Convince me that the patting is important, I just feel like a twit of the highest order. Also I’m so unaware. “Look at your skin and determine what it needs today” – what does that meeeaaaannnnn. My skin needs *less acne*, that’s what my skin needs. I can’t connect what I see in the mirror to picking something to put on it. I’ve copped on that it’s often dehydrated though, so I’m trying to think moisture, not just oil. (Snow White and the Asian Pear made me do that. :) )\n\nThere are, as far as I’ve ascertained (side note: ascertained is such a delicious word, isn’t it? I just love saying it) two online shops in Sweden with any sort of AB. Bonnybonny sells The Face Shop, Missha and It’s Skin. Online chemist Apotea sells some Whamisa. That’s it folks. I’ve purchased from Cosmetic Love to try out the things Fiddy made me try (goddammit Fiddy), and as far as I’m concerned CL is MY bae because free shipping makes my life easy. However, rubbish free samples so far, Etude House BB creams that are all streaky and crap and TonyMoly whitening panda cream which is … what. Why you even exist, panda cream. Anyway. Bonnybonny is a very good shop, super friendly, fast and with the personal touch. I got free samples from them (when I bought my BB cream) of the It’s Skin Power 10 Effectors, YE and CO. YE quite nice? Felt like it did something? CO a joke. Considering the LI one based on stuff  read here on the subreddit? Really unsure. It’s just much easier to buy in-country also I like to support local shops. Generally though, for skincare,  I’m not feeling the brands available in Bonnybonny. They feel a bit blah, meh, cheap? My first sheet mask experience was Missha masks from Bonnybonny and I was unimpressed. I have now bought many more ;) (GODDAMMIT FIDDY) and begin to see the point. However – the environment, folks. I don’t like this single-use business at all – and if the sheet mask is a bit shit I feel as though I’ve single-handedly killed a small herd of whales or something. The whole consumist slant to AB or any skincare addiction really frustrates me. Do I need the sheet masks, or can I buy equally good serums/essences whatever instead? File under Banivani’s queries and expect me to pop up with ponderings about this. \n\nI’ve got a low-ph cleansing thing going on, using oil to loosen makeup (atm mineral oil because trying it out because reddit), then a Western style cleansing lotion from the chemist, a Swedish brand called Elw. Ph 5,5 and no fragrance. (I quite like the Hirons approach of cleaning with a flannel you see. But you can try to convince me I’m wrong. I might listen because I’m still not beautiful.)  I also have \"soap\" called Lactacyd, also a Swedish brand. It's made with lactic acid and has a ph of 3,5. It's been around forever and is marketed towards sensitive skin/areas (i.e. vaginas, my friends). I actually bought the very vagina-specific one (“for intimate areas”, what) to try out as a foaming cleanser, because it didn’t have SLS as second ingredient (ingredients are Aqua, Lauryl Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Lactic Acid, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Glycol Distearate, Glycerin, Sodium Methylparaben for those interested). I am still not beautiful. After this we start getting to the AB! In lieu of the acids recommended by Hirons I’ve got Cosrx BHA and AHA, and the A-Sol thingie. It’s all grand, but I’m not beautiful. Not sure the AHA does much. I think propolis might be good for me though, quite liking the A-Sol and have re-purchased. Am considering something more propolosy than the a-sol as a next step? Because after my “acids” and A-Sol I don’t really have anything. Am finishing up a few Western-style serums and have some sheet masks, that’s it, oh! and a bottle of Cosrx snail essence that will have arrived today (my daughter is picking the package up for me :) ). \n\nSo I’ll be lurking about looking for things to layer. I want things that address my wrinkles, pores and dehydration, also, you know, FECKING ACNE. I’ll be nosing around your moisturizer threads and your emulsion threads. I’m not at all sure what I want/need out of those though, this is a tricky step for me. \n\nSorry for the essay! Oh, and dewy – what’s up with that? What does it meeeaaann? Basically “shiny with class”? Or does it mean “wet”? If you take a stroll through the dewy grass you end up with wet feet, like. I’ll be back. \n\n",

        "body": "Hej there, my western neighbour! Finn here with one year and some months of AB under my belt. \n\nHonestly, the knowlegde of \"what my skin needs today\" increases the better your skin gets and overall is bit less of a thing for oilier skin than drier skins IMO. \n\nAlso, I don't pat in for long unless it's actually needed for a reason. As in, I pat my morning routine more so I can apply sunscreen/makeup on top quicker and not have the moistness interfere. Evening, I just mostly spread and leave, or pat just enough to know I've reached all areas of face. In the end my face is quite moist of all my products, but I just seal it all in with a cream or sleeping pack and go to bed. I don't fall asleep immediately, so the stuff has about 30min to absorb so it won't rub off on my pillow, and the last steps keep it from running off my face and make it absrob quicker. \n\nHave you actually had derm prescription/diagnose lately? I know for a fact I could not keep my skin in this pretty condion had it not been for my double Roaccutan ten-thirteen years ago and my IUD this year. After these steps to rein in my hormones, AB has the freedom to do all its topical stuff. \n\nAnd I'd definitely encourage you to try a gentle propolis essence in addition to A-Sol. Skinfood Royal Honey Propolis Essence is really good and somewhat easy to find even if prices are a bit higher. Pureheal's and Tosowoong are other brands that have similar products.\n\nIf you liked Cosmetic-Love (I do too, I think I buy from them most often) you'll like Jolse and BeautynetKorea too. RRS I go to whenever I want cheap sheet masks, but they have shipping costs so it needs a bit more research and comparison. Otherwise, Ebay.\n\nAs far as sheet masks go, they are more of a pamper/boost/before important events thing. Get an essence for everyday, but if you find a brand/flavour of a sheet mask that gives you a good effect, stock up a 10-pack or two of it. I always get two uses off a single sheet mask packet, which makes me feel a bit better about them, Frst the mask and then next day the leftover essence after my usual essences. I got binder clips for the sole reason of sealing the sheet mask packets overnight :P\n\nOh, and dewiness. Means shiny in a luminous/a bit wet sort of way. [This](http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/236x/29/70/7d/29707d66e5ad0f14e44156fe3c8a13c5.jpg) picture is a good example. Because healthy skin is shiny, and moistness is pretty, Korean trend (although it's fading a bit, it seems to be cottony skin now that's in) has been \"as glossy as you can make it\". I mean, it's mostly achived with a lot of shiny balms and highlighter as far as makeup goes, but if you have hydrating enough skincare you should have somewhat shiny skin even with no makeup and just sunscreen over your skincare steps.\n\nAnyway, do search me in the Routine Megathread to see my recent-ish products. I'm going to go do my skincare now since my BHA has had its wait time, but do ask if I didn't explain thoroughly or anything else you want to ask/chat about! :)",

I believe that once your acne is under control then you could better address your other skin issues like wrinkles, pores, and sun damage. Adult acne is usually characterized by papules, pustules and deep nodules and regular skincare products may not be enough for that. Just like what /u/pohybel asked, are you seeing a dermatologist? Perhaps some prescription medication like antibiotics and retinoids could help clear your skin. \n\nAnd I agree, the layers of AB (and the waiting times) can seem stressful and demotivating. But the good thing about AB is you can add or subtract from the routine. You can customize it however you want. If you're not so much into sheet masks, it's fine! Even a basic routine will do if it's able to address your skin's needs. :)\n\nI'm excited to read the responses to your post. I'm sure this will be a great and fruitful discussion. :)",

When you're ready to fight the battle against aging, let me know.

I go weeks without sheet masking, and then I might do a couple in a week when I'm feeling like it. It certainly doesn't have to be an every day thing. If you want to, you could replace with wash off masks, or sleeping masks or...gasp...nothing at all.\n\nAlso, you really don't have to use Asian brands. To my way of thinking, AB is in large part about the mentality and the routine. Double cleansing is freakin' awesome. Using a cleanser that doesn't make your face feel tight and dry has been a real game changer for me. Lots of layers of slippy hydrators and serums is, frankly, lovely. GOOD SUNSCREEN is a godsend. Maybe you don't care about sunscreen as you're in Sweden and it's going into winter. But in the summer months it would be good even for you. You could buy locally for basically all of those things - it used to be that you just couldn't find an oil cleanser from a western brand, for example, but they're catching on and now you can. However, having said that, I recently decided I was tired of ordering from Korea and did a thought experiment of trying to replace my products with only those I could buy locally and I just ended up frustrated at the ridiculously high cost of western serums. I mean, WHYYYY do they have to be so expensive? Also, mineral oil seemed to be in everything and I personally avoid it. So I'm going to try out a couple of things but...eh....gimme some Innisfree any day.\n\nOK, so, hydration. Try out something with hyaluronic acid. My personal favorite has been Hada Labo Gokujyun Alpha Lotion. This is the one in the red bottle that has some anti-aging stuff included (good for us over-40's types!). But I may try the new Gokujyun Premium lotion when I can get my hands on it just to compare. Don't want to try getting hold of that? What about Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel or Indeed Labs Hydraluron serum? I have no real idea if they are comparable but they are hyaluronic acid focused gels and aim to do that nice light hydration thing.\n\nAnyway, stick around. Post some, even if you don't feel you have time, because we all seem to like reading your writing style!\n\nEDIT: PS I don't pat anything in. Can't get the hang of it, and it makes my face feel sticky. So, um, I just smooth things on and let them sink in a bit, and that's it.",

        "body": "What u/pohybel said, but also in addition, if you have been battling acne for many years, and more so now, it is really best to see a dermatologist for that, as adult acne and cystic acne is tough as shit to battle using only otc products - it can require a long ass time to adjust and readjust until finding the right set of products that might possibly help, which if you're older you're really not going to be able to afford spending that much time to only potentially find a solution for the acne. So I strongly advise going to the derm first before spending any more money on acne specific products or actives (which I don't usually advise people to use until they have at least a basic routine (cleanse, hydration,moisturize, sunscreen) that already works for their skin) to better figure out what you're dealing with and how you can deal with the acne first. Once you have the acne more or less under control - during which time it is strongly advised to follow what the derm says (make sure you like and trust your derm, can always go for a second opinion first if you're unsure about them) and keep only a basic routine as well while you're on their course of treatment, , then you can concentrate more on the anti aging portion of things and fiddle with a routine (that doesn't have to be super complicated). Be sure to ask the derm about using Lactacyd for cleansing (well, and disclose your routine as it is as well. Be as honest with the derm as possible about your skin so they have a better idea of how to combat your acne) because that is pretty unorthodox and Idk if that is good for your skin or not.\n\nIf you're not using sunscreen, I strongly advise not using actives, really (and also, please use sunscreen. It is the number one sure thing that will help in reducing additional sun damage to your skin from here on out). Most actives make your skin more photosensitive which would only escalate your wrinkle issues if you don't use sunscreen daily.",

    "body": "They released an article a few weeks ago about farm-to-face beauty products. My feelings about the movement towards \"natural\" aside, the writer recommended a $60 cleansing oil, and included this following line:\n\n> [It's paraben-, preservative- and chemical-free, and smells divine.] (https://www.refinery29.com/2018/01/189611/natural-ethical-beauty-products-farm-to-face#slide-1) \n\nI am taking offense at the preservative-free claim. This is not only factually wrong, this is extremely dangerous.\n\nLet me make this clear: the marketing copy for this product doesn't claim to be preservative-free. The copy brags about having AHA and plant extracts, but they don't claim to be [preservative-free] (https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/african-botanics-pure-marula-cleansing-oil.html). If the company did, they would have been wrong. \n\nThis is the ingredient list: \n\n>Glycerin, Capric/Caprylic Triglycerides, Aqua, Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Diisopropyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Sorbitan Oleate, Sclerocarya Birrea (Marula) Seed Oil\\*\\*, Moringa Pterygosperma (Moringa) Seed Oil\\*\\*, Adansonia Digitata (Baobab) Seed Oil\\*\\*, Isoamyl Laurate, Lauryl Glucoside, Coco Glucoside, Eriocephalus punctulatus (Chamomile Cape) Essential Oil, Citrus Paradisi (Pink Grapefruit) Essential Oil, Vaccinium Myrtillus (Bilberry) Extract, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugar Cane) Extract, Acer Saccahrinum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Extract, Tocopherol Acetate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Benzyl Benzoate\\*, Citral\\*, Citronellal\\*, Geraniol\\*, Limonene\\*, Linalool\\*. \\*Constituents Of Natural Essential Oils Used. \\*\\*Certified Organic. 100% Vegan. Gluten-free.\n\nGuess what? Both dehydroacetic acid and benzyl alcohol are used as preservatives. So the writer's claim about preservative-free is factually wrong.\n\nHere's the bigger issue, though: cosmetic products need preservative systems. \n\nYou cannot sell an unsafe product. Cosmetics are often a mixture of oils and water, which is perfect breeding ground for disease agents like mold and bacteria and viruses and fungi. This means that you cannot sell a product without an adequate preservative system. These germs need to be killed, or you will sicken someone, if not kill them. \n\nEven if you did your best to disinfect the manufacturing equipment, and even if all of the employees involved in manufacture practice safe manufactory practices, bacteria and mold can still get in. Plus, as a consumer uses the product, it will accumulate bacteria, fungi and mold over time. If these are allowed to grow unimpeded, this can change the color, scent, texture, etc of the product. Consumers like having a product that lasts as long as possible. As such, it is very important to have a system in place to preserve the product, not only to preserve human health, but to keep a product usable for as long as possible. \n\nTherefore, suggesting that a product 100% lacks preservatives, and implying that this is a good thing, is extremely irresponsible. By suggesting that having no system in place is more ethical, natural, or safe, you are endangering people's lives. Additionally, you are forcing your readers to spend more money on products than they need to, simply because preservative systems are necessary for it to last long enough for it to be used up. \n\n(I will note that there are products that claim to be self-preserving; these products don't use traditional preservatives, but they still have a system in place. Whether these are adequate is outside the scope of this post, but even the natural cosmetic lines agree that preserving products is a good thing.)\n\nAlso, the chemical-free line is just wrong. All matter is chemical. Oil is a chemical, extracts are chemicals, water is a chemical... ",

    "body": "Hi everyone!\n\nI have accumulated a great deal of different shampoos from various indie companies throughout my time here and I thought it might be helpful to share my thoughts on them!\n\nSince everyone's hair is different, your experiences might differ from mine, so just keep that in mind! For reference, My hair is a little past my shoulders and heavily layered. It is generally limp, fine, and very straight. I find that my hair gets easily weighed down by a lot of products. I dye it red about every 5 weeks with henna and, a few times a year, I will have balayage highlights added in or touched up. My hair gets oily at the roots, in my bangs, and around my face, but the bleached ends become very dry. I wash the bangs and top of my head every day and the full length every 2 to 3 days. I blow dry, straighten, and/or curl my hair several times a week. The water in my house is on the “softer” side.\n\n**[ Cocoa Pink ]**\n\n**Shampink Conditioning Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  A favorite amongst the IMAM community, Shampink (formally Princess Poo) provides gentle cleansing without stripping or drying. The absence of sulfates means that it won’t be as likely to pull dye prematurely out of your hair. I find that this shampoo does not lather very much unless you use a generous amount, but it still cleans well enough. It is highly moisturizing, which unfortunately means that it does not provide me with a lot of lift or volume at the roots; my hair looks a little limp when I use this product, so I have to coax it more with the blow dryer to keep it from falling too flat. I tend to use this shampoo on days when I know I am going to be putting my hair up, braiding it, or doing some sort of up-do where a lot of slip is required. This is also nice to use for washing my bangs every day, as it doesn’t dry them out.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 6 oz. and 10 oz. plastic bottles with attractive labeling. Shampoo is thick and clear. Minimal lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $7.50 for 6 oz. ($1.25 per oz.) and $14.00 for 10 oz. ($1.40 per oz.).\n\n*Scents:*  Shampink comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Not as generously scented as CP’s Argan Conditioner. Also available in unscented. I have this in Cereal Killer (fruit loop type scent) and Cake on Mondays (delicious cinnamon almond cake, but beware if you are sensitive to cinnamon).\n\n*I recommend this for:*  Normal-Dry hair types, frequent washers, color-treated hair, damaged hair.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Water, Sodium Glucose Carboxylate and Lauryl Glucoside (natural surfactants), Rosemary Extract, Lavender Extract, Rose Extract, Lemon Grass Extract, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Fragrance, Mica, Phenoxyethanol and Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid (Paraben Free Preservation System).\n\n**Squeaky Clarifying Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  This is a nice alternative to CP’s Shampink if you have oily or limp hair, but still desire more gentle cleansing than most sulfate-based shampoos. I find that this formula lathers a bit better than its counterpart. It is more clarifying than Shampink, but I still would not consider it a \"clarifying shampoo\" as it is quite moisturizing. I like this when my hair is feeling a little oilier at the roots, I previously used hair spray or a scrunching product, or I got sweaty from working out at the gym.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 4.5 oz. and 10 oz. plastic bottles with attractive labeling. Shampoo is thick and light pink in color. Medium lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $6.50 for 4.5 oz. ($1.44 per oz.) and $13.00 for 10 oz. ($1.30 per oz.)\n\n*Scents:*  Squeaky comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Not as generously scented as CP’s Argan Conditioner. Also available in unscented. I have this in Lychee Rose Macaroons (sweet rose with a hint of coconut).\n\n*I recommend this for:* All hair types, gentle clarifying.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Water, Sodium Lauryl Glucose Carboxylate, Lauryl Glucoside, Rosemary Extract, Lavender Extract, Rose Extract, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium, Modified Cornstarch, Fragrance, Mica, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid (preservatives).\n\n**[ Savor Soaps ]**\n\n**Creme Fraiche Whipped Soap**\n\n*Overview:*  I have found that a lot of people use Savor’s Whipped Soap in place of shampoo. I find that it lathers very well and clarifies my hair, leaving it feeling light, bouncy, and smooth; however, I experienced a lot of dryness on my scalp and some frizziness on the ends of my hair. Many people have had great success with this and I may end up giving it another try this summer, when my scalp is especially oily. A little bit goes a long way and it is definitely a multi-use product (shampoo, body soap, shaving cream, etc.), so it is a great value! I did find a lot of unblended pieces of what looks like shea butter throughout the mixture, although this is not listed in the ingredients so I'm not sure what it is. Didn’t really bother me as it dissolves in water, but I thought I would note this. The scent lingers for quite a while after it's rinsed out!\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 2 oz. and 8 oz. plastic jars with attractive labeling. Soap is thick with a butter-like texture. Interestingly, the sugar scrub soaps had a softer texture. Generous lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $4.50 for 2 oz. ($2.25 per oz.) and $10.00 for 8 oz. ($1.25 per oz.)\n\n*Scents:*  There are a variety of scents to choose from, most of which are sweet and fruity, but there are also more masculine options available. I did not find an unscented version of the whipped soap, but you may be able to request it. Generously scented and remains in hair after rinsing. I have this in Honey (perfumey honey floral).\n\n*I recommend this for:* Normal-Oily hair types, thick hair.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Distilled water, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Sodium cocoyl isethionate, Disodium lauryl sulfosuccinate, Sodium chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Tetrasodium edta, Sweet almond oil, Fragrance, Color\n\n**[ Fortune Cookie Soap ]**\n\n**Shampoo Bar**\n\n*Overview:*  I have not had much success with sulfate-free shampoo bars in the past, so I was pleasantly surprised at how well Fortune Cookie’s shampoo bar worked for me! It lathers easily, smells great, and doesn’t leave a weird film on my hair that I sometimes get with other shampoo bars. This product provides gentle cleansing and it is very economical as a little bit goes a very long way. I find the scent to be quite long lasting as well. I use this when traveling as it takes up very little room in my bag.\n\n*Product details:*  Couldn’t find the size dimensions on the website. Bar is square and colored/decorated according to scent. Generous lather. It seems that it will last a long time.\n\n*Cost:*  $8.99 for one bar.\n\n*Scents:*  There are a small handful of scents available and good portion of them change with the seasons. They are mostly sweet, fruity, and fresh scents. I did not see an unscented version. I have this in Oh Hair (peach nectar, grapefruit, sprig of thyme) and it is pleasant and long lasting.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  All hair types, travel.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Sodium Coco Sulfate, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Kokum Butter, Cosmetic Grade Silicone (Moisturizer), Shea Butter, blend of Palm and Coconut Oils (Saponified), Purified Water, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Vitamin E (Tocopherol), Fragrance and/or Essential Oils, Cosmetic Color\n\n**[ Toadstool Soaps ]**\n\n**Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  This shampoo provides superb lather and great cleansing power without leaving my hair parched. It removes any kind of product or oil build-up easily. It is more clarifying than many other indie brands, so I always make sure to follow up with a conditioner. It is fantastic at removing grime, styling products, and skin oil. The foaming power is very impressive considering this is a sulfate-free product. A little bit goes a LONG way. The shampoo leaves my hair super clean, fluffy, and full of volume. The packaging is very basic. The larger bottle size is definitely the way to go as it is the most economical of all of the shampoos I’ve tried.\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 3 oz. and 10.5 oz. plastic bottles with minimalist labeling. Shampoo is medium-consistency and clear (type of fragrance may alter color). Very generous lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $6.50 for 3 oz. ($2.17 per oz.) and $9.75 for 10.5 oz. ($0.93 per oz.) Some of the shampoos containing essential oils are a little more expensive.\n\n*Scents:*  The shampoo comes in virtually every scent that you could possibly imagine. Most are very generously scented, but more subtle scents are available as well. Also available in unscented. I have this in Milk and Honey (comforting almond milk and honey) and it is one of the more subtle scents.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  Normal-Oily hair types, limp hair.\n\n*Ingredients:* Distilled Water, Coconut Oil, Cocoa Butter, Saponified Olive Oil, Vegetable Oil & is enhanced with 100% Raw Honey and Lemon Juice for a healthy shine, Fragrance Oil & Potassium Sorbate as a preservative. *Note: There is lemon juice in the ingredients, but I do not find that it lightens my hair color at all. I have read on other message boards that this is because when it is \"cooked\" the lightening quality is diminished.*\n\n**Wheat and Oat Shampoo**\n\n*Overview:*  I love the ingredients in this shampoo! My hair really likes marshmallow root and the slippery elm was a nice surprise (both give a lot of natural “slip” to the hair). This is a great formula that would suit most hair types, particularly if your hair likes protein. Protein can be somewhat drying if it’s used in excess, so keep this in mind when deciding what conditioner to pair it with. Toadstool also has an accompanying rinse-out conditioner that works very well with this, but if you have especially dry hair, you may want something more intense. This shampoo isn’t scented; it has its own natural scent from the ingredients, which pretty much smells lightly of grain. Not unpleasant, but I’ve just become so accustomed to crazy-scented products that it was a little bit of a surprise!\n\n*Product details:*  Available in 10.5 oz. plastic bottles with minimalist labeling. Shampoo is medium-consistency and light yellow. Good lather.\n\n*Cost:*  $10.50 for 10.5 oz. ($1 per oz.).\n\n*Scents:*  Natural scent of wheat.\n\n*I recommend this for:*  All hair types, protein lovers.\n\n*Ingredients:*  Aloe barbadensis (Organic Aloe) Juice, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Vegetable Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Avena sativa (Oat) Extract, dl-Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5), Camellia sinensis (Organic Green Tea) Extract, Urtica dioica (Organic Nettle Leaf) Extract, Stellaria media (Organic Chickweed) Extract, Ulmus fulva (Organic Slippery Elm) Extract, Silybum marianum (Organic Milk Thistle) Extract, Althea officinalis (Organic Marshmallow Root) Extract, Aphanizomenon flos-aqua (Blue Green Algae), Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid\n\n**[ Winner ] Toadstool Soap's regular shampoo because of the affordable cost, excellent lather, and availability of scents.**\n\nStay tuned for my review of indie conditioners!\n\nWhat shampoos have you tried? How did you like them? If you would like to share your thoughts, that'd be great! It would also be helpful if you included your hair type so that people with similar hair can decide if that product will (or won't) work for them.",

    "body": "[Packaging and product texture shots](https://imgur.com/a/F6hqmpb) \n\n#Review type \nMixed overall - negative considering the exfoliating claims, but a good soothing cleanser 🤔 WRP. It does \"help to reduce the acne\", as they claim. Just not in the exfoliating _way_ they claim. Read on to find out why 😂\n\n#Skin type\nOily. Sensitive, malassezia (fungal acne) - prone, PIE/PIH-prone, mildly acne-prone\n\n🐳 Age: 30\n\n🐳 Current climate: Hot and dry-ish\n\n#Usage timeline\nStarted using it in April 2021, finished it in March 2022, so that's almost a year. Crazy, right? 😂 Used it twice or thrice a week, as I would any exfoliating cleanser\n\n🐳 Price: ₹350 \"retail\", always available for less. Currently ₹199 for 100 ml [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.in/gp/aw/d/B08XQRLX3K?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title) \n\n#Ingredients\nDecyl Glucoside, Lauryl Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, Cocodiethanolamide (Cocamide Dea), Propylene Glycol, Gelpol Et-1/​ Acrypol Et-1(Carbomer), Fragrance, Salicylic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Triethanolamine, Demineral Water\n \n(Had to get it off INCI decoder, the website lists \"Full ingredients list\" as: 2% salicylic acid, 5% glycerin 🙃) \n\n#User experience\nAs a general cleanser, a very nice experience that reminds me of the similarly affordable Clean & Clear Natural Bright face wash (the one with rosewater), that also has a good amount of glycerin. The Rejusure lathers slightly less, even. The Clean & Clear cleanser is one I currently use, and often repurchase, so this is a good thing. \n\nHowever.\n\nI used it up, over the year, and it did absolutely nothing beyond cleansing. No salicylic acid action. Yes, I tried leaving it on for a minute - nothing. \n\nWith the whole bottle over and the review to be written, I finally tested the pH of the stuff, and it's at a pH of 8-9. Before you're horrified, I then realised that face wash is applied on a wet face, and therefore, what my skin is exposed to is far more diluted and milder 🙃 So I tested that as well, [and here are the pH results](https://imgur.com/a/f9Bhg4p). A fine way to finish the bottle up! \n\nThe lathered up product tests at a nice 6.5 👍🏽 Not quite \"skin-identical\" 5.5, but not far off. I believe the mild alkalinity contributes to the good, medium strength cleansing action. \n\nBut here's what the [Paula's Choice website](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredients/ingredient-salicylic-acid.html) has to say about salicylic acid and pH:\n>Salicylic acids works most effectively as a leave-on treatment, ideally within a pH range between 3 and 4. Rinse-off salicylic acid cleansers typically have a higher pH, which likely won’t offer much of an exfoliation benefitnot to mention the contact time with skin is very brief - but the salicylic acid may at least offer skin-calming benefits in this form and can be included in amounts as low as 0.5% to achieve this benefit.\n\nThis face wash is literally basic. Alkaline. Which, hilariously, is what makes it a basic face wash 😂 No exfoliating action. But likely some skin-soothing effect! \n\nI started using an affordable 2% SA serum this month (to be disclosed and reviewed at a later date 👀), that's caused purging and everything. Tested at a pH of four. Very nice. I do know there's salicylic cleansers out there that are more exfoliating, at the right pH and what not, but I personally would get some kind of leave-on, if I'm really hoping to see an exfoliating impact from salicylic acid ☺\n\n#My thoughts\nIf you want a gentle face wash to use every day, sure. The bottle even says to use twice a day, which would be overexfoliating if their pH was at an effective level, but is just fine considering the active isn't gonna be active 🙃\n\nIt may work for acne in the soothing sense. We tend to underestimate the impact of anti-inflammatory treatments, and overestimate that of exfoliants - leading, as many of us have experienced, to over-exfoliation, barrier damage, and/or dehydration 😅 Hydration and soothing often go a very long way to healing acne and breaking the inflammatory cycle. I mean, the whole Korean skincare approach is based on that, and I've come to see that as a sustainable, practical relationship to have with my skin ❤ It works! \n\nI'm not personally super hung up on 5.5 pH balanced facewashes, because AFAIK, the skin reasserts its pH quite easily within a few minutes, since it's washed off so fast anyway, and I think 6-6.5 is the usual pH (will be testing some others to assuage my own curiosity, so I'll update this post if I learn otherwise). If you are very particular about that kind of thing, this isn't the cleanser for you. \n\n... The kicker is, I might repurchase it after all, as a gentle and soothing foaming cleanser. I'd like to see how soothing it really is, when used twice daily 🤔\n\nThe Clean & Clear one is sometimes hard to find, and doesn't have the added soothing benefit of salicylic acid... it's also possible I'll just move on to products that do exactly as they claim. Who knows what the future holds. Not I. \n\nHope this was helpful and/or interesting ☺❤ K, byee!",

    "body": "Hi fellow skincare addicts!\n\n*Edit: These are not 'new' but in the wake of the Purito controversy I think a lot of people are tying to find sunscreens they can trust. I'm not aware of any independent studies on Daylong but their filters are top of the line + I've had a really good experience with them so I thought I would do this review for you guys :)*\n\nI'm honestly a little surprised how little talk there is about these sunscreens, because they do the job fairly well, performance and ingredients wise. I'm talking about the ***Daylong Face Sensitive*** (normal to oily skin) and ***Daylong Extreme*** (face milk version, for dry to very dry skin). They are both broad spectrum SPF 50. They both claim to be water and sweat proof (I have never really put these particular claims to the test, but fyi).\n\n**My skin type:** .... weird. I am 30+, rosacea prone,  and my skin has changed *a lot* in the past couple of years, it's an absolute nightmare. Everything looks shiny on me no matter what, so I try to that into account for reviews XD I don't wear makeup very often, and my routine at the moment is toner + lotion + moisturizer (+squalane if needed), with little variation. Also I have light skin (FP scale 2).\n\n**EDIT: Forgot to mention that where I live it's very sunny and mostly dry all year round. Tested these this winter, maybe I'll do another little post about them in the coming summer.**\n\nAnyway, the review now!\n\n\\-\n\nIngredients:\n\n***Daylong Face Sensitive*** \\- Aqua, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate **(UVB)**, diethylaminohydroxybenzoy hexyl benzoate **(UVA)**, c12-15 alkyl benzoate, dibutyl adipate, tapioca starch, ethylhexyl triazone **(UVB)**, methylene bis-benzotriazoyl tetramethylbutylphenol (nano) (**Tinosorb M, broad spectrum)**, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine **(Tinosorb S, broad spectrum)**, sorbitol, helianthus annus seed oil, glycerin, tocopherol, dimethicone, lauryl glucoside, polyglyceryl-2 dipolyhydroxystearate, cetyl phosphate, cetearyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, carbomer, decyl glucoside, sodium levulinate, triethanolamine, caprylyl glycol, ascorbyl palmitate, ethyl ferulate, sodium anisate, polymethylsilsesquioxane, polyglyceryl-5 trioleate, propylene glycole, rosmarinus officinalis leaf extract, xanthan gum, bht, disodium uridine phosphate.\n\n***Daylong Extreme*** \\- Aqua, Ethylhexyl salicylate **(UVB)**, Methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol **(Tinosorb M, broad spectrum)**, Bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethmethylbutylphenol, Bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine **(Tinosorb S, broad spectrum)**, Diethylhexyl butamido triazone **(UVB)**, tyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, l adipate, Pentylene glycol, Alcohol, Sorbitol, Dimethicone, Cetyl phosphate, Cetyl alcohol, Triethanolamine, Tocopherol, Decyl glucoside, Lecithin, Acrylic acid / VP crosspolymer, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan gum, Aloe berbadensis leaf juice powder.\n\n\\-\n\nThese sunscreens are available in several countries in Europe but I'm not too sure about overseas *(Edit: apparently they are available widely but UV filters and ingredients may vary depending on your area)*. Daylong belongs to a group called Galderma, which owns brands like Differin and Cetaphil. In the EU they are very affordable, ranging between 11€ to 15€ depending on where you buy them, at least in my area.\n\nAs far as my experience using them:\n\n**Texture:** they are both pretty nice, the Extreme is a face milk so fairly liquidy and easy to spread, comes in your average tube over here but I think a pump version exists as well. The Sensitive one does come in a pump, and the texture is more like a gel (if you are familiar with AB gel-creams, it's pretty similar to that). Also spreads easily.\n\n**Longevity & comfort:** so this is definitely the strength of these sunscreens in my opinion. The Extreme one has been designed for people who have actual allergies and/or severe reactions to direct exposure to the sun. One generous application of either lasts forever. As in, if I apply in the morning, go out for a few hours (nothing too sweaty) in the afternoon it's still there on my face. I felt the difference in my skin hydration for sure (not feeling as tight in the afternoon vs most other sunscreens I own). Also works really well under makeup, especially the Extreme one (I mostly use MISSHA magic cushion as foundation).\n\n**Whitecast & appearance:** Unfortunately, the Extreme does have a noticeable white-cast. It's not quite the casper look but it's there (can see it more as a tone-up if you are pale but will never look natural on anything darker imo, if that's something that bothers you). The Sensitive doesn't have a white-cast at all but it's not a completely natural look either. It does look a little shiny on me (most things do), not in an offensive way but in a 'I have just put something on my face' kind of way, even an hour later. I find this a little surprising for something targeted towards oily skin but there you have it.\n\n\\-\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nThese sunscreens may not be the most cosmetically elegant I have tried so far, but they are definitely worth a try in my opinion, especially since they are in a very decent price range for the quality. And of course YMMV, so they might work for you cosmetic wise. They have some really serious protection and while I haven't tested the 'waterproof' claims they stayed on my face *forever* with a few hours of exposure (very sunny all year round here and dry, not much humidity).\n\nIf your skin in seriously dehydrated, I would give these a try if you can because for me they really helped with TEWL and keeping my skin feeling comfortable. Would I repurchase? Yes, for times I know I need some serious protection but I wouldn't use the Extreme one if I was going to meet someone, or at least not without makeup, because I would feel too self-conscious of the white-cast for sure.\n\nJust to clarify, these are not HG for me, but I'm sure they could be for dry and dehydrated skin types, and I think they deserve more visibility. The dream for me is finding something that gives me the same level of comfort and barrier but is more elegant.\n\n\\-\n\n**tl;dr: excellent, long lasting protection + helps with TEWL but white-cast on the Extreme version, slight 'glow' on the Face Sensitive one.**\n\nI hope this was helpful to someone!! :)",

        "body": "I use and enjoy the Daylong Extreme quite often. I like that it has good UVA-filters (Tinosorb M, Tinosorb S and Avobenzone). I have to admit that I'm someone who struggles with reapplying sunscreen as often as you're supposed to, which is why I like using (very) water resistant sunscreens, and I also get the impression that the Daylong stays put very well, which I really appreciate, too. \n\n\nI also enjoy how well it applies, it spreads easily and comfortably, but still dries down and builds a film fairly quickly while other sunscreens sometimes seem to never really settle/dry down. The film it forms also seems really even to me, no streaks or anything, and it doesn't sting my skin or eyes nor settle weirdly in hair, eyebrows or lines. I think price-wise it's also pretty good (I usually buy the 200 ml bottle).\n\n\nEven though I like it a lot, I am hesistant to recommend it, because of the aesthetic aspect. I find that it has a whie cast (due to the Tinosorb M) and it also looks very shiny. It doesn't actually feel greasy or oily to me, but the shine is pretty intense. It's also a bit sticky, which doesn't really bother me on the face because I only notice it there when I touch it, but that's why I don't really like using it on the body, where there's more friction happening. \n\n\nPersonally, I can get the white cast and shininess under control with some make up, so for me personally it's not a huge issue, but I think a lot of people might be bothered by it/don't want to have to put make up on top of their sunscreen to make it look okay-ish.",

I used their conditioner as well, and for a while, it made my hair nice and soft.  \n\nThen all of a sudden, my hair started to get extremely dry and tangled all the time. I am talking self dread locking, small animal around the nape of my neck tangled.  I first chalked it up to being winter and my jacket/scarf being the culprit, but as we moved into and through summer, same problem.\n\nI started changing conditioners, trying different ones, but nothing seemed to help.  I tried protien treatments and that seemed to help. Then I realized, it was not the protien treatment that was helping but the aphogee shampoo for damaged hair which had SLS in it. \n\n I have been experimenting with this theory and it appears that whenever I shampoo with the aphogee and my regular conditioner its fine.  If I use the SLS free shampoos I have, tangled, dry mess. I am thinking that the more natural shampoos just dont cut it (literally), I think there is junk left on my hair, which means that the moisture from my conditioner isn't penetrating in there and also that junk likes to stick to junk, causing tangling.\n\nIs there any rhyme to my reason or am I totally off base here?

However, I believe Fixderma have run numerous tests since they advertise as being Photostable despite their ingredients contradicting science. Personal experience? I haven't tanned while using it and it's one of the few Indian sunscreens that dark skin can wear, if that's a concern for you. My personal take is that there might be more to formulation than just ingredients, and since Fixderma is a brand that has released their spf tests, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. \n\nFor free radical concerns? I just layer an antioxidant rich toner underneath.\n\nIf you're looking for something that looks good based on ingredients, Blynds Emulgel actually has a ton of new gen SPF filters! Unfortunately I am deathly terrified of white casts (just got burned by Z Block) so I decided not to try it just yet. It's also quite affordable!",

    "body": "• There aren’t that many reviews of products by Bonajour online so I decided to make a review post. All of the products were purchased from Amazon through the official Bonajour seller. \n\n(Obviously not sponsored)\n\n1.) Coconut Oil Body Moisturizer (300 ML)\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Cetearyl Olivate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sorbitan Olivate, Pinus Densiflora Extract, Saussurea Involucrata Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Olivoyl Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Glyceryl Oleate, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Arginine, Carbomer, Fragrance, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n- Review: I’ve repurchased this body lotion multiple times already. The scent is so heavenly and it feels so good on my body. This moisturizer is lightweight but moisturizing. 5/5\n\n2.) Sensitive Skin Body Wash (500 ML)\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Disodium cocoamphodiacetate, Lauryl Glucoside, Propanediol, Sodium cocoyl glutamate, Sodium chloride, Glycerin, Centella Asiatica Extract, Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosmary) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Aniba Rosodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil, Octyldodecanol, Echium Plantagineum Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Butylene Glycol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hexylene glycol\n\n- Review: I love this body wash, I’ve purchased it 2 times and it lasts for a while too (even with daily use). It has a relaxing smell and it lathers well. I put this body wash on a Salux washcloth and the body wash doesn’t dry out my skin. 5/5\n\n3.) Mugwort Cream Calming Mask (1.9 fl. oz)\n\n- Ingredients: Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract(32.20%), Water, Kaolin, Butylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Bentonite, Sorbitan Olivate, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Apium Graveolens (Celery)Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Brassica Rapa (Turnip) Leaf Extract, Solanum Lycopersicum (Tomato) Fruit/Leaf/Stem Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Brassica OleraceaItalica (Broccoli) Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Cinnamomum Cassia Bark Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosmary) Leaf Extract, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Enantia Chlorantha (Bark) Extract, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pusatilla Koreana Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Citrusparadisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Octyldodecanol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant) Seed Oil, Oleanolic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder (4,000ppm), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Powder, Tocopherol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Artemisia Vulgaris Oil(500ppm), Sod\n\n- Review: I’m still going through my first purchase of this and it’s grown on me. Although I prefer the I’m From Mugwort Mask, this mask is skin calming too. I use mask this during my menstruation cycle (where my skin is more prone to having skin inflammation) and it felt very nice. I also like how the date when opened can be written on the product + it’s a cheaper mugwort product. 4/5\n\n4.) Propolis Serum (100 ML) \n\n- Ingredients: Propolis Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Water, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Cinnamomum Cassia Bark Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Ulmus Campestris (Elm) Bark Extract, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Gleditsia Australis Thorn Extract, Angelica Dahurica Root Extract, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Bletilla Striata Root Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Seed Extract, Trichosanthes Kirilowii Root Extract, Broussonetia Kazinoki Root Extract, Eugenia Caryophyllus (Clove) Flower Extract, Amomum Xanthioides Seed Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Sodium Carbomer, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Epigallocatechin Gallate\n\n- Review: I have mixed thoughts about this product. The price is really good especially for the size (100 ML). I would recommend this serum for oily skin types. This is more of a skin calming serum rather than a hydrating one. It did calm my face but did little for my acne. This product is also unscented. I didn’t repurchase the serum. 3/5 \n\n5.) Seaweed Lotion (150 ML) \n\n- Ingredients: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Butylene Glycol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Water, Sargassum Fulvellum Extract, Gelidium Cartilagineum Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycerin, Panthenol, Polyglutamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Allantoin, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n- Review: I also have mixed thoughts about this lotion. This product is unscented and the smell of the moisturizer doesn’t bother me. This is a very basic moisturizer. Sometimes this would make my face feel itchy but my face was dehydrated at the time I was using this. I wouldn’t repurchase it and am now using it as a hand lotion (which works). 3/5\n\n6.) Seaweed Skin Toner (150 ML)\n\n- Ingredients: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Water, Sargassum Fulvellum Extract, Gelidium Cartilagineum Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Polyglutamic Acid, Panthenol, Allantoin, Betaine, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n- Review: This is a great toner but after I started using the Matsuyama Hadauru Moisturizing Infusion Balancing Lotion, I used this one less. I haven’t repurchased it. I also used it before applying lotion on my body (which feels nice and cooling). This is a lightweight toner that can easily be layered. This product is also unscented. 4/5",

    "body": "**Here is what the website claims:**\n\nVery high sun protection for sensitive skin for children. Broad-spectrum UVA-UVB protection- Water-resistant- No white marks- Photostable- Silicone-free, Paraben-free\n\n**Ingredient List:**  AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA). C12-15 ALKYL BENZOATE. DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE. METHYLENE BIS-BENZOTRIAZOLYL TETRAMETHYLBUTYLPHENOL \\[NANO\\]. WATER (AQUA). GLYCERIN. BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE. DIETHYLHEXYL BUTAMIDO TRIAZONE. DIISOPROPYL ADIPATE. BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE. CETEARYL ISONONANOATE. LAURYL GLUCOSIDE. POLYGLYCERYL-2 DIPOLYHYDROXYSTEARATE. DECYL GLUCOSIDE. BENZOIC ACID. CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE. CAPRYLYL GLYCOL. CITRIC ACID. DISODIUM EDTA. GLYCERYL BEHENATE. GLYCERYL DIBEHENATE. HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES. HYDROGENATED PALM KERNEL GLYCERIDES. POLYACRYLATE-13. POLYISOBUTENE. POLYSORBATE 20. PROPYLENE GLYCOL. SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE. TOCOPHEROL. TOCOPHERYL GLUCOSIDE. TRIBEHENIN. XANTHAN GUM.\n\n**Active ingredient Percentages**:  Octocrylene (9%). Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (4%). Titanium Dioxide (3.4%). Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane (3%). Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (2%).\n\n**Why I decided to buy it:**\n\n\\- Retails for 33 dollars for 200ml. I got it in a set with the 200ml thermal water on sale for $22.\n\n\\- Good SPF, good UVA protection (PPD is at least 20 with the UVA circle)\n\n\\- It's a spray format. It's the type of spray you spray in your hands first, then rub in. This leads me to believe it'd be a lighter texture from its fluid nature.\n\n\\- Claims to be water-resistant AND have no white marks.\n\n\\- Fragrance-free\n\n\\- Out of the 3 reviews I could find, all of them were great and one said no white marks.\n\n**My Skin Type:**\n\n\\- VERY oily, especially in T-zone.\n\n\\- EXTREMELY clog and acne-prone. Most moisturizers break me now and I've stopped using emollient things completely aside from sunscreens.\n\n\\- NC30\n\n**The Review:**\n\nI got this sunscreen last year. It has a very slight sunscreen smell, hardly noticeable to me. Very runny texture. I used it a few times during the summer but stopped after using it about 5 times. I stopped because: The no white marks thing is not true for me. It is VERY obvious. It stung my eyes like crazy when it would drip down via sweat or washing it off. The water resistance was questionable to me because it looked like it was coming off really easily with sweat and water. I also tried using it on my body a few times but I ended up just leaving a bunch of white marks everywhere I went because it was transferring everywhere. It felt wet yet oily at the same time no matter how long I had it on. All hope was lost.\n\nHowever, I did start using it again for the last 2 weeks as a facial sunscreen. First I use the Soon Jung Toner. Then I use 4 sprays (roughly 1/4 tsp) only on my face (not the neck... don't come for me, I just hate washing things off my neck and when it gets on my shirts). The weather now isn't too hot where I am so the sweating issue wasn't a big deal. I stopped putting it on my eyelids to prevent the eye-stinging and use a separate sunscreen there now (Hada Labo UV White Gel). I haven't noticed any breakouts from it for the last 2 weeks. I wear it for my daily 20 minute walks. I know it's overkill but I'm trying to use it up and I don't care what I look like on these walks! I've also started wearing it to work under my makeup. It wears surprisingly well under makeup and makes it look really dewy. I didn't use primer or powder. I used the Purito Cica clearing BB cream in #27 which is the tiniest bit too yellow for me. This with the sunscreen probably made the best shade match ever for me. I will attach a picture of me wearing the combo on the top half of my face and nothing on the bottom half.\n\nOverall I'm happy that I managed to make it work because of the great protection it offers, but I probably won't get it again because it's so finicky.  It'll probably last me forever because I'm only using it on my face, so the value is there. I'd recommend it if you've got a foundation that's a bit too dark, or if you straight up don't care what you look like and just want the protection. Just don't use it near your eyes or body. Thanks for reading my first reddit review!\n\n**Pictures:**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Eza516d](https://imgur.com/a/Eza516d)\n\nEDIT: Forgot to add pictures and say that I am based in Canada so it's in CAD.",

I've never done a review on here before, but I felt I needed to share this product with the community, especially since I haven't seen this one mentioned too much.\n\n**My background:**  I am a 26-year old female with sensitive, acne-prone, combination skin that is very fair in tone. I tend to get severe cystic acne on my chin and around my jawline which turn into purple scars that take months to disappear.\n\nMeet SIORIS' Day by Day Gel Cleanser. I found out about this product on a K-beauty blog article outlining double-cleansing products for those with cystic acne (I seriously need all the help I can get). This cleanser was being touted as a 99.9% natural, gentle, low-pH, low foam cleanser perfect for use after oil cleansing. It's reasonably priced ($22.99 for 150 mL on Amazon), but still a little more than I'd spend on a face wash; I decided to splurge on this to try to help fix my skin. \n\nSIORIS claims that the cleanser's pH is 5.52, and that 61% of the ingredients are composed of organic essential oils (generally this means the ingredients are grown without the use of traditional pesticides, but many companies use it synonymously with \"natural\", so this didn't have too much of an effect on my decision to purchase this. Source: Currently working on my Ph.D. in organic chemistry). That being said, the ingredients list looks promising:\n\n\"\\*Golden Jeju Pomelo Peel Extract (56%), Decyl Glucoside, Glycerin, Houttuynia Cordata Extract (5%), Lauryl Glucoside, Polyglyceryl-5 Oleate, Salix Nigra (Willow) Bark Extract (2%), Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Pinus Sylvestris Leaf Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Propanediol, Water, Citric Acid, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Gardenia Florida Fruit Extract, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil (\\* indicates organic farming)\" (Source: Amazon; ingredients are not listed on the bottle itself)\n\nNote only one ingredient is \"farmed organically\". Again, not an issue for me, but I wanted to disclose this in case anyone is trying to go all natural. From what I was able to research, most, if not all, of these ingredients, especially those at the top of the list (i.e. There is a higher concentration of them in the product) have a low comedogenic score (around 0-2). The higher this number, the more likely the ingredient is to clog your pores. One of my caveats with this product is that, allegedly, since it is composed so heavily of natural extracts, it has a shelf life of only about 6 months. I prefer my products to have a shelf life of anywhere from 8-12 months, especially when they come in a relatively large container like this one. \n\n**Now for my personal experience:**  I used this cleanser after oil cleansing in the evening and as my primary cleanser first thing in the morning. The first time I used this, I noticed that feeling we all love from a good AB cleanser; no skin tightness or \"squeakiness\"! I felt as though this preserved my moisture barrier well, both after oil cleansing and cleansing alone. This truly goes on like a gel; there is little to no foaming, which is a good sign for those with sensitive or dry ski since foaming agents tend to also be drying and/or irritating for some people. However, this was indeed sufficient to remove excess residue from my oil cleanser. I found 3 pumps of this cleanser to be the right amount during both morning and night cleansing. This is definitely going to last a long time, so hopefully I can use it up before the 6-month expiration mark!\n\nThe morning after using this, I noticed a decrease in inflammation around my acne which continued over the next few days of use. Obviously just this cleanser isn't going to be enough to heal severe cystic acne, but I can definitely vouch for its ability to reduce sometimes embarrassing redness. I've been using this for several weeks at this point, and I really only have good things to say about it. The only thing I really dislike about this is the smell. It's to be expected that a cleanser marketed as \"all natural\" isn't going to have any fragrance, but the smell of all these extracts mixed together is honestly a little off-putting. I'm fine dealing with it, but those with more sensitive noses may not be! \n\nI'd give this a solid **4.5 out of 5 stars**, losing points for the short-ish shelf life and weird smell. This is honestly a GREAT gentle cleanser for those with similar skin conditions to mine. I would definitely recommend sensitive skin types to give this a try!",

    "body": "TL;DR Foaming cleanser with Coco-Glucoside was too stripping. Started experimenting with the emulsion-cream formula (Sodium Polyacrylate, oils, Glycerin, surfactants/solubilizers) – better but still too strong. Got some random papules. Need help with a cleansing formula to make it less stripping but without residue that might contribute to acne. A simpler version of Cerave Hydrating Cleanser dupe left a residue, got some papules and one nodule because of it.\n\nDetailed version:\n\nSince simple foaming cleanser with just 2.7% Coco-Glucoside (and less=no foam) was too stripping to my combo (oily-normal-dry) skin I started experimenting with non-foaming emulsion-cream formula.\n\nI used Sodium Polyacrylate (Cosmedia SP) as an emulsifier and thickener. 1-2%, then found that 2 was too much.\n\nI used some surfactants/solubilizers with it, usually Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate at 0.5-5%. 2-5% was too strong. Every time I tried to add Coco-Glucoside (with an additional thickener, like Xanthan Gum), it was too strong, usually, 4 uses and my skin was crying for help. Even with oils, which I describe below.\n\nThen I added some oils, usually caprylic/capric triglyceride or grapeseed oil. 2-5%. Anything below 5% was too strong. I wonder, maybe Cosmedia is just too good at emulsifying sebum on the face. I still want to use it because it feels great at distributing it on a wet face and it's easy to rinse off.\n\nSo it mostly looked something like this:\n\n* 4-5% Oils\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 0.5-2% Surfactants/solubilizers\n* 1% Sodium Polyacrylate\n* 1% Phenoxyethanol & Ethylhexylglycerin  \n* Lactic acid to pH about 6.\n* Then I tried something simple like:\n* 4% Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 2% PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate\n* 1% Sodium Polyacrylate\n\nIt was still a little too strong, but sebum production lowered and my skin calmed down a little.\n\nNext, I tried something like this:\n\n* 2% Grapeseed oil\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 1.1% PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate\n* 0.85% Sodium Polyacrylate\n* 0.5% Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate\n\nToo strong. Added more oils to 5% total. It's better, but my dry areas are still tight (cheeks) and normal areas a little tight. And now I have a problem with 2-5 papules on oily areas (forehead).\n\nSo I'm not sure what could I change and what's causing inflamed pimples – maybe it's still too stripping or it's because of some PEG-7 residue? I read that it's a surfactant AND a refatener.\n\nSpeaking of residues – I tried to make a simpler version of Cerave Hydrating Cleanser dupe:\n\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 2% BTMS-50\n* 2% Cetyl Alcohol\n* 0.5% PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate\n* 1% Phenoxyethanol & Ethylhexylglycerin  \n* 0.5% Glyceryl Stearate Citrate\n* 0.5% Hydroxyethylcellulose\n\nI used it like 4 times and didn't like it as it left a powdery residue (I think it's a BTMS and/or Cetyl Alcohol?) and I got some papules and one nodule. It was 16 days ago. I read that BTMS can break some people out badly, I wonder if maybe these papules that I've been getting lately was still because of a cleanser with BTMS that I used 4 times 2 weeks ago.\n\nI know it's not a place for acne, but I think it was important to mention it. I think most of my acne is because of just using too stripping cleansers and/or a residue of product.\n\nI am open to suggestions, I can replace Sodium Polyacrylate with something else, but it's hard to get some emulsifiers/solubilizers here in Poland so I'd like to use it.\n\nI use a simple cream after cleansing:\n\n* 5% Dimethicone 350 CST\n* 4% Betaine\n* 2% Sodium Polyacrylate - I think I'll lower it to 1-1.5% because it's a little too thick and it dries too quickly. Or maybe add something like Sorbitol?\n* 1% Phenoxyethanol & Ethylhexylglycerin  \n\nHere's a list of emulsifiers/surfactants/solubilizers (except ingredients which I described above) which I can buy here I Poland:\n\n* Olivem 1000 - I'm afraid a little that it'll contribute to acne, even in a rinse-off product.\n* Creamy Base 1-1-3 *(Aqua, Glycerin, Sorbitan Laurate, Polyglyceryl-4 Laurate, Dilauryl Citrate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate, Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Trilaureth-4 phosphate, Lauryl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin)*\n* Self-emulsifying creamy base *(Glyceryl Stearate Citrate (and) Sucrose Stearate (and) Sucrose Distearate (and) Polyglyceryl-4 Cocoate (and) Cetyl Alcohol (and) Sodium Ricinoleate)* \\- it contains Fatty Alcohol and I'm not sure if it contributed to acne or it was just BTMS.\n* Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate - the description says it needs to have 15-40% of oils to be stable, so I think it's not a good idea for a cleansing formula.\n* Glyceryl Monostearate - it needs to have pH >6.8\n* SLP *(Sorbitan Laurate, Polyglyceryl-4 Laurate, Dilauryl Citrate)*\n* Polysorbate 20, 80, 85\n* *Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate* \\- Again, Fatty Alcohol\n* Simulgel Thickener (Sodium Acrylate / Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer & Isohexadecane & Polysorbate 80) - maybe it would be a better option than just Sodium Polyacrylate\n   * Or this: Emulcold Extra (Sodium Acrylate; Acryloyldimethyl Taurate; Dimethylacrylamide Crosspolymer; Isohexadecane; Polysorbate 60)\n* Polawax (Emulsifying Wax NF)\n* Gosulin IL *(Isoamyl Laurate & Isoamyl Cocoate) -* not an emulsifier, but I read it can be used to wash off dimethicone easily.\n* Carbomer - I think it can't be used alone to emulsify, but it works well with Sodium Polyacrylamide, so I can use less Cosmedia and lower pH >6 without loss of a viscosity \n* Surfactants:\n   * Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside (O110) - I read that it's harsher than Coco-Glucoside.\n   * Decyl Glucoside (O10) - same concerns as above.\n   * Lauryl Glucoside\n   * Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids - it's a new ingredient in a shop, I haven't made a research about it yet.\n   * Cocamidopropyl Betaine - I think I'm allergic to amphoteric surfactants or it's because of some of it binds to the skin? My skin is itchy after I use it a couple of days in a row.\n   * Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate - same as above.\n   * Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate - a product with it made my hands very dry, so I think I don't want to use it on my face. Which is sad because studies have shown that it's one of the mildest anionics...",

It doesn’t foam. I just gently massage the gel around my face. It’s enough to get my pores clear.

For the past month or so I've tried cutting down on my use of silicones and sulfates (only use a sulfate shampoo once a week or so because my hair feels too gross without it), but overall my hair feels worse than before. About a month ago I bought some natures gate products, because I really like how they're relatively inexpensive and also vegan/cruelty free. \n\nFor anyone who's curious: \n\nThis is the ingredients list for the shampoo I've been using: Water, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, sodium cocoyl isethionate, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, lauryl glucoside, glycerin, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract, panthenol, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, borago officinalis (borage) seed oil, tocopherol, ascorbic acid, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, equisetum arvense (horsetail) leaf extract, geranium maculatum (geranium) extract, salvia officinalis (sage) leaf extract, mimosa tenuiflora (mimosa) bark extract, ascorbyl palmitate, polysorbate 20, leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, glyceryl undecylenate, citric acid, fragrance (parfum)*\nMade in the USA from globally sourced materials.\n* Phthalate free\nNo - sodium lauryl/laureth/coco sulfates, phthalates, butylene glycol, artificial colors.\n\nAnd this is the ingredients list for the conditioner - Water, Glycerin (Vegetable Derived), Stearyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Cetyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Vegetable Derived), Benzyl Alcohol, Stearalkonium Chloride (Vegetable Derived), Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Hordeum Vulgare (Barley) Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Fruit Extract, Viola Tricolor (Pansy) Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hydroxyethylcellulose (Plant Derived), Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Fragrance*.\n*Phthalate free.\n\nMy hair feels straw-like even in the shower, there's no slip unless it's absolutely coated in conditioner and then as soon as it rinses out it feels gross again. I also feel like my hair is falling out more often (if I pull at the tips, long strands will start coming out in the shower). I don't really know what to do. I feel like my hair gets buildup pretty easily because when I've tried cowashing with thick shampoos or have put oil in my hair it always feels really weighed down and greasy the next day. I also have a lot of problems with an itchy, flaky scalp. \n\nI was thinking that using a conditioner with water soluble silicones would be the best compromise - all the benefits of silicones but without the buildup. \n\nDoes anyone have any product recommendations? *I've also been looking for a heat protectant spray* that contains water soluble silicones, since I usually straighten my hair a bit to get rid of the really weirdly shaped waves. I've started using a bit of salt spray in my hair as well (not that often), but I feel like it's been drying out my ends. I considered mixing a bit of conditioner or oil (I've heard jojoba is closest to the scalp sebum) into the mix to make it less damaging, but I have no idea what the salt is doing to my hair with or without silicones. On one hand, it seems like silicones would protect my hair from the salt penetrating it too much. But on the other, it would also prevent the moisturizing ingredients from penetrating my hair, so it seems like a catch-22. I do think I need silicones though, because my hair just doesn't seem to be doing too great without them.   \n\nI'm sorry for such a long post! But if anyone could help me, that would be wonderful.

You might want to find a protein free conditioner to use and only use the protein one once every couple of weeks.\n\nAlso salt spray will just dry out your strands and make your hair feel coarse. I'm not sure why you are using salt spray if your straighten your hair. It's more likely to make it wavy and crazy.\n\nIf you use heat I'd maybe get a silicone heat spray/serum and just use it on the parts you straighten. Silicone WILL wash out if you don't use it in every single product and it will help to protect your hair from heat.\n\nWhen not using heat. Use an oil on your ends to keep them soft.\n\nHope that helps :)",

I use one pump, twice a day, and when it comes in contact with water, it generates just the right amount of beautiful foam.  It is super easy to rinse off, nothing lingers behind.  My skin feels refreshed and clean but not dried out.\n\n**Results:**  I fell in love.  This is my holy grail cleanser, hands down.  It helps my skin retain moisture and cleanses without aggravating redness.  And a huge bonus for me is that it smells like lavender, but I know that isn't for everyone.\n\n**Packaging:**  Standard plastic bottle and pump.  Nothing remarkable in that aspect.\n\n**Repurchase?**  Already did!  I've had a bottle on stand-by since July because I kept thinking I'd run out faster than I actually did.  This stuff lasts *forever*.",

I'm in Canada and was using Live Clean shampoos and loved them, but wanted something in a bigger bottle as my boyfriend showers at my place often and we were just blasting through those little bottles together.\n\nI thought Yes To Carrots would be a great replacement, and at first it was fine. But after about six weeks of use, my hair is very dry and I'm experiencing itchy, flaky scalp for the first time in years. Granted, this could be due to the extreme cold weather we've been experiencing of late, but I'm pretty certain it was the shampoo.\nAlso, I'm not sure if the Live Clean shampoo contains silicone, and using Yes To Carrots simply revealed the true state of my hair (which is admittedly pretty damaged at the ends).\n\nEither way, I didn't enjoy the shampoo. On a more superficial note, the shampoo was very thick and difficult to squeeze out of the small opening (not an issue with the conditioner), so I unscrewed the cap and eventually just transferred it to a different bottle.\nAnd perhaps my biggest complaint: it BURNED my eyes! I'm not one to let shampoo run down my face in the shower, but I somehow couldn't keep this stuff far enough away from my eyes.\n\nAnd the conditioner, meh. It was fine. I'd buy it again, in fact.\n\nI notice that the reviews on the Yes To Carrots website are quite mixed. If you're curious about it and it won't damage your wallet, I'd still say it's worth a try.",

So far everything’s thriving and I’ve never gotten sick in 6 years of this. I also never store my water for any amount of time, even in winter I make sure the hoses stay clear and shunt everything onto the land. My philosophy is that the pathogens that the greywater contains, if it’s not allowed to sit for any amount of time and reproduce, are going into hostile territory when they reach the soil and will get promptly eliminated by either the sun or other microbes. I also wash produce thoroughly (with the water going back into the yard) and prefer cooking or fermenting vegetables, so that probably helps too.

    "body": "Hi Skincare addiction!\n\nI've been reading many of the threads here and since I appreciate so much the wealth of info I wanted to share with you my quest for the (as close to) perfect sunscreen, hoping that it will be useful.\n\nA bit of background: I'm a fair blonde Spaniard in my 30s with oily, sensitive skin (please excuse my English, btw). Won't bore you with how many sunscreens I've tried in my life that haven't made it for me, and being pale in this sunny country, believe me- I've tried many. I thought I had found my HG in Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence Face Sunscreen SPF 50/ PA+++ last year but, despite some sources stating that alcohol content might not be so bad for skin in a well-formulated formula, I still wanted to find something that was alcohol, fragrance and nasty stuff free, especially since one is supposed to wear sunscreen EVERYDAY. I'm far from a skincare expert but after a bit of research I decided that, even if the EWG lists have some very nice options, I wanted to find a European sunscreen, as some of the chemicals used here are proven to be safer and more effective (Tinosorbs, etc.), and UVA protection better. But of course, most of these products are not as thoroughly reviewed or not reviewed at all in places like EWG, so there started my quest. My biggest problem with the \"adult\" versions of brands like Bioderma, Avène or La Roche-Posay sunscreens was the fragrance content. But finally, I found this (links in Spanish and French, product is not available in English-speaking countries, but the name and picture will do for those of you who might want to get it shipped from France). Mind you, this is the newest formulation (last year's had still fragrance and parabens in it):\n\nhttp://www.eau-thermale-avene.es/solares/solar-pieles-sensibles/gama-naranja/leche-spf-50-ninos-100-ml-0\n\nhttp://www.eau-thermale-avene.fr/solaire/protection-solaire/peaux-sensibles-sensitive-protection/lait-spf-50-enfant\n\nThis is the composition:\n\nAVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA). C12-15 ALKYL BENZOATE. DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE. METHYLENE BIS-BENZOTRIAZOLYL TETRAMETHYLBUTYLPHENOL [NANO]. WATER (AQUA). GLYCERIN. BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE. DIETHYLHEXYL BUTAMIDO TRIAZONE. DIISOPROPYL ADIPATE. BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE. CETEARYL ISONONANOATE. LAURYL GLUCOSIDE. POLYGLYCERYL-2 DIPOLYHYDROXYSTEARATE. DECYL GLUCOSIDE. BENZOIC ACID. CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE. CAPRYLYL GLYCOL. CITRIC ACID. DISODIUM EDTA. GLYCERYL BEHENATE. GLYCERYL DIBEHENATE. HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES. HYDROGENATED PALM KERNEL GLYCERIDES. POLYACRYLATE-13. POLYISOBUTENE. POLYSORBATE 20. PROPYLENE GLYCOL. SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE. TOCOPHEROL. TOCOPHERYL GLUCOSIDE. TRIBEHENIN. XANTHAN GUM.\n\nNo parabens, no fragrance, safe blockers, hypoallergenic, non comedogenic. I've run the ingredient list both through the Beautypedia and the EWG database and all products seem safe (perhaps savvier redditters can correct me if I'm wrong). All of them. I'm delighted. Not sure why it is rated only so-so in Avène's French page as there are no comments, but seems good to me! Just to make sure I wasn't getting anything nasty I googled reviews in other French webpages (avis) and it's well reviewed. \n\nNow for wearability: I like it A LOT. It doesn't leave a white cast and it's not oily. It absorbs easily and (so far) hasn't made me break out. I've been using it on face and neck for the past days and so far so good. I like the texture a lot. I don't wear foundation so I cannot tell how good it would work in combination but it's good friends with my moisturizer.\n\nI will update in the next weeks to let you know how it's doing, but it seems I might have finally found my HG sunscreen- one marketed for children! Hey, if it's good for them it should be good for me too :)\n\n",

I've tried around 5 different types, all targeted towards people with allergies or babys.  All fit the same criteria: no perfume, alcohol, sulfates, silicones or liquid polymers. While my scalp is now in excellent condition, I keep noticing that after using sulfate-free shampoo, my hair will get badly tangled and dull. It's difficult to brush and I end up ripping through it which does cause some damage. :/ The main surfactants in those shampoos are either coco-glucoside or lauryl glucoside. \nHas someone had the same issues? If so, is there a fix for this? \nCould it be another ingredient that I should look out for? \nI'm very reluctant to use normal shampoo again because I'm scared of getting a dry, bleeding scalp. But sulfates leave my hair so smooth and shiny. :/",

        "body": "So, baby shampoo’s key characteristic is to not hurt when it gets into baby’s eyes. Cuz you know, babies = splashing = foam in eyes. To do this the shampoo pH is close to tears for the sake of the eyes. This pH turns out to be too high for hair, so the shampoo is alkaline. Alkaline shampoos lift the cuticle, which would increase friction and mechanical damage, aka would end up tangling and frizzing more easily. Stick with adult formulas :) There is a higher chance of the pH being around 5-5.5, which is good for the hair.\n\nThe other thing to look for is how you are actually massaging the shampoo on your scalp. Going in circles seems to create tangles. Move your fingers back and forth instead, if you are massaging the shampoo on scalp in circular patterns.",

Nice to see that the hydrating offering doesn't include the problematic (well for me anyway) ester forms of emollient alcohols, though the caveat is that it might not be hydrating enough. The Kids Lotion looks to be a very good middle of the road (as well as extremely affordable) option if you don't mind alcohol so much, but want a little less of it. \n\nAlso if anyone notices something wrong with the listings (like mispellings) please tell me! I had to manually re-type it as the email they sent was weirdly formatted and pasting it here ended up with lots of blank spaces. I figured it would be faster to just re-type it rather than erase the blank space.",

(Context: I have a fairly dry scalp, wash roughly once a week, and have fine hair in good condition.) Most of the things I've tried included sulfates, which could be the culprit, but the old formula skips a lot of common shampoo ingredients so I'm not certain. I'm not familiar with the function of many of these chemicals, and I don't know how much of a difference this will make to the effects of the shampoo--  **How worried should I really be here? Is this likely to make my scalp grumpy, or likely to be fine?** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHelp me HaircareScience, you're my only hope!",

Their whole thing is they have co-ops in Africa for shea production and almost all their products contain it. So this got me thinking: is there a shea shortage? I did some basic googling and it seems like maybe. A few years back (2015) someone posted that the trees skipped a season, which happens every decade. Some also said that a strain on cocoa production was leading to the use of shea as a substitute.\n\nAnyway, maybe that's why they reformulated. Or maybe it was for other supply chain reasons, or something else.",

The results of my test came in, i will line them up down bellow:\n\n- cocamidopropyl betaine\n- lauryl glucoside\n- decyl glucoside \n\nThese ingredients are mostly found in shampoo and showergel. I have tried an shampoo bar from guhl (doesn’t have any of the ingredients) but the eczema in my face only got worse. So now i am looking for other options but dont seem to find any… so maybe someone could help? For further info; i am dutch. \n\nThank you,",

There are a lot of home soap-makers or small companies you could talk to! I've never had my Soap Lady make me shampoo but many of them can and many are willing to custom-make just for you. \n\nAs for the soap making the skin worse, some soaps are drying and showering hot can make that really much worse. I shower in cooler water and moisturize after with as natural a moisturizer as I could find that still worked. A lot of the time I just don't use soap, my skin is really fragile and it seems to wash off the coating that protects it. I've had eczema all my life but it got to be a lot less bad when I stopped using soaps outside of what's made for me or what's in the shampoo that works for me. It wouldn't work for you because it has some of those ingredients; I am mostly allergic to sulfites and that sort of thing. \n\nJust like soaps, there are great resources for making natural shampoo at home! I haven't had to, but it doesn't seem difficult and I would maybe start there?",

I don't feel like leaving the house and I cringe every time I look at the mirror I cringe.\n\nI didn't have acne in my teens and I mean it. My skin was magazine-cover clear. At around 18 I started getting some pimples on my chin, but they were mostly isolated and would go away fairly quickly. This is around the time I started using a proper cleanser and moisturizer. Last year I got the worst breakout ever - I have acne all over my face, including my cheeks, which was terrifying because I'd never got a single pimple in my cheeks. I went to the derm and after trying a lot of topical meds (epiduo, clindoxyl, differin, etc) it mostly went down with doxycycline. My cheeks and forehead cleared up, but my chin didn't.\n\nAnd, jesus crist, I hate my chin so much now.\n\nIf you touch it, it feels like that chocolate nut ice pop meme, it's bumpy even where there's no acne, and some bumps are huge. Also, it's all red since the spots are so close together. It's painful and whenever I touch it, it feels oily and gross.\n\nIt makes me anxious, depressed and self conscious. I find myself trying to cover my chin whenever I talk to people, but mostly I just try to avoid interactions because of that. I hate going out during daytime because the sunlight makes it more noticeable. I installed the dimmest lighting possible in my bathroom so I feel less like shit.\n\nMy current routine is:\n\n- Aché's Nutrel Cleanser for Sensitive Skin (aqua, glycerin, butylene glycol, decyl glucoside, lauryl glucoside, acrylates copolymer, xantham gun, ppg-5-ceteth-20, peg-120, methyl glucose dioleate, triethanolamine, ppg-2 methyl ether, phenylpropanol, triethyl citrate, behenyl alcohol, sucrose stearate, disodium edta, isocetyl alcohol, sucrose tristearate, stearic acid, arginine, veratraldehyde, anisaldehyde, coumarin, tripeptide-3)\n\n- Granado Moisturizing Fluid for Sensitive Skin (aqua, cyclomethicone, isononyl isononanoate, glycerin ,cetearyl alcohol, dimethicone, caprylic/capric triglyceride, polysorbate 60, tocopheryl acetate, polyacrylamide, c13 – 14 isoparaffin, dimethicone crosspolymer, astrocaryum murumuru seed butter, phenoxyethanol, butylene glycol, palm alcohol, laureth 7, piptadenia colubrina peel extract, disodium edta, theobroma grandiflorum seed butter, lecithin, propanediol, bht, triethanolamine, cyclotetrasiloxane, phytosteryl canolate, methylisothiazolinone, caprylyl glycol, potassium sorbate, tocopherol)\n\n- Bioré Aqua Rich Watery Essence FPS 50 (2015)\n\nRight now I have at home Pond's Cleansing Oil, Cosrx Low PH Good Morning Gel Cleanser, Cosrx One Step Original Clear Pads and HOLIKA HOLIKA Smooth Egg Skin Peeling Gel, but to be honest I'm scared of trying them and just making it all worse.\n\nI should also mention that I've been examined for PCOS and they found nothing. I'm not on the pill, I don't wear scarves and I've tried multiple brands of tooth paste. I'm at loss.\n\n[Here](https://i.imgur.com/X7m5BIu.png) are some pics.

    "body": "Ursa Major Fantastic Face Wash\n\nIt’s not right...but it’s okay…\n\nThe Ursa Major brand is one that I came across a few times at Ulta but never really gave it a second look. But, after seeing their amazing photos on Instagram and looking into the brand story a bit more I was very intrigued. \n\nThis Vermont based skincare line is focused around a more outdoors/active kind of aesthetic...they really put an emphasis on “less is more” as well. Cleanse, tone, and hydrate are pretty much all you get from their offerings (which is not a bad thing at all).\n\nEvery beautiful mountain landscape pic from Ursa Major just called to my personal love of hiking, rock climbing, and simply being outside. So, without reading too much into the formulations I took the dive with their Fantastic Face Wash. \n\nBut now looking back...I wish I would have used my brain instead of my heart and researched more deeply (I guess not even that deep...turn the bottle around Anthony!).\n\nI did initially really enjoy using this product. The slightly watery cleansing gel/fluid applied to my skin very nicely. Even though this is a low pH cleanser...the later that I was able to create was quite dense and luxurious (especially with my whip maker). Using it with the Foreo Luna 3 also created a fairly dense foam.\n\nIn addition, the wonderful woodsy/bright aroma that the Fantastic Face Wash provides had me quickly falling in love. The scent immediately reminded me of the Sulwhasoo Snowise EX Cleansing Foam that I adored (now discontinued). But...it’s this forest wonderland-like scent that ended up being this product’s downfall (for me).\n\nRather than using synthetic fragrance...the Ursa Major Fantastic Face Wash uses a whole host of essential/fragrant oils. Black Spruce, Fir, Rosemary, Lime, Lemon, Grapefruit, Cedar, Vetiver, and Spearmint Oils all make an appearance here. \n\nDuring the first week/few uses I didn’t see any negative reactions to this product...and for me that was so good to see. “Okay Anthony...you aren’t seeing the typical sensitivity this time around. Maybe the warnings about essential oils you are seeing everywhere aren’t as big of a deal.” I thought to myself.  \n\nBut soon enough...I started to notice little flashes of redness, the occasional angry blemish, or odd warmth on my skin popping up. By week three, my skin started to make it apparent that something was wrong. \n\nI decided to work the Ursa Major Fantastic Face Wash out of my routine in favor of something that I have used in the past (the 23.5n Rice Soothing Cleansing Foam) and my skin seemed to quickly calm down and several blemishes began to recede. I have been using some awesome soothing products in my routine (reviews coming soon) and they just seemed to immediately feel more effective. It was like the rest of my routine had less to work against to provide a benefit.\n\nSo, I think three weeks is enough for me when it comes to this cleanser. I really, really wanted to like it and be one of the few that truly can put nearly anything on their face LOL! But...the trend has been that products using a large amount of essential oils (specifically citrus oils) have a tendency to anger my skin.\n\nA lavender oil here, or a small amount of rosemary there seem to be okay...but there really is a tipping point for me and the Ursa Major Fantastic Face Wash pushed things a bit too far. It will however make an excellent body wash!\n\nFull Ingredients List: Aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf juice\\*, aqua/water/eau, lauryl glucoside, coco-glucoside, sodium cocoyl glutamate, caprylyl/capryl glucoside, inulin, glyceryl laurate, sodium lauroamphoacetate, gluconolactone, sodium lauroyl glutamate, xylitylglucoside, anhydroxylitol, xylitol, oryza sativa (rice) extract\\*, camellia sinensis leaf extract\\*, saccharum officinarum (sugarcane) extract, citrus limon (lemon) fruit oil, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) fruit extract, vaccinium myrtillus fruit extract, acer saccharum (sugar maple) extract, picea mariana leaf oil\\*, pseudotsuga menziesii branch/leaf oil\\*, rosmarinus officinalis leaf water, lavandula angustifolia (lavender) flower water\\*, citrus paradisi peel oil, citrus aurantifolia peel oil, artemisia ludoviciana (owyhee) leaf oil, juniperus virginiana wood oil, tanacetum annuum flower oil, nardostachys jatamansi oil, vetiveria zizanoides root oil, mentha spicata leaf extract, sodium phytate, PCA glyceryl oleate, citric acid, calcium gluconate, leuconostoc ferment filtrate, sodium benzoate, soybean peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, limonene \\*Denotes organic\n\nWhere To Buy (Ulta $28.00 USD - 236 ML): [https://www.ulta.com/fantastic-face-wash?productId=pimprod2017694](https://www.ulta.com/fantastic-face-wash?productId=pimprod2017694) \n\nOne Thing To Note:\n\nThere are so, so, so many things that can potentially cause sensitivity/irritation. You may find this product to be absolutely amazing and if so...I’m jealous. My reasoning for pointing to the fragrance here is just trial and error/looking at what has caused a problem for my skin in the past. The common theme has been an overabundance of essential oils...especially lemon and orange oil. Let me know if you spot anything else here that stands out as a potential trigger. On the flip side, I don’t think I can recall my skin reacting to a product that uses a low amount of synthetic fragrance...but time will tell.",

I've been wanting to find more natural options & this one checked off so many boxes: All natural, made in the USA, cruelty free, simple approach/routine...I've also been trying to find a moisturizer with more \"oomph\" for the winter. Given that they're based in VT, I thought they might be a good choice. \n\nI, too, usually have to avoid any fragrance but convinced myself this would be OK because it's all natural.\n\nTried the Fortifying Face Balm & the Fantastic Face Wash & basically realized very quickly I should have gone with my head instead of heart.\n\nFace Balm:  Very little went a long way in terms of coverage. I didn't find it very moisturizing overall. But, I'm used to a heavier feeling moisturizing cream & this was a nice, light gel, so I decided to keep trying it thinking maybe I just needed to get used to the lighter weight. Also, I had been having some more redness than usual & Ursa Major said this would calm skin (among other things) & several ingredients were listed as soothing\n\nFace Wash: Loved the scent & the feel of the wash. It felt very cleansing & pleasant without being drying\n\nHOWEVER\n\nOne week of the Balm & my face was redder than before. I could see a line of where I had applied the balm (not near my eyes) & where I hadn't.\n\nOnly tried the Face Wash 3 times over the course of the week. I was worried about trying both at once & not being able to tell which one worked/didn't work but temptation got the better of me & I tried both those few times. My skin was *not* happy. Somehow even redder with the combo. It would fade after maybe half hour so, but it would overall by redder than normal.\n\nI gave up after a week & am now trying to figure out how to calm my skin back down.\n\nSuper bummed because I really wanted to like this product line. I think it could work for people with less sensitive skin.\n\nI do appreciate that they offer good sample/travel size options so at least I'm not feeling guilty over throwing out a ton of product.",

While this cleaned most of my hair, the part that had been bleached for the color was always sticky, and the ends of my hair were floofy. What's up with that?\n\nI've since switched to a sulfate-free shampoo, but I notice that all of the surfactants in shampoo are similar sounding compounds, like sodium lauryl glucoside carboxylate and sodium cocoyl isethionate. What are these compounds, and why are they better than sulfates? \n\nI also find that 2nd day hair is far too greasy to go out in public with when I use these shampoos. I blow dry my hair regularly because I don't have time to let it air-dry in the mornings, and if I go outside it'll freeze.\n\nI think the best texture my hair has ever had was when coloring it all over with Manic Panic, then blow-drying it. My hair is always voluminous and bouncy when I do this, but then I have to wash the dye out to avoid staining everything. Is there a way to achieve this texture without the dye? Is that feasible on a regular basis?\n\nI typically try to wear my hair layered and messy, but my hair is so straight that layers disappear, and it has a hard time staying messy.\n\nI'm looking for an all-over routine, preferably with products I can order from Amazon Prime.",

decided to focus on this topic. i know i've procrastinated far too long but my birthday is next week and its my goal to start a skincare routine by then and to have the best skin i can have by then. here's my issues:\n\ni'm a 16 (soon to be 17) year old girl without a job and living in a low income family. i've been on SCA long enough to know that good skincare isnt cheap,  i don't have the money to but a $15 cleanser. idk why but i've been hesitant about starting a SCR probably because i'm fearful i'll do it wrong or the purging & potential for a product not agreeing with me will be too much to handle. i have a lot of new mini kits that i got for christmas and i thought i'd ask for your guy's reviews on these products (because i haven't seen anyone post on most of these yet) and your recommendations for me on creating a routine with what i currently have instead of going out and buying some the the HG products of this community. \n\nfirst, here's some history of my skin:\ni've known about skincare since i was about 11 from watching yt, before that i had did nothing but let water hit my face in the shower. at first i went to walmart and target trying any product that interested me and was cheap. i never stuck to a routine and to this day i've never consecutively washed my face for more than 5 days. the good news is in the last couple of years i've been educating myself more and watching out for certain ingredients and staying away from harmful products. i know i probably sound crazy to you all but i've never even used sunscreen. thankfully, it seems as if i'm crazy blessed because i've never had bad skin issues or a lot of acne, in the last 2 years though my skin has been the worst i've seen it, i don't really know how to rate it because sometimes i look at my skin and think \"ah its not that bad it's practically clear\" and other times, especially when i'm wearing makeup or in good lighting i'm thinking \"goodness, my skin is awful\". my main issue are blackheads on my nose, texture all over my face especially on my forehead (but pretty much unnoticeable unless you're up close or in good/dim lighting), whiteheads on my chin, and a few persistent zits on my cheeks and a few others that pop up here and there. \n\nnow to the products. i'm going to list all of the products i've accumulated and not used recently, most of them are sample sizes from gift sets. my request is for you to give me a mini review on any of the products you've tried and from the skin issues i've relayed for you to tell me what you'd suggest my routine to be with the products i have. if you need anymore information please let me know, and i apologize if i've one anything wrong or worded things weird i'm new to this site and new to skincare at this level.

Skincare actually doesn’t have to be expensive to be effective.

Here, you could alternate and  use The Ordinarys Salicylic Acid 2% Solution.\n\nMoisturizer \n\nSunscreen daily \n\nPm: \n\nCleanse with same gentle cleanser\n\nExfoliate 2-3 times per week - I’d recommend The Ordinary  Glycolic Acid 7% Toner \n\nSerums/Acids: Here you can use either the salicylic acid or Niacinamide again. Or you can use one of these in the morning and one at night but don’t mix them together. \n\nMoisturize",

It's ~$7 and the salicylic acid will help with your minor acne problems. \n- Sunscreen   \nI would highly recommend getting sunscreen or start wearing ball caps if you're out in the sun.

My hair is:\n\n1.\tShort\n2.\tThin\n3.\tStraight\n4.\tNot very dense\n5.\tI just did the strand of hair in a cup of water test from the wiki, and it sank almost immediately, so I guess that means it's pretty porous\n6.\tPretty oily, so I shampoo every few days (schedule and sweat depending) and will usually cowash with [Kirkland Signature Moisture Conditioner](https://www.costco.com/kirkland-signature-moisture-conditioner-33.8-fl-oz.product.100375352.html) in between\n\nI've used typical grocery store shampoos (Old Spice, Axe, Dove for Men, Head & Shoulders, etc.) in the past and a lot of them have been too harsh, making my hair really frizzy and drying out my scalp, kicking oil production into overdrive, which is something I'd definitely like to avoid. I figure something with similar ingredients, or ingredients that do the same thing would be best, but I have no idea where to look. They are:\n\n>Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Lauryl Glucoside, Glycerin, Cannabis Sativa Seed Oil, Panthenol, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil, Tocopherol, Ascorbic Acid, Ruscus Aculeatus (Butcher’s Broom) Root Extract, Pimenta Dioica (Allspice) Fruit Extract, Pilocarpus Pennatifolius (Jaborandi) Leaf Extract, Silybum Marianum (Milk Thistle) Seed Extract, Sambucus Nigra (Elder) Flower Extract, Chrysanthemum Sinense Flower Extract, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Polysorbate 20, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Glyceryl Undecylenate, Citric Acid, Fragrance (Phthalate free), Caramel\n\nThis list is what I see on my bottle. They must've reformulated at some point before going under because it's different from what's listed in the link.\n\nSo yeah, that's where I'm at right now. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!",

It made perfect sense: I have a very oily scalp and somewhat drier, coarser ends.\n\nSo I tried to start shampooing every other day instead. My mom and brother told me that my hair should adjust after a few days or a couple of weeks at most, but it has now been just over one month and my hair is still a gross greaseball on the non-shampoo days. I can't stand to touch it, and I put it in a ponytail to hide the greasiness as much as I can but I'm getting real tired of ponytails (they give me headaches too).\n\nCould you offer me any advice? Is it just my hair type, or am I using bad products?\n\n**My hair:**\n\nFairly thick and coarse, shoulder length, never been dyed, trimmed frequently, slightly frizzy, mostly straight but with a tendency to flip (not quite waves, unfortunately).\n\n**My routine:**\n\nEvery morning I take a shower, and I only use shampoo every other day (for a month now). I use conditioner in the shower every day, no matter what. I use a wide tooth comb straight out of the shower, and right before I go out the door I blow dry with warm (not hot) air, no brushing or styling. On shampoo days, my hair is nice and shiny, but some grease starts to show at the very end of the day. My hair usually looks its best in the late afternoon or evening - just enough oil to be soft and silky, but not too much! On non-shampoo days, my hair is visibly oily and feels kind of sticky. It's not a good look.\n\n**My products:**\n\n[Live Clean Sensitive Hypoallergenic Shampoo](https://well.ca/products/live-clean-sensitive-hypoallergenic_92987.html) - every other day\n\nIngredients: Aqua (Water/Eau), Camellia Sinensis Extract**, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract **, Sodium Methyl 2-Sulfolaurate, Disodium 2-Sulfolaurate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Stearyl Citrate, Lauryl Glucoside, Glycerin, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Fruit Extract, Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) wood Extract, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Peel Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Extract, Vanilla Planifolia Fruit Extract, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate,  Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Hydroxide, Citric Acid\n\n[Live Clean Apple Cider Vinegar Clarifying Shampoo](http://www.amazon.ca/Live-Clean-Vinegar-Clarifying-Shampoo/dp/B00BIWYZZK) - weekly or biweekly (there is an ingredient list at the link)\n\n**---**\n\nLive Clean Fresh Water Moisturizing Conditioner\n\nI'm afraid I can't find an ingredient list online for this product, but I do know that it is SLS/sulfate-free.\n\nOR\n\n[Marc Anthony Instantly Thick Volume Conditioner](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=prod2079998)\n\nIngredients: Deionized Water with Phytokeratin, Centrimonium Chloride, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, T.E.A., Dimethicone Fluid, dl Panthenol, QUarternium-15, Polyquat-7, Fragrance, D7C Red #17, D&C Yellow #11.\n\nI would love to find a solution to shampooing every day, since I want to colour my hair soon and I'm afraid of over-washing.

Though I will say it took me a good three months to get my hair to calm down when I was switching from SLS/silicones and daily washings to every other day, so you might just need to give it more time. But now I can go two or even three days between washings pretty easily and when I went back home for the holidays EVERYONE was commenting on how healthy and good my hair looked, so the three months of buns and hats were worth it!\nAlso, definitely get some dry shampoo! Batiste is good and cheap and available at Ulta, but does have a pretty strong smell, and all of them smell different, so if smells bother you, you will have to get one of the higher end dry shampoos.

I’ve been managing seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp really well with a Vichy anti-dandruff shampoo, which I use 1–2 times per week. It contains the following ingredients:\n\n\tAQUA / WATER - SODIUM LAURETH SULFATE - COCO-BETAINE - GLYCERIN - DIMETHICONE - CETYL ALCOHOL - HYDROXYSTEARYL CETYL ETHER - CARBOMER - CI 19140 / YELLOW 5 - CITRIC ACID - 2-OLEAMIDO-1,3-OCTADECANEDIOL - PPG-5-CETETH-20 - PROPYLENE GLYCOL - SALICYLIC ACID - SELENIUM SULFIDE - SODIUM CHLORIDE - SODIUM HYDROXIDE - SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE - PARFUM / FRAGRANCE\n\nOn other days, I typically use Sebamed Plus Shampoo for sensitive skin, which has these ingredients:\n\n\tAqua (Water), Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Lauryl Glucoside, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Hydroxypropyl Oxidized Starch PG-Trimonium Chloride, Piroctone Olamine, Menthol, Parfum (Fragrance), Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, CI 42090 (Blue 1 Lake), CI 47005\n\nI know the transplanted area needs time to heal properly, so I’ve held off using these shampoos for now. However, seborrheic dermatitis tends to flare up if I don’t keep it under control, so I want to know:\n\t1.\tWhen can I safely resume using my Vichy anti-dandruff shampoo?\n\t2.\tShould I wait longer to use the Sebamed shampoo as well, or is it gentler and safe to use earlier?\n\t3.\tAre there any precautions or alternative recommendations for managing seborrheic dermatitis during this healing phase?\n\nI’m following my surgeon’s advice for post-transplant care, but I’d love to hear from others with similar experiences or knowledge. Thanks in advance for your help!",

(sometimes, I have the feeling it will only end with the inevitable decline in testosterone that awaits us all, but I digress...)\n\nFor the last 2 months, I've been religiously doing **NOTHING** about my skin.  \n\\- Sleeping in the same dirty pillowcase (y, gross...)  \n\\- No moisturizer, toner, active, clay mask or whatever.  \n\\- Only using the same BODY cleanser to wash my face once a day and that's it.  \n\n\nThese are the ingredients in the body cleanser I used (**Douche Soin Corine de Farme KIDS 2en1 Corps & Cheveux**) : *Aqua, Lauryl Glucoside, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Glycerin, Parfum, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Citric Acid, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Coco-Glucoside, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Aloe Barbadensis Extract\\*, Viola Tricolor Extract\\*.*  \n\n\nDespite this one being marketed toward kids, it made my 28 yo skin tight, dry and flaky even on the first use. No surprise there, as it happens with every cleanser (even the most gentle ones) if I don't moisturize afterward.  \n\n\nRESULT : **not a single pimple in 2 months.** Skin would get dry and flaky, then oily... and that's it.  \nI'd gladly keep this weird new routine, but fine lines started to show more as a side effect of dryness. So I started to moisturize again 2 days ago (LRP Toleriane Sensitive Cream) and... pimples are back.  \n\n\n**TLDR ; What would be the more minimalist, simplest moisturizer to avoid breaking out ? I've read about Sebamed Gel and ordered it but it looks loaded to me (12 ingredients, Propylene glycol, Vit B5...)**  \n\n\nPure squalene oil, The ordinary HA + moisturizing, aquaphor are already out of the equation. Dimethicone / panthenol are also out.  \n\n\nThanks for reading and answering :)",

So now i am on prednison again for the second time this month. Everytime i shower i have really red itchy skin. So the time came and i did an allergy test. The results of my test came in, i will line them up down bellow:\n\n- cocamidopropyl betaine\n- lauryl glucoside\n- decyl glucoside \n\nThese ingredients are mostly found in shampoo and showergel. I have tried an shampoo bar from guhl (doesn’t have any of the ingredients) but the eczema in my face only got worse. So now i am looking for other options but dont seem to find any… so maybe someone could help? For further info; i am dutch. \n\nThank you,",

I have sensitive skin and this hasn’t broken me out. It has made my lips peel though. I’m not a huge fan of lip balm. \n\nI’ve been using it for almost two months twice a day with nothing else except for Supergoop’s mineral matte tinted sunblock during the daytime. I’m still using the same bottle. I don’t have to use very much. Product is white and has a moisturizer consistency. Spreads easily. Very little smell unlike the very chemical-smells of TO retinol products. It’s easy to get too much product out of the little container. \n\nThis gives me similar results to The Ordinary’s granactive retinoid 2% emulsion that uses an encapsulated form of retinol so it is less irritating. I haven’t gotten any bad photosensitivity from it which is nice unlike retinol. \n\nThis gave me a lot of smoothness like the ordinary’s above mentioned product, but I still haven’t seen a big change in scars. I didn’t see a big change with my scars or discoloration/uneveness with other retinol products. I don’t have wrinkles so I can’t say anything about that. \n\nI wouldn’t say this is enough alone as a moisturizer if you have dry skin. My skin is normal to dry and I’m okay with putting on a second layer in areas that are drier. No greasiness. Absorbed by my skin quickly. I’ll probably have to go back to putting my Saturday skin glacial water cream and or my le prunier plum elixir on in the next few months though. \n\nIt’s really cheap and I like that it gives my skin a poreless look. I think I’ll keep buying it until something nicer comes along without EOs and other irritants.",

    "body": "Hello!  \nI wanted to share my progress being into the curly girl method for 2 months. I wanted to make this post mostly of the Amla powder results that I had. Unfortunately my first Amla application formed even better curls but I failed to take pics, so those pics are after a month and it seems that my hair continues to form them. Sometimes they make strong curls and other times very lose.\n\nHair type: High Porosity Hair, forming 2B up to 3A curls, color treated, and 6 months ago bleached.  \nSo this is why I invested heavily as you will read below in many products to see what works for me.  \nBecause I have white hair, I have to dye them.  \nMy choice is Eko hair dye from Exclusive (perhaps the best copper red I have ever had in my life) Passion and Color line. Its an organic hair dye.\n\nProducts:  \nCurl activators as masks, 1-3 times per week. (still figuring out a good program)\n\n1. Amla powder (2 spoons at a ball, little warm water to make a watery paste, apply on hair and leave it for an hour) Amla is the biggest curl activator for me and my type of hair out of any other expensive product that I use (see below about Olaplex 3 and Bond Rehab by Curlsmith)\n2. Olaplex 3, the first 2 times I didn't notice major difference, but the third time I left it for an 1.5 hours and my hair formed almost like the amla nice waves/curls, so I believe it works and for bleached hair it might take sometime.\n3. Bond Rehub by Curlsmith, to be honest no major difference after 2 applications. But because I bought 3 on black friday big discount I will use them all!\n\nShampoo:  \nI have 2 main choices after my experiments with Rhassoul which was a disaster, my hair type doesn't like clays, oh well my face does, so nothing goes to waste.\n\n1. Organic shampoo base from europe with only those ingredients  *Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice\\*\\*, Decyl Glucoside\\*, Lauryl Glucoside\\*, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid* (I will add some goodies in there but not sure yet what)\n2. Oat Water! To my surprise oat water is amazing! I read the info from here [https://thebeautybrains.com/2016/06/can-i-use-clay-to-shampoo-my-hair-episode-136/?fbclid=IwY2xjawHGSTRleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHdrKS1uRFh4\\_G0-vcgtRpyUHzKvYtN4cD4FEO6\\_WU-undlxtyQ9mn8fJ8g\\_aem\\_jwYOR\\_6Q4rvyWFYToZbwfg](https://thebeautybrains.com/2016/06/can-i-use-clay-to-shampoo-my-hair-episode-136/?fbclid=IwY2xjawHGSTRleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHdrKS1uRFh4_G0-vcgtRpyUHzKvYtN4cD4FEO6_WU-undlxtyQ9mn8fJ8g_aem_jwYOR_6Q4rvyWFYToZbwfg)\n\nso, I bought organic oats whole, (not powder, please don't use powder, disaster results according to some reddits), I boiled a good amount of oats (to make it concetrated) for 2 min to release natural saponins and left it for about an hour at the hot water to cool down. Used a strainer and voila! Oat water, doesn't bubble but it does clean the hair, use conditioner after and my hair were sooooo soft.  \nI highly recommend oat water when someone doesn't use heavy products, for curly girl method its amazing for some people.  \nOats contain two unique steroidal saponins, avenacoside A, 1, and avenacoside B, 2.  \nPoint is works! Especially for people who chose to shampoo more than once per week like me.  \nBUT once per week I would use regular shampoo curly girl approved.  \nAnd most importantly it might be color safe for people like me who use copper hair dyes and its a pain in the a\\*\\*\\* that color.\n\nConditioner:\n\n1. Organic conditioner base from EU with those ingredients *Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cetearyl Alcohol\\*, Betaine, Coco-glucoside\\*, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter\\*\\*, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil\\*\\*, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil\\*\\*, Helianthus Annus (Sunflower) Seed Oil\\*\\*, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Xanthan Gum, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil\\*\\*, Citric Acid, Tocopherol*\n\n(again this is a base for making your own conditioner I will add some things not sure yet what)\n\n2. Garnier Fructis Keratin Hair Bomb MASK  \nIf someone search the ingredients they are Curly girl approved BUT it doesn't contain keratin, it contains a 3 hydrolyzed proteins combo that seems benefit the hair a lot!  \nSoy, wheat and corn hydrolyzed proteins and I indeed see difference at my curls.\n\nStyling products:  \nCurly Angels brand\n\nHallelujah curl activator  \nCurling Mousse  \nGlorious Curling Gel  \nI am highly satisfied with those, I cannot say Curlsmith is better or not, at least at my hair.\n\nCurlsmith  \nHydrate and Plump leave in (it works, it gives volume)  \nWeightless air dry cream (I guess it works, not major difference than the curly angels brand)  \nHydro Style Flexi Jelly (it works good, I prefer the Glorious Curling Gel, it leaves the hair softer)  \nCurl Defining styling soufflé, (same as above, they all work, but if I put too much they dry the hair a bit to the touch)\n\nMoroccanoil brand:  \nMoroccanoil uses one ingredient which is great for hair VEGEPRO! which is this:  \nHydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol  \nThis works, this is why at my first post I said in 7 days my hair transformed, I was using them every day.  \nBUT they contain silicons and I wanted to go full proper curly girl method, I can actually buy Vegepro and make a solution much cheaper to be honest. No need to pay such expensive hair line for one ingredient that you can find cheap.\n\nSo basically I discontinued the moroccanoil and I will use all the above.  \nThe only rule I don't follow for the curly girl method is washing my hair once per week. I wash my hair more often, Im not convinced about the water/oil science to be honest, and I have to use those below for my high porosity hair because any hair dyes leave my hair faster than an athlete running at 100 meters.  \nSo my plan is to use diluted ACV vinegar rinse and coconut oil that closes the hair scales before any wash.  \nI am figuring out a proper weekly method, now its a bit chaotic.  \nso here are my pics and my progress.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyhmeswgb76e1.jpg?width=1453&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=463969bf83917cd495ab09dfe5d996fee696ec60\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2sxmj0xgb76e1.jpg?width=896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=62f5eb163ee6709d370571cc774ebeefe26d9a00\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g49gaaxgb76e1.jpg?width=1298&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca3127549a3a322d31b08be134813d8eb7dc5b94\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xi8a7pxgb76e1.jpg?width=606&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d54357ff5f2c87314f30a5c28e8fa8ae8173703b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/41ipxqxgb76e1.jpg?width=1314&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13382c8a43236537ad8cbe2983139aa518d42a45\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xruzqvygb76e1.jpg?width=1286&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d4a45ee941a207d726990b51f0cc336bf0229a8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uqwv08ygb76e1.jpg?width=1196&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=deedc539c31cbce9cc4add4d26a46b8e0428dc57\n\nThis picture with the white roots is early days, 2 months ago when I first saw 3A curl, one single curl, Im so happy! This is how it all started to get more serious about this method. AND I had my very first complement at the street from a lady if those are my natural hair! and I proudly said YES!!!!!!!\n\nNo finger coiling, I leave them all natural and wild to see how they behave.  \nIn the future I might start finger coiling them to enhance the result.  \nSo, this is what I had and my progress.

Look at the packaging ...any vitamin c product should be stored in a way to minimize light and air entry. This one looks good as far as the packaging goes. The ingredients look good. And then you're down to reviews - do they look like you can trust them and are they from reputable sources?

However longer alkyl chains give better foam stability ([source using SLS as an example](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927775722021495)).\n\nThe coconut oil-derived surfactants have a mixture of C8-C10, while the lauryl group (C12) has a longer chain length and will have a more stable foam. \n\nBetween SLI and SLEI, the ethoxylated portion reduces foaming ability ever so slightly because it the ethoxylated groups lead to a slightly higher surface tension compared to non-ethixylated versions. This is probably because of how the ethoxylated groups affect packing at the air-water interface. \n\nSo SLI will have the best foam stability. You can also use enhancers of foaming that reduce surface tension while still be gentle (like CAPB) creating mixed micelles. Not all surfactants do this well, so play around and see what you like. \n\nI do think a few percent SLI in a shampoo does a lot for foaming while still leaving a alkylglucosides formula rather mild. I usually don't use more than 10 wt% in a AG-derived formula.",

    "body": "First of all, sorry if I give a bit too much information. Itchy scalp is a little bit gross when you go into the description of it, so sorry about that.\n\nOkay, so since I was very, very young (think one or two years old) I've had ridiculously sensitive skin. Eczema is constantly there, I have to banish scented soaps from my skincare routine, etc. etc. My scalp's usually been pretty alright, up until recently. \nA while ago, I think about last year around this time, I started getting a really itchy scalp. It was around my hairline in the middle of my head, in patches more than all over. I called it dandruff, though I'm not sure *what* it was, as I got small white flakes in my hair around the same time. I bought E45 shampoo, which (as far as I remember) stopped the itching and helped me cope with it while it cleared up. \nI don't remember my scalp being abnormally itchy over spring or summer, but late autumn this year it's got really bad again. A couple of weeks ago I noticed it getting steadily itchier, and unfortunately I'm guilty of scratching it more than I probably should, at one stage to the point of it bleeding slightly. Again, it's usually worst in one or two patches, but it's so horribly itchy that once or twice it's stopped me from sleeping properly until I either give up and scratch it or put moisturiser in the places where it's worst (which stops it for a short while but makes it necessary for me to wash my hair in the morning.) The other day I accidentally scratched it, and a yellowy scale-flake thing came off, which is (I think) the first time that's happened. This time around, E45 has done nothing for me. That might have something to do with the fact that I've been trying to cut out harsh cleansers from my usage and E45 shampoo has Sodium Myreth Sulfate in it. What I'm using at the moment is a shampoo called Child's Farm, which is in fact a baby shampoo that's been 'dermatologically approved' and 'paediatrician approved' and 'suitable for eczema' but it hasn't been doing much for me. It cleans my hair/scalp perfectly well, and for a while afterwards my scalp isn't itchy, but about midway into the day or the next day, my scalp's back to being itchy again. \n\nI'm really sick of having an itchy scalp, and I don't know if it's down to the cold/wet weather (it's been foggy and cold and rainy recently), too much of something in my diet, or just sensitive skin that is now affecting my scalp. I've heard of and can get Neutrogena T-Gel, but it's expensive and I don't want to try it unless I know it could make a difference. \n Has anyone out there gone through this and come out the other side? Is it just an awkward phase of itchiness or is there some magical thing that I haven't heard of that can bring it back to being healthy and itch-free again?\n\nIf anyone's curious, the ingredients in Child's Farm shampoo are as follows: Aqua, Sodium Coco-Sulfate,  Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Lauryl Glucose Carboxylate, Argan Oil Polyglyceryl-6 Esters, Parfum, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Lauryl Glucoside, Limonene, Lactic Acid, Sucrose Laurate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil*, Citric Acid, Alcohol, Amyl Cinnamal.\n\nEdit: wording",

        "body": "Seborrheic Dermatitis is the fancy tern for the dandruff spectrum, though it's usually just used for the severe side of the spectrum. It typically causes flakes and the bigger, more severe flakes in more severe cases are typically yellow and often greasy. It's very closely related to eczema to the point that eczema of the scalp is usually diagnosed as SD, and some people think they are completely the same disorder. Both are associated with an overgrowth of a particular microbe that is supposed to be on our skin. Its technically a fungus. The overgrowth irritates the skin and when the immune system goes after it, even more damage is done to the skin, which just lets the microbe overmultiply more. Ketoconazole shampoo (nizoral) is very good at attacking that particular fungus, as is monistat cream, but obviously ask your pharmacist or doctor because I'm not either of those things. Tea tree oil 5% in shampoo is also supposed to be very effective against that kind of microbe.",

I use Tazarotene 0.05% gel every other night with azelaic acid 20% in the mornings (sometimes). My skin is naturally oily but the taz and winter weather makes me very very dry and dehydrated. My skin hates hyaluronic acid so i try to hydrate with glycerin etc. Ive also switched to using only micellar water and rinsing it in the mornings rather than cleansing and it helps (i think)\n\nI currently use micellar water to remove sunscreen & any makeup. Then use a water based cleanser. While its pretty gentle, i still find my skin gets really dry afterwards. So while im not a fan of true oil cleansers (dont like the feeling and too tedious for my depressed brain to do every night), i found that most ‘oil’ cleansers in my country are actually water based. Here’s one i have which has Aqua as the first ingredient and then some gentle ‘oily’ surfactants:\n\nAQUA, PEG-7 GLYCERYL COCOATE, GLYCERIN, GLYCERYL OLEATE, COCO-GLUCOSIDE, NIACINAMIDE, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF EXTRACT, GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA ROOT EXTRACT, SODIUM LAURYL GLUCOSE CARBOXYLATE, LAURYL GLUCOSIDE, SODIUM PCA, SAPONARIA OFFICINALIS ROOT EXTRACT, PARFUM, SODIUM CITRATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, SORBIC ACID, BENZYL ALCOHOL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID\n\nIts supposed to be a dupe for the Cerave Foaming Oil Cleanser or the one by LRP or Bioderma since the ingredients are almost the same. \n\nMy question is: can i use this as a primary cleanser at night after micellar water? Does anyone use the Cerave or LRP one as a sole cleanser?",

        "body": "I’m a bit confused by the notion of a water based oil cleanser, chemistry-wise. This seems contradictory. Your question gave me a few questions of my own, and I ended up going down an of interesting rabbit hole from your question… 😅\n\nSo short answer - the two products you list should be fine to use together as long as it’s not drying your skin out. I would tend to think it would be very drying, but nonetheless BETTER than your status quo routine regarding dry skin. So it’s very personal… I know for my skin I could not get away with either of these routines, but we’re not the same. I’d make sure to keep your moisturizer game strong either way.\n\n——————\n\nOkay a bit more nitty gritty now (& apologies if I repeat anything you know already). \n\n(1) just to be clear, micellar water IS considered a water-based cleanser as well. So you as-is have been using 2 water-based cleansers. This is why I said earlier switching to something like the cerave oil-based one you mentioned might be a bit gentler on your skin… water-based already strips away your natural skin’s oils. THAT BEING SAID, yes micellar water is a lot more gentle and since you were removing makeup with it, I don’t necessarily disagree with your thinking (for me it’s too abrasive, but again maybe not for you). \n\n(2) Also to clarify, the cerave cleanser you referenced IS an oil-based cleanser, from all indications I can see. I’m guessing that you may be seeing water as the first ingredient to (1) provide a phase for all those aqueous surfactants you mentioned and (2) perhaps those various oil-based ingredients, when added together, surpass in quantity the water present. Note here - I was going off the cerave ingredients I found on this website (https://www.cerave.com/skincare/cleansers/facial-cleansers/hydrating-foaming-oil-cleanser)\n\n(3) Just looking at the first few surfactants you listed, for instance, PEG-7[…] & coco-glucoside are water-soluble, while glycerol oleate is not by default (but is fairly dispersible apparently). I could go on but long story short sometimes those surfactants might look more oil-based than they actually are (& vice versa). I’ll spare you the nerdy chemistry for now but the science is super fascinating. \n\n(4) Given points 1&2, switching to 1st micellar, 2nd cerave-dupe, from 1st micellar, 2nd traditional water-based, would generally be less drying and therefore more calming. If you suspect though that leaving some of your skin’s natural oils might break you out, this switch might be more irritating in the acne department. \n\n(5) Completely a personal anecdote - I found micellar only in the PM, & rinsing with water only in the AM to work best for me. I also do wear spf & makeup most days. It sounds like my skin is a lot more fragile than yours though. \n\n\nPhew! Apologies for how long I let this get. Hopefully something here is helpful! :)",

There are a lot of products on the market that contain a lot of chemicals, many of which have by now become familiar sights in ingredients lists. There are an awful lot of them derived from coconut and palm exclusively, but there are also a lot of them that can be derived from other sources. There isn't any regulation currently in place (at least in the United States, that I am aware of) that requires manufacturers to disclose the source of their chemicals, which can lead to a lot of companies falsely claiming that their products are coconut and/or palm free, when they are just the opposite. Some of the chemicals you will see are things like Vitamin A-palmitate. This one in particular can be tricky as it can be found naturally in beef fat, or it can be derived from coconut or palm plants. You see it a lot in milk, particularly milk that is 2% or less milk fat, which would make you think that it is derived from beef fat, but when you start digging, you find out that it is far more readily available (and therefore cheaper for dairies to buy in the quantities they use) to acquire a palm derived version. Now, devil's advocate here, it may be simply that the dairies do not actually know that they are adding a palm derived product into their milk, as they are likely going through a bulk supplier.\n\nI have also come to realize that there are a lot of companies who advertise things as being coconut and/or palm free and are completely unaware that the chemicals they use come from those sources.

It's really annoying.\n\nOne of my safe fall-back products is \"Avène Tolerance Extreme Emulsion\". It's not miraculous, but it has minimal ingredients and is decently moisturizing, which makes it a good baseline for when you're trying to deal with rosacea. The sebamed face gel is another good simple moisturizer if you can get your hands on it. It's very difficult to find in Sweden but I know it's readily available in a lot of central european countries.\n\nAs for the cleanser, the one you listed looks quite bad. It has a lot of aggravating ingredients (perfume, limonene, SLS etc)\n\nThat said all of this varies a lot based on how your skin is. Personally I can't handle any heavy products with shea butter which rules out a lot of fantastic moisturizers. I have to make due with gel ones, but if your skin is on the dry side you may find yourself needing something heavier.",

They sell S-traps (prohibited by code) and Drano (destroys your pipes and kills septic bacteria) at Home Depot. I would be wary of this line of thinking moving forward. There are absolutely zero checks and balances preventing companies from still making this stuff and selling it. I don't mean to be rude, just want to make you aware. \n\nAs for the coconut oil, it shouldn't be an issue if it isn't in it's natural, saturated state. Because coconut oil is a saturated fat, it is solid at room temperature. That's how it clogs pipes. \n\nYou may want to take a little sample of each product and mix them in a cup of water to see how they react to moisture. There's a chance the powders become coagulated and clumpy/sticky.",

    "body": "Does anyone know of a good conditioner with water-soluble silicones? For the past month or so I've tried cutting down on my use of silicones and sulfates (only use a sulfate shampoo once a week or so because my hair feels too gross without it), but overall my hair feels worse than before. About a month ago I bought some natures gate products, because I really like how they're relatively inexpensive and also vegan/cruelty free. \n\nFor anyone who's curious: \n\nThis is the ingredients list for the shampoo I've been using: Water, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, sodium cocoyl isethionate, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, lauryl glucoside, glycerin, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract, panthenol, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, borago officinalis (borage) seed oil, tocopherol, ascorbic acid, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, equisetum arvense (horsetail) leaf extract, geranium maculatum (geranium) extract, salvia officinalis (sage) leaf extract, mimosa tenuiflora (mimosa) bark extract, ascorbyl palmitate, polysorbate 20, leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, glyceryl undecylenate, citric acid, fragrance (parfum)*\nMade in the USA from globally sourced materials.\n* Phthalate free\nNo - sodium lauryl/laureth/coco sulfates, phthalates, butylene glycol, artificial colors.\n\nAnd this is the ingredients list for the conditioner - Water, Glycerin (Vegetable Derived), Stearyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Cetyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Vegetable Derived), Benzyl Alcohol, Stearalkonium Chloride (Vegetable Derived), Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Hordeum Vulgare (Barley) Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Fruit Extract, Viola Tricolor (Pansy) Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hydroxyethylcellulose (Plant Derived), Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Fragrance*.\n*Phthalate free.\n\nMy hair feels straw-like even in the shower, there's no slip unless it's absolutely coated in conditioner and then as soon as it rinses out it feels gross again. I also feel like my hair is falling out more often (if I pull at the tips, long strands will start coming out in the shower). I don't really know what to do. I feel like my hair gets buildup pretty easily because when I've tried cowashing with thick shampoos or have put oil in my hair it always feels really weighed down and greasy the next day. I also have some issues with an itchy, flaky scalp. \n\nI was thinking that using a conditioner with water soluble silicones would be the best compromise - all the benefits of silicones but without the buildup. \n\nDoes anyone have any product recommendations? *I've also been looking for a heat protectant spray* that contains water soluble silicones, since I usually straighten my hair a bit to get rid of the really weirdly shaped waves. I've started using a bit of salt spray in my hair as well (not that often), but I feel like it's been drying out my ends. I considered mixing a bit of conditioner or oil (I've heard jojoba is closest to the scalp sebum) into the mix to make it less damaging, but I have no idea what the salt is doing to my hair with or without silicones. On one hand, it seems like silicones would protect my hair from the salt penetrating it too much. But on the other, it would also prevent the moisturizing ingredients from penetrating my hair, so it seems like a catch-22. I do think I need silicones though, because my hair just doesn't seem to be doing too great without them.   \n\nI'm sorry for such a long post! But if anyone could help me, that would be wonderful.

Prior to no poo people complimented my hair on a regular basis. Times have changed.)  \n\nI used Alaffia African Black Soap for all Hair and Skin types Peppermint along with the OCM on my face and it has worked miracles clearing my skin, the bottle says that Alaffia can double as a shampoo so I was wondering if I should give that a go.   \nHere is the ingredient list..\n\nAfrican mint (ocimum canum) extract (aqueous), African black soap (saponified shea butter* [butyrospermum parkii] and palm kernel oil [elaeis guineensis]), lauryl glucoside, peppermint essential oil.\n\nSo could I try this and still be no poo?

    "body": " \n\nBeard shampoos free of SLS or SLES have become a popular trend in  men's grooming products. As consumers grow more health-conscious, they  are paying closer attention to the chemicals present in everything they  utilise, ranging from food to personal care items.\n\nIs SLS that bad? What is Sodium Lauryl Sulphate? Should we seek an alternative?\n\nHopefully, this article will help you understand a little bit more about what SLS is and what it does.\n\n**What is** **Sodium Lauryl Sulphate?**\n\nSLS stands for **Sodium Lauryl Sulphate**. SLS is a  common ingredient in many personal care products, such as shampoos,  soaps, and toothpaste. It is a surfactant, which means it helps to break  up oils and dirt, creating a lather that allows the product to clean  effectively. However, some people may experience irritation or  sensitivity to SLS, and therefore, opt for SLS-free products.\n\nSLS is a synthetic chemical compound, but it is derived from natural  sources. SLS is typically made from the fatty acids found in coconut or  palm kernel oil, which are natural substances. However, during the  manufacturing process, these fatty acids undergo several chemical  reactions, including sulfation and neutralization, to create Sodium  Lauryl Sulphate. So, while SLS is derived from natural sources, it is  considered a synthetic ingredient due to the chemical processing it  undergoes.\n\n**Is** **Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS) bad?**\n\nSome potential drawbacks of SLS include:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Skin irritation: SLS may cause skin irritation, dryness, or redness  for some people, particularly those with sensitive skin or pre-existing  skin conditions such as eczema or dermatitis.  \n \n2. Eye irritation: If products containing SLS come into contact with the eyes, it can cause irritation or discomfort.  \n \n3. Stripping natural oils: SLS can strip the skin and hair of their  natural oils, leading to dryness and potential damage. This is a concern  for people with dry or delicate hair.  \n \n4. Environmental impact: Although SLS is considered biodegradable,  there are concerns about its production process, which involves palm  kernel or coconut oil. Palm oil production has been associated with  deforestation and habitat destruction.\n\nIt is essential to note that reactions to SLS vary from person to  person. Some individuals use products containing SLS without any issues,  while others might experience adverse effects. Not everyone will be  allergic to SLS. If you have concerns about SLS, you can look for  SLS-free products or consult a dermatologist or healthcare professional  for advice tailored to your specific needs.\n\n**How is Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS) made?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Extraction of fatty acids: The fatty acids are extracted from the  plant source, usually through a process called hydrolysis. This involves  breaking down the triglycerides found in the oils into their  constituent fatty acids and glycerol.  \n \n2. Production of lauryl alcohol: The extracted fatty acids are then  converted into lauryl alcohol (also known as dodecanol) through a  hydrogenation process. Hydrogenation involves adding hydrogen to the  fatty acid molecules under high pressure and temperature, in the  presence of a catalyst.  \n \n3. Sulfation: Lauryl alcohol is reacted with sulphur trioxide (SO3) to  produce lauryl sulphate. This reaction, called sulfation, involves  adding a sulphate group (SO4) to the lauryl alcohol molecule.  \n \n4. Neutralization: Finally, lauryl sulphate is neutralized with an  alkali, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH), to  produce Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS) or Potassium Lauryl Sulphate  (KLS), respectively.\n\n**Are there alternatives to Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS)?**\n\nThere are several alternatives to Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS) that  can be used in personal care products as surfactants or foaming agents.  If you are seeking an SLS free option, then some of the below will be  what to look out for.\n\nSome of the more common alternatives include:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Sodium Coco-sulphate (SCS): This surfactant is derived from coconut  oil and is like SLS but considered milder. Although it shares some  similarities with SLS, some people find it less irritating.  \n \n2. Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate (SLSa): SLSa is a milder and less  irritating alternative to SLS. It is derived from coconut and palm oils  and provides good foaming and cleansing properties.  \n \n3. Cocamidopropyl Betaine: Derived from coconut oil, cocamidopropyl  betaine is a gentle surfactant and conditioning agent that is often used  in combination with other surfactants to create milder formulations.  \n \n4. Decyl Glucoside: This is a mild, non-ionic surfactant derived from  plant-based sources, such as corn or coconut. It is biodegradable and  suitable for sensitive skin.  \n \n5. Coco-glucoside: Another plant-based, non-ionic surfactant,  coco-glucoside is derived from coconut and fruit sugars. It is gentle  and effective for sensitive skin and hair.  \n \n6. Lauryl Glucoside: A mild, non-ionic surfactant made from coconut or  palm oil and glucose, lauryl glucoside is often used in baby and  sensitive skin products.  \n \n7. Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate: This surfactant is less irritating than SLS and provides good cleansing and foaming properties.\n\nAnother ingredient that is often used to replace SLS in shampoo is **Cocamidopropyl Betaine**  (CAPB). CAPB is a mild surfactant and foaming agent derived from  coconut oil and used in personal care products such as shampoos, body  washes, and facial cleansers.\n\nCAPB is known for its gentle cleansing properties and is often used  in combination with other surfactants to reduce potential irritation. It  also has conditioning properties, which can help to soften and detangle  hair. As a result, it is commonly found in products formulated for  sensitive skin or those marketed as being mild or gentle. So, seeing  this in a beard shampoo makes sense.\n\nWhile Cocamidopropyl Betaine is considered to be a safer and milder  alternative to more aggressive surfactants like Sodium Lauryl Sulfate  (SLS) and Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES), some individuals may still  experience irritation or allergic reactions to CAPB. However, such  reactions are generally less common compared to stronger surfactants.\n\nWhen looking for an alternative to SLS, it's essential to consider  the specific product and your skin or hair type. Many people with  sensitive skin or allergies find that these alternatives cause less  irritation or dryness compared to SLS. However, individual reactions may  vary, so it's a good idea to test a new product on a small area before  full use.\n\n**TL:DR**\n\nSodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) does not cause issues for everyone, and  some people can use products containing SLS without any adverse effects.  However, it is essential to recognise that even some SLS alternatives  can be potential irritants for certain individuals. It is not a  one-size-fits-all situation, as everyone's skin and hair may react  differently to various ingredients.\n\nWhen trying out any new product, it is always wise to perform a patch  test first. Apply a small amount of the product to a discreet area of  skin and wait for at least 24 hours to check for any signs of irritation  or an allergic reaction. This precautionary step can help you avoid any  unpleasant surprises when using the product more extensively.\n\nIf you have already found a product that works well for you and does  not cause any irritation, it is advisable to stick with it. However, if  you are in search of something new, consider exploring products  specifically formulated for sensitive skin, particularly when it comes  to facial and hair care products. These formulations often contain  milder ingredients and are less likely to cause irritation or other  adverse reactions.\n\nRemember that finding the right personal care products may require  some experimentation, as individual preferences and sensitivities vary.  Always pay attention to your skin's and hair's response to a product and  adjust your choices accordingly to maintain their health and  well-being.",

I personally haven’t had any issues with expiration date and authenticity from my orders and their customer service can’t be beat! When a product ends in .97 it means that it’s being priced to sell / transition out of stock. However I’ve seen “last chance” pricing drop even further \\(I’m looking at you May Coop Activator. I got it for $15 but it dropped even further to $10\\) so if you’re interested IMO order sooner rather than later.\n\n### [PERRICONE MD H2EE FIRMING FOAM MASK $14.97](https://www.costco.com/Perricone-MD-H2EE-Firming-Foam-Mask.product.100393188.html)\n\n$50 MSRP listed on the [main website](https://www.perriconemd.com/skincare/shop-by-collection/h2-elemental-energy/firming-foam-mask-5211.html). I made a post about this one previously when I first noticed the price drop and since then mine has arrived in the mail. I think of it as a “wash\\-off” mask and I’ll use it after my weekly glycolic acid 30&#37; peel. It’s an ointment\\-like texture that turns into a light foam. You have to work fast or it starts foaming up on you! I use maybe 4 pumps per session, the instructions do say “use liberally”. The instructions say leave on for about 10 minutes but I HATE the way it feels as the bubbles subside, it feels incredibly itchy to me. On washing off it leaves a slippery feel on the skin, so beware if you’re one of those people who hate that feeling.\n\nI don’t know that it does much but it does seem to reduce my irritation post\\-peel. It’s a fun purchase for the price.\n\nIngredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Bentonite, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Saccharide Isomerate, Disiloxane, Decyl Glucoside, Betaine, Dunaliella Salina Extract, Phosphatidylcholine, Sodium Borohydride, Perfluorohexane, Perfluoromethylcyclopentane, Perfluorodecalin, Disodium Adenosine Triphosphate, Octyldodecyl PCA, Menthyl PCA, Algin, Carica Papaya Fruit Extract, PEG\\-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Coconut Acid, Sodium Chloride, 1,2\\-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, PEG\\-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Xanthan Gum, Acrylates/C10\\-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Isethionate, Butylene Glycol, PEG\\-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Potassium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Phenoxyethanol.\n\n### [PERRICONE MD COCOA MOISTURE MASK, 2 FL OZ $24.97](https://www.costco.com/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10701&langId=-1&storeId=10301&krypto=TsFcXaXAk3BsXSa9ZKqbfv%2FGHosRgoiYXtztTh0rA%2BrBzz1draIbYguAsg0jWazTrNBaKfWpFbjTFtSZzQTyJE9eIvrg4Ir9NaN0MPgrR64%3D&ddkey=http%3ALogon)\n\n$69 MSRP listed on [main website](https://www.perriconemd.com/skincare/treatments/cocoa-moisture-mask-5327.html).

They are based on individual ingredients rather than **any negative effects the final product may have.** The way ingredients interact in a formulation can influence their potential impact, and the presence of a specific ingredient does not automatically equate to harm when used in a product. It's always crucial to do your own research, consider the product as a whole, and keep in mind that personal reactions can vary greatly. When making decisions about personal care products, it is recommended to consult with healthcare professionals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brief**: This baby wipes highlights Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice and Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract as primary ingredients, known for their soothing and moisturizing qualities - attributes that can be advantageous for the delicate skin of infants. Nevertheless, the inclusion of Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, and Lauryl Glucoside, while serving as mild surfactants that are generally safe, warrants attention as they could potentially cause irritation in individuals with very sensitive skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nLiquid: Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Glycerin, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Carbomer, Lauryl Glucoside, Caprylyl Glycol, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Benzoate.\n\nFabric: No Information\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Typical ingredients description and side effects\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract\n   * Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, more commonly known as aloe vera, is a widely used ingredient in skincare products due to its soothing and moisturizing properties. It's considered generally safe for topical use. However, like any ingredient, it can cause side effects in some individuals, especially if they're allergic to it.\n   * However, it's worth noting that certain parts of the aloe vera plant contain a compound called aloin, which has been linked to potential carcinogenic effects when ingested in large amounts. Most commercial aloe vera products, including skincare products and topical applications, are made from the clear gel found inside the aloe vera leaf, not the outer part of the leaf where aloin is found. The process used to prepare aloe vera for commercial use generally removes aloin to non-detectable levels.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Allergic Reaction: Though rare, some individuals might be allergic to Aloe Vera. Signs of an allergic reaction could include skin redness, rash, itching, swelling, or discomfort. If these occur, discontinue use and consult a healthcare provider.\n      * Skin Irritation: Some people may experience minor skin irritation when using products containing Aloe Vera, particularly if they have sensitive skin.\n      * Photosensitivity: There have been some reports suggesting that topical application of Aloe Vera might increase sensitivity to sunlight, which could potentially increase the risk of sunburn. However, these reports are limited and this side effect is more commonly associated with oral ingestion of Aloe Vera. Given the transient nature of contact with a baby wipe, it is even less likely to cause this effect.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Sodium Benzoate\n   * Sodium benzoate is a type of salt of benzoic acid and is commonly used as a preservative in many types of products, including food, medicines, and personal care products like baby wipes. It's used to prevent the growth of microbes, thereby prolonging the shelf life of products.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Some people might experience skin irritation from products containing sodium benzoate. This could present as redness, itching, or a rash. Babies have sensitive skin, so they may be more susceptible to irritation.\n      * Allergic Reactions: Though rare, some individuals may have an allergic reaction to sodium benzoate, which could result in symptoms such as redness, swelling, or hives.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Glyceryl Polyacrylate\n   * Glyceryl Polyacrylate is a polymer that is often used in personal care products such as baby wipes because it helps to stabilize and thicken the product, and can also act as a humectant, helping to maintain the moisture level in the skin. This ingredient is generally regarded as safe and is not commonly associated with adverse side effects. However, like any substance, it can potentially cause side effects in some individuals.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Some individuals, especially those with sensitive skin, might experience minor skin irritation such as redness, itching, or rash.\n      * Allergic Reactions: It's less common, but some individuals might have an allergic reaction to Glyceryl Polyacrylate, leading to symptoms such as hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Sodium Hydroxide\n   * Sodium Hydroxide, also known as lye or caustic soda, is a strong alkaline substance that's used in many industries. In personal care products like baby wipes, it's typically used in very small amounts as a pH adjuster to ensure the product is safe and comfortable for use on the skin. In very high concentrations, sodium hydroxide can be harmful and corrosive, but the amount used in personal care products is generally safe. However, like any ingredient, it has the potential to cause side effects in some individuals.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: In some individuals, particularly those with sensitive skin, sodium hydroxide could potentially cause skin irritation. This might present as redness, itching, or a rash.\n      * Allergic Reactions: Though rare, some individuals might have an allergic reaction to sodium hydroxide, leading to symptoms such as hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe grading system used by EWG in the Skin Deep database is as follows:\n\n1 to 2: Low hazard\n\n3 to 6: Moderate hazard\n\n7 to 10: High hazard",

She recommended me one but it has SLS and I'm not sure about using it - is it not that good for hair and skin as it is with humans?

Acid exfoliants need time to penetrate the skin in order to do their work.\n\nTo purchase acid exfoliants in the UK, you can try Paula's Choice UK (expensive), Forever Young Active Solutions (cheap), or Nip + Fab (mid-range), which is available in Boots and Superdrug.\n\nI use Korean products as I find they suit my skin best and are pretty good value: CosRX Blackhead Power Liquid for BHA and Whitehead Power Liquid for AHA (this is quite strong and not necessarily for beginners). They are around £7 each for around 3 months of product. There's a lot of info over on /r/AsianBeauty.\n\nIf you worry about sunlight, do you wear a high factor sunscreen every day? This is important regardless, but if you do start using acids it's absolutely essential. Asian sunscreens are believed to be higher quality in terms of sun protection, and sit more nicely on the skin than Western products. I use Biore Watery Essence, which is SPF 50+ PA++++, and you can buy it from Ebay and Amazon UK for around £7-10.\n\nPIH (acne scarring) can potentially be helped to heal with a Vitamin C serum, but honestly, sunscreen is your bff in the fight against scarring, at least to start with.\n\nWe sound like similar skin types, so feel free to ask me anything else! This is my routine, which is keeping my hormonal acne under control.

I used the All Bright serum (see AHA/ BHA mega review in the sidebar) and was underwhelmed.\n\nFurthermore the UV index is pretty low at present, low enough not to be useful for vitamin D production in the skin. I would be more concerned about getting enough bioavailable vitamin D in your diet since that and the long chain omega-3s also in oily fish are really important for skin health. Experts recommend up to four servings of oily fish a week.\n\nConsult your family doctor about the breakouts because the most effective acne fighting actives are on prescription. Some of those may necessitate vigilant use of a broad spectrum sunscreen. Do also check out our ingredients Wiki, particularly the entries on vitamin A, vitamin C (sodium ascorbyl phosphate) and niacinamide.",

I've learned that it's been entirely discontinued (due to its microbeads, I suspect), and therefore all my trusty online suppliers had run dry.

Unsure of what to buy, I picked up some Güd grapefruit body wash from Target. This worked fine, and when I started running out I bought Everyday Coconut body wash. That's when I noticed it was having an effect on my skin I hadn't experienced. It doesn't dry me out, but while I'm in the shower after using the wash it would leave a filmy feel, like I wasn't clean, and I felt like plastic.\n\nSo, I decided to finish off the rest of my Güd body wash...except now it had that effect as well. Around the same time I tried using some homemade soap and it felt the same, like I couldn't wash it off. After reading about body washes on this subreddit, I invested in Alaffia's African Black Soap, and found it was having the same effect. \n\nI'm not sure if my body just isn't reacting well to these body washes, which seems unlikely since one worked then all of a sudden didn't. It's driving me nuts, and doesn't affect my partner the same way. \n\nHere are the ingredients, if that helps:\nGüd: Water, Sodium Coco-Sulfate, Fragrance, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Chloride, Coco-Glucoside, Glycerin, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hyssopus Officinalis Extract (Organic), Juglans Nigra (Black Walnut) Leaf Extract (Organic), Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract (Organic), Rosa Canine Fruit Extract (Organic), Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Leaf Extract (Organic), Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Alcohol Denat., Potassium Sorbate, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol.\n\nEveryday Coconut: Coconut Water, Coffee Berry Extract,  Saponified Virgin Coconut Oil, Lauryl Glucoside, Decyl Glucoside, Copra Extract.\n\nAfrican Black Soap:  African Black Soap (Saponified Shea Butter and Palm Kernel Oil) and African Mint Extract",

They’re relatively safe, but usually bad for people with textured hair as it can build up and make the hair shaft weaker over time since less moisture gets in. \n\nTry using a shampoo with a sulfate surfactant. If your shampoos do have sulfates, then find a good clarifying shampoo. That’s my advice.

I'm trying to make a natural bubble bath solution, and a lot of the ones I see on the market use decyl glucoside and lauryl glucoside, glycerin, and citric acid, but many of them aren't ph adjusted unfortunately. I know that citric acid is used to make products more acidic, but they can also reduce foaming abilities of surfactants (although I'm not sure if this is the case for all surfactants or just anionic ones). At least from what I found online, there seem to be 4 types of surfactants (nonionic, anionic, cationic, amphoteric), and I'm not sure if there are types of acids as well that would or would not inhibit each of their foaming abilities. Additionally, from what I read, it seems like glycerin is on the acidic side? But also I don't know if adding too much would also negatively impact bubbles forming. Basically, I'm wondering if there is any way to lower the ph of a solution that is mainly made up of a naturally derived surfactant without inhibiting its ability to foam. Also, do bubbles only form in alkaline solutions?",

Anyways I have this gentle face cleanser from Neutrogena (ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Lauryl Glucoside, Potassium Acrylates Copolymer, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Fragrance) \n\nI ran it through an ingredient checker online to find out that it has sulfates. There’s so much confusion for me because I want to know what I’m putting on my skin. I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks. I’ve heard that this ingredient may cause a few health conditions and I’m worried if it’s too late too stop using it too",

    "body": "I will tell you my recent history to understand my case.  In Novermber 2021 i started having a crazy hairloss. Some months before i had checked my ferritin and it was 28 ! But i had no time to go to the doctor again.  I also had no idea that ferritin 28 is low back then, cause they didn't marked it with black, and i also used to have super low ferritin in past so i thought 28 is great. From the start of 2022 i am using the same shampoos. 1st hand with a 92% natural ingredient shampoo that is it for hairloss and 2nd hand with a pharmaceutical dandruft shampoo. After that i was keep loosing a lot of hair, even if i started taking folate. But i didn't had a blood panel done. (I have checked thyroid though A LOT of times in my life and never had an issue). I didn't managed to grow my hair really thick after that, some times i was loosing a lot of hair, some others not so much. \n\nI got covid and had 40 fever for 3 days and after exactly 2 months, April of 2023, a CRAZY hairloss started. I was in shock. I also had 34 ferritin though. Hairloss stopped or stopped being so severe in Late August. And gradually my hairloss came to normal. Normal for me is loosing 2-3 hairs after the wash day, and as i go further to the next washing day i loose more hair but nothing serious. After that i managed to make my hair a lot thicker ! Sure though the were 2 areas were they were still not thick. But in general i was happy, cause they looked good. i just wanted to grow them longer.\n\nAnd OUT OF NOWHERE in July i started loosing A LOT of hair.  I checked ferritin and it was 49. Pretty good and better than before. It could be higher but i guess its not so low to cause hairloss. 1 year before doctor had told me that 34 it COULD possible cause hairloss, and in order to exclude it, it should be higher. So 49 cannot be that bad.\n\nI know my body, and i know that in the first days after the washing day i am just loosing 2-3 hair per day, and as i go closer to washing day (day 7) in the last 2 days i see some more hair shedding but nothing crazy. All summer though  was loosing A LOT OF HAIR every day, it was pretty shocking. Even in the first day after washing.  Even some hours after washing. I was shedding a lot.\n\nI run out of the 92% natural shampoo i use on the 1st hand. So i putted some water on it to use it and i saw LESS hairloss but still not normal it was just better. The next week i had run out of it so i only used the other shampoo i have in 2-3 hands cause it does not foam. And my hairloss came back to NORMAL. Exactly after the wash i didn't used it !\n\nI am pretty sure its from the shampoo, it was just a pitty to loose ALL MY PROGRESS and now be on point zero and trying to grow back my hair again. I just wonder how i didn't had hairloss when i was using it on winter and now it caused me hairloss? All this 2,5 years i was using it i never managed to grow my hair really thick and i didn't checked my ferritin regurarly, so i don't know if shampoo also was an issue. It could possible be.\n\nHere are the ingredients:\n\n|| || |Aqua (Water), Coco-Glucoside, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Panthenol, Niacinamide, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape\\*) Leaf Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive\\*) Fruit Oil, Malva Sylvestris (Mallow\\*) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract, Biotin, Tocopherol, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Starch, Magnesium PCA, Zinc PCA, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Manganese PCA, Glyceryl Oleate, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Parfum (Fragrance), Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Citric Acid, Lauryl Glucoside, Sodium PCA, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Sodium Lauryl Glucose Carboxylate, Butylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides Citrate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate| || ||",

Without a clear diagnosis/ diagnoses it is difficult to say which ingredients are likely culprits for these symptoms.\n\nI have highlighted some potentially problematic ingredients. In acne vulgaris some struggle with depositing silicones such as dimethicone and cyclomethicone. Caprylic/ capric triglycerides are AKA fractionated coconut oil, tocopherol is AKA vitamin E. PEG- prefix means water soluble, so clogging ingredients may be much less of a problem in a cleanser format compared with a leave on one.\n\nDrying alcohol and butylene/ propylene glycols are known irritants, skin barrier disruptors and penetration enhancers. Fragrance is an irritant and the second most common topical allergen after nickel.\n\nAny preservative - including the much maligned parabens - is an issue for someone somewhere. I *think* sorbic acid and/ or potassium sorbate cause flushing for some but that would need double checking.\n\nPhysical/ all mineral sunscreens are recommended over chemical sunscreens in reactive skin. I rate [Derma-e Antioxidant Natural Sunscreen SPF 30 body] (http://dermae.com/product/343/Antioxidant-Natural-Sunscreen-SPF-30-Body-Lotion.html) (identical to the face version which claims oil-free status). This has no silicones nor drying alcohol, does have 1% green tea extract, a little sodium ascorbyl phosphate (form of vitamin C useful in acne), caprylic/ capric triglycerides, a little of a fatty alcohol.\n\nCleansers ... totally different tack would be a micellar water, the gentlest ingredients wise is [Bioderma Sensibio H2O] (http://www.bioderma.com/en/our-products/sensibio/h2o) which has none of the regular preservatives, one glycol way down the ingredients list. Even if you don't love micellar cleansing waters it might help you with the elimination process, or they can be used as a second cleanse after an emulsifying oil.\n\nFoaming cleanser wise I rate Simple Kind to Skin Refreshing Wash Gel which has a short ingredients list, is pH appropriate and is ridiculously gentle (use it on my full body). It is based on cocoamidopropyl betaine which someone suggested is coconut-based in your other thread. There is no link between this surfactant and the potentially comedogenic oil, it has been completely transformed chemically.",

I tried the OCM with hada labo with zero success. Hada labo is just no go. I'm wondering if the \"-icone\" ingredients like Dimethicone are acting as an occlusive and breaking me out?",
