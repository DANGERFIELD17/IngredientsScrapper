    "body": "Naisipan kong dumaan sa Watsons ngayong araw para bumili ng lotion, dahil paubos na yung ginagamit ko. Nakita ko tong lotion na 'to ng Luxe Organix na naka B1T1 for Php 405, kaya naisipan kong subukan. 2 variant yung binili ko, itong Retinol + Gluta, tsaka yung Niacinamide + Arbutin. \n\nTLDR:\n\nMay microfoaming, malakas ang fragrance, heavier skin feel kumpara sa ibang serum lotions sa Market, mali-mali ang IL, mislabeled dahil imbes na retinol, Retinyl Palmitate ang laman base sa IL. \n\nUnahin muna nating tingnan ang packaging. Sa unang tingin, di nalalayo material sa packaging ng mga serum lotion ng Vaseline. Tho, yung sa Vaseline, rounded yung tabas ng seal ng tube sa both sides, samantalang itong sa LO ay pointed. \n\nSa itsura naman mismo ng laman, off-white na medyo madilaw yung kulay ng lotion. Medyo clumpy din yung itsura pagkalabas nito sa tube, at madali ding mag-break yung emulsion upon skin contact. Malakas yung fragrance nya na dominated ng floral notes. Unang naisip ko nga nung naamoy ko e amoy poon, dahil sa sobrang floral. \n\nMedyo matagal ipahid sa balat, kumpara sa ibang serum lotion na nasubukan ko na. Naka-observe din ako ng microfoaming during application nitong lotion. Ang microfoaming ito yung nagkakaroon ng puti-puting streaks sa balat habang pinapahid ang isang product, kadalasan mga emulsion gaya ng lotion at creams. Ang microfoaming ay dulot ng pagkaka-trap ng air sa product habang ipinapahid sa balat. Kung ikukumpara ko ito sa ibang serum lotion na nagamit ko na (Vaseline Gluta-Hya Serum Burst Lotion, Smoochkins Nia-Arbutin Nano White Serum Lotion), ito yung pinaka heavy ang skin feel. Hindi ko masyadong na-feel yung pagka serum lotion. And lastly naka-experience din ako ng pamumula at pantal sa braso ko after ko gamitin itong lotion na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list. \n\nWater (Aqua), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Myristate, Fragrance, C15-19 Alkane, Stearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Triethanolamine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Glutathione, Polysorbate 20, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ceramide NP, Mannitol, Pentylene Glycol, CI19140, Phosphatidylcholine, Retinyl Palmitate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Polyglyceryl-10,  Citric Acid, Tocopherol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nHindi na talaga nawala ang mga errors sa IL ng mga local products. Di yata talaga uso ipa-check man lang sa regulatory personnel ang IL na ilalagay sa final layout ng packaging bago ang ipa-mass printing. Para sa product na ito, hindi Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol ang tamang INCI name, kung hindi Cetearyl Alcohol. Next, Polyglyceryl-10, what? Incomplete yung ingredient name. Ang daming Polyglyceryl-10 esters na nag eexist, wag nyo na kami paghulain. (Side Note: Ang Polyglyceryl-10 esters ay kadalasang ginagamit as non-ionic emulsifier sa cosmetics.). \n\nPangalawa kong napansin, CI19140. Ang CI19140 ay isang dye na kilala din bilang Tartrazine Yellow or FD&C Yellow #5. Ito yung nagbigay ng medyo madilaw na kulay sa lotion na ito. Konektado ito sa kasunod kong punto. \n\nIkatlo, bakit Retinyl Palmitate ang nakalista dito sa IL? Kaya nyo ba nilagyan ng Yellow #5 ang lotion na ito para magmukhang may retinol, kasi nakakapagdulot ng paninilaw sa mga product ang retinol kapag ihinalo ito? Ngayon, ano ba ang problema kung retinyl palmitate ang nakalagay, imbes na retinol? Ito kasi yun: maliban sa obvious na mislabelling sa product na ito, mas mababa ang potency ng retinyl palmitate kaysa sa retinol. Sa buong retinoid family, ang mga retinyl esters kagaya ng retinyl palmitate ang may pinakamababang potency, dahil kailangan pa nito ng isang extra conversion step (retinyl palmitate -> retinol). Tandaan, ang mga retinoids, kailangang ma-convert into retinoic acid para ma-activate ang retinoic acid receptors natin sa balat at makuha ang benefits. \n\nRetinyl esters -> Retinol -> Retinaldehyde -> Retinoic Acid\n\nKada conversion step, bumababa ang potency ng isang retinoid, kaya sa kaso ng retinyl palmitate, na isang retinyl ester, eto ang may pinakamababang potency. \n\nMay peptides din pala itong lotion na ito: Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9 at Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11.\n\nAng acetyl tetrapeptide-9 ay isang signaling peptide na nagbibigay ng message sa fibroblasts sa ating dermis na magproduce ng collagen (specifically Collagen Type 1) at proteoglycans, na mahalaga para mapanatili ang structure at mapanatiling tight (hindi sagging) ang balat natin.  Nakakatulong din itong mabawasan ang appearance ng fine lines sa mukha, dahil na rin sa stimulation ng collagen at proteoglycan production. \n\nKung ang dermis ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, ang epidermis naman ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-11. Kagaya ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, signaling peptide din ito na nagbibigay ng mensahe sa epidermis na mag-synthesize o magproduce ng Syndecan-1 at Collagen XVII. Kapag mataas ang dalawang ito sa balat, nag-iimprove ang elasticity ng balat. \n\nKaramihan ng mga nabanggit na benepisyo ng dalawang peptides na ito ay base pa lamang sa mga in-vitro studies na naisagawa na. Wala pang gaanong in-vivo clinical studies na lumabas kaya medyo skeptical pa din ako sa mga peptides na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo lastly sa product claims. \n\n* Retinol + Gluta\n\n* Whitening Serum Lotion\n\n* Lightening\n\n* Firming\n\n* Hydrating\n\n* 24 hr Supple Smooth\n\n* 3X Peptide Youth Repair + Hyaluronic Bright + Ceramide Glow\n\nUnang claim pa lang, sablay na. Wala namang retinol tong lotion na 'to. Pinaglololoko ako nitong LO e. \n\nSa claim na lightening at whitening, medyo duda ako. Mukhang glutathione lang ang pwedeng masabi ng brand na ito na skin lightening ingredient. Pero duda ako sa efficacy ng glutathione na makapagpa lighten ng skin topically. Maraming limitations yung mga published studies tungkol sa efficacy ng topically applied gluta, gaya ng mababang bilang ng participants sa studies at sobrang iksi na study period. \n\nSa claim na firming, mukhang inilagay ito gawa nung mga peptides. Sa hydrating claim, meron namang hydrating ingredients (glycerin, hyaluronic acid derivatives, olive oil, Plukenetia Volubilis oil, tsaka Ceramide NP). Same din dun sa mga sumunod na claims, dahil sa presence ng mga nabanggit na ingredients. \n\n\nFinal words:\n\nHindi ako masaya sa nabili kong lotion na 'to. Hindi kasing lightweight at fast absorbing nung iba kong nasubukan na serum lotions. Amoy poon yung fragrance. May microfoaming during application. Nagkapantal ako sa braso. Mali-mali ang IL. Pero yung pinaka disappointing sa lotion na 'to e yung claim na may retinol daw, pero retinyl palmitate lang ang nasa ingredient list. May paglalagay pa ng yellow dye para magmukhang may retinol. Napakalaking red flag para sa akin ang pagmi-mislabel ng product.\n\nAyun lang. Salamat sa pagbabasa. At laging maging mapanuri sa mga binibili at balak nating gamitin na products. \n\n",

        "body": "*TL;DR for anyone scrolling past*\n\n* LO Retinol + Gluta uses retinyl palmitate and not retinol, which is a low potency variant of retinol that requires extra conversion steps to get the same effects as retinol. Yellow dye appears to have been added to the lotion to give the appearance of fully evolved retinol being an ingredient as retinol usually makes creams look yellow.\n* The peptides used claim to target fine lines and elasticity, but only proven by in-vitro studies (i.e. in controlled lab environments) vs. in-vivo (i.e. on living organisms)\n\nThank you for this in-depth review, skincare\\_chemist19!

    "body": "Hey-Oh! So, I see some form of this question multiple times per day in various skin and personal care subs: How do I deal with my hyperpigmentation? I also asked myself this question a few years ago. See, I'm prone to freckles and a little melasma and I set out to figure out a way to solve it with years of research, trial and error, testing, talking to dermatologists and professionals, and scouring every medical article I could get my hands on. I wanted to share my findings and research since this is a common concern, especially among people in their 30s. This started as a small post about my routine and ballooned into a massive book about hyperpigmentation. I hope it's helpful!\n\n**DISCLAIMERS:**\n\n* I use the term \"brightening\" instead of \"lightening\" which is a subtle distinction. None of the ingredients or methods I recommend bleach your skin as \"lightening\" would suggest, but they can reduce the appearance of hyperpigmentation. \"Brightening\" tends to be a confusing term in skincare, but for the purposes of this post, I use it as a descriptor for anything that helps prevent or reduce melanin in hyperpigmented skin.\n* I will use the term \"hyperpigmentation\" ad nauseam as a catch-all term for excess pigmentation in the skin including freckles, melasma, PIH and dark spots. This does not encompass moles which are different. This is also different from redness, which is a whole other post.\n* Speaking about hyperpigmentation requires some sensitivity to very real issues around it including cultural implications. This post is not intended to moralize hyperpigmentation nor is it intended to alienate the normal melaninization of skin across various tones. Hyperpigmentation refers to excess melanin production on the skin in the form of spots that are darker than the surrounding skin. It's not bad or wrong, nor does it speak to anyone not \"doing a good enough job\" of taking care of themselves.\n* I do repeat myself a few times in here but that is for people who are skipping around the article. I want to be as thorough as possible even if you're jumping to the parts of the post you need.\n* I do run an online dermatology practice and skin care consultancy, but in order to protect the integrity of my advice, I do not promote my business, I don't give direct medical advice, I don't link to any products/websites, and I don't have any products I've formulated myself to promote. \n\nThis is going to get long because I wanted to cover everything re:hyperpigmentation. But for your reading pleasure and ease, I have divided this post up so you can get whatever information you need:\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n1. Types of Hyperpigmentation\n2. What Causes Hyperpigmentation?\n3. How To Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 1: The Ingredients\n4. How to Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 2: The Routine and Recommendations\n5. Body Hyperpigmentation\n6. Nuclear Options\n\nLet's get to it!\n\n# Types of Hyperpigmentation\n\nHyperpigmentation refers to excess melanin production in the skin, but it can actually take a couple different forms. Knowing the type of hyperpigmentation you're experiencing is key to understanding if and how it can be treated.\n\n**Freckles:** Freckles are incredibly common, especially for people with lighter skin tones. They are small, brown or reddish-brown dots often clustered on the skin. They develop on the surface and are not raised bumps. Freckles can appear anywhere on the body but are common on the face. Freckles are permanent, but the color, contrast and severity can vary and be tempered.\n\n**Melasma:** Melasma appears as dark patches or splotches around the face, though usually found on the forehead, upper lip, and high on the cheeks. Melasma forms deeper in the skin and appears more amorphous than freckles, moles, or age spots. It can create a “muddy” appearance and is very common among pregnant and postpartum women due to hormonal factors. But it can literally happen to anyone and anywhere on the body.\n\n**Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation (PIH):** Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) occurs when damaged skin forms melanin during the healing process leaving dark spots. This is common after acne, injuries, eczema, burns, and other trauma to the skin. Exposure to UV rays during healing can make PIH worse. Post-inflammatory erythema (PIE) is similar, but leaves pink or red marks on the skin as a result of damage to the capillaries from injury or inflammation. Basically, when skin is compromised by injury, as part of the immune response cells will begin to generate melanin in an attempt to prevent further damage from UV exposure, so what will happen is the wound/legion/blemish will heal but the pigmented skin remains.\n\n**Age Spots:** This is kind of a forgotten form of hyperpigmentation. Sun spots, also referred to as liver spots, and solar lentigines are large spots/patches of dark skin with distinct borders. They vary in color from light brown to almost black. They develop on the surface of the skin usually later in life, but reflect damage that often occurred from improper sun protection at a younger age. They can appear on the face, neck, chest, hands, and arms, usually on areas that had UV exposure. For many people, they can begin to appear in your 30s or 40s.\n\n# What Causes Hyperpigmentation?\n\nThere are a number of factors that can contribute to the formation of hyperpigmentation. Generally, it forms as the result of a combination of genetic and environmental influences. Everyone is unique, but these are some of the most common causes of hyperpigmentation and dark spots:\n\n**Genetics** can play a role in the development of hyperpigmentation and dark spots in several ways:\n\n* **Melanin production:** Melanin is the pigment that provides color to our skin, hair, and eyes. The amount of melanin produced and distributed in the skin is largely determined by genetics. People with a greater genetic predisposition to melanin production in their skin are more likely to experience hyperpigmentation and dark spots as a result of sun exposure, hormonal changes, and other factors. People with darker skin are also more prone to melanin production in the form of hyperpigmentation.\n* **Genetic anomalies:** Certain genetic anomalies, such as oculocutaneous albinism, can affect melanin production and distribution in the skin, leading to an increased risk of hyperpigmentation and dark spots.\n* **Family history:** If you have a family history of hyperpigmentation or dark spots, you may be more likely to develop these conditions yourself.\n* **Enzymes and genes:** The enzymes that control melanin production and distribution are regulated by specific genes. Variations in these genes can impact melanin production, leading to an increased risk of hyperpigmentation and dark spots.\n\n**Sun (UV) Exposure.** In addition to genetic determination of melanin production, UV exposure is the leading environmental cause of hyperpigmentation and the formation of dark spots. Melanin is the pigment that provides color to our skin, hair, and eyes. It acts as a natural sunscreen (but don't treat it like natural sunscreen!!! This isn't the point of the exercise), absorbing UV radiation to protect the skin from damage.\n\nWhen the skin is exposed to UV radiation, the melanocytes (cells that produce melanin) in the skin go into overdrive, producing more melanin to protect the skin from further damage. This increased melanin production can result in dark spots or areas of hyperpigmentation on the skin.\n\n**Hormones.** In addition to genetic determination of melanin production, hormones and hormonal sensitivity is a leading internal cause of hyperpigmentation and the formation of dark spots.\n\nOne of the most well-known examples of hormonal hyperpigmentation is melasma, a condition characterized by dark, amorphous patches on the face, particularly on the cheeks, forehead, nose, and upper lip. Melasma is often associated with hormonal changes, such as those that occur during pregnancy, hormonal therapy, or birth control pill use. The hormonal changes can stimulate an increase in melanin production, resulting in dark spots or areas of hyperpigmentation. This can happen irrespective of UV exposure, though the sun does exacerbate it.\n\nHormones can also affect melanin production by altering the skin's metabolism and pigmentation pathways. For example, high levels of cortisol, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands during stress, can trigger an increase in melanin production, resulting in hyperpigmentation.\n\n**Inflammation, Injury & Trauma** to the skin can result in hyperpigmentation by triggering an increase in melanin production. When the skin is inflamed or injured, it triggers a response from the body's immune system, which can stimulate an increase in melanin production as a protective measure.\n\nFor example, acne breakouts or other skin injuries can result in post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), which is characterized by dark spots or areas of discoloration on the skin. The dark spots are a result of an increase in melanin production in the affected area, which occurs in response to the inflammation or injury. In addition to acne and other skin injuries, other conditions that can result in PIH include eczema, psoriasis, and insect bites.\n\n**Medication Side Effects.** Certain medications can cause hyperpigmentation on the skin. Medications that can cause hyperpigmentation include:\n\n* **Tetracycline antibiotics:** Tetracycline antibiotics, such as doxycycline and minocycline, can cause discoloration of the skin and teeth when taken in high doses or for an extended period of time.\n* **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs):** NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, can cause hyperpigmentation in some individuals, especially if taken in high doses or for an extended period of time.\n* **Chemotherapy drugs:** Certain chemotherapy drugs, such as doxorubicin and daunorubicin, can cause hyperpigmentation, especially in areas of the skin that have been exposed to the sun.\n* **Hormonal medications:** Hormonal medications, such as birth control pills and estrogen replacements, can cause hyperpigmentation in some individuals, especially if they are taken for an extended period of time.\n* **Antimalarial drugs:** Antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, can cause hyperpigmentation in some individuals, especially if taken in high doses or for an extended period of time.\n* **Isotretinoin** aka accutane when taken for acne can cause hyperpigmentation due to the increase of cell turnover and exposing delicate new skin cells to UV rays before they have shored up.\n\nIf using these medications is necessary for your livelihood, it is not recommended to stop their use without the recommendation of your doctor.\n\n# How To Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 1: The Ingredients\n\nWhen looking for skin care products to treat and prevent hyperpigmentation and dark spots, it's important to look for ingredients that can help encourage cell turnover, curb melanin production, and block harmful UV rays. A lot of these things overlap with treatments for other conditions like acne and general anti-aging, but I've noted ones that specifically work on the mechanisms controlling melanin production. Now, this is an extensive list, but I know it doesn't have everything. I've included the ingredients that had the most compelling evidence and/or worked the best for me or people at my practice. But it's also not necessarily a shopping list. You don't have to have all of these things to treat hyperpigmentation, but I'll get to that in the routine portion. This is more to be used as a tool that can help you diversify your routine if you find one ingredient or another doesn't work for you. And it can help you determine if a product targets hyperpigmentation based on its ingredients. There's lot's of options. Some of the key ingredients to look for include:\n\n**Retinoids** that increases cell turnover. Retinoids like tretinoin, adapalene, retinol et al, can help treat hyperpigmentation by promoting the turnover of skin cells and increasing cell growth, which can help fade dark spots and improve overall skin tone by replacing pigmented skin cells at the surface. While retinoids are extremely effective, they do have some caveats. First, they can be sensitizing to a lot of users, but this can be tempered by using different form functions, different application methods, or different concentrations. Second, because it's constantly turning over skin exposing delicate new skin cells to the elements, it can actually worsen hyperpigmentation if you're not vigilant about sun protection and avoidance. Tretinoin and other retinoids are firewalled behind a prescription in some countries and may be more difficult to obtain. But retinol/al is available in OTC forms.\n\n**SPF** represents a class of many ingredients designed to protect the skin from UV rays and the damage that occurs from exposure. UV exposure is one of the biggest causes of fine hyperpigmentation and wrinkles so adequate protection is essential. I know I'm not winning any science awards for this declaration, but a lot of people who struggle with hyperpigmentation aren't adequately protecting themselves from the sun. But you also have to be kind of realistic. Even with perfect protection and avoidance, sometimes your hyperpigmentation will still flare. This happens during the summer for a lot of people and something even I grapple with. The key is to do your best and SPF actually works well with numerous other ingredients (like the ones listed below) to help solve that problem.\n\n**Arbutin** is a Tyrosinase Inhibitor that blocks melanin production. Arbutin, or the synthesized version called alpha arbutin, is a favorite brightening ingredient because it's a slow-release derivative of hydroquinone that inhibits melanin production. This results in both healing and prevention of dark spots, especially when paired with topical acids. It metabolizes on the skin into hydroquinone which is super effective for hyperpigmentation while being a less controversial and hard-to-come-by ingredient than pure hydroquinone. More on hydroquinone in part 6.\n\n**Tranexamic acid** is another Tyrosinase Inhibitor. This was first used in wound care and it was found to have profound effects on hyperpigmentation. Although it's an acid, it's not a chemical exfoliant, kinda like how hyaluronic acid is not a chemical exfoliant. The exact mechanism by which tranexamic acid works to reduce hyperpigmentation is not fully understood, but it is believed to work by reducing inflammation by blocking plasmin which contributes to melanin production when unchecked. It is particularly effective in treating melasma and one of my personal favorite ingredients.\n\n**Kojic Acid** is *another* Tyrosinase Inhibitor. Kojic acid is a natural skin brightener that is derived from various fungi. Kojic acid can also help to exfoliate because it's a slight chemical exfoliant, which can remove dead skin cells that contribute to hyperpigmentation and improve overall appearance. But it does both things: block melanin production and turn skin cells over.\n\n**Azelaic Acid** has a lot of things going for it that can help with hyperpigmentation. It's an anti-inflammatory and antiseptic that disrupts melanin production. Azelaic acid works by inhibiting the production of melanin in the skin like those other tyrosinase inhibitors. In addition, azelaic acid also has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, which help to improve the overall health and appearance of the skin by reducing melanin production as a result of injury or inflammation. It's also an anti-acne ingredient that can address the root cause of PIH by reducing acne on the skin. It's pretty awesome and available in OTC and prescription strengths.\n\n**Niacinamide** is another one that directly and indirectly addresses hyperpigmentation. It's a skin soother that decreases inflammation and it naturally reduces sebum production which can curb acne which can curb PIH. It actually took me a little while to figure out that this was another solid hyperpigmentation treatment for these reasons because I used to look at it as being more of an acne treatment. Niacinamide is a form of vitamin B3 that works by inhibiting the transfer of pigment within the skin, which can help to reduce the appearance of dark spots and uneven skin tone. So while it doesn't block tyrosinase, it prevents transfer of pigmented skin cells to the surface.\n\n**Vitamin C aka L-ascorbic acid** is an antioxidant that fights free radical damage. It treats and prevents hyperpigmentation in three ways. First, it reduces free radical damage from UV exposure which helps increase the effectiveness of SPF when worn together. Second, it is also a tyrosinase inhibitor that blocks melanin production. And finally, vitamin C encourages skin cell turnover. The key is finding a nice stable version of it.\n\n**Glycolic and Lactic Acid.** Since this list is getting long I am going to group these together. Glycolic Acid is a water-soluble alpha hydroxy acid that penetrates into the pores to treat pigmentation by providing general exfoliation and resurfacing of the skin. The result is improvements in dark spots, texture and other signs of aging. Lactic Acid is also an AHA but with a slightly larger molecular size than glycolic acid so it doesn't penetrate as deep and acts more as a surface exfoliant. As a result it provides more gentle exfoliation to buff away surface pigmentation with an added benefit of acting as a humectant to seal moisture into the skin.\n\n**Licorice Extract** is a plant extract that inhibits melanin production. Licorice root extract contains a compound called glabridin, which has been shown to have skin brightening effects as, you guessed it, a tyrosinase inhibitor. In addition, licorice root extract also has anti-inflammatory properties, which can help to reduce redness and inflammation associated with hyperpigmentation. I'm seeing more and more of this pop up in skin care.\n\n**Soy Proteins** are another plant extract that inhibits melanin production. They contain compounds known as isoflavones, which have been shown to help reduce the amount of melanin produced by melanocytes in the skin. Additionally, soy proteins have antioxidant properties that can help to protect the skin from damage caused by free radicals, which can contribute to hyperpigmentation.\n\n# How To Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 2: The Routine and Recommendations\n\nThis is adapted from numerous comments, posts and DMs I've written on the topic and also comprises a large portion of my own personal routine and routines we recommend to patients. This is a generalist routine meaning it targets all the forms of hyperpigmentation I've mentioned; freckles, melasma, PIH, and age spots though it can be tweaked to address these individually more specifically. This is really my jumping off point for people to get a good idea of what they can achieve as a baseline with OTC ingredients before fine tuning or enlisting the help of a dermatologist. For a lot of people, this is enough to fully resolve, but even if it gets you part of the way there, this should give you a good idea of reactivity.\n\nA few caveats:\n\n* Freckles cannot ever be 100% eradicated. You can however reduce their appearance and prevent them from getting darker. It's important to have realistic goals and understand that sometimes our genetics will overrule any routine we have.\n* This routine and any hyperpigmentation routine will not address moles. Moles are a totally different thing that can only be eradicated through removal by a medical practitioner. Moles can be raised or not, but no amount of topicals will get rid of them.\n* Melasma is a beast. Sometimes it can be treated with OTC topicals, sometimes it requires prescription strength topicals like hydroquinone, sometimes you need in-office procedures like fractal lasers or IPL. Again, this routine is a jumping off point to see what you can accomplish at home before going down that road (and more on that at the bottom in part 6).\n* You'll notice I don't mention products with all the ingredients I listed above. This is because the more you put on your face, the greater your risk of causing irritation. Again, you can adjust and tweak by switching out products with these ingredients or add/subtract as it suits your personal needs.\n* If you're struggling with hyperpigmentation while pregnant or breastfeeding, these recommendations may need to be paused.\n\nAlright, let's get to it!\n\n**AM routine -- The Goal: Heal, Protect, and Prevent. In order of application following a lukewarm water rinse:**\n\n* Azelaic acid\n* Alpha Arbutin\n* Vitamin C serum\n* Moisturizer\n* SPF\n\nThe combo of C+AZ+AA+SPF is an absolute powerhouse for healing existing hyperpigmentation and preventing new hyperpigmentation from forming. It makes your SPF more effective, it inhibits the production of melanin from UV exposure (not your natural melanin production though), and it speeds cell turnover with dual antioxidant action and gentle chemical exfoliation. The result is brighter skin in a few months of consistent use.\n\n**For Azelaic Acid**, this is the ingredient for serious treatment. It's considered one of the most effective ways to reverse melasma aka serious hyperpigmentation short of hydroquinone -- which is both controversial and hard to get. It brings a little bit of exfoliation to the table in addition to inhibiting UV melanin production, but it also has a slight antiseptic property which can help with acne. Paula's choice Azelaic Acid Booster is the only one I've really tried after sampling the Ordinary's in-store and not liking the texture. I get about 6 months out of a tube and a little bit goes a long way.\n\n**For Alpha Arbutin**, the Ordinary's formulation is pretty solid. I prefer the Ordinary's AA 2% + HA as opposed to their AA 2% + Ascorbic Acid 8% as I don't believe the quality and stability of their Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) is great. That's why I opt for a separate Vitamin C serum step. But the AA + HA also has a little bit of lactic acid in it which provides some gentle exfoliation and encourages AA deeper into the skin where it's more effective. Lactic acid is mild enough that it's safe for use in a morning routine, but you still want to protect with SPF. There are a couple AA products floating around but I think TO's product is probably the best, most straightforward one. Alpha Arbutin metabolizes into hydroquinone on the skin so is basically one of the best OTC pigment correctors you can get.\n\n**For Vitamin C,** the gold standard really is Skinceuticals CE Ferulic. This is stupid expensive though so I’m going to suggest Timeless Vitamin C. I like that it comes in an airless pump that prevents oxidation over time. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that increases the rate of skin cell turnover bringing forward new, skin cells while simultaneously improving the effects of SPF. It's a great foundation for a fix.\n\nThese ingredients can be layered on one right after the other then topped with your **moisturizer** (I like a basic one like cetaphil daily lotion), then topped with your **SPF**. The SPF I would recommend is Canmake UV mermaid gel in clear as this will not leave a white cast on your skin and it’s generally a very elegant SPF. It's SPF 50 which means it gives really good protection, but there are numerous SPFs you can try. I personally like anything from La Roche Posay, any Neutrogena SPF that's not formulated with ethylhexylglycerin, Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen, Biore Aqua Rich (another Japanese brand), Trader Joe's SPF if you can get your hands on it, and EltaMD.\n\nOf all the products I’ve tried that could act as a stand-in for vitamin c, azelaic acid, and alpha arbutin, there’s one Japanese serum from Hada Labo called “whitening lotion” which has had the biggest impact on my hyperpigmentation in a single product of anything I’ve tried. This might be a little too effective though, I actually find that it washed me out within the first 2 weeks of twice daily use, so now I only use it in the morning. And I’m not a fan of the translation… which is a direct but mistranslation. It’s not a bleaching lotion, it also relies on a form of vitamin C and tranexamic acid to brighten skin. But it's a really interesting to try if you wanted a simplified morning routine in which case I would apply this, then your moisturizer, then your SPF.\n\n**PM routine -- The Goal: Renew and Reveal. In order of application:**\n\n* Cleanse\n* Buffer\n* Tranexamic acid and exfoliant OR retinoid\\*\\*\n* Moisturize\n\n**To cleanse**, I have a really basic recommendation that will remove your SPF, makeup, and any grime/sebum from your day. Start with Cetaphil gentle cleanser. This is a gentle, hydrating cleanser that will break up your SPF really effectively. Massage in and rinse. Then apply a foaming cleanser, I recommend Cetaphil daily cleanser which foams. This will sweep away anything that’s left and give you a good foundation for the rest of your routine. While this doesn't directly help hyperpigmentation specifically, it's a critical step especially for people who are acne>PIH prone. It also gives you a nice clean slate to apply the rest of your skincare. I've tried dozens of cleansers but always come back to these two as good basic options.\n\n**For your Buffer** this is an important step that can be done prior to using a chemical exfoliant or retinoid: applying an occlusive that will block the active from more sensitive skin. I recommend buffering around your eyes and nostrils with La Roche Posay Cicaplast balm because it kind of doubles as a nice eye cream, but this can also be done with basic vaseline or aquaphor for a more budget-friendly option.\n\n**For Tranexamic Acid**, my holy grail TXA product, La Roche Posay Glycolic B5 is actually a multipurpose serum that combines ingredients to treat hyperpigmentation with chemical exfoliants. It contains two hyperpigmentation heavy hitters -- Tranexamic acid and Kojic Acid which are great for melasma -- and two exfoliants -- Glycolic Acid and Lipo-Hydroxy Acid (LHA) which is like fancy salicylic acid -- so it both reveals new skin cells that are less prone to pigmenting from UV exposure while sloughing away your old skin cells. You can use this 2 or 3 nights per week. On off nights, just cleanse and moisturize.\n\n**For a Retinoid** if you can get prescription tretinoin, this is going to be the best bet. Your doctor will advise you on the concentration. More on that in part 6. It will help speed up the rate of cell turnover bringing new, unpigmented skin cells to the surface faster. Some other OTC options include differin (which is rated more for acne but uses the same mechanism for cell turnover so it's also effective in this use case) and retinols. Now, I haven't tried every retinol on the market but I have two that I stand by: SkinCeuticals retinol and L'Oreal retinol serum. The SkinCeuticals is, in my opinion, the closest to RX tretinoin in terms of efficacy, but it's a little pricey. The L'Oreal also does a really good job and is a little more affordable. It's currently my go-to OTC on the days I'm not using my RX retinoid tazarotene. You can use this 2 or 3 nights per week. On off nights, just cleanse and moisturize.\n\n**\\*\\* My recommendations for tranexamic acid and retinoids CANNOT be used in the same night.** You'll nuke your skin. And for most people, both aren't necessary, you can get away with using one or the other. If I had a preference, I would say use the TXA serum instead of a retinoid, but if you can build up a tolerance to using them both without damaging your barrier, they work really well together. So, proceed with caution. If you want to use both, use them on alternate nights and give yourself a night or two without either to let your skin recover. For me personally, I do retinoids on Sundays, and Wednesdays, chemical exfoliants on Mondays and Thursdays, and I let my skin rest (cleanse, moisturize, squalene oil) on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.\n\nOn top of whichever active you choose, apply your moisturizer. You can use the same one you use in your morning routine, the Cetaphil daily lotion as it’s nice and light. I also like La Roche Posay Toleraine double repair for a ceramide-based cream alternative if you want something richer. You do not want to \"slug\" over actives. This advice gets mixed in a lot. Slugging refers to applying an occlusive layer over your skincare such as vaseline, aquaphor, oils like squalene oil, or healing balms like La Roche Posay Cicaplast balm. While this can be done on hydration nights, it should not be done on nights when you're using chemical exfoliants or retinoids as this may make them too effective causing irritation and breakouts.\n\n# Body Hyperpigmentation\n\nOk, I need everyone to be a grownup for two seconds. These products and methods (both from the prior section and this section) should NOT be used on your genitals. First, you can cause serious irritation or infection by applying active skincare to your genitals. Second, it's really not going to do anything to change the pigmentation of the skin there. The skin on your genitals is different than your body and facial skin and it pigments in different ways for different reasons so it's not going to respond to topicals the same way the rest of your body does. Don't even try it.\n\n**To be perfectly clear, these are the areas you should not be applying skincare:** labia majora, labia minora, vaginal entrance or vagina, clitoral hood, perineum, anus, intergluteal cleft aka inside your butt crack, penis, or scrotum. And I say this as someone who chaffed the precipice of her \"intergluteal cleft\" in an unfortunate crunches-in-the-wrong-gym-shorts accident leaving me with some deeply incriminating hyperpigmentation and earning me the nickname \"skid mark\" from my ever loving boyfriend. It faded after a year but you can still send prayers.\n\n**These are areas you can apply skincare but do so with absolute caution and at your own risk:** bikini line, mons pubis, inner thigh up to the groin fold, butt cheeks.\n\nOk, now that we've got the disclaimers out of the way, let's move forward. Hyperpigmentation can also occur on body skin for the same reason it appears on the face, but it can also be triggered by friction. And because body skin is different from facial skin, it requires a slightly different approach. This is my recommendation for both hyperpigmentation and KP (Keratosis pilaris) because they rely on the same mechanism for treatment: chemical exfoliation.\n\nIn the case of body hyperpigmentation, I recommend a two prong approach: a body wash in the shower and a topical treatment to be used after. Oh, and SPF again if there are areas that are exposed to the sun, and I have a holy grail SPF recommendation for this.\n\nNow you may have noticed in my facial skin recommendation that I did not mention CeraVe as a treatment brand. I have posted numerous takedowns of CeraVe on other threads so I won't rehash them here suffice it to say that it's no longer a brand I can in good faith recommend since it's acquisition by L'Oreal. This is often the brand that's considered when treating KP on the body, but I don't believe their formulations and ingredient quality works for everyone.\n\n**For the body wash**, I recommend Neutrogena body clear with Salicylic acid. This is an exfoliating body wash that will help clear away dead skin cells on the surface allowing new ones to come through. To be effective, you want it to sit on your skin for a little while. I recommend lathering it up and applying it after turning off your shower faucet and letting it sit for 2 or 3 minutes. This is when I like to knock out shower emails. Then rinse away.\n\n**On towel dried skin after your shower**, apply AmLactin Bumps Be Gone. Again, this is formulated for KP but the reason I like it is because it contains lactic acid which will also give the assist on brightening hyperpigmented body skin. The wash and this should be effective, but you might also want to mix in a few drops of the alpha arbutin serum I recommended for your facial routine, maybe three drops per application area (each leg, each arm, chest, etc). I generally don't encourage facial products on the body because it's not an economical use for them, and also because body skin is a little more resilient and doesn't need skincare that's formulated for more sensitive facial skin. The AA serum from the Ordinary is very affordable however and is a good hyperpigmentation generalist.\n\nAnother one that I mentioned in the facial hyperpigmentation portion that can work well on the body is the Hada Labo whitening lotion. Again, this is formulated around tranexamic acid which is very effective for hyperpigmentation and a little bit if this stuff goes a long way. I buy it in bulk from Japanese Importers though it's also available on Amazon for a slightly higher price. If you find yourself in Asia, stock up on it. I use this specifically for fading tan lines that happen (even with diligent/neurotic SPF use) around my fitness watch and the straps of my workout tops that I run in.\n\n**You also want to wear SPF on areas that are exposed to the sun** to prevent pigmentation from occurring. The one I absolutely love that’s not your 90’s banana boat is Aveeno Protect + Hydrate lotion with SPF 60. This is a great SPF for a lot of reasons: it finishes like a lotion instead of a sunscreen, it dries down totally clear, and it has a pleasant, slight sweet scent. On a scale of 1-10 with 1 being bare skin, 10 being banana boat slathered on by your mom in 1997, and regular body lotion being a 2, I give Aveeno Protect + Hydrate a 2.5 in terms of texture and feel-finish. I use it as my daily lotion on my neck, arms, shoulders, and chest. If you're more active you might need a heavier hitter here like a sport sunscreen.\n\n# Nuclear Options\n\nIn general, I recommend trying OTC topical solutions for any skin concern before heading down the in-office procedure route. Part of this is because you can usually put a good dent in what you're struggling with by using OTC topicals, making in-office procedures and RX treatments easier and more effective. Part of it is so you have a good maintenance routine in place to use after the fact to preserve the results of your in-office procedure which can sometimes be costly. Lastly, while some procedures can solve the immediate problem completely, topical skincare can be really effective at treating other adjacent conditions like redness, acne, and fine lines.\n\nSide note: I haven't listed every possible compounded medication because there are a lot, and many compounded meds are formulated to tackle multiple issues like acne and hyperpigmentation. I also tend to favor single note skin care (aka, products with very few ingredients) as this allows you to combine or remove certain actives and gives you a better sense of reactivity. \n\nFor tougher-to-treat hyperpigmentation such as melasma, if your topical routine doesn't totally clear the problem in 6 to 8 months, a visit to the dermatologist might be helpful. Here are the heavier-hitting procedures and topicals that can go the extra mile after you've exhausted other options.\n\n**Medical Grade Peels:** Medical grade chemical peels can be done by dermatologists. Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or phenol peels may be done for cases of severe hyperpigmentation, but high concentration BHA or AHA peels are also commonly used. I do these twice a year. Because of the strength of the acids used, these must be done by a medical professional with careful followup.\n\n\\*\\*\\*IPL Therapy and Laser Therapy may not work for everyone and in some cases may exacerbate hyperpigmentation so you really want to work with dermatologists with a lot of experience in treating cases similar to yours to determine if these interventions are appropriate for you.\n\n**IPL Treatment:** Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) therapy can treat hyperpigmentation by targeting the melanin in the skin with a broad spectrum of light wavelengths, heating and breaking the melanin down. IPL is particularly effective for treating sun damage and age spots, as well as other forms of hyperpigmentation. The treatment is relatively non-invasive, with minimal downtime, making it a popular option. This is also a great treatment for the redness associated with enlarged blood vessels (often confused for broken capillaries) on the surface of the skin which can also appear alongside hyperpigmentation. There isn't any clinical evidence to support at-home IPL devices being effective in the same way. That doesn't mean it's not possible, it's just not studied enough to be certain. Most at-home IPL devices do not operate in effective wavelengths the way professional grade ones do.\n\n**Laser Therapy:** Fractional and CO2 lasers can be used to treat a range of hyperpigmentation issues, including sun damage, age spots, and melasma. The treatment works by removing the top layers of skin, which contain the excess pigmentation, revealing fresh, healthy skin cells underneath. The lasers also stimulate the production of collagen, which helps to improve skin texture and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.\n\n**Hydroquinone:** This isn't an in-office procedure like the aforementioned treatments, but it is firewalled behind a prescription meaning you can only access hydroquinone in effective concentrations by working with a doctor. This is a somewhat new development at least in the US following some covid-era rejiggering of prescription clearances. HDQ is controversial because it's a skin bleaching agent which has some cultural implications in places where light skin is favored over natural pigmentation. HDQ technically works the same way other OTC tyrosinase inhibitors do (in fact arbutin actually metabolizes into HDQ when applied to the skin), pure HDQ happens to be the most powerful version of them. It lightens any skin it touches, not just hyperpigmented skin in higher concentrations which can make it tough to use. This effect isn't as profound in the other tyrosinase inhibitors I mentioned making them much easier to use over HDQ which, in high concentrations, must be dotted on the skin in only hyperpigmented areas. So HDQ is really reserved for intervention in extreme or OTC treatment-resistance cases.\n\n**Tretinoin and Prescription Retinoids:** This is going to be dependent on what part of the world you're in, but in a lot of countries, tretinoin and its counterparts like tazarotene are only available through prescription. I mentioned retinoids in the routine so if you're able to get your hands on a prescription from a doctor, it may be more effective than OTC retinols. Most doctors will prescribe a retinoid over hydroquinone, so this is usually easier to procure and can be quite effective on its own as a hyperpigmentation treatment. OTC differin is the only retinoid available over-the-counter (in the US) which can also be used for hyperpigmentation.\n\n**Prescription Azelaic Acid:** This is another one that's available in lower concentrations over-the-counter (which can still be quite effective) but there are prescription strength grades of azelaic acid. This is usually reserved for rosacea treatment as it tends to target redness and flushing, or as an acne treatment because of its antiseptic properties, but it can also be an effective hyperpigmentation treatment for its tyrosinase-inhibiting ability.\n\n**If you made it this far, congratulations! I hope this information is helpful. While it is extensive and based on massive amount of research, experience, experimentation and work with professionals, it may not be perfect and it may not be suitable for everyone. Feel free to offer any constructive criticism or ask any questions in comments. I am always open to expanding my understanding.**",

    "body": "Hey-Oh! So, I see some form of this question multiple times per day in various skin and personal care subs: How do I deal with my hyperpigmentation? I also asked myself this question a few years ago. See, I'm prone to freckles and a little melasma and I set out to figure out a way to solve it with years of research, trial and error, testing, talking to dermatologists and professionals, and scouring every medical article I could get my hands on. I wanted to share my findings and research since this is a common concern, especially among people in their 30s. This started as a small post about my routine and ballooned into a massive book about hyperpigmentation. I hope it's helpful! \n\n**DISCLAIMERS:**\n\n* I use the term \"brightening\" instead of \"lightening\" which is a subtle distinction. None of the ingredients or methods I recommend bleach your skin as \"lightening\" would suggest, but they can reduce the appearance of hyperpigmentation. \"Brightening\" tends to be a confusing term in skincare, but for the purposes of this post, I use it as a descriptor for anything that helps prevent or reduce melanin in hyperpigmented skin.\n* I will use the term \"hyperpigmentation\" ad nauseam as a catch-all term for excess pigmentation in the skin including freckles, melasma, PIH and dark spots. This does not encompass moles which are different. This is also different from redness, which is a whole other post.\n* Speaking about hyperpigmentation requires some sensitivity to very real issues around it including cultural implications. This post is not intended to moralize hyperpigmentation nor is it intended to alienate the normal melaninization of skin across various tones. Hyperpigmentation refers to excess melanin production on the skin in the form of spots that are darker than the surrounding skin. It's not bad or wrong, nor does it speak to anyone not \"doing a good enough job\" of taking care of themselves.\n* I do repeat myself a few times in here but that is for people who are skipping around the article. I want to be as thorough as possible even if you're jumping to the parts of the post you need.\n* I do run an online dermatology practice and skin care consultancy, but in order to protect the integrity of my advice, I do not promote my business, I don't give direct medical advice, I don't link to any products/websites, and I don't have any products I've formulated myself to promote. This is going to get long because I wanted to cover everything re:hyperpigmentation. But for your reading pleasure and ease, I have divided this post up so you can get whatever information you need: \n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n1. Types of Hyperpigmentation\n2. What Causes Hyperpigmentation?\n3. How To Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 1: The Ingredients\n4. How to Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 2: The Routine and Recommendations\n5. Body Hyperpigmentation\n6. Nuclear Options \n\nLet's get to it! \n\n**Types of Hyperpigmentation** \n\nHyperpigmentation refers to excess melanin production in the skin, but it can actually take a couple different forms. Knowing the type of hyperpigmentation you're experiencing is key to understanding if and how it can be treated. \n\n**Freckles**: Freckles are incredibly common, especially for people with lighter skin tones. They are small, brown or reddish-brown dots often clustered on the skin. They develop on the surface and are not raised bumps. Freckles can appear anywhere on the body but are common on the face. Freckles are permanent, but the color, contrast and severity can vary and be tempered. \n\n**Melasma**: Melasma appears as dark patches or splotches around the face, though usually found on the forehead, upper lip, and high on the cheeks. Melasma forms deeper in the skin and appears more amorphous than freckles, moles, or age spots. It can create a “muddy” appearance and is very common among pregnant and postpartum women due to hormonal factors. But it can literally happen to anyone and anywhere on the body. \n\n**Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation (PIH)**: Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) occurs when damaged skin forms melanin during the healing process leaving dark spots. This is common after acne, injuries, eczema, burns, and other trauma to the skin. Exposure to UV rays during healing can make PIH worse. Post-inflammatory erythema (PIE) is similar, but leaves pink or red marks on the skin as a result of damage to the capillaries from injury or inflammation. Basically, when skin is compromised by injury, as part of the immune response cells will begin to generate melanin in an attempt to prevent further damage from UV exposure, so what will happen is the wound/legion/blemish will heal but the pigmented skin remains. \n\n**Age Spots**: This is kind of a forgotten form of hyperpigmentation. Sun spots, also referred to as liver spots, and solar lentigines are large spots/patches of dark skin with distinct borders. They vary in color from light brown to almost black. They develop on the surface of the skin usually later in life, but reflect damage that often occurred from improper sun protection at a younger age. They can appear on the face, neck, chest, hands, and arms, usually on areas that had UV exposure. For many people, they can begin to appear in your 30s or 40s. \n\n# What Causes Hyperpigmentation? \n\nThere are a number of factors that can contribute to the formation of hyperpigmentation. Generally, it forms as the result of a combination of genetic and environmental influences. Everyone is unique, but these are some of the most common causes of hyperpigmentation and dark spots: \n\n**Genetics** can play a role in the development of hyperpigmentation and dark spots in several ways:\n\n* **Melanin production:** Melanin is the pigment that provides color to our skin, hair, and eyes. The amount of melanin produced and distributed in the skin is largely determined by genetics. People with a greater genetic predisposition to melanin production in their skin are more likely to experience hyperpigmentation and dark spots as a result of sun exposure, hormonal changes, and other factors. People with darker skin are also more prone to melanin production in the form of hyperpigmentation.\n* **Genetic anomalies**: Certain genetic anomalies, such as oculocutaneous albinism, can affect melanin production and distribution in the skin, leading to an increased risk of hyperpigmentation and dark spots.\n* **Family history:** If you have a family history of hyperpigmentation or dark spots, you may be more likely to develop these conditions yourself.\n* **Enzymes and genes**: The enzymes that control melanin production and distribution are regulated by specific genes. Variations in these genes can impact melanin production, leading to an increased risk of hyperpigmentation and dark spots. \n\n**Sun (UV) Exposure.** In addition to genetic determination of melanin production, UV exposure is the leading environmental cause of hyperpigmentation and the formation of dark spots. Melanin is the pigment that provides color to our skin, hair, and eyes. It acts as a natural sunscreen (but don't treat it like natural sunscreen!!! This isn't the point of the exercise), absorbing UV radiation to protect the skin from damage. \n\nWhen the skin is exposed to UV radiation, the melanocytes (cells that produce melanin) in the skin go into overdrive, producing more melanin to protect the skin from further damage. This increased melanin production can result in dark spots or areas of hyperpigmentation on the skin. \n\n**Hormones**. In addition to genetic determination of melanin production, hormones and hormonal sensitivity is a leading internal cause of hyperpigmentation and the formation of dark spots. One of the most well-known examples of hormonal hyperpigmentation is melasma, a condition characterized by dark, amorphous patches on the face, particularly on the cheeks, forehead, nose, and upper lip. Melasma is often associated with hormonal changes, such as those that occur during pregnancy, hormonal therapy, or birth control pill use. The hormonal changes can stimulate an increase in melanin production, resulting in dark spots or areas of hyperpigmentation. This can happen irrespective of UV exposure, though the sun does exacerbate it. \n\nHormones can also affect melanin production by altering the skin's metabolism and pigmentation pathways. For example, high levels of cortisol, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands during stress, can trigger an increase in melanin production, resulting in hyperpigmentation. \n\n**Inflammation, Injury & Trauma** to the skin can result in hyperpigmentation by triggering an increase in melanin production. When the skin is inflamed or injured, it triggers a response from the body's immune system, which can stimulate an increase in melanin production as a protective measure. For example, acne breakouts or other skin injuries can result in post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), which is characterized by dark spots or areas of discoloration on the skin. The dark spots are a result of an increase in melanin production in the affected area, which occurs in response to the inflammation or injury. In addition to acne and other skin injuries, other conditions that can result in PIH include eczema, psoriasis, and insect bites. \n\n**Medication Side Effects.** Certain medications can cause hyperpigmentation on the skin. Medications that can cause hyperpigmentation include:\n\n* **Tetracycline antibiotics:** Tetracycline antibiotics, such as doxycycline and minocycline, can cause discoloration of the skin and teeth when taken in high doses or for an extended period of time.\n* **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs):** NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, can cause hyperpigmentation in some individuals, especially if taken in high doses or for an extended period of time.\n* **Chemotherapy drugs:** Certain chemotherapy drugs, such as doxorubicin and daunorubicin, can cause hyperpigmentation, especially in areas of the skin that have been exposed to the sun.\n* **Hormonal medications:** Hormonal medications, such as birth control pills and estrogen replacements, can cause hyperpigmentation in some individuals, especially if they are taken for an extended period of time.\n* **Antimalarial drugs:** Antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, can cause hyperpigmentation in some individuals, especially if taken in high doses or for an extended period of time.\n* **Isotretinoin** aka accutane when taken for acne can cause hyperpigmentation due to the increase of cell turnover and exposing delicate new skin cells to UV rays before they have shored up. \n\nIf using these medications is necessary for your livelihood, it is not recommended to stop their use without the recommendation of your doctor. \n\n# How To Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 1: The Ingredients \n\nWhen looking for skin care products to treat and prevent hyperpigmentation and dark spots, it's important to look for ingredients that can help encourage cell turnover, curb melanin production, and block harmful UV rays. A lot of these things overlap with treatments for other conditions like acne and general anti-aging, but I've noted ones that specifically work on the mechanisms controlling melanin production. Now, this is an extensive list, but I know it doesn't have everything. I've included the ingredients that had the most compelling evidence and/or worked the best for me or people at my practice. But it's also not necessarily a shopping list. You don't have to have all of these things to treat hyperpigmentation, but I'll get to that in the routine portion. This is more to be used as a tool that can help you diversify your routine if you find one ingredient or another doesn't work for you. And it can help you determine if a product targets hyperpigmentation based on its ingredients. There's lot's of options. Some of the key ingredients to look for include: \n\n**Retinoids** that increases cell turnover. Retinoids like tretinoin, adapalene, retinol et al, can help treat hyperpigmentation by promoting the turnover of skin cells and increasing cell growth, which can help fade dark spots and improve overall skin tone by replacing pigmented skin cells at the surface. While retinoids are extremely effective, they do have some caveats. First, they can be sensitizing to a lot of users, but this can be tempered by using different form functions, different application methods, or different concentrations. Second, because it's constantly turning over skin exposing delicate new skin cells to the elements, it can actually worsen hyperpigmentation if you're not vigilant about sun protection and avoidance. Tretinoin and other retinoids are firewalled behind a prescription in some countries and may be more difficult to obtain. But retinol/al is available in OTC forms. \n\n**SPF** represents a class of many ingredients designed to protect the skin from UV rays and the damage that occurs from exposure. UV exposure is one of the biggest causes of fine hyperpigmentation and wrinkles so adequate protection is essential. I know I'm not winning any science awards for this declaration, but a lot of people who struggle with hyperpigmentation aren't adequately protecting themselves from the sun. But you also have to be kind of realistic. Even with perfect protection and avoidance, sometimes your hyperpigmentation will still flare. This happens during the summer for a lot of people and something even I grapple with. The key is to do your best and SPF actually works well with numerous other ingredients (like the ones listed below) to help solve that problem. Arbutin is a Tyrosinase Inhibitor that blocks melanin production. \n\n**Arbutin**, or the synthesized version called alpha arbutin, is a favorite brightening ingredient because it's a slow-release derivative of hydroquinone that inhibits melanin production. This results in both healing and prevention of dark spots, especially when paired with topical acids. It metabolizes on the skin into hydroquinone which is super effective for hyperpigmentation while being a less controversial and hard-to-come-by ingredient than pure hydroquinone. More on hydroquinone in part 6. \n\n**Tranexamic acid** is another Tyrosinase Inhibitor. This was first used in wound care and it was found to have profound effects on hyperpigmentation. Although it's an acid, it's not a chemical exfoliant, kinda like how hyaluronic acid is not a chemical exfoliant. The exact mechanism by which tranexamic acid works to reduce hyperpigmentation is not fully understood, but it is believed to work by reducing inflammation by blocking plasmin which contributes to melanin production when unchecked. It is particularly effective in treating melasma and one of my personal favorite ingredients. \n\n**Kojic Acid** is another Tyrosinase Inhibitor. Kojic acid is a natural skin brightener that is derived from various fungi. Kojic acid can also help to exfoliate because it's a slight chemical exfoliant, which can remove dead skin cells that contribute to hyperpigmentation and improve overall appearance. But it does both things: block melanin production and turn skin cells over. Azelaic Acid has a lot of things going for it that can help with hyperpigmentation. It's an anti-inflammatory and antiseptic that disrupts melanin production. \n\n**Azelaic acid** works by inhibiting the production of melanin in the skin like those other tyrosinase inhibitors. In addition, azelaic acid also has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, which help to improve the overall health and appearance of the skin by reducing melanin production as a result of injury or inflammation. It's also an anti-acne ingredient that can address the root cause of PIH by reducing acne on the skin. It's pretty awesome and available in OTC and prescription strengths. \n\n**Niacinamide** is another one that directly and indirectly addresses hyperpigmentation. It's a skin soother that decreases inflammation and it naturally reduces sebum production which can curb acne which can curb PIH. It actually took me a little while to figure out that this was another solid hyperpigmentation treatment for these reasons because I used to look at it as being more of an acne treatment. Niacinamide is a form of vitamin B3 that works by inhibiting the transfer of pigment within the skin, which can help to reduce the appearance of dark spots and uneven skin tone. So while it doesn't block tyrosinase, it prevents transfer of pigmented skin cells to the surface. \n\n**Vitamin C aka L-ascorbic acid** is an antioxidant that fights free radical damage. It treats and prevents hyperpigmentation in three ways. First, it reduces free radical damage from UV exposure which helps increase the effectiveness of SPF when worn together. Second, it is also a tyrosinase inhibitor that blocks melanin production. And finally, vitamin C encourages skin cell turnover. The key is finding a nice stable version of it. \n\n**Glycolic and Lactic Acid.** Since this list is getting long I am going to group these together. Glycolic Acid is a water-soluble alpha hydroxy acid that penetrates into the pores to treat pigmentation by providing general exfoliation and resurfacing of the skin. The result is improvements in dark spots, texture and other signs of aging. Lactic Acid is also an AHA but with a slightly larger molecular size than glycolic acid so it doesn't penetrate as deep and acts more as a surface exfoliant. As a result it provides more gentle exfoliation to buff away surface pigmentation with an added benefit of acting as a humectant to seal moisture into the skin. Licorice Extract is a plant extract that inhibits melanin production. \n\n**Licorice root extract** contains a compound called glabridin, which has been shown to have skin brightening effects as, you guessed it, a tyrosinase inhibitor. In addition, licorice root extract also has anti-inflammatory properties, which can help to reduce redness and inflammation associated with hyperpigmentation. I'm seeing more and more of this pop up in skin care. \n\n**Soy Proteins** are another plant extract that inhibits melanin production. They contain compounds known as isoflavones, which have been shown to help reduce the amount of melanin produced by melanocytes in the skin. Additionally, soy proteins have antioxidant properties that can help to protect the skin from damage caused by free radicals, which can contribute to hyperpigmentation. \n\n# How To Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 2: The Routine and Recommendations \n\nThis is adapted from numerous comments, posts and DMs I've written on the topic and also comprises a large portion of my own personal routine and routines we recommend to patients. This is a generalist routine meaning it targets all the forms of hyperpigmentation I've mentioned; freckles, melasma, PIH, and age spots though it can be tweaked to address these individually more specifically. This is really my jumping off point for people to get a good idea of what they can achieve as a baseline with OTC ingredients before fine tuning or enlisting the help of a dermatologist. For a lot of people, this is enough to fully resolve, but even if it gets you part of the way there, this should give you a good idea of reactivity. A few caveats:\n\n* Freckles cannot ever be 100% eradicated. You can however reduce their appearance and prevent them from getting darker. It's important to have realistic goals and understand that sometimes our genetics will overrule any routine we have.\n* This routine and any hyperpigmentation routine will not address moles. Moles are a totally different thing that can only be eradicated through removal by a medical practitioner. Moles can be raised or not, but no amount of topicals will get rid of them.\n* Melasma is a beast. Sometimes it can be treated with OTC topicals, sometimes it requires prescription strength topicals like hydroquinone, sometimes you need in-office procedures like fractal lasers or IPL. Again, this routine is a jumping off point to see what you can accomplish at home before going down that road.\n* You'll notice I don't mention products with all the ingredients I listed above. This is because the more you put on your face, the greater your risk of causing irritation. Again, you can adjust and tweak by switching out products with these ingredients or add/subtract as it suits your personal needs.\n* If you're struggling with hyperpigmentation while pregnant or breastfeeding, these recommendations may need to be paused. \n\nAlright, let's get to it! \n\n**AM routine -- The Goal: Heal, Protect, and Prevent. In order of application following a lukewarm water rinse:**\n\n* Azelaic acid\n* Alpha Arbutin\n* Vitamin C serum\n* Moisturizer\n* SPF \n\nThe combo of C+AZ+AA+SPF is an absolute powerhouse for healing existing hyperpigmentation and preventing new hyperpigmentation from forming. It makes your SPF more effective, it inhibits the production of melanin from UV exposure (not your natural melanin production though), and it speeds cell turnover with dual antioxidant action and gentle chemical exfoliation. The result is brighter skin in a few months of consistent use. \n\n**For Azelaic Acid**, this is the ingredient for serious treatment. It's considered one of the most effective ways to reverse melasma aka serious hyperpigmentation short of hydroquinone -- which is both controversial and hard to get. It brings a little bit of exfoliation to the table in addition to inhibiting UV melanin production, but it also has a slight antiseptic property which can help with acne. Paula's choice Azelaic Acid Booster is the only one I've really tried after sampling the Ordinary's in-store and not liking the texture. I get about 6 months out of a tube and a little bit goes a long way. \n\n**For Alpha Arbutin**, the Ordinary's formulation is pretty solid. I prefer the Ordinary's AA 2% + HA as opposed to their AA 2% + Ascorbic Acid 8% as I don't believe the quality and stability of their Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) is great. That's why I opt for a separate Vitamin C serum step. But the AA + HA also has a little bit of lactic acid in it which provides some gentle exfoliation and encourages AA deeper into the skin where it's more effective. Lactic acid is mild enough that it's safe for use in a morning routine, but you still want to protect with SPF. There are a couple AA products floating around but I think TO's product is probably the best, most straightforward one. Alpha Arbutin metabolizes into hydroquinone on the skin so is basically one of the best OTC pigment correctors you can get. \n\n**For Vitamin C**, the gold standard really is Skinceuticals CE Ferulic. This is stupid expensive though so I’m going to suggest Timeless Vitamin C. I like that it comes in an airless pump that prevents oxidation over time. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that increases the rate of skin cell turnover bringing forward new, skin cells while simultaneously improving the effects of SPF. It's a great foundation for a fix. \n\nThese ingredients can be layered on one right after the other then topped with your **moisturizer** (I like a basic one like cetaphil daily lotion), then topped with your **SPF**. The SPF I would recommend is Canmake UV mermaid gel in clear as this will not leave a white cast on your skin and it’s generally a very elegant SPF. It's SPF 50 which means it gives really good protection, but there are numerous SPFs you can try. I personally like anything from La Roche Posay, any Neutrogena SPF that's not formulated with ethylhexylglycerin, Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen, Biore Aqua Rich (another Japanese brand), Trader Joe's SPF if you can get your hands on it, and EltaMD. \n\nOf all the products I’ve tried that could act as a stand-in for vitamin c, azelaic acid, and alpha arbutin, there’s one Japanese serum from **Hada Labo called “whitening lotion”** which has had the biggest impact on my hyperpigmentation in a single product of anything I’ve tried. This might be a little too effective though, I actually find that it washed me out within the first 2 weeks of twice daily use, so now I only use it in the morning. And I’m not a fan of the translation… which is a direct but mistranslation. It’s not a bleaching lotion, it also relies on a form of vitamin C and tranexamic acid to brighten skin. But it's a really interesting to try if you wanted a simplified morning routine in which case I would apply this, then your moisturizer, then your SPF. \n\n**PM routine -- The Goal: Renew and Reveal. In order of application:**\n\n* Cleanse\n* Buffer\n* Tranexamic acid and exfoliant OR retinoid\\*\\*\n* Moisturize \n\n**To cleanse**, I have a really basic recommendation that will remove your SPF, makeup, and any grime/sebum from your day. Start with Cetaphil gentle cleanser. This is a gentle, hydrating cleanser that will break up your SPF really effectively. Massage in and rinse. Then apply a foaming cleanser, I recommend Cetaphil daily cleanser which foams. This will sweep away anything that’s left and give you a good foundation for the rest of your routine. While this doesn't directly help hyperpigmentation specifically, it's a critical step especially for people who are acne>PIH prone. It also gives you a nice clean slate to apply the rest of your skincare. I've tried dozens of cleansers but always come back to these two as good basic options. \n\n**For your Buffer** this is an important step that can be done prior to using a chemical exfoliant or retinoid: applying an occlusive that will block the active from more sensitive skin. I recommend buffering around your eyes and nostrils with La Roche Posay Cicaplast balm because it kind of doubles as a nice eye cream, but this can also be done with basic vaseline or aquaphor for a more budget-friendly option. \n\n**For Tranexamic Acid**, my holy grail TXA product, La Roche Posay Glycolic B5 is actually a multipurpose serum that combines ingredients to treat hyperpigmentation with chemical exfoliants. It contains two hyperpigmentation heavy hitters -- Tranexamic acid and Kojic Acid which are great for melasma -- and two exfoliants -- Glycolic Acid and Lipo-Hydroxy Acid (LHA) which is like fancy salicylic acid -- so it both reveals new skin cells that are less prone to pigmenting from UV exposure while sloughing away your old skin cells. You can use this 2 or 3 nights per week. On off nights, just cleanse and moisturize. \n\n**For a Retinoid** if you can get prescription tretinoin, this is going to be the best bet. Your doctor will advise you on the concentration. More on that in part 6. It will help speed up the rate of cell turnover bringing new, unpigmented skin cells to the surface faster. Some other OTC options include differin (which is rated more for acne but uses the same mechanism for cell turnover so it's also effective in this use case) and retinols. Now, I haven't tried every retinol on the market but I have two that I stand by: SkinCeuticals retinol and L'Oreal retinol serum. The SkinCeuticals is, in my opinion, the closest to RX tretinoin in terms of efficacy, but it's a little pricey. The L'Oreal also does a really good job and is a little more affordable. It's currently my go-to OTC on the days I'm not using my RX retinoid tazarotene. You can use this 2 or 3 nights per week. On off nights, just cleanse and moisturize. \n\n**\\*\\* My recommendations for tranexamic acid and retinoids CANNOT be used in the same night.** You'll nuke your skin. And for most people, both aren't necessary, you can get away with using one or the other. If I had a preference, I would say use the TXA serum instead of a retinoid, but if you can build up a tolerance to using them both without damaging your barrier, they work really well together. So, proceed with caution. If you want to use both, use them on alternate nights and give yourself a night or two without either to let your skin recover. For me personally, I do retinoids on Sundays, and Wednesdays, chemical exfoliants on Mondays and Thursdays, and I let my skin rest (cleanse, moisturize, squalene oil) on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. \n\nOn top of whichever active you choose, apply your **moisturizer**. You can use the same one you use in your morning routine, the Cetaphil daily lotion as it’s nice and light. I also like La Roche Posay Toleraine double repair for a ceramide-based cream alternative if you want something richer. \n\nYou do not want to \"slug\" over actives. This advice gets mixed in a lot. Slugging refers to applying an occlusive layer over your skincare such as vaseline, aquaphor, oils like squalene oil, or healing balms like La Roche Posay Cicaplast balm. While this can be done on hydration nights, it should not be done on nights when you're using chemical exfoliants or retinoids as this may make them too effective causing irritation and breakouts. \n\n# Body Hyperpigmentation \n\nOk, I need everyone to be a grownup for two seconds. These products and methods (both from the prior section and this section) should NOT be used on your genitals. First, you can cause serious irritation or infection by applying active skincare to your genitals. Second, it's really not going to do anything to change the pigmentation of the skin there. The skin on your genitals is different than your body and facial skin and it pigments in different ways for different reasons so it's not going to respond to topicals the same way the rest of your body does. Don't even try it. \n\n**To be perfectly clear, these are the areas you should not be applying skincare:** labia majora, labia minora, vaginal entrance or vagina, clitoral hood, perineum, anus, intergluteal cleft aka inside your butt crack, penis, or scrotum. And I say this as someone who chaffed the precipice of her \"intergluteal cleft\" in an unfortunate crunches-in-the-wrong-gym-shorts accident leaving me with some deeply incriminating hyperpigmentation and earning me the nickname \"skid mark\" from my ever loving boyfriend. It faded after a year but you can still send prayers. \n\n**These are areas you can apply skincare but do so with absolute caution and at your own risk**: bikini line, mons pubis, inner thigh up to the groin fold, butt cheeks. Ok, now that we've got the disclaimers out of the way, let's move forward. \n\nHyperpigmentation can also occur on body skin for the same reason it appears on the face, but it can also be triggered by friction. And because body skin is different from facial skin, it requires a slightly different approach. This is my recommendation for both hyperpigmentation and KP (Keratosis pilaris) because they rely on the same mechanism for treatment: chemical exfoliation. \n\nIn the case of body hyperpigmentation, I recommend a two prong approach: a body wash in the shower and a topical treatment to be used after. Oh, and SPF again if there are areas that are exposed to the sun, and I have a holy grail SPF recommendation for this. \n\nNow you may have noticed in my facial skin recommendation that I did not mention CeraVe as a treatment brand. I have posted numerous takedowns of CeraVe on other threads so I won't rehash them here suffice it to say that it's no longer a brand I can in good faith recommend since it's acquisition by L'Oreal. This is often the brand that's considered when treating KP on the body, but I don't believe their formulations and ingredient quality works for everyone. \n\n**For the body wash**, I recommend Neutrogena body clear with Salicylic acid. This is an exfoliating body wash that will help clear away dead skin cells on the surface allowing new ones to come through. To be effective, you want it to sit on your skin for a little while. I recommend lathering it up and applying it after turning off your shower faucet and letting it sit for 2 or 3 minutes. This is when I like to knock out shower emails. Then rinse away. \n\n**On towel dried skin** after your shower, apply AmLactin Bumps Be Gone. Again, this is formulated for KP but the reason I like it is because it contains lactic acid which will also give the assist on brightening hyperpigmented body skin. The wash and this should be effective, but you might also want to mix in a few drops of the alpha arbutin serum I recommended for your facial routine, maybe three drops per application area (each leg, each arm, chest, etc). I generally don't encourage facial products on the body because it's not an economical use for them, and also because body skin is a little more resilient and doesn't need skincare that's formulated for more sensitive facial skin. The AA serum from the Ordinary is very affordable however and is a good hyperpigmentation generalist. \n\nAnother one that I mentioned in the facial hyperpigmentation portion that can work well on the body is the Hada Labo whitening lotion. Again, this is formulated around tranexamic acid which is very effective for hyperpigmentation and a little bit if this stuff goes a long way. I buy it in bulk from Japanese Importers though it's also available on Amazon for a slightly higher price. If you find yourself in Asia, stock up on it. I use this specifically for fading tan lines that happen (even with diligent/neurotic SPF use) around my fitness watch and the straps of my workout tops that I run in. \n\n**You also want to wear SPF on areas that are exposed to the sun** to prevent pigmentation from occurring. The one I absolutely love that’s not your 90’s banana boat is Aveeno Protect + Hydrate lotion with SPF 60. This is a great SPF for a lot of reasons: it finishes like a lotion instead of a sunscreen, it dries down totally clear, and it has a pleasant, slight sweet scent. On a scale of 1-10 with 1 being bare skin, 10 being banana boat slathered on by your mom in 1997, and regular body lotion being a 2, I give Aveeno Protect + Hydrate a 2.5 in terms of texture and feel-finish. I use it as my daily lotion on my neck, arms, shoulders, and chest. If you're more active you might need a heavier hitter here like a sport sunscreen. \n\n# Nuclear Options \n\nIn general, I recommend trying OTC topical solutions for any skin concern before heading down the in-office procedure route. Part of this is because you can usually put a good dent in what you're struggling with by using OTC topicals, making in-office procedures and RX treatments easier and more effective. Part of it is so you have a good maintenance routine in place to use after the fact to preserve the results of your in-office procedure which can sometimes be costly. Lastly, while some procedures can solve the immediate problem completely, topical skincare can be really effective at treating other adjacent conditions like redness, acne, and fine lines. \n\nSide note: I haven't listed every possible compounded medication because there are a lot, and many compounded meds are formulated to tackle multiple issues like acne and hyperpigmentation. I also tend to favor single note skin care (aka, products with very few ingredients) as this allows you to combine or remove certain actives and gives you a better sense of reactivity. \n\nFor tougher-to-treat hyperpigmentation such as melasma, if your topical routine doesn't totally clear the problem in 6 to 8 months, a visit to the dermatologist might be helpful. Here are the heavier-hitting procedures and topicals that can go the extra mile after you've exhausted other options. \n\n**Medical Grade Peels:** Medical grade chemical peels can be done by dermatologists. Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or phenol peels may be done for cases of severe hyperpigmentation, but high concentration BHA or AHA peels are also commonly used. I do these twice a year. Because of the strength of the acids used, these must be done by a medical professional with careful followup. \n\n\\*\\*\\*IPL Therapy and Laser Therapy may not work for everyone and in some cases may exacerbate hyperpigmentation so you really want to work with dermatologists with a lot of experience in treating cases similar to yours to determine if these interventions are appropriate for you. \n\n**IPL Treatment:** Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) therapy can treat hyperpigmentation by targeting the melanin in the skin with a broad spectrum of light wavelengths, heating and breaking the melanin down. IPL is particularly effective for treating sun damage and age spots, as well as other forms of hyperpigmentation. The treatment is relatively non-invasive, with minimal downtime, making it a popular option. This is also a great treatment for the redness associated with enlarged blood vessels (often confused for broken capillaries) on the surface of the skin which can also appear alongside hyperpigmentation. There isn't any clinical evidence to support at-home IPL devices being effective in the same way. That doesn't mean it's not possible, it's just not studied enough to be certain. Most at-home IPL devices do not operate in effective wavelengths the way professional grade ones do. \n\n**Laser Therapy:** Fractional and CO2 lasers can be used to treat a range of hyperpigmentation issues, including sun damage, age spots, and melasma. The treatment works by removing the top layers of skin, which contain the excess pigmentation, revealing fresh, healthy skin cells underneath. The lasers also stimulate the production of collagen, which helps to improve skin texture and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. \n\n**Hydroquinone**: This isn't an in-office procedure like the aforementioned treatments, but it is firewalled behind a prescription meaning you can only access hydroquinone in effective concentrations by working with a doctor. This is a somewhat new development at least in the US following some covid-era rejiggering of prescription clearances. HDQ is controversial because it's a skin bleaching agent which has some cultural implications in places where light skin is favored over natural pigmentation. HDQ technically works the same way other OTC tyrosinase inhibitors do (in fact arbutin actually metabolizes into HDQ when applied to the skin), pure HDQ happens to be the most powerful version of them. It lightens any skin it touches, not just hyperpigmented skin in higher concentrations which can make it tough to use. This effect isn't as profound in the other tyrosinase inhibitors I mentioned making them much easier to use over HDQ which, in high concentrations, must be dotted on the skin in only hyperpigmented areas. So HDQ is really reserved for intervention in extreme or OTC treatment-resistance cases. \n\n**Tretinoin and Prescription Retinoids:** This is going to be dependent on what part of the world you're in, but in a lot of countries, tretinoin and its counterparts like tazarotene are only available through prescription. I mentioned retinoids in the routine so if you're able to get your hands on a prescription from a doctor, it may be more effective than OTC retinols. Most doctors will prescribe a retinoid over hydroquinone, so this is usually easier to procure and can be quite effective on its own as a hyperpigmentation treatment. OTC differin is the only retinoid available over-the-counter (in the US) which can also be used for hyperpigmentation. \n\n**Prescription Azelaic Acid:** This is another one that's available in lower concentrations over-the-counter (which can still be quite effective) but there are prescription strength grades of azelaic acid. This is usually reserved for rosacea treatment as it tends to target redness and flushing, or as an acne treatment because of its antiseptic properties, but it can also be an effective hyperpigmentation treatment for its tyrosinase-inhibiting ability. \n\n**If you made it this far, congratulations! I hope this information is helpful. While it is extensive and based on massive amount of research, experience, experimentation and work with professionals, it may not be perfect and it may not be suitable for everyone. Feel free to offer any constructive criticism or ask any questions in comments. I am always open to expanding my understanding.**",

        "body": "Wowwowow insanely comprehensive and great info. Also beautifully presented and well formatted! So glad to see so many great suggestions and some of my favorite combinations too.\n\n  \n\n\nOne thing I wanted to comment on was the part about using tranexamic OR retinoids and how you suggested using them and just further clarify that that's, as you pointed out, something specific to the products you were suggesting in this example because the LRP glycolic b5 obviously has glycolic. So it is very much appreciated that you were attentive enough to point out that using retinoids and glycolic on the same night is a big risk for most people 😇\n\n  \n\n\nSince tranexamic itself isn't going to lead to any additional irritation risk, by itself it's safe to use with whatever else you'd like if the formualtion doesn't contain other actives that would add irritation risk. Cos de Baha Tranexamic Acid serum (tranexamic + niacinamide) is one of the generic options I would suggest that won't be adding additional irritation risk, and can certainly be used with retinoids comfortably. Cos de Baha Tranexamic Acid serum (tranexamic + niacinamide). Some other options with just slight exfoliation power but can be comfortably layered with retinoids without significant tolerance risk is Be Minimalist Tranexamic acid serum has no niacinamide, but has 3% mandelic and 0.3% salicylic, and HPA. Those are my 2 primary reccs. There's also Naturium Tranexamic Acid serum (tranexamic acid, niacinamide, licorice, kojic acid) which is more impressive on paper but all of them are excellent.\n\n  \n\n\nThe second is the retinoid application method. I always advise using moisturizer BEFORE your retinoid rather than after. Since there's no reduction in efficacy, theres only upside of decelerated absorbtion leading to less oversaturation of the retinoic acid receptors which is what leads to those side effects. (Using moisturizer before retinoids is also referred to as buffering but I don't want to confuse anyone with using the word buffering in 2 different ways here). Ideally in the simplest routine example, you would cleanse, apply the cos de baha tranexamic serum, moisturize on damp skin. then wait for it to dry down and then apply your retinoid.\n\n  \n\n\nI have a whole guide on how to use retinoids optimally and a list of reccs which I think would be great here for some affordable options in varying potency ranges. I particularly suggest one of the RetinAL products for anyone seeking the most potent OTC options aside from Adapelene depending on your country and very affordable!\n\n  \n\n\n> Retinoid reccs and guidance [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/qtodqu/routine_help_how_to_cleanse_once_a_day_when_you/hkp4w8t/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/qtodqu/routine_help_how_to_cleanse_once_a_day_when_you/hkp4w8t/)\n\n  \n\n\nAnd if it interests you, I believe I have a whole different post linked within that specifically dedicated to discussing the cost:benefit analysis of using moisturizer before retinoids or applying it to clean skin instead. (spoiler: there is no benefit to not using moisturizer before, only risk.)\n\n  \n\n\nFor vitamin C, a fav is the Minimalist 10% or 16% vitamin C which uses centella water as a base so you also get some great additional anti-inflammatory benefit to further reduce any potential irritation. I'm not a huge vitamin C fan, it's great if you can tolerate the extra irritation potential and already have many of those other ingredients you mentioned incorporated since azelaic and retinoids and tyrosinase inhibitors are going to be much more hard hitting for hyperpigmentation :) and having anti-inflammatory ingredients included in your routine can make a huge difference for PIE and consequently PIH to prevent the melanocytes from being irritated.\n\n  \n\n\nI also definitely agree with the TO azelaic being very sensorially and cosmetically unpleasant 🤣. It has a hard time not just pulling with ITSELF which is an impressive feat that they managed to botch the formulation so badly.\n\nWhat I normally suggest is one of:\n\n *  Q +A 8%Azelaic Acid serum\n *  Cosde Baha azelaic acid 10% serum (has Niacinamide)\n *  Peach Slices azelaic acid 10% serum\n *  Finacea 15% azelaic acid prescription (preferably the foam if accessible as it's much more comfortable and elegant, but insurance can make that prohibitive for some).\n\nThsts all I have to comment on for now. Your post was excellent and I hope people get to see it!",

    "body": "Hey everyone! Due to a recent posting of misinformation being spread on here, excessive worrying over ingredients, and people PMing me for advice I figured I would just make a post about this to help other people with similar questions\n\nFor background, I am a chemist- in particular a biochemist. I used to work in a research area that focused on mineral/ion- skin absorption. I'll try to hit the ones that aren't in the side bar already and separate them out by category for easy viewing. Let me know if I missed any big ones!\n\n**Emulsifiers - keep oil/water based chemicals from separating in products**\n\nMost common products I see contain polysorbates, laureth-4, glyceryl monostearate (also pearlescent agent)\nlauramide DEA (also foam booster), or potassium cetyl sulfate. There's also stearic acid that also helps with cleansing. These aren't necessarily bad for you nor are they good for you. They're kinda meh ingredients that exist to make the product work \n\n**Preservatives- extend their shelf life and are anti microbial**\n \nparabens- these get a lot of flack but there isn't that much research confirming their 'toxicity'. The [original study] (http://www.dr-baumann.ca/science/Concentrations%20of%20Parabens%20in%20Human%20Breast.pdf) that brought them into the spotlight was over hyped by the media and dozens of other studies done afterwards have yet to find a definite link to cancer or other diseases. These are however very great preservatives\n\nBenzyl alcohol containing products has been known to dry some people out due to it's status as an alcohol. Aside from a preservative it's also used as a ph balancer\n\nformaldehyde- if you see this in a product, you may want to be wary. The World Health Organization has determined this to be a carcinogen; however whether trace amounts are as bad for you is still unknown\n\n tetrasodium EDTA/ disodium EDTA- normally these are used to draw metals out of the blood, but in terms of skincare, both work to stabilize the product by binding other chemicals. Only concern with this one is that it's an environmental hazard \n\nPhenoxyethanol -  an antimicrobial \n\nethylhexylglycerin - helps with eczema and also works for some people with rosacea \n\n**Moisturizers : Lipid thickeners - give product it's creamy consistency**\n\ncetyl alcohol, stearic acid and carnauba wax are the big ones- aren't bad, rarely cause things like breakouts for most people. These are also good at protecting the moisture barrier from water loss by forming a 'seal' \n\n**Moisturizers : Natural thickeners - come from nature, usually work as humectants (think hyaluronic acid)**\n\nhydroxyethyl cellulose, guar gum, xanthan gum and gelatin are the most popular\n\n**Moisturizers: Mineral thickeners - also natural, absorb both oils and retain water**\n\nmagnesium aluminium silicate, silica and bentonite are the big ones here. A lot of clay masks and some silicone based (neutrogena) sunscreens are apart of this category. Silicone based sunscreens are great for those who's skin can handle them since they keep oils/shine in check while also preventing your skin from overdrying\n\n**Moisturizers: synthetic thickeners - used in a lot of gel type products and some of the rich/smooth white creams**\n\ncarbomer, cetyl palmitate, and ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate are common ones\n\n**Emollients - soften the skin by preventing water loss, work as humectants,  definetly want these in your routine**\n\nbeeswax, olive oil, coconut oil and lanolin, petroleum jelly, mineral oil, glycerin, zinc oxide, butyl stearate and diglycol laurate , urea, glycerol, propylene glycol or lactic acid are big ones here.\n\nSome of these are termed 'comedogenic' like coconut oil but many many people don't break out from them so that's a pretty arbitrary rating imo\n\n**Edit- here’s a couple more I forgot to add that are sunscreen relevant**\n\n**Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate-** protects against UVB and not UVA rays. It is not very stable either, when exposed to sunlight, it kind of breaks down and loses its effectiveness (not instantly, but over time - it loses 10% of its SPF protection ability within 35 mins)\n\n**Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane-**  famous Avobenzone. It is the only globally available chemical sunscreen agent that protects against UVA. It is the global gold standard of UVA protection and is the most used UVA sunscreen in the world. Suprisingly it’s in moisturizers too.The problem with it, though, is that it is not photostable and degrades in the sunlight. Wikipedia says that avobenzone loses 36% of its UV-absorption capacity after just one hour of sunlight",

    "body": "I used to post on GOMI analyzing the ingredients of different Glossier formulations and would generally comment on their product releases, but I thought I'd move to reddit for this one since I think it's more helpful here.\n\nMe: I work in the beauty industry on the product development side and because of that I'm constantly testing new products from competitors either just to keep up with the industry or when clients bring them in as comparisons. Recently I came across a product that I thought omg, I need to post this on reddit bc there are a ton of people who would probably want to know this.\n\nThis post will cover the first [Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser](https://www.glossier.com/products/milky-jelly-cleanser) dupe which is a 99.999% match, is half the price (or usually less) - and the sole difference is that it has a different fragrance.\n\nIf you look up “Glossier Milky Jelly Dupes” the one that is always coming up is the Bliss Makeup Melt Cleanser. That one is annoying because is not a real dupe at all; it’s just vaguely texturally similar and has a similar bottle, but the formulation has nearly nothing in common with Milky Jelly in any way. Kind of pointless.\n\nPresenting the last word in Milky Jelly dupes, the [ELF Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser](https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9). It is \\*nearly identical in every way\\* to Milky Jelly and is usually on sale for $3. Srsly.\n\nIngredients comparison:\n\nE.L.F. Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser Ingredients: Water (Aqua), PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Dipropylene Glycol, Poloxamer 184, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Betaine, Isohexadecane, Xylitylglucoside, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Juice, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Panthenol (Vb5), Hydroxyacetophenone, Isopropyl Myristate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Anhydroxylitol, Polysorbate 80, Allantoin, Xylitol, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nGlossier Milky Jelly Ingredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Propanediol, Isohexadecane, Poloxamer 184, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Xylitylglucoside, Betaine, Allantoin, Glycerin, Panthenol, Symphytum Officinale Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Anhydroxylitol, Polysorbate 80, Xylitol, Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Isopropyl Myristate, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nThese formulations are nearly identical. They have the same cleansing agents in almost exactly the same order, and even the same textural ingredients. E.L.F. was definitely duplicating the formula exactly when they were formulating.\n\nAs I've said, I've tested the E.L.F. Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser and the Milky Jelly face wash and they are nearly identical. The texture is bang-on and the use experience is the same. There is just one real difference - the Glossier cleanser uses rosewater as the scent ingredient, and the Bounce Back uses a coconut fragrance. I’m sensitive to fragrances and it doesn’t bother me at all, it’s pretty light.\n\nThe best part? The E.L.F. Bounce Back Milky Jelly dupe is $6.00 for 100ml.\n\n$6.\n\nAnd when I ordered it for testing, it was actually $3 because E.L.F. always has sales.\n\nTo compare, Glossier Milky Jelly is $18.00 for 177ml + shipping.\n\nWhere to buy the Bounce Back: it’s is a little annoying, since they don’t have it in Target, or on Amazon it seems, but you can get it on the ELF website. Here’s the link:\n\n[https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9](https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9)\n\nAlso, disclaimer: I don't work for ELF, and never have, and think most of their products are very mediocre. But this one is clearly a copy of something already tested and popular (and I don't feel bad about sharing it because the Glossier Milky Jelly was a total rip-off/copy of the LaRoche Posay Physiological Gel, soooo)",

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

While you might have had a bad experience, using acids with retinol will NOT cause more breakouts as you erroneously suggested, and on the contrary many dermatologists recommend using benzoyl peroxide in conjunction with retinols to stave off purging and help acne heal faster.

    "body": "I know CeraVe in the tub is quite popular here, but I just wanted to provide a quick overview of other CeraVe moisturizers for those who aren't familiar.\n\n**NOTE**: All CeraVe moisturizers contain cetearyl alcohol/cetyl alcohol, which may cause breakouts to those who have a sensitivity to fatty alcohols.\n\n**Cerave Moisturizer Overview**\n\n[**Cerave Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/moisturizing-cream) (also known as Cerave \"in the tub\") is a thick, creamy moisturizer with ceramides, hyaluronic acid and petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/moisturizing-lotion) comes in a bottle and is a thinner consistency. It also has ceramides and hyaluronic acid but no petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/am-facial-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a small pump bottle and has a thick, creamy (slightly greasy) texture. It is SPF 30 and contains the following active suncare ingredients: Homosalate (12% - for UVB protection), Octinoxate (7.5% - for UVB protection), Octocrylene (2% - for UVB protection), Zinc Oxide (3.5% - for UVA protection). It also contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/pm-facial-moisturizing-lotion) (my fave) comes in a small pump bottle and is a silky/gel texture. It contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and places more focus on chemical exfoliation. Notable ingredients are mineral oil, ammonium lactate (similar to lactic acid), salicyclic acid, ceramides and a lower concentration of hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-cream) comes in a tub and is a thicker version of the SA lotion and contains similar ingredients with the addition of niacinamide.\n\n[**Cerave Skin Renewing Night Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/skin-renewing-night-cream) comes in a tub and contains shea butter, ceramides, niacinamide, peptides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and contains niacinamide, ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and allantoin (an anti-irritant derived from urea). \n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-cream) comes in a tub and contains glycerin, petrolatum, ceramides and hyaluronic acid. No niacinamide or allantoin in this one.\n\n**Notable Ingredient Overview**\n\n**Ceramides**: Naturally occurring, long chains of skin lipids (fats) that are major structural components of the skin’s outer layers. Skin as a barrier system inhibits water movement via its extracellular matrix, which has a unique composition of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% free fatty acids. Together, these lipids form what researchers refer to as \"crystalline lamellar structures\". Ceramides are necessary for the skin’s water-retention capacity as well as for barrier repair and cell regulation. Adding ceramides to skin-care products can help to restore the skin’s barrier system.\n\n**Hyaluronic acid**: Component of skin tissue that is used in skin-care products as a good skin-identical ingredient. Hyaluronic acid can boost skin's moisture content, reduce inflammation, have cell-communicating abilities, and help prevent moisture loss.\n\n**Niacinamide**: Also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid, niacinamide is a potent cell-communicating ingredient that offers multiple benefits for aging skin. Assuming skin is being protected from sun exposure, niacinamide can improve skin's elasticity, dramatically enhance its barrier function, help erase discolorations, and revive skin's healthy tone and texture.\n\n**Ammonium Lactate:** Ammonium lactate is a mix of lactic acid and ammonium hydroxide. It is used as a skin moisturizer lotion to treat dry, scaly, itchy skin. Those who are using it should avoid exposure to sunlight or artificial UV rays, such as sunlamps or tanning beds. Ammonium lactate makes skin more sensitive to sunlight. Skin is more likely to sunburn. Use sunblock and wear clothes when exposed to sunlight.\n\n**Salicylic acid**: Referred to as beta hydroxy acid (BHA), it is a multifunctional ingredient that addresses many of the systemic causes of blemishes. For decades dermatologists have been prescribing salicylic acid as an exceedingly effective keratolytic (exfoliant), but it also is an anti-irritant This is because salicylic acid is a derivative of aspirin (both are salicylates—aspirin’s technical name is acetylsalicylic acid), and so it also functions as an anti-inflammatory.\n\n**Shea butter**: A plant lipid extracted from the karite tree that is used as an emollient in cosmetics. Shea butter is a rich source of antioxidants.\n\n**Ingredient Lists**\n\n> **CeraVe Moisturizing Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n>\n> **CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Active Ingredients: Homosalate (12%), Octinoxate (7.5%), Octocrylene (2%), Zinc Oxide (3.5%). \n> Inactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate and Boron Nitride, Dimethicone, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Hyaluronic Acid, Phytosphingosine, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n> \n> **CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Renewing SA Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Mineral Oil, Ammonium Lactate, Salicylic Acid, Trolamine, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 in Corn Oil), Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Dimethicone 360, Methylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Propylparaben, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Renewing SA Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ammonium Lactate, Salicylic Acid, Triethanolamine, Cetyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 in Corn Oil), Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Methylparaben, Edetate Disodium, Propylparaben, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Glyceryl stearate SE, Stearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Saccharide Isomerate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterols, Ceramide 6 II, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 1, Niacinamide, Hyaluronic  Acid, Caprooyl Tetrapeptide-3, Tripeptide-1, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tocopherol, Allantoin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Phytosphingosine, Dextran, Xanthan Gum\n>\n>**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n>\n>Purified Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetostearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Emulsifying Wax, Niacinamide, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lauric Acid, Zinc Citrate, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Arginine PCA, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, EDTA, Sodium PCA, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer\n>\n>**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**\n>\n>Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Petrolatum, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nHopefully this information will be useful to people interested in trying Cerave.",

I was chatting over at the /r/beautyguruchatter Discord when NoSpelledWithAK said that she thought that the formula was changed and that no one said anything. This sounds rather surprising; after all, why would ABH change their formula for a brand new palette when everyone was likely to compare it to MR?\n\nWe wanted to go ahead and confirm that this was

Probably the one everyone is going to latch onto is that Subculture shadows are based on talc, whereas MR shadows are based on mica, but it looks like the entire formula got changed between the two palettes. This likely explains why people are having problems with Subculture not blending in as well as MR, as well as some major kickback issues.\n\nInterestingly enough, the ingredients for MR aren't [listed on the ABH website](http://www.anastasiabeverlyhills.com/modern-renaissance-palette/ABH01-18170.html). I wonder why.",

So, from that standpoint, this switch is ethical. But, you know, the brand wasn't sitting there making this decision because of ethical mica concerns.  \n\nI guess what I'm saying is that ABH could have announced this and made it a good thing. If they partnered up with a children's rights org, and put out this palette as a first step toward using less mica. There was a way to have spun it.  \n\nBut even if they had spun it and we were sitting on this website gushing over how ABH supports human rights, the reality is that they did this to make their shadows cheaper. Lower quality. And that's a bummer. I definitely have been channeling my inner Kimberly Clark on this one. Don't need it, not gonna buy it.",

To me, it's not the talc that is the issue but the overall change in formulation (quite a few ingredients and their position on the list are different btwn subculture and modern renaissance)",

I personally would go for the Be Plain when it's available because it has a simplified formula without the unnecessary plant extracts and flower oils. I think the Be Plain one would be better for oily skin than the Round Lab one. Both of the Hyggee sunscreens look promising, but I'm gravitating towards the Vegan Sun Cream because it is a chemical sunscreen and I have a tan complexion, I don't want to risk a white cast. However, the Real Sun Cream does have an interesting ingredient list and whipped texture (as I can see on Yesstyle)  and I will be looking out for reviews to see whether it leaves a white cast or not and make my decision accordingly. What I love about the Hyggee sunscreens is that they are fragrance/essential oil free, but they still contain alcohol. I prefer alcohol because it allows the sunscreen to set better and be less tacky. If you have oily skin, I would think that one of the Hyggee sunscreens would work better for you because I have a Kolmar sunscreen (Isntree Watery Sun Gel) that is similar to the new Round Lab and Be Plain sunscreens and I definitely wouldn't recommend it for oily skin as it is way too shiny.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream has beet root extract, which made me think of the Krave Beet Shield. Get this, the Beet Shield was also made in Cosmax, same as this new Hyggee one. So I did some digging and found out that the Beet Shield has the SAME exact 5 filters as this new Hyggee sunscreens in the same order. The rest of ingredients are not too similar though, so I do not think they are the same exact sunscreen, as opposed to how I feel about the Be Plain and Round Lab sunscreens, which I do think are almost identical. I do think this Vegan Sun Cream is inspired by the Beet Shield, with maybe an improved formula, since the Beet Shield did not pass SPF tests. So if you are looking for a replacement of the Krave Beauty Beet Shield but with verified SPF protection, get the new Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream!",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

    "body": "Hiya,\n\nI hope you enjoy the below reviews. I'm just a regular consumer buying everything with my own money - i.e., nothing sponsored, etc. Note, I've bought all of them on sale for around AUD$15-20 because I like sales haha.\n\nProducts:\n\n1. PKY - essence toner;\n2. PKY - mist toner;\n3. Secret Key - fresh nature toner - milk brightening one;\n4. Benton - Aloe BHA Toner;\n5. Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner; and\n6. Purito - Centella Green Level Calming Toner & the unscented version (Purito Unscented Centella Toner)\n\nMy skin used to be severely dry but is now slightly dry on the cheek areas and slightly oily on the t-zone during summer and slightly dry on the whole face in the winter.\n\nAlso note that the below two PKY products have different 'actives'/hero ingredients notwithstanding them seemingly being quite similar! I've bolded the plant extracts under the ingredient headers below.\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Essence Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495), *Australian* websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. *Note, this one is generally recommended for people with drier skin whereas the mist version is generally recommended for those with oilier skin* Friends with eczema have also used this with success. *.* I can use both year round without breaking out. I've had friends with oilier skin who've used this one and have broken out. YMMV.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** LOVE THIS. May repurchase this for the rest of my life. I've used this after breaking my moisture barrier, after chemical peels, after active masks, and also *after getting my face ablatively lasered (after the the initial few days of only using an ointment)*. It's REALLY benign in a godly way. If you want it to do anything other than hydrate or increase the penetration of your other actives, this isn't the product for you (note, it doesn't claim to do anything else apart from hydrate & calm really).\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a little bit thicker than water but not as thick as the Purito centella toners. Won't run off your hand/face like water will but will eventually run off.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** None at allll, even when I broke my moisture barrier.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? Yes**/I have rebought this 4 or so times so far.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Mist Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance. This is in a spray bottle and is better suited to oily skinned persons.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1060395517?cpid=1060395516&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1060395517%3Fcpid%3D1060395516%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=876677637398885328), and Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/pyunkang-mist-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. This one is more for people with slightly oilier skin too. It's a lighter formula than the essence one.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Decent hydration, I prefer to use this in the toner stage instead of after my skincare but I have enjoyed using it as a 'refreshing' spray during the day.\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a nice mist, doesn't run on the face. Feels like a spray of water?\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a spray bit on top. I've had no issues with it but one mate had a couple that didn't spray properly.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** Unsure. I've rebought it once but haven't gone to use this one as much as I have the PKY essence toner or the Purito Unscented Centella Toner. I also don't like mists a whole bunch as they can go onto your clothes (if you're out) or jewellery if you're wearing any.

Couldn't use it long enough to notice anything.\n\n**Smell:** A very strong scent that I could barely use it. I think I used it around 5-10 times before binning it - I couldn't even put up with the scent of this to use it on other parts of my body.\n\n**Feel:** really watery.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Fortunately (given the high fragrance), no reactions to this. If you had any irritation though, I'd expect some sort of reaction.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?

AUD$23. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/benton-aloe-bha-skin-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1053033537), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** people with sensitive and dry skin as it's quite rich.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** on and off since mid 2020, still using it randomly to just use it up.\n\n**My thoughts:** Per Google (may not be accurate), it has a pH of 5.5 which is too high for there to be any noticeable exfoliation with 0.5% BHA present. I've not noticed any calming effects. It is definitely hydrating but given it's advertised as a BHA toner I'm quite disappointed at the lack of BHA efficacy here. I would much rather use the purito centella toner to hydrate and calm my skin as the centella has other benefits such as helping to stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** Similar to the PKY essence toner. Not as thick as the purito centella toners.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a pump on top. No issues with it, but it can come out a bit forcefully sometimes.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **No**, almost threw it out but am trying to use it up.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nAloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Water (80%), Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Beta-Glucan, Polyglutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea (Green Purslane) Extract, Psidium Guajava (Guava) Fruit Extract, Salicylic Acid (0.5%), Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract (200mg), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice (200mg), Arginine, Pentylene Glycol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Polysorbate 20, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** **Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 relief toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$25 for 180mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/etude-house-soon-jung-ph-5-5-relief-toner-180ml-180ml/info.html/pid.1058586258), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone. It adds light hydration with benign ingredients - akin to the PKY toners but very minimally more expensive. It'd be good if you have irritated and/or dry skin.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** I used it once/twice a day until I used it up. Bought it in December 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Pretty decent. I'd recommend this to the same group of people who'd use the PKY essence toner. Nothing ground breaking. I prefer the calming nature of the Purito Unscented Centella Toner or even the PKY essence toner if you want zero actives (if you consider centella an 'active').\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** A watery toner.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** No but for no fault of the product. I just prefer using the Purito Unscented Centella one as it's just as benign, a bit cheaper, and has the benefits of centella.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, Propanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Madecassoside, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Polyglycerin-3, Disodium EDTA\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**Centella Green Level Calming Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804) **& the** [**Centella Unscented Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380)\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating and calming toner - may also stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$30 but I've always bought it on sale for approx. AUD$20-25 for 200mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380), [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml)\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone however this is best suited to those with any sort of irritation, acne, or redness. That is, if you have basically perfect skin you're probably not going to notice much of a difference but if you have irritation etc then you'll likely fall in love. Also good if you're wanting to help stimulate collagen production especially for the low price point - target ages for this is probably mid twenties and up.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** religiously since April 2020, sometimes twice a day.\n\n**My thoughts:** *BLOODY EXCELLENT*. I'm on my second bottle of this. My first bottle was the first listed one (scented) and then they released the unscented one so I bought that! It's incredible. I love it. In my opinion, it's partially why my skin is able to tolerate me using actives so much. It's excellent to use before actives as it doesn't interact with anything and really good to use after an 'active' mask or a clay mask etc. I switched to the unscented one to just reduce the risk of irritation.\n\n*also studies, which I haven't read but have seen derms I trust on insta etc, say that* ***centella can help stimulate/produce collagen... a big yes from me given it's a calming ingredient that shouldn't purge you or break you out*** *(unless you're allergic/sensitive to it)!*\n\n**Smell:** The scented one smells herbaceous (akin to Asian herbal medicine - I don't mind it but others may). The unscented one doesn't really smell like anything / I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** thick/fat/heavy water. Not a watery toner. Enjoyable.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Neverrrrrr, this helps me reduce the side effects from using actives such as retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, etc.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **Yes** & I have. Will probably rebuy for life.\n\n**Ingredients:** 4 variants as they've got the scented and unscented versions, and then those with and without witch hazel\n\nnon-witch hazel unscented version -\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract (strengthens skin barrier), Butylene Glycol (humectants), Pentylene Glycol (skin-conditioning agents), Dipropylene Glycol (humectants), 1,2-Hexanediol (stabilizers), Trehalose (humectants), Sodium Hyaluronate (natural moisturizing factor/ humectants), Hamemelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiaticoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiatic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Madecassic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Panthenol (strengthens skin barrier), Carbomer (viscosity increasing agents), Allantoin (skin protectants), Arginine (skin-conditioning agents), Portulaca Oleracea Extract (skin-conditioning agents), Ethylhexylglycerin (skin-conditioning agents), Disodium EDTA (stabilizers)\n\nI hope these reviews were useful :)",

I would only trust claims I can see after using a product. \n\n\nAs far as I know, topical creams cannot generate collagen production. Collagen is created from the foods you eat. I’m not even sure you can take collagen supplements to increase collagen production because everything in your body is broken down in the same way and your body will direct the amino acids to where the body needs it most and not where you might want it.",

    "body": "# Background\n\nSkinceuticals CE Ferulic is considered the best vitamin c serum that money can buy in the skincare market today. In fact, many people have sweared by the Skinceuticals CE Ferulic, claiming that it makes a larger difference in their skin compared to other vitamin c alternatives. At $166 per oz, it's not as easily accessible by the average consumer. The reason why it's so expensive is because Skinceuticals currently holds the patent for the perfect ratio of vitamin c, vitamin e, and ferulic acid needed to optimize the effectiveness of vitamin c.\n\nThe \"golden ratio\" is **15% L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)**, **1% Vitamin E (Tocopherol)**, and **0.5% Ferulic Aced** with a pH level between **2.5 - 3.0**. Skinceuticals CE Ferulic is also **fungal acne safe**.\n\nGiven the price, there have been a lot of posts and comments asking for dupes of this product.\n\n**Disclaimer: This post is not sponsored. I used my own money to purchase Skinceuticals and Dr.Brenner for the advancement of skincare data.**\n\n## Why should I use Vitamin C?\n\nI'm not going to go into this too much since that's not really the focus of the post, but you can read more about the research behind Vitamin C here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/vitamin\\_c\\_recs](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/vitamin_c_recs)\n\n## Popular Dupes\n\nThere are some well known popular dupes of Skinceuticals out in the skincare market today.

I have lots of PIE due to old acne and lots of freckles and sun damage on my skin due to the fact that I've lived in Hawaii for most of my life.\n\n## Current Routine\n\nMorning:\n\n* ILLI Ceramide Ato Lotion\n* Hado Labo Tokyo Skin Plumping Gel Cream\n* Shiseido SPF40 Sunscreen\n\nNight:\n\n* La Roche Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Face Wash\n* Tretinoin 0.1% cream\n* ILLI Ceramide Ato Lotion\n* Hado Labo Tokyo Skin Plumping Gel Cream\n\nTret has made my skin extra sensitive. For example, my skin is now unable to use the Cerave hydrating cleanser due to how sensitive it is. The La Roche Posay cleanser is the only non irritating cleaner I can use now that I am on Tret.\n\nI have tried multiple Vitamin C products on my skin over the years. Specifically, I've tried Melano CC, NuFountain C20, The Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension, and Philosophy Vitamin C Powder.\n\nI have never been able to spot any visible improvement whenever I started using *any* brand of Vitamin C on my skin.\n\n# Review\n\nThere's quite a number of reviews between Skinceuticals CE Ferulic VS Timeless 20% Vitamin C and Paula's Choice C15 if you make a quick Google search. I didn't want to add to those stats as I think there's enough data there. This post is mainly going to review Skinceuticals CE Ferulic vs Dr.Brenner's 20% Vitamin C Serum. In my opinion, Dr.Brenner is the closest dupe, ingredients wise, to Skinceuticals CE Ferulic.\n\n## Packaging\n\n[Packaging](https://preview.redd.it/y21w3rkgcmi51.jpg?width=1433&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=440c465d015a4ab5b9a285ece3ca393f24c7b33a)\n\nSkinceuticals came in a blue paper box, wrapped in plastic. The actual bottle is pretty opaque, but would definitely still allow light through given that it's glass and I was able to see the serum line quite clearly.\n\nDr.Brenner's came with the glass bottle wrapped in plastic. The bottle was just as opaque as Skinceuticals, and I was also able to see the serum line quite clearly.\n\nThe general guidance for both is to store in a cool, dry place. I've also read online that Vitamin C should be exposed to as little light as possible. Given that, I think Skinceutical's does a better job protecting the product until it gets to the consumer's home given the paper casing. For Dr.Brenner, it's possible for it to be exposed to light while waiting for it to be packaged and sent. However, they do claim on Amazon that they create their Vitamin C serum every 2 weeks to make sure it's fresh.\n\nI stored both of mine in a cupboard, so they're both only exposed to light when I take it out and use it. However, I kept my Skinceuticals in the paper casing while I stored it in the cupboard.\n\n## Product\n\n**Dr. Brenner Vitamin C Serum**\n\n[Link](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-L-Ascorbic-Hyaluronic-Dr-Brenner/dp/B07ZG28M2S/)\n\nPrice: $24.99/oz\n\n|Skinceuticals Ingredients|Dr. Brenner Vitamin C Ingredients|\n|:-|:-|\n|Aqua/Water/Eau, Ethoxydiglycol,|Water, Ethoxydiglycol,|\n|Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin,|L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Propylene|\n|Propylene Glycol, Laureth-23,|Glycol, Glycerin, Laureth-23,|\n|Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol,|Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Sodium|\n|Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate.|Ferulic Acid, Panthenol,|\n||Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol|\n\nAs you can see, the ingredients used in Dr.Brenner is the same as Skinceuticals, although the ordering seems to be different. Dr.Brenner claims that the ratio is **20% Vitamin C, 1% Vitamin E, 1% Hyaluronic Acid,** and **0.5% Ferulic Acid**. Unfortunately, I do not know the pH nor do I have anything to find out the pH of Dr.Brenner. Dr.Brenner **is fungal acne safe**.\n\n## Method\n\nI applied Skinceuticals to the left side of my face, and Dr.Brenner to the right side of my face every morning for 1 month, adjusting for irritation. I also applied the same sunscreen to my entire face after applying the vitamin c serums.\n\n## Thoughts\n\n**Skinceuticals CE Ferulic**\n\nThis has a really strong hot dog smell. The reviews are spot on about this. It really does smell like I'm rubbing hot dog water on my face. The serum is a pale yellow. The texture is slightly more viscous than Dr.Brenner's. The best way I can describe it is that it has the texture of thick water.\n\n**Dr.Brenner Vitamin C Serum**\n\nThis has a faint hot dog smell, not as strong as Skinceuticals. The texture is not as thick as Skinceuticals, it's more runny and has a closer texture to water, possibly due to the higher hyaluronic acid content. The coloring is a lighter yellow than Skinceuticals.\n\nMy before pictures are from when I applied the Vitamin C serums for the first time on each side. My after pictures are 1 month after daily morning application of the Vitamin C serums.\n\nI found that the Dr.Brenner serum is more irritating on my skin than Skinceuticals. I found that the side where I usually apply the Dr.Brenner serum usually gets more red and irritable compared to the Skinceuticals side. However, this only happens when my skin needs a break from Tret, and the irritation usually goes away if I take a break from Tret for a day.\n\n## Final Verdict\n\n[Before Front](https://preview.redd.it/pu2biihlcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fc6d699da9c03071fedefbf839616465bddf31b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Before Skinceuticals](https://preview.redd.it/pbx6am5ncmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8781476d62dbbf083a306021e119563fd226742)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Before Dr. Brenner](https://preview.redd.it/yr2ofgzocmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2be97af34e9328346fb0b41825bf547bce93c3c3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Front](https://preview.redd.it/b6v0kgoqcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c50ddcdda52d39e8b434fe78d1e0147ff35c41b7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Skinceuticals](https://preview.redd.it/wajzo5zrcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cee0f78bdf18dfe3bd284ed2406eb1b08e753b53)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Dr.Brenner](https://preview.redd.it/24ub6lbtcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a7c5406f55dd31b8823a9ff2a62cba875f2ce29)\n\nResults wise, both sides look pretty similar to me, with the Skinceuticals side looking a bit better. However, this could be due to the fact that I just had more acne scarring on the Dr.Brenner side than the Skinceuticals side. Given the fact that I don't think the difference between the two sides is all that large and my experience with them is mostly similar, I would go for the Dr.Brenner serum and probably apply it every other day. However, if you don't have sensitive skin like mine, I still would recommend Dr.Brenner's serum over Skinceuticals. The reason being that I just don't see *that* large of an improvement from Skinceuticals over Dr.Brenner to justify the 8x price tag. The ingredients are also *very* similar, with the only difference being that Dr.Brenner has more hyaluronic acid.",

    "body": "Hello again! You may remember me from my prior post “[A Comprehensive Guide to Hyperpigmentation and How to Treat it.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/13wsdpz/misc_a_comprehensive_guide_to_hyperpigmentation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) I am back again with another comprehensive guide, this time on another skincare concern that I often see in skin-subs which is some version of the question “why do I have **chin/jawline acne** and how do I deal with it?” Now, you may be wondering why I’m choosing to hyper focus on one particular area of the face. You see, our chins are actually very unique environments which results in a really specific type of acne with very specific causes and treatments. Some people will have acne everywhere on their faces and bodies but some people will frustratingly develop persistent acne on just their chins and jaws. This post is specifically intended as a resource for people who find that their primary location of persistent breakouts is on their chin.\n\nAs it so happens, I also suffered from seemingly treatment resistant chin acne and I set out to figure out a way to solve it with years of research, trial and error, testing, talking to dermatologists and professionals, and scouring every medical article I could get my hands on. I wanted to share my findings and research since this is a common concern. I hope this resource is helpful!\n\n**DISCLAIMERS:**\n\n* Acne is an incredibly diverse condition with many causes and treatment courses and will always be unique to the individual struggling with it. While I will do my best to be as thorough as possible in my explanations and recommendations, it’s both possible and likely that I’m not able to detail every circumstance resulting in your personal case. This is meant to be a high level guide to serve as a jumping off point. \n* Speaking about acne requires sensitivity to very real personal implications. This post is not intended to moralize or act as a judgment of anyone struggling with acne. It is not a commentary on anyone’s personal hygiene, hormone profile, lifestyle, or environment. \n* There are a few conditions that can present similarly to acne present on the chin such as rosacea, perioral dermatitis, herpes simplex, allergies and autoimmune conditions, impetigo, hand foot and mouth disease, staph, and others. These will not respond to the same treatments as acne and should be addressed by a medical professional to properly diagnose and create a treatment plan for.\n* Shaving may also cause acne-like legions, but these are the result of irritation and ingrown hairs that also will not respond to the same treatment as acne. I will write a separate post on shaving in the near future to hopefully address these.\n* I do repeat myself a few times in here but that is for people who are skipping around the article. I want to be as thorough as possible even if you're jumping to the parts of the post you need.\n* I do run an online dermatology practice and skin care consultancy, but in order to protect the integrity of my advice, I do not promote my business, I don't give direct medical advice, I don't link to any products/websites, and I don't promote any products I've formulated myself. In spite of this being a heavily researched piece, please bear in mind that it also at its core an opinion piece. I also did not utilize AI for any portion of this post.\n\nThis is going to get long because I wanted to cover everything re:chin and jawline acne. But for your reading pleasure and ease, I have divided this post up so you can get whatever information you need:\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n1. Types of Chin Acne\n2. What Causes Chin Acne aka Why is This Area Unique?\n3. What Exactly is Hormonal Acne and Why Does it Affect My Chin?\n4. How To Treat Chin Acne Part 1: The Ingredients\n5. How to Treat Chin Acne Part 2: The Routine and Recommendations\n6. “I’ve Gone Too Far With the Actives” \n7. Is it Fungal Acne?\n8. Nuclear Options\n\nLet's get to it!\n\n\n\n# 1. Types of Chin Acne\n\n  \nLike acne that appears on other areas of the face and body, chin acne can take a few different forms. Knowing the types of acne breakouts can help you understand the underlying causes and is key to figuring out how to treat them.\n\n**Blackheads:** Blackheads happen when your pores become partially clogged and the trapped debris oxidizes to a dark brown/black color. Because the top of the pore remains open, blackheads are known as “open comedones.”\n\n**Whiteheads:** Whiteheads happen when your pores become clogged all the way through causing a small white bump at the top. Whiteheads are known as “closed comedones” as the pore is completely blocked by debris. These are generally very small.\n\n**Papules:** Papules are raised red bumps that form when oil, dirt or excess skin cells block a pore and mix with bacteria on your skin. This bacterial infection extends into the surrounding skin creating an inflamed legion. Papules do not contain pus, thus they don’t really form a white point like you see with whiteheads or pustules.\n\n**Pustules:** Pustules are raised bumps with a white center surrounded by red, inflamed skin. They’re like the 2.0 version of a whitehead. They form when a pore becomes blocked by oil, dirt, or dead skin cells and gets infected to the point of creating a yellowish/white pus that’s visible under the skin, sometimes coming to a distinct peak. \n\n**Nodules:** Nodular acne occurs very deep within the skin. They can produce red or flesh-colored bumps at the surface, but they frustratingly may not appear to come to a definitive point. They are hard to the touch and are caused when the deepest part of a clogged pore gets infected. Nodular acne feels sore, or like there is a pressure under the skin.\n\n**Cystic:** Cystic acne, also known as acne cysts or blind pimples, are large, painful, pus-filled clogged pores that have become infected. They may not come to a definitive point on the surface and are fairly soft to the touch. They develop deep in the skin but create a red appearance at the surface. Like nodular acne, they often feel like a sore pressure point, but it’s difficult to really see where they are because they don’t form a peak or point, just an amorphous bump. \n\n\n\n# 2. What Causes Chin Acne aka Why is This Area Unique?\n\nThere are a number of factors that can contribute to the formation of chin and jawline acne, but this is a very unique spot which is worth discussing in detail. Generally, acne forms as a the result of a combination of bodily and environmental factors, but the chin and jawline have a few things going on that makes this area particularly interesting.\n\nFirst, I want to quickly discuss what causes acne to form in general:\n\n**Oil Production:** Oil on the skin, also known as sebum is the primary variable in the great equation of acne formation. Oil production is largely influenced by genetics, but it can be triggered by exposure to certain environmental factors. Many types of acne form around sebum that’s produced and then trapped in pores when combined with other things like dead skin cells, bacteria, and dirt. Sebum in an of itself is not bad, in fact it’s essential to maintaining the health of your skin, but preventing it from combining with acne-causing bacteria is key.\n\n**Comedogenic Reactions:** When sebum combines with other gunk, especially stuff that’s non water soluble, pores will sometimes clog. A comedogenic reaction is when a pore becomes blocked as a result of the accumulation of materials that cannot easily be cleared. This can happen with natural “gunk” like dead skin cells and environmental grime, but it can also happen with products that we apply to our skin such as skincare, makeup, SPF, and in some cases our hair products. Side note on this, there isn’t a generally accepted scale of comedogenic reactivity even though there are claims of one existing. Everyone is different, and certain things may trigger a comedogenic reaction in one person but not another. \n\n**Bacteria:** When bacteria enters the picture, clogged pores can go from simply being blocked to infected. This infection will trigger an immune response from the body, usually resulting in inflammation, redness, pain, and in some cases the production of pus. This is the difference between black/whiteheads and pimples/nodules/cysts. \n\n**Genetics:** Your genetics can greatly influence how prone you are to acne, what type, and at what severity. Genetics will predetermine certain aspects of your skin such as: \n\n* The size of your pores and how prone they are to blockage\n* Your natural level of sebum production \n* The rate at which you shed old/dead skin cells and replace them with new ones \n* Your hormonal levels and sensitivity to them\n* If you will have an allergic or inflammatory response when exposed to certain stressors, ingredients, or environmental factors\n\n**Skin Barrier Disruption:** Acne that forms as a result of skin barrier disruption is a form of an inflammatory reaction. Skin barrier disruption can occur when skin is exposed to environmental factors such as extreme heat or cold, dry air, wind, or pollution. It can also occur due to exposure to too many active or drying ingredients such as chemical/manual exfoliants, antioxidants, antiseptics, etc. \n\nExcessive exposure to these environmental factors and/or active ingredients can irritate and inflame the skin, disrupting the pH, triggering an immune reaction that results in pain, redness, and swelling. When the skin barrier is disrupted in this manner, it will often produce excess sebum in an attempt to moisturize the skin and rebalance its pH. During this time, the skin is less able to stave off bacteria and other environmental stressors which often mix with this excess sebum resulting in acne and breakouts. \n\n**Diet:** There is a great deal of controversy as to whether or not diet contributes to acne. It’s possible that foods themselves may cause acne through skin contact (more on that right below) and it’s possible that your body may react in certain ways that can trigger acne when certain foods are consumed, such as an inflammatory response or as a response to something like hormones in dairy products. Whether or not certain foods contribute to acne can be a purely personal experience. There’s no single body of research that can tell us one way or the other, many studies are conflicting, and it’s very difficult to objectively test when everyone’s own experience seems to differ.\n\n**B Vitamin Breakouts:** Now, there isn’t an established clinical consensus on this either, but there’s anecdotal evidence to suggest that certain B vitamins contribute to acne by possibly promoting sebum production. These include things like B12, biotin, and B complexes that can appear in multivitamins and in supplements that are marketed for promoting “hair, skin and nail health.” There’s also no clinical evidence to suggest a direct link between B vitamins and skin/hair/nail health except for the operating theory that in increasing sebum production, they promote healthy development in these areas, but for people who are prone to acne, it also seems to trigger breakouts. This isn’t unique to just the chin area, but it may be worth evaluating your supplements if you’re finding an increase in acne with use of supplements that feature B vitamins. \n\n**Hormones:** This gets its own section….\n\n  \n**But why my chin/jaw** ***specifically*****??**\n\nFor people who struggle with acne on just their chin or jawline, this is a really common question, and the answer is part of the reason I believe it requires a unique approach to treating. Chin acne is the result of two things:\n\n**Gravity and Proximity to Your Mouth:** All the time we spend upright means that stuff on the surface of our skin will migrate downward over the course of the day. Now this is true for other areas of your face, sometimes our hair products migrate down to our foreheads, our eye makeup onto our cheeks. But what makes the chin particularly problematic for acne is not only do we have this drift of face stuff to this area, we also have our mouths. \n\nOur mouths are full of bacteria, and even if you don’t spend all day drooling on yourself, that bacteria can spread downward as a result of talking, laughing, coughing, sneezing, licking our lips, even just normal breathing. *Propionibacterium* *acnes* and *staphylococcus* *epidermidis* are bacteria that can originate in the mouth and migrate outward and downward causing acne legions. To a lesser extent, we also see some bacterial transfer from the hands as the chin/jawline tend to be high touch points.\n\nOur mouths are also where we eat. Even if you’re the most careful eater in the world, many times you’ll get some degree of food debris on your chin. Even though I just mentioned that there’s no general consensus on whether or not diet contributes to acne, it’s possible that the act of putting food in our mouths can; that getting even trace amounts of stuff like grease and sugar on the skin around our mouth can contribute to clogged pores and bacterial proliferation. \n\n\n\n# 3. What Exactly is Hormonal Acne and Why Does it Affect My Chin?\n\nEveryone’s biological processes are dictated in part by the influence of hormones in our system, but the link between hormones and acne isn’t as simple as “I have hormones, *ergo* I have acne.” Understanding the environment in which hormones contribute to the formation of acne can help us with more realistic treatments than just “stop the hormones.”\n\nThe reason hormones cause acne is that androgen hormones (aka male hormones like testosterone, DHEAS, DHEA, and androstenedione) influence the production of sebum in the skin: it increases as they go up, and decreases as they go down. A breakdown of the actual process is as follows:\n\n1. Oil producing sebaceous glands are powerful androgen receptors, producing more sebum when they collect more androgen hormones or convert their precursors. This causes oil production on skin and a build up of that sebum in the pores. \n2. Androgens themselves may also clog pores causing comedones to be formed.\n3. DHEAS is also inflammatory by nature, triggering immune response T cells to show up in and around clogged pores.\n\nThe levels of these androgen hormones can be globally elevated (as is the case with PCOS in females or generally for males with high testosterone naturally or supplemented, hence backne with steroid use) or they can fluctuate. This is why women sometimes breakout during their periods: it’s the downstream effect of elevated androgen hormones in the luteal phase when estrogen and progesterone naturally decrease. \n\nAs mentioned prior, B vitamins can also have this effect by triggering androgen receptors even though they themselves are not androgen hormones or their precursors. \n\nDue to the aforementioned reasons as to why the chin in particular is an area where we find the best ingredients for acne, we can see why increased sebum production from elevated androgens would result in breakouts there. Now, the knee jerk reaction may be to stop or reduce those hormones — and there are ways to do that such as using/stopping birth control pills or other forms of hormone replacement or suppression — but while these may work as an acne treatment, it’s an option you should only discuss with your doctor if appropriate for you.\n\nThere are other ways to address hormonal causes of acne such as the medication spironolactone or spearmint herbal tea. Spiro is a diuretic that’s been proven to block androgen receptors and spearmint is thought to have a similar effect but I have yet to find a study specifically supporting this, at least not to the rigor I would like to recommend this in earnest. \n\nGenerally, for those who either can’t or don’t want to use interventions that affect their hormone profiles or take androgen blocking medications, the most reasonable intervention is to temper the environment in which acne forms on the skin through the use of topicals and skin care. The reason I mention all of this is to pull back the curtain on what exactly “hormonal acne” means so you can address the resulting sebum that’s ultimately forming acne legions. This is where we look at the ingredients specifically proven to address the environment on your skin.\n\n\n\n# 4. How to Treat Chin Acne Part 1: The Ingredients\n\nWhen looking for skincare products to treat and prevent chin and jawline acne, it’s important to look for ingredients that can help encourage skin cell turnover, curb sebum production, kill off acne-causing bacteria, clear clogged pores, and block harmful UV rays. \n\nNow, this is not actually as extensive of a list as you might expect. There are lots of ingredients that target acne, including new and novel ones coming onto the market all the time. I’m choosing to focus on ones that are clinically studied and have the most compelling evidence, ones that have worked the best for myself and people that I’ve worked with, recommendations from dermatologists and formulators, and ones that are more readily accessible. I also find that having a consistent routine that includes proper cleansing is just as important as what you're using, as well as limiting the number of topicals to prevent the dreaded moisture barrier disruption which can have a backfire effect. \n\nThis also isn’t a shopping list. You don’t have to have or use all of these things to treat chin acne, but I’ll get into that in the routine portion. This is more to be used as a tool that can help you diversify your routine if you find one ingredient or another doesn't work for you. And it can help you determine if a product targets acne based on its ingredients. There's lot's of options. Some of the key ingredients to look for include:\n\n**Retinoids** that increases cell turnover. Retinoids like tretinoin, adapalene, retinol et al, can help treat chin and jawline acne by promoting the turnover of skin cells and increasing cell growth, which can help prevent dead skin cells from clogging pores. While retinoids are extremely effective, they do have some caveats. First, they can be sensitizing to a lot of users, but this can be tempered by using different form functions, different application methods, or different concentrations. Second, because it's constantly turning over skin exposing delicate new skin cells to the elements, it can actually worsen acne if you overdo it and damage your skin barrier. Lastly Tretinoin and other retinoids are firewalled behind a prescription in some countries and may be more difficult to obtain. But retinol/al is available in OTC forms.\n\n**Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs)** are water-soluble chemical exfoliants. Solubility of skincare ingredients matters because the natural moisturizer of the skin is our sebum, which is oil. Water-soluble ingredients don’t dissolve in oil, thus they do not penetrate into the pores as deeply. This, however, is not actually a downside, it means that these types of ingredients work on the top layers of the skin which is great for acne. Common AHAs that are used to fight acne include glycolic acid, lactic acid, and mandelic acid. There are numerous others, but these are the most promising and well-researched. Use of AHAs helps breakup and remove dead skin cells which prevents them from clogging pores. And while pore size cannot be reduced, AHAs can help reduce the dilation that happens when pores fill up with gunk.  \n\n**Beta Hydroxy Acid (BHA)** is an oil-soluble chemical exfoliant, the most well known of which is salicylic acid. Remember Stridex pads? Those are salicylic acid! Because BHA is oil-soluble, it dissolves in the skin’s natural sebum which pulls it deeper into the pores. This causes deeper exfoliation which makes this an effective ingredient for combatting deeper forms of acne. The caveat is, since it works in deeper levels, the risk of irritation is higher. But when carefully used especially when featured in cleansers, BHA is a very effective method of treating and preventing acne.\n\n**Azelaic Acid** has both anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties making this one of my all around favorite skincare ingredients due to it’s ability to both kill off acne-causing bacteria as well as reduce redness and acne scarring. It’s also a mild chemical exfoliant that helps strip away dead skin cells much like AHAs and BHAs. It's pretty awesome and available in OTC and prescription strengths.\n\n**Niacinamide or Vitamin B3** is a skin soother that decreases inflammation, but its real power is that it naturally reduces sebum production which can curb acne. It works by inhibiting the enzyme “sebaceous lipase” which is part of the process of oil production in the pores. Ironically, it’s a form of vitamin B3, but unlike ingested B vitamins that might trigger acne, as a topical it actually helps prevent acne. Like AHAs/BHA it can also reduce the dilation of pores which can make them appear smaller. Now, there are some people who are sensitive to niacinamide. I cannot find any studies to support why this may be, or if perhaps people are reacting to other ingredients in products that contain it, but if you find you do not tolerate niacinamide well, it’s best to skip it.\n\n**Benzoyl Peroxide** is an antiseptic which means it makes the environment incredibly inhospitable for bacterial proliferation. Unlike antibiotics that kill bacteria (which can contribute to antibiotic resistance), benzoyl peroxide as an antiseptic simply makes life miserable for bacteria so they fail to thrive and cause acne. Benzoyl peroxide is usually found in two forms, either as a leave-on topical or in face washes. Like many of the other ingredients listed here, it can be sensitizing with overuse, and in the leave-on form, it can sometimes bleach your clothes, but it’s an incredibly effective way to curb the proliferation of bacteria on the chin. It’s also one of the active ingredients in prescription Epiduo or Epiduo forte, which is compounded benzoyl peroxide and the retinoid adapalene. Benzoyl peroxide is generally available in concentrations of 5 and 10%. \n\n**Sulphur** is…. Sulphur. It does a couple things (other than stinking) when applied to treat acne. It helps absorb excess oil, it dries out dead skin cells to make them easier to clear away, it has some antiseptic properties especially against chin-loving *propionibacterium* *acnes*, and it’s also a mild exfoliant. It comes in two forms usually, as a face wash or as a leave-on mask or spot treatment. This can be a good substitute for benzoyl peroxide. Sulphur allergies or sensitivities are common, so it’s important to check for any reactivity you might have.\n\n**SPF** represents a class of many ingredients designed to protect the skin from UV rays and the damage that occurs from exposure. This doesn’t necessarily have an effect on preventing chin acne, but it is necessary to use when using active ingredients to fight acne. Just use it.\n\n\n\n# 5. How to Treat Chin Acne Part 2: The Routine and Recommendations\n\nAlright, let’s get to it. I’m providing two paths to take: a gentler option for more sensitive skin and a heavier-hitting option if your skin is more resilient to actives. But first, irrespective of your skin, there’s one really important part of the routine worth exploring if you suffer with chin and jawline acne which is getting your oral health dialed.\n\nI discovered this accidentally and then was able to later confirm with a dermatologist and dentist that the effect here can be real. A few years ago I decided to do Invisalign and I actually noticed my chin breakouts reduced significantly in part because I was brushing my teeth, flossing, and rinsing with mouthwash as much as 10 times per day depending on how often I was drinking or eating.\n\nNow, you don’t need to be doing that quite as often, but what I’ve found to be effective against chin acne is the following:\n\n**In the morning:**\n\n1. Scrape your tongue using a tongue scraper.\n2. Rinse and gargle with a mouthwash of your choosing and wait 5 or 10 minutes. This is a good time to do your skincare. I personally like CloSYS mouthwash.\n3. Brush your teeth but don’t rinse with water and avoid eating or drinking for a little while.\n\n**Throughout the day:**\n\n1. Keep a little travel bottle of mouthwash with you and if you can, swish a little after anytime you eat or drink (anything that isn’t just plain flat water.) This helps curb some of that bacteria that likes to meander out of your mouth and onto your chin. I have a 3oz refillable bottle that I fill every few days and just keep it in my bag.\n2. If you’re not able to rinse with mouthwash, swish your mouth with plain, flat water after eating or drinking. This helps clear away food/drink residue that oral bacteria proliferate in. \n\n**In the evening:**\n\n1. Scrape your tongue.\n2. Floss, and really get in there. SO many people don’t floss thoroughly enough. Many of the bacteria associated with chin acne are elevated in people with gum disease. \n3. Rinse and gargle with your mouthwash. Wait 5 to 10 minutes, again this is a great time to do your skincare. \n4. Brush your teeth and again, don’t rinse with water after.\n\nIf you can stick with an oral hygiene routine like this, for a lot of people struggling with chin acne, it’s half the battle. And I know it might seem obvious, like “of course I brush my teeth!!!” but adding maintenance steps through the day and *really flossing* are two of the biggest parts that plenty of people fail to do regularly. These are also great steps to take if you f\\*cking hate getting manhandled at the dentist.\n\nNow let’s talk about the actual skincare portion. Since this is targeted, you can apply the actives to just your chin area or your whole face if you would like. It’s up to you. Just be sure you get thorough coverage of your whole face when cleansing, moisturizing, and applying SPF.\n\n\n\n# The Gentle Routine\n\n**AM routine — In order of application following a lukewarm water rinse:**\n\n1: Niacinamide\\*\\*\n\n2: Azelaic acid\n\n3: Moisturizer\n\n4: SPF\n\n\n\n**For Niacinamide,** I have been extremely happy with the Ordinary’s Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%. \\*\\***If you can’t tolerate niacinamide**, you can skip this step and instead use **Effaclar Mat Oil-Free Mattifying Moisturizer from La Roche Posay** as your moisturizer step.\n\n**For Azelaic acid,** Paula's choice Azelaic Acid Booster is the only drugstore one I've really tried after sampling the Ordinary's in-store and not liking the texture. For a semi-RX, Dermatica has both a 15 and 20% “Clarifying Azelaic Acid Cream” which can be purchased directly from their site. \n\n**For Moisturizer,** it’s tempting to go with one formulated for acne or oil control, but I generally recommend a light and sheer moisturizer. I really like Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion (the one for face and body). If you need a niacinamide(B3)-free option Vanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer is a good option.\n\n**For SPF,** I personally like anything from La Roche Posay, any Neutrogena SPF that's not formulated with ethylhexylglycerin as this can be sensitizing for some, Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen, Trader Joe's SPF if you can get your hands on it, and EltaMD. Find one that you like and that you will wear.\n\n\n\n**PM routine: In order of application:**\n\n1: Gentle cleanse\n\n2a: Adapalene (Mon/Wed/Fri, start with 1x per week and build to 3x)\n\n2b: AHA (Sun) \n\n3: Moisturizer  \n\n\n**To Gentle Cleanse**, this is a two-step process. Start with Cetaphil gentle cleanser. This is a gentle, hydrating cleanser that will break up your SPF really effectively. Massage in and rinse. If you need something a little stronger to breakup makeup or more stubborn SPF, Clinique “Take the Day Off” makeup remover is a great alternative. Then massage in a foaming cleanser, I recommend Cetaphil daily cleanser, and rinse.\n\n**For Adapalene**, OTC Differin cream is the one you’re going to want to go with as it’s the easiest prescription-strength retinoid to get without seeing a doctor. Apply a pea-sized amount. Oddly enough, of all the retinoids I’ve tried, my chin acne has responded the most to adapalene. I like to start people at once a week and build to 3 times per week, up to daily if you can tolerate it. If you’re using the AHA next step though, keep at least one day adapalene-free so you can also have an exfoliation day.\n\n**For AHA,** the one I like to go with that provides gentle, yet effective exfoliation is lactic acid. Lactic acid also binds to water which makes it a really good hydrating ingredient as well. The Ordinary’s Lactic Acid + HA in either 5 or 10% is a good one.   \n\n\n# The Heavier-Hitting Routine\n\n**AM routine — This will be the same as the AM portion of the gentle routine, no need to go crazy. Pop back up there for that.**\n\n**PM routine: In order of application:**\n\n1: Benzoyl peroxide cleanse\n\n2a: Adapalene (Mon/Wed/Fri, start with 1x per week and build to 3x)\n\n2b: BHA (Sun)\n\n3: Moisturizer\n\n\n\nThis might not seem terribly different from the Gentle Routine, but both benzoyl peroxide cleansing and the introduction of a BHA can be particularly a\\*s kicking if your skin isn’t ready for it.\n\n**For Benzoyl Peroxide Cleanser,** first you will do a gentle cleanse with Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser to breakup your SPF and do a first pass on your skin. Massage in and rinse completely, then follow with Differin Daily Deep Cleanser. Depending on your tolerance, you can rinse this off right after massaging into skin, or you can let it sit for a few minutes (3 at the most) before rinsing. If you find your skin getting really irritated by this, switch to the gentle routine. \n\n**For Adapalene**, OTC Differin cream will work here, just like in the gentle routine.\n\n**For a BHA**, also called salicylic acid, there are a couple options I like. Paula’s Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant or the Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Solution are great options. This can be very sensitizing though, especially in a routine that includes a retinoid so only use once or twice per week and not on the same night as your adapalene.\n\n\n\n# 6. Is it Fungal Acne?\n\nIf the routines don’t seem to be working for you, it’s possible that you may have fungal acne. Fungal acne can show up on your chin for the same reason regular acne can, except instead of being cause by bacteria, it’s caused by an overgrowth of yeast. Fungal acne can have a distinct appearance, it’s similar to whiteheads/closed comedones with small, clustered white or flesh colored bumps, and it might not appear as red and inflamed as pustules/papules. There is some controversy as to whether or not fungal acne is a thing (mostly as a matter of semantics, it’s not technically a form of *Acne vulgaris*, rather *Pityrosporum folliculitis* or *Malassezia folliculitis*), but if you’re not successful with the routines above and you can rule out other medical conditions, it may be worth treating your case like fungal acne.\n\nThe solution to this is a simple one: cleanse your face with an antidandruff shampoo a few times per week —Head and Shoulder, Selsun Blue, Nizoral are great ones. Let it sit on your skin for a few minutes before rinsing, then top with a basic moisturizer. If you have a combination of fungal and regular acne, you can do this as your cleansing step a few times per week with the rest of the steps in the routine. If you just have fungal acne, you can literally just do this and follow with your moisturizer and SPF during the day. If it persists, talk to your doctor about a prescription anti-fungal.\n\n\n\n# 7. “I’ve Gone Too Far With the Actives” \n\nIt’s tempting to go nuts with the actives in an attempt to quickly stave off chin acne, but this can cause severe irritation that can actually contribute to more breakouts. The skin cell turnover cycle is about 30 days which means that it will generally take a few weeks to start seeing improvements with a new routine. Most people will know if a routine is working within 3 to 6 months, but a quick way to know if it’s not working because you’ve overdone it is if you experience a damaged moisture barrier which can happen as quickly as within a few days.\n\nA damaged moisture barrier is an injury to the skin that can be caused by using too many actives and is akin to a chemical burn. There are a few telltale ways to know if this is happened: first, the skin will have a really distinct feel. It will feel tight and dry, but confusingly, it may be very oily at the same time. It may also appear red and inflamed, it may peel or appear to crack, and it may burn, itch, or sting even when you apply inert topicals like a basic moisturizer. \n\nThe confounding thing is that in this state, your skin will produce more oil to try to calm everything down, but because the immune system is working on healing the damaged skin, it’s less able to stave off acne causing bacteria. So not only are you very uncomfortable and inflamed, you’re also probably going to have more breakouts. Healing acne means striking a gentle balance with your actives, but if you find that you have disrupted your moisture barrier, you should pull everything back until it stabilizes. \n\nI recommend dropping your routine down to absolute basics: In the morning, rinse with lukewarm water, use a gentle moisturizer like Cetaphil or Vanicream, and top with SPF. In the evening, double cleanse with Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser and then Cetaphil Daily Cleanser, then top with your moisturizer and/or an occlusive like Vaseline or La Roche Posay Cicaplast Balm. Stick with this until your skin feels normal again, and if you want, very slowly reintroduce your actives, or switch some of the recommended products for others that I’ve mentioned to see if there’s something else you get along with.\n\n\n\n# 8. Nuclear Options\n\nIn general, I recommend trying OTC and drugstore topical solutions for any skin concern before heading down the dermatology route. Part of this is because you can usually put a good dent in what you're struggling with by using OTC topicals, making in-office RX treatments easier and more effective. Generally, a doctor will be able to prescribe prescription-strength versions of many of the things I’ve already listed, or they will add oral medications. But by doing as much as you can with drugstore products AND ensuring you can stick with a consistent routine, you can make the most of your continued work with a dermatology.\n\nSide note: I haven't listed every possible compounded medication because there are a lot, and many compounded meds are formulated to tackle multiple issues. I also tend to favor single note skin care (aka, products with very few ingredients) as this allows you to combine or remove certain actives and gives you a better sense of reactivity. \n\nThis list also doesn’t include hormone-related treatments. If you believe a hormonal intervention is right for you, it’s best to talk to your doctor specifically about your individual needs. \n\nFor tougher-to-treat chin acne, if your topical routine doesn't totally clear the problem in 6 to 8 months, a visit to the dermatologist might be helpful. Here are the heavier-hitting topicals and medications to discuss with a dermatologist that can go the extra mile after you've exhausted other options.\n\n*This does not constitute medical advice, it is intended to act as a guide for you to discuss with your dermatologist or medical provider.*\n\n**Medical Grade Peels:** Medical grade chemical peels can be done in dermatology offices. High concentration BHA or AHA peels are also commonly used for acne. Because of the strength of the acids used, these must be done by a medical professional with careful followup. I recommend this over seeing an esthetician for peels. \n\n**Tretinoin and Prescription Retinoids:** This is going to be dependent on what part of the world you're in, but in a lot of countries, tretinoin and its counterparts like tazarotene are only available through prescription. These would be used in place of the OTC adapalene I mentioned in the routine if prescribed by your provider. There is a stronger prescription-strength adapalene as well as a compounded medication called Epiduo or Epiduo Forte, which combines adapalene with Benzoyl Peroxide. You should be mindful that it can bleach clothes and sheets if you are prescribed it. Aside from the ones already mentioned, common forms of prescription retinoids include: Altreno, Tazorac, Fabior, and Trifarotene (Aklief). They vary wildly in cost in availability so I recommend asking to start with generic options first before asking your doctor for brandname acne medication.\n\n**Prescription Azelaic Acid:** This is another one that's available in lower concentrations over-the-counter (which can still be quite effective) but there are prescription strength grades of azelaic acid such as Finacea and Azelex. This is usually reserved for rosacea treatment as it tends to target redness and flushing, but it can also be an effective acne treatment for its antiseptic properties.\n\n**Topical Antibiotics:** Topical erythromycin and clindamycin can be helpful in killing off acne causing bacteria but you need to be careful of developing antibiotic resistance. I am of the opinion that a topical antibiotic course should not exceed 90 days, but your doctor will know better based on your case. It may be helpful however to ask your doctor exactly how long you should be on a topical antibiotic, how you will know if it’s working, if they have a plan for you to gradually wean off of it, and what their recommendation for replacement would be after you have finished your course. Typically, a doctor will transition you to a topical retinoid or other medication following an antibiotic course. It’s good to have a clear plan prior to starting a topical antibiotic.\n\n**Oral Antibiotics:** Tetracycline antibiotics like doxycycline and minocycline are sometimes prescribed for severe acne cases and are usually the last line of defense before the ultimate treatment which I will get into next. It’s generally recommended to exhaust all other possible topical treatments before turning to this sort of intervention as oral antibiotics can have numerous side effect (such as hyperpigmentation, nausea, severe photo reactivity) and can also contribute to systemic antibiotic resistance. However, short (1 to 3 months) or infrequence courses of oral antibiotics can be effective in treating acne and helping prevent the repopulation of acne-causing bacteria. Like topical antibiotics, it’s important to have a clear plan with your doctor to understand how long you will be on it, how you will know if it’s working, and what you will transition to using after the course is finished. Having a routine to support an oral antibiotic is key to longterm success even after your course is finished.\n\n**Oral Tretinoin:** Also called isotretinoin or accutane, this is the true nuclear option for acne, chin or otherwise. Like its topical counterpart, oral tretinoin works by increasing skin cell turnover. Generally, it’s only used in severe cases as the courses are often long, fraught with side effects, and require lifestyle adjustments such as abstinence from alcohol and regular blood draws for liver enzyme and cholesterol monitoring. However for many people, the side effects are minimal, and the reduction in acne often outweighs the temporary discomfort of the treatment course. Many people can go years or even the rest of their lives without a severe reoccurrence of acne following an oral tretinoin course. \n\n—\n\n**If you made it this far, congratulations! This concludes my comprehensive guide on chin acne. I hope this information is helpful. While it is extensive and based on massive amount of research, experience, experimentation and work with professionals, it may not be perfect and it may not be suitable for everyone. Feel free to offer any constructive criticism or ask any questions in comments. I am always open to expanding my understanding.**",

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

The packaging is very sleek hard plastic and the wording is imprinted on the outside-they say this is to make it easier to recycle and save from extra plastic labeling. I have also used the gel cream and this is really night and day and not comparable at all imo. It comes in a pump bottle and pumps about a pea size each. I use 2 pumps for my whole face and neck. I struggle with very dry skin that is dry in the morning if I don’t use a very thick moisturizer at night. This keeps my face dewy and moist all night. It’s not thick like a shea butter cream and it spreads very easily. It smells exactly like oats like if you get a handful of ground oats and smell it, that’s what this smells like. It leaves a nice glow but not a greasy finish. My hair doesn’t stick to my face when I use this if that makes sense. It’s a great price point the bottle is bigger than it looks the photos. \n\nThis is my first time doing a review so let me know if I missed something and I’m also happy to answer any questions!",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

    "body": "Panibagong sunscreen naman ang irereview ko. Ito ay yung SunProfessional Sunscreen with Orgasol Caresse ng Brilliant Skin Essentials. Yung white ang binili ko, since hindi ako gumagamit ng tinted sunscreens for personal use. Na-curious ako sa sunscreen na ito kasi ito yung first time kong makakita ng product kung saan hindi active ingredient ang main focus. Perfect chance din ito para magkaroon ako ng idea sa performance ng Orgasol Caresse na raw material, na di ko na kinakailangang i-source out yung mismong material at ipadala sa lab. For context, ang Orgasol Caresse kasi ay isang spheroidal powder na may oil-absorption capacity at nakakapagbigay ng powdery finish, lalo na sa mga products kagaya ng sunscreen (more on this later sa ingredients portion). Naubos ko na itong nabili ko, kaya naisipan ko na ding gawan ito ng review. \n\nUnang kapansin-pansin sa product na ito ay yung primary packaging nitong bote na hugis itlog. Infairness sa brand, pina IPO pa nila ito, at nakita ko mismo sa IG nung brand owner yung specs at design ng boteng ito. Magandang to laban sa counterfeiting, since laganap to ngayon both sa local at international brands. Maganda din ang pagkakaprint ng text sa bote, hindi nag-i-smudge kahit basa ang kamay ng tubig, pawis, or nung mismong product. \n\nNgayon naman, sa actual use. Itong sunscreen na ito ay isang opaque white na gel cream, na hindi ganoon kadaling mag-break down when in contact sa daliri o kamay. For context, may mga nasubukan na akong sunscreen na upon contact sa skin e nag-be-break na agad yung emulsion. Ito kadalasan yung sinasabi nung mga users na nagiging matubig or runny yung sunscreen kapag ginagamit nila. Scented itong sunscreen ba ito, pero hindi ganoon kalakas (for me) na tipong nakakasura. Sakto lang para ma-mask yung odor ng base formula. \n\nMadaling i-blend itong sunscreen na ito sa balat, and sa ilang saglit lang e nagseset na ito kaagad. Wala akong white cast na na-observe dito nung ginagamit ko. Aside sa blendability at absence ng white cast, may na-appreciate ako dito sa product na ito. May cooling effect sa balat, sakto sa mainit na panahon natin. Yung cooling effect nito ay hindi ganun katindi to the point na may stinging, subtle cooling effect lang. Kapag natuyo at nagset na sa balat itong sunscreen, dun ko naramdaman yung effect ng Orgasol Caresse na powdery feel nung hinaplos ko yung face ko. Matte ang naging finish nito sa akin, so in my opinion, ok to sa mga oily to combination skin na users. Wala din akong na-observe na pilling sa duration ng paggamit ko nitong sunscreen. Wala din akong naramdaman na stinging o hapdi sa balat nung ginagamit ko ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo sa ingredients. Ito ang ingredient list:\n\nWater, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, Butylene Glycol, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Nylon-6/12, Polyacrylamide, C13-15 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethicone, Green Tea (Camellia Sinensis) Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Cucumber (Cucumis Sativus) Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sunflower (Helianthus Annuus) Seed Oil, Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Leaf Extract, Fragrance, Menthyl Lactate, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA\n\nMay apat na UV filters itong sunscreen na ito:\n\nEthylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (UVB) \nButyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane (UVA) \nOctocrylene (UVB) \nTitanium Dioxide (UVB) \n\nMay slight concern lang ako sa titanium dioxide na ginamit. Sunscreen-grade na titanium dioxide is usually coated with either aluminum hydroxide or silica. Mahalaga ang coating na yan for titanium dioxide dahil pinipigil ng mga coating na ito ang formation ng reactive oxygen species (ROS) kapag tinamaan ng UV ang Titanium Dioxide. Kahit coating yan, dapat isama pa din yan sa ingredient list. \nFor more information sa function ng aluminum hydroxide, pakitingnan na lang sa link below:\nhttps://incidecoder.com/ingredients/aluminum-hydroxide\nPara naman sa silica,  please see link below:\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925838810020128\n\nOk naman ang preservative system, since Phenoxyethanol at Ethylhexylglycerin ang ginamit, common preservative system na ginagamit ng mga brands na averse sa parabens. \n\nTingnan naman natin yung Nylon-6/12. Yan yung INCI name ng Orgasol Caresse. Yan ung nagbibigay nung mga skinfeel benefit at oil-control dito sa sunscreen na ito. Comparable itong ingredient na ito sa Silica at sa Polymethylsilsesquioxane (PMSQ), na kapareho nitong nagbibigay ng powdery after feel at oil-control benefit. \n\nAnother noteworthy na ingredient sa sunscreen na ito ay yung Menthyl Lactate. Ito yung nagbibigay sa sunscreen na ito ng subtle cooling effect sa skin during use. Related ito sa Menthol, ang kadalasang ginagamit na ingredient for cooling benefit. \n\nAng next comment ko sa ingredients nitong product na ito ay para sa mga cosmetic chemist at regulatory personnel na in-charge sa paggawa at pag-check ng IL. Sa product na ito, hindi na-take into consideration yung % composition nung mga raw materials na existing as blends or premixes. For example, sa UV filter, ang ginamit na raw material dito is SUNCAT MTA, isang raw material premix. Ang composition nitong raw material blend na ito ay yung first 6 ingredients na makikita nyo sa IL nitong product na ito. Kung ite-take into account yung % ng each component ng SUNCAT MTA, hindi dapat magkakatabi yung anim na yan, meron jan na dapat nasa ibabang part ng IL. This is the same din sa emulsifier system at preservative system na ginamit dito, hindi advisable na magkakatabi yan, since premix yung ginamit. Ngayon, bakit ko ito pinuna? Dahil pinapadali nito ang paggaya sa product nyo ng mga competitors nyo. So para dun sa brand, kung ayaw nyo magaya kaagad ng iba yung product nyo, please consider taking into account yung % composition nung mga mixture ingredients nyo para mapwesto ng maayos sa IL. \n\nPunta naman tayo sa product claims. Simple at straight forward ng claims nitong product na ito, base sa label. \n1. With Orgasol Caresse\n2. Broad Spectrum SPF 50 PA++++ UVA-UVB Protection\n\nClaim #1, napatunayan na natin yan sa ingredient list, Orgasol Caresse = Nylon-6/12.\n\nClaim #2, hindi ko alam kung nai-post na ba ng brand owner sa kanyang soc med yung SPF Test report. Yung brand owner na makakasagot nito. \n\nMay isang bagay lang akong napansin sa box nito. Hindi nakalagay yung mandatory warning statement, according sa ASEAN Sunscreen Labeling Guideline:\nDo not stay too long in the sun, even while using a sunscreen product. \nDapat lang talaga na ilagay ito sa label ng mga sunscreen product dahil madalas na nakakalimutan ng mga consumer na hindi advisable na magbabad sa ilalim ng sikat ng araw kahit pa na naka sunscreen. Once na mahulas yang sunscreen na gamit mo, masusunog at masusunog ang balat mo jan. \n\nFinal words regarding this sunscreen:\nAside dun sa mga comments ko regarding sa improvement ng ingredient list, absence ng mandatory warning statement, pati na sa non-inclusion ng ginamit na coating agents para sa titanium dioxide sa IL, ok naman itong sunscreen na ito overall. Good aesthetics, good formula, straight forward product claims na wala ng kuskos balungos. \n\nAyun lang, maraming salamat sa pagbabasa ng review na ito. \n",

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens® B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70. With all the fragrance ingredients lie Limonene, Grapefruit Oil and Lavender Oil it's best to skip this product.\n* Water, Glycerine, Dicaprylylcarbonaat, Isoamyl Lauraat, Cyclopentasiloxaan, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Boter, Shea Butter Cetyl Esters, Triheptanoin, **Tocoferol, Phenoxyethanol,** Behenyl Alcohol, Methylpropaandiol, Glycerylstearaatcitraat, Polysorbaat 20, Natriumacrylaten Copolymeer, **Retinol,** Glycerylstearaat , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Limonene, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, etc...\n\n**Fourth example, Sunday Riley A+ High Dose 6.5% Retinoid :**\n\n* Claim: 5% retinoid ester, 1% liposomal-encapsulated retinol, 0.5% blue-green algea\n* Probably the 5% refers to Granactive Retinoid, you can't use 50% of this, so that means there's 0.5% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens® B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well. Otherwise some options below. \n\n* UK: Dermatica - \"otc\" tretinoin\n\n* US: Curology - \"otc\" tretinoin or Adapalene\n\n* [Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-1pct-retinol-treatment/801.html) - $58/30mL\n\n* [Avene RetrinAl 0.1% Retinaldehyde](https://www.aveneusa.com/retrinal-intensive-cream) - $70/30mL\n\n* [Geek&Gorgeous 0.05% Retinaldehyde](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) $13.50/30mL",

        "body": "So I was looking into [Physiogel Calming Relief AI cream](https://incidecoder.com/products/physiogel-calming-relief-ai-cream) in more depth, and I'm so confused about the ingredient Palmitamide MEA aka PEA aka Palmitoylethanolamide. Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

They don't always appear as \"ceramide \\_\\_\", there are other names for them, such as:\n\nHydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, Myristoyl/​Palmitoyl Oxostearamide/​Arachamide MEA, Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide, Hydroxypalmitoyl Sphinganine, [Safflower Oil/​Palm Oil Aminopropanediol Esters](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/safflower-oil-palm-oil-aminopropanediol-esters), etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo today I wanted to make a list of products that are easily overlooked when searching for ceramide skincare, because many people are only looking for the word \"ceramide\".

The only time HA is good is if you have a special event or a wedding where you only need to have your skin look plumped and it's best for only a few hours but it's definitely something you do not want to eat everyday!!!

Minimalist had used same formulation and just changed active. Basically 3 formulas --> 10 products. I had shared this is my stories \\[@avaale\\_\\]. Purely because I found it interesting. [Reproducing those stories here](https://imgur.com/a/rBAGL2Q), if you'd like to take a look.\n\nToday I decided to take a deeper look at the products, since I was getting comments like 'are you trying to say these products are useless?'.  And I had too cursory an examination to be comfortable saying it's good or bad. The Minimalist had outdone themselves with transparency and even mentioned supplier details, for every main active. (Not being sarcastic, I'm genuinely in awe, that they did this, while have the Indian skincare world refuses to declare full list of ingredients).\n\nStarted with\n\n# Vitamin C 20% (SAP) + Ferulic Acid\n\nThey had sourced the SAP from [BASF.](https://www.basf.com/in/en.html) Searching for details on their SAP, I found [this.](http://www.dr-baumann-international.co.uk/science/BASF%20Vitamin%20C.pdf) The technical information sheet for SAP from BASF itself.\n\nA few things stand out.\n\n* The technical info sheet says SAP is **most stable at pH values above 6.5.** [Pubchem compound summary](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Sodium-ascorbate) agrees.  **However the Minimalist site claims that the product is at a pH of 3.5**\n* Now according to the same BASF technical sheet, at pH 3 (details on 3.5 was not provided) , stability falls from 100 to 10 in 60 days. Where as from PH 5 to 7 stability wavers at 90 to 100 till 120 days. Stability at various pHs were tested at 40C\n* Next the ferulic acid. LAA which is a highly unstable form of Vitamin C is usually formulated with ferulic acid to increase stability. All studies I found tested LAA & ferulic acid  [\\[1\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16185284/), [\\[2\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4536008/), [\\[3\\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18603326/).  But Ferulic acid as an ingredient does have anti-oxidant properties and is a effective scavenger of free radicals, which could be a reason it was added. Just looking at ferulic acid, [this article](https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/491755) states that it penetrates the stratum corneum in at both pH 3 as well 7.2. So it should still work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Salicylic Acid 2%\n\nFrom the site *\"Formulated with* [Curcylic 40](https://www.vantagegrp.com/en-US/Product/Page/ea60363a-7c2a-4907-b245-a763f0475c50/Curcylic-40) *(SA) based on advanced pre-solubilized technology from* [Vantage](https://www.vantagegrp.com/webforward/home)*, US, a global natural chemistry company\"*\n\nNow the INCI name for [Curcylic 40](https://www.cosmeticingredients.co.uk/ingredient/curcylic%C2%AE-40) is Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine & Salicylic acid. As u/Aayu07 pointed out in her Insta stories \"Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine\" part is not mentioned [in the Minimalist website](https://beminimalist.co/products/salicylic-acid-2) at all. I assume they're writing the whole thing SA.\n\nIf you check out [Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-dimethylamine) in Incidecoder.  It not only talks about [Curcylic 40](http://www.lipochemicals.com/products/curcylic-40), but also rather helpfully shows us other products with this ingredient, one of which happens to be [The Ordinary Salicylic 2%](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-salicylic-acid-2-solution) & [The Ordinary Aha 30% + Bha 2% Peeling Solution](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-aha-30-bha-2-peeling-solution-2).  The ordinary does mention [Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-dimethylamine) in [their ingredients list](https://theordinary.deciem.com/product/rdn-salicylic-acid-2pct-solution-30ml?_ga=2.87650074.34031488.1600610763-39495863.1600610763) by the way. So for[2%, they basically have 5%](https://www.theformulary.co.uk/product/curcylic-40-water-soluble-salicylic-acid/) Curcylic 40 and pH is supposed to be between 3 and 8.  But pH of this product is not mentioned on the minimalist site.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Retinol 2%\n\nFrom the site *\"Contains top quality Granactive Retinoid sourced from* [Grant Industries](https://www.grantinc.com/)*, USA, A leading global supplier in skincare\"*\n\nThe granactive retinoid, they're sourcing from Grant has the [iNCI name Dimethyl Isosorbide (and) Hydroxyp­inacolone Retinoate](https://cdn.thomasnet.com/ccp/00654679/98240.pdf). Which they've split up, maybe due to percentages of concentration. The ordinary did this too.\n\nI found this [list of actives and briefs about them](https://cdn.thomasnet.com/ccp/00654679/98240.pdf) from Grant Industries. Where they mention [these results.](https://imgur.com/Pf6meSk.jpg)\n\n[INCI Decoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxypinacolone-retinoate) also provides a summary of the ingredient itself and results from manufacturer's tests and results from Estee Lauder comparitive in-vitro study between Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, [tretinoin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tretinoin), good old [retinol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/retinol) and [retinyl palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/retinyl-palmitate) in collagen boosting effectiveness.\n\nTheir bottomline \"*We are really happy to see some innovation happening with retinoids, and we think* ***Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate is a super promising rising star, but it’s not fully proven yet.*** *If you are someone who likes to experiment and try out the newest things, grab your running shoes and try some HPR containing serum now (see product list below :)). If you like the tried and true, however, stick to* [*retinol*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/retinol) *and* [*tretinoin*](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tretinoin) *for now and re-examine the question in a couple of years when (hopefully) more research will be available. \"*\n\nManufacturer recommends [upper limit use of 1%](https://imgur.com/Pf6meSk.jpg). This is where retinol comes in I'm guessing. For the other 1% or more. This is the same combination The ordinary uses in their [Granactive retinoid 2% emulsion](https://theordinary.deciem.com/product/rdn-advanced-retinoid-2pct-30ml).\n\nAlso the other products using this ingredient in Incidecoder is a who's who of brands.\n\n* Sunday Riley A+ High Dose Retinoid Serum\n* Peter Thomas RothProfessional Strength 3% Retinoid Plus\n* Dr. Sam Bunting SkincareFlawless Nightly Serum\n* The Inkey List  Retinol Serum\n* And even surprisingly [Revolution Skincare](https://incidecoder.com/brands/revolution-skincare)Skin Tone Correcting Serum – Granactive Retinoid 2%\n* and much much more.\n\nThe [science behind this product](https://beminimalist.co/products/retinol-2) on the Minimalist website, speaks pretty much only about the granactive retinoid, even though the product is called Retinol 2%. Retinol and Retinoic acid esters are not the same and don't work exactly the same way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Niacinamide 10% + Zinc\n\nFrom the site *\"Formulated with Niacinamide USP Grade (US Pharmacopeia approved) by* [Lonza, Switzerland](https://www.lonza.com/)*, a leading global supplier of Vitamin B3 for over 40 years\"*\n\n[Lonza is definitely big into Niacinamide](https://www.efeedlink.com/search/?q=lonza&q=lonza), and a well known legit supplier.\n\nBut onto more relevant information, I did find this [data sheet from Lonza](https://dermagist.com/shop/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/niacinamide-sheet.pdf) with briefs on a few efficacy studies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Hyaluronic Acid 2% + Vitamin B5\n\nFrom the site *\"The key ingredient is sourced from* [Royal DSM, Netherlands](https://www.dsm.com/corporate/home.html)*; a global science-based company ranked in Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations 2020\"*\n\nBare bones [Data Sheet of Hyaluronic Acid](https://www.essence-plus.com/essence-plus689/program_download/good/201611081542182368.pdf) from manufacturer.\n\nBare bones [Data sheet of Panthenol,](http://technicaldocuments.dsm.com/product_finder/technical_documents/DNP/level10/DNP_DNPNA_000000000000413852_PDS_en.pdf?&&ACSew=ApplicationDataSheet) from Royal DSM. But I'm not sure if they're sourcing this from them too. One thing though, if they're sourcing ingredient from here pH of 5% solution in water is 9 to 10.5. Now the panthenol is probably lesser than 2% since hyaluronic acid is listed first (this is an assumption since Indian companies don't really care about listing in order of %).\n\nI'm not sure how relevant this is but pH of hyaluronic acid is 6 to 7 according to the data sheet. Panthenol is 9 to 10.5. This is a serum that I originally assumed for pH balanced. But the [incidecoder](https://imgur.com/VgOAZJ1.jpg) lists no [buffering](https://incidecoder.com/ingredient-functions/buffering) agent. [Skincarisma](http://www.skincarisma.com/products/analyze?utf8=%E2%9C%93&product%5Bingredient%5D=Aloe+Vera+Juice%2C+Dimethyl+Isosorbide%2C+Sodium+Hyaluronate%2C+Propanediol%2C+Ethoxydiglycol%2C+Panthenol%2C+Phenoxyethanol%2C+Pullulan%2C+Ethylhexylglycerin%2C+Hydroxyethylcellulose%2C+Xanthan+Gum%2C+Sclerotium+Gum%2C+Trisodium+Ethylenediamine+Disuccinate%2C+Lecithin) doesn't mention a pH adjuster either. So I'm very curious to see what the actual pH of this product.\n\n**Disclaimer: I'm not a cosmetic formulator and while I roughly know ingredient purposes, I've no idea how all the ingredients would interact with each other and affect the pH. Which why I started this with 'I'm not sure, how relevant this is'.**\n\nI did ask a friend who purchased this product to check pH and if or when she gets back to me, I'll update this accordingly.\n\nAlso while the science behind the products had this to say *'Not all topical Hyaluronic acid serums are equally effective as the molecular size of HA determines the depth of its delivery in the skin. The smaller the molecule size, the deeper it penetrates the dermis. Larger-molecule size HA stays at the epidermis and provides surface hydration only.'*  The data sheet attached above mentions a molecular mass of 1.6 MDa. This is [middle molecular weight](https://www.nayaglow.com/2019/04/30/hyaluronic-acid-explained/).\n\nSo is this inherently bad? Not necessarily, as ecowell explains in detail in [this post.](https://www.theecowell.com/blog/hyaluronicacid) All sources are cited. Also [this](https://madridge.org/journal-of-chemistry-and-research/ijcr-1000103.pdf).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Lactic Acid 10% + Hyaluronic Acid 2%\n\nFrom the site \"*Formulated with natural and pure ingredients sourced from leading global suppliers such as* [Corbion](http://www.corbion.com/) *and Royal DSM, Netherlands\"*\n\nI think we can safely assume that HA in this product is sourced from Royal DSM. And I've already gone in-depth into it above. So directly onto, lactic acid. And we have the data sheet [here](https://www.corbion.com/static/downloads/datasheets/56pdf/pds-purac%20hs%2088%20(0406).pdf). Nothing that alarms me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kojic Acid 2% + Alpha Arbutin 1%\n\nFrom the site *\"Formulated with the most stable form of kojic acid, Kojic Dipalmitate, sourced from* [Alpha Environmental](https://www.alpha-environmental.com/)*, USA, a leading global supplier\"*\n\nI found nothing. Zilch. Not even a info page on their own site. Just a [listing](https://www.alpha-environmental.com/products.html) that shows they sell both Kojic Acid Dipalmitate as well as Alpha arbutin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# AHA 30% + BHA 2%\n\nFrom the site \" *All ingredients are sourced from leading global suppliers such as Fortune 500 Chemours Company, USA, and Vantage, US\"*\n\nSince we already BHA is [Curcylic 40](https://www.cosmeticingredients.co.uk/ingredient/curcylic%C2%AE-40) ie Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine & Salicylic acid, and it's been analysed above, I'm moving on the AHAs.\n\nChemours offers a variety of [Glycolic Acid products](https://www.chemours.com/en/brands-and-products/glycolic-acid) for different purposes. Their [Glypure TM](https://www.chemours.com/en/-/media/files/glycolic-acid/glypure-cosmetic-grade-glycolic-acid-brochure.pdf) range which comes in 3 variants are our best bet and Glypure GL which is glycolide, the cyclic diester of glycolic acid. I found a lot of information\n\n* [Technical Spec](https://www.chemours.com/en/-/media/files/glycolic-acid/glypure-70-spec-sheet.pdf) and [Material Safety Data Sheet](https://www.3eonline.com/ImageServer/ImageViewer.aspx?id=3Q%2FfAR8ne%2FvPh6syVnSymkS%2BBDo8OjmbVocxRCMEgeH9DOXp3rOno2bBstgZQVl6ddB5zxzJXIW7nbmF5mKrdg%3D%3D) for Glypure 70\n* [Technical Spec](https://cms.chempoint.com/ChemPoint/media/ChemPointSiteMedia/PDF%20Docs/C-10269_Glypure_99_specsheet_1.pdf) and a [2017 MSDS](https://cms.chempoint.com/ChemPoint/media/ChemPointSiteMedia/PDF%20Docs/Glypure-99-SDS-_1.pdf) for Glypure 99\n* [Product Information](https://www.in-cosmetics.com/__novadocuments/670288?v=637172315377900000) of Glypure GL\n* [Brochure](https://www.chemours.com/en/-/media/files/glycolic-acid/glypure-glycolic-acid-sell-sheet.pdf) with manufacturer studies and much more that I'm not adding here.\n\nHowever very little on Glypure™ Preneutralized which I feel is the actual product used. All we know about this is \"• Pre-neutralized Glypure™ is an aqueous solution neutralized with ammonium hydroxide. It is available in a variety of pH levels—2.25, 3.25, 3.8, 4.0, 4.4—as well as custom pH.\"\n\nIncase I'm mistaken I'm leaving other info attached above.\n\nLogically lactic is probably from [Corbion](http://www.corbion.com/) (which is not mentioned) and BHA from [Vantage](https://www.vantagegrp.com/webforward/home), which is mentioned.\n\nI found no mention of mandelic acid in both Chemours and Vantage's sites. I've no clue where it's sourced from.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Apple Cider Vinegar 2% + Glycolic Acid 10%\n\nFrom the site \"*It is formulated with high-grade ingredients sourced from a Fortune 500 company, Chemours, USA\"*\n\nThis obviously refers to Glycolic Acid as discussed above. No idea about source of ACV.\n\nBut Neemli and Minimalist, 2 brands recently picked this combo to formulate products with. So I had a cursory glance at studies and found [this one study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31328306/) where \"*A total of 22 subjects (11 AD and 11 healthy controls) were enrolled. Subjects soaked both of their forearms for 14 days, with one arm in dilute ACV (0.5% acetic acid) and the other in water 10 minutes daily. Transepidermal water loss and pH were measured pre- and post-treatment*.\" Conclusion: Dilute ACV soaks have no significant effect on skin barrier integrity but caused skin irritation in a majority of subjects.\n\nNeemli's site did mention this *\"A natural astringent, Apple Cider Vinegar helps increase the blood flow to the skin, minimizing the appearance of pores. It also helps balance the skin’s pH to keep it functioning optimally and fighting acne-causing bacteria.\"* as the reason it was added.\n\nI'll have to look into this deeper later, but for now, this combination baffles me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Benzoyl Peroxide 2% + Glycolic Acid 5%\n\nFrom the site *\"Contains top quality ingredients sourced from Vantage Specialty, USA, ranked in the top 30% of the most sustainable companies in the world by EcoVadis\"*\n\nAnd we're back to Vantage. Glycolic Acid has to be from Chemours. so the BP is from Vantage.\n\nVantage markets BP as [Curoxyl 42](https://www.vantagegrp.com/en-US/Product/Page/65ea0c11-a095-463f-a102-a19ccd2ae9bb/Curoxyl-42). The INCI name is Aqua & Benzoyl peroxide. Found the [brochure](https://pdfhost.io/v/lWMc.doh5_PowerPoint_Presentation.pdf) and I find this product quite intriguing since they claim that it's a *\"aqueous based, micronized benzoyl peroxide dispersion (40%) in the form of a gel that can replace traditional BPO due to its low irritation profile\"* while normally I find BP quite irritating.\n\nNo mention of pH on the site, while Bp is supposedly 4.8 to 6.6. And glycolic acid traditionally potent at much a lower pH. This study on glycolic acid's  antibacterial activity against *C. acnes* found it [most potent at 3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64545-9), while it did kill C.acnes upto 4.5. Less efficient killing was found at pH 5.\n\nSo I'm curious about the pH of this product too.\n\n# \n\n# My thoughts\n\n* I didn't find anything supporting or refuting Consumer testing results that's stated on the website.\n* I'm most excited for Retinol 2%, since The granactive retinoid emulsion was my love before I was prescribed Adapalene and Tret.\n* All in all, while the company has indulged in lesser than savoury practices regarding packaging and I'm not certain about the research they did into ingredients / formulation themselves or their passion for skincare, I do believe that they maybe better than a lot of indie brands out there.\n* A insta video by a popular beauty editor who was talking about the minimalist had been shared with me. They had said some sourcing seems legit and others shady. While sources for ACV and mandelic acid was not revealed, all others seem to be legit. I found no shadiness, let me know if you've found any.\n* Products that don't quite convince me / I still have doubts about are\n\n1. Vitamin C 20% (SAP) + Ferulic Acid  (pH reasons)\n2. Benzoyl Peroxide 2% + Glycolic Acid 5%  (pH reasons)\n3. Apple Cider Vinegar 2% + Glycolic Acid 10%  (combination)\n4. Hyaluronic Acid 2% + Vitamin B5  (pH reasons)\n5. Kojic Acid 2% + Alpha Arbutin 1% (no details, no idea what to think)\n\n* The actual results and efficacy is yet to be seen, and I'll personally primarily judge them on that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso speaking about popular bloggers / influencers, a lot of info about minimalist that's been going around in social media is clearly from this sub.\n\nAs you guys know this is a completely non-profit platform that we're using to educate ourselves and others, the other contributors and I gain nothing from doing all this research and sharing it, And while I have no problems with people sharing and using this information, I do wish credit is given where credit is due. And if you're asking \"how do we credit? you're anonmyous\", u/Aayu07 and I both started Instagram handles. Well she has had hers for years. I started it because she wanted to credit me for sharing some glycolic acid stuff. And I'd appreciate it if you credit me if you use this information anywhere. Just DM me or u/Aayu07 or any other user here to find out whether they wanted to be credited. Basic courtesy guys. For instance u/kparwal and u/e-lusion were also credited when u/Aayu07 used their findings.\n\nJust to be clear, ***\"I*** ***do not*** ***consent to this post or any part of it being reposted on any social media (including but not limited to YouTube, Instagram, Tumblr, Snapchat).

Because the Ordinary entered a market that was pretty saturated, and the Indian market is STARVED of basic formulations. \n\nI DO wish they'd use INCI names for their ingredients, because the Derma Essentia moisturizer used a proprietary name for their emulsifier, and I was so excited, I only found out later that Polysorbate 20 was in there... Not fungal safe 😐. But I'm glad these products ARE minimal! \n\n... That being said, chemist products are still cheaper, and Be Minimalist's products are too pricey for me 😂 Talk to me when I make my own money, maybe I'll have all their products, who knows! ...

I'm curious to know your thoughts on two of their products  - the Minimalist's niacinamide+zinc and their squalene. Are those formulations okay? I would love to try something from them but I'm a bit apprehensive. \n\nI'm trying my best to understand these things but I still have a very basic understanding of skincare ingredients and formulations. I would live to learn :)",

Easily congested.\nI have PIE and redness, but I don't have much dark spots or discoloration (aside from what's left behind after eczema flared ups) \n\nAlso I live in a dry, hot climate where the sun is really harsh.\n\n\n📈 **About the charts (slide 2 and 3)**:\n\n\n0 means least of the \"title\" and 5 means most of the \"title\"; like \"thickness\" is rated 1 means it's not a thick toner, and is really watery.\n\n\n🧴 **Coming to the product:**\n\n\n- Name: Skin1004 madagascar centella tone brightening boosting toner.\n\n- Period of usage: 1 month\n\n\n- I use it in the morning in this routine:\nCleanse (Benzoyl peroxide cleanser) > Toner 1 (isntree green tea fresh toner) > Toner 2 (this skin1004 toner) > Moisturise > Sunscreen\n\n\n> Ingredients: Centella Asiatica Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Propanediol, Betaine, Allantoin, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Prunus Mume Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Fruit Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Water, Glucose, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n- Fungal acne safe: YES ✅\n\n\n💭 **My thoughts:**\n\n\nWhen I first saw the product the ingredients list looked promising, but i couldn't find much on reddit about it. I use skinsort a lot though (it's an app where you can check whether a product is fungal acne safe or not) and I looked up this product there and the reviews were really good so I ended up ordering it!\n\n\nThis did not disappoint! I think you can get a fair idea of how I feel about the products through the charts that I have attached, but it's really good and it suits my skin well. It's hydrating, soothing, quick absorbing and it works. Also, it mildly exfoliates the skin but it's not too much and in my opinion it's safe for everyday use! \n\n\nI have used skin1004's tone brightening ampoule too, and I like it but I like this toner WAY more than that ampoule, and in my opinion it works better than the ampoule. Plus if you look up the ampoule on reddit many people have said it broke them out, and I suspect the ampoule was breaking me out too, but I didn't have any such issue with this toner.\n\n\nOverall, I would rate it 4.5/5, will keep repurchasing it. Also, i can tell this will last a while because I have been using it almost everyday, and I layer it twice, but I've only used up the amount you see in the picture so 👀\n",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

Nasaktuhan na nakita kong naka-live yung sa Dermorepubliq kaya napagpasyahan kong tingnan ang kanilang mga product. May isang product na nakatawag pansin sa akin: ang kanilang 1% Retinol Serum. \n\nNapukaw ng product na ito ang aking pansin dahil sa taas ng retinol na nilalaman nito. Mataas ang 1% retinol para sa isang leave-on product, ang rekomendasyon nga lang nito sa E.U. ay nasa 0.3% lang (https://health.ec.europa.eu/publications/revision-scientific-opinion-sccs157616-vitamin-retinol-retinyl-acetate-retinyl-palmitate_en). \n\nKaya sinilip o naman sa listing ng Dermorepubliq 1% Retinol Serum, una kong hinanap ang ingredient list nito. Pero laking gulat ko nung makita ko ang ingredient list nito:\n\nAqua, Isopropyl Myristate, Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Niacinamide, Retinyl Palmitate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Tocopherol, Allantoin\n\nWalang Retinol, imbes, Retinyl Palmitate ang nakalagay. Malinaw na mislabeled ang produktong ito. Hindi ko tuloy maintindihan kung papaano nakalusot sa FDA ito noong nag-apply ito ng cosmetic product notification. 🤦‍♂️\n\nKaya para sa lahat: laging maging mapanuri sa inyong binibiling produkto.

All of these do not have fragrance. Both Isntree creams are great for daytime use (gel cream in the summer and moist cream in the winter). The Illiyoon Ato Lotion is for the body and even face if you prefer a little more occlusivity with a balanced moisture and has been a great all-arounder and extremely economical. Innisfree Ato Cream is a great choice is you really want to lock it all in overnight.***\n\n**My Skin: c-c-c-c-c-COMBO. My skin is drier in the winter and oily in the summer.**\n\nThe hyperlinked ingredients will take you to CosDNA analysis of each product.\n\n***PRODUCTS: ALL DO NOT HAVE FRAGRANCE ❤***\n\n***Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Aqua Gel Cream:***\n\n* Store: Jolse\n* Price: $10 (sale)\n* Size: 100 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_fe18517608.html) Water, Methylpropanediol, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Betaine, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Trehalose, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Centella Asiatica Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium PCA, Phytosqualane, Isostearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol Cocoate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters, Hydrogenated Olive Oil Unsaponifiables, Butylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Ethylcellulose, Propanediol, Phenyl Trimethicone, Pentylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n* **Review:** *I have used this for the past 6 months, and I can say this gel-cream really shines in the summer for daytime use. It is extremely hydrating, but  in the winter, it really lacks in the 'locking in water' department. I'd say this texture and performance is really similar to the cult-fave Belif Aqua Bomb and is a lot cheaper. It gives a burst of hydration with a hint of moisture, does not have any stickiness, and does not pill with sun protection layer. Has not caused any breakouts for me, but of course, avoid if you have a HA sensitivity or live in dry climate. People with pure oily skin will have more longevity in using this throughout the year. I probably will not repurchase because I love to try new products, but I have enjoyed using it and it practical price. Overall a great no-frills gel-cream.*\n\n***Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Moist Cream:***\n\n* Store: Jolse\n* Price: $10 (sale)\n* Size: 100 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_d36c550998.html) Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Dipropylene Glycol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Betaine, Behenyl Alcohol, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Water, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Cynara Scolymus (Artichoke) Leaf Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Eclipta Prostrata Leaf Extract, Pteris Multifida Extract, Beta-Glucan, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Methylpropanediol, Fructooligosaccharides, Raffinose, Ceramide NP, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Pentaerythrityl Distearate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Cholesterol, Folic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Polyquaternium-51, Tromethamine, Ammonium-Acryloyldimethyltaurate-Vp-Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA\n* **Review:** *I also used this cream for 6 months, and this is a great daytime cream for the winter. The texture here is more reminescent of Belif Moisturizing Bomb and is even more economical! This cream gives alot of moisture and balances a little bit of hydration and emollience. It takes in a bit more time to rub in and it is slightly sticky after application but that feeling goes away fast especailly when layering with sun protection. I have had zero breakouts using this cream and I recomend this for combination skin that gets drier in the winter. I have also used this at night, but I prefer a little more occlusiveness. It may be good for oily or combo skin at night if you prefer a lighter cream. I probably will not repurchase because I love to try new products, but I have also enjoyed using it and it practical price. Overall a great no-frills moisturizer and I look forward to try other products from Isntree.*\n\n***Illiyoon Ato Ceramide Lotion***\n\n* Store: Olive Young\n* Price: $37 (1+1 deal)\n* Size: 2x 528 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2f20551004.html) Purified Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Shea Butter, Cyclopentasiloxane, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Hydrogenated Poly (C6-14 Olefin), Clohexasiloxane, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Perilla Frutescens Sprout Extract, Magnolia Kobus Flower Extract, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA (Ceramide PC-104 32.75ppm), Mannitol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Caprylate, Dimethicone, Diisostearyl Malate, Lauric Acid, Myristic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Stearic Acid, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Alcohol, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cholesterol, Palmitic Acid, Propanediol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Disodium EDTA\n* **Review:** *I have used this for a month on both my body and my face, and I think out of all of these this is my favorite. I think some may not like that it leaves thin film of occlusiveness, but for me that is a plus. Locking in moisture is critical for me. It truly excels as a body cream because it does not feel sticky. This lotion is filled with so much goodness such as ferments, ginseng (korean antiaging plant), shea butter, and a bit of ceramide. It melts in to your skin and moisturizes it well. In the winter, I also enjoy it as a both a day and night face cream too since it is more emmolient and occlusive than the Isntree HA Moist Cream. Out of all the purchases, this has been a must purchase forever for my body and has an added bonus that I can use it on my face when I want to mix up routine.* \n\n***Innisfree Ato Soothing Cream***\n\n* Store: Jolse \n* Price: $23 (sale)\n* Size: 150 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_bdc7551007.html) Purified Water, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Glycerin, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Panthenol, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, C14-22 Alcohols, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Bislauramide MEA, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Arachidyl Alcohol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Cholesterol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Xanthan Gum, Sorbitan Isostearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA, Madecassoside, Glucose, Arachidic Acid, Myristic Acid, Acorus Calamus Extract, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Tocopherol.\n* **Review:** *I have also been using this cream for a month, and it is a very impressive barrier cream. It is buttery and harder to rub in, but this will 100% lock in your routine. Judging by its formulations and comparing to Innisfree Derma Formula Green Tea Probiotics Cream, I can guess that it is about 3% cermamide. This cream does not give much moisturzation, but if you are using a layering a routine it will seal all of the steps in, especially layering an emulsion before it. I feel like with this cream, it has an antiaging effect because my fine lines has redued probably due to its effectiveness as a barrier cream formulated with the ceramide and centella antioxidants! This one will be loved by those with dry, sensitive, or combo skin that loves a good barrier cream. I will probably repurchase, but I know there are other products to try in a similar catagory!*\n\nEdit: Added details addressing fragrance :)",

        "body": "Review: After my surprisingly successful I had with the majority of the Skin1004 Madagascar Centella line promptly soothing a massive hives attack I had last week while  on a business trip, I was curious to try more  of their products.\n\nJust as I was leaving the conference venue, I happened to see a TJ/TK Maxx equivalent with a K-beauty display in the window. And there was this product, at a 20%-off introductory price. So I read the INCI, liked it, &  bought it.\n\nIt was a cloudy day with a stiff chill wind in Northern Europe, temperature 8° C/ 46° F. I definitely felt the cold wind on my face! My lips & cheeks took the brunt for sure. \n\nI rushed the 5 blocks to my hotel room & saw how the wind had affected my Jung Saem Mool Essential Nuder cushion foundation. So I took the plunge and gave my face the recommended 2 spritzes.\n\nFirst of all, the mist sprays in a wide soft, cloud, exceedingly fine & weightless. At first I wondered if any had hit my face at all! I didn't feel \"water\" or \"droplets.\"  Nor did I notice  any particular scent. \n\nThis is certainly unlike my other Western mists, such as the Nuxe Rose Mist, which offers medium size, wet  droplets; the Mario Badescu lavender mist, which sprays heavy and very wet, so wet it can run down your face!; and even the lovely Caudalie Grape Water, which has a fine mist, but can definitely be felt on the face.\n\nWell, the Skin1004 mist does in fact feel like walking into a gentle fog, so I get the \"cloudy\" description.\n\nAfter a minute I want to my bag to grab my Sisley Phyto-Rouge Shine (I love this highly moisturizing sheer balm/lipstick/gloss BTW) and as I put it on I notice the feeling of wind-dryness from my walk had vanished. \n\nMy face looked revived somehow, even though I'd been wearing the cushion for about 8 hours. I just suddenly looked a bit plumper & less tired? \n\nSo I've been using it the whole week now, several times a day. When the stuffy hotel room felt hot, the mist  felt somehow pleasantly cooling. When I felt red from the cold wind, I was soothed. I just love it. \n\nAnd even tho it's made for normal, sensitive & combo skin, it felt perfect on my sensitive & dry skin as well. \n\nMy big con so far is the size of the bottle I have.... not purse friendly!",

    "body": "Just stopped by TJ's and saw this new moisturizer. It didn't even have an official sign on it, just the name and price handwritten in sharpie, so it must be super new. \n\n[Ultra Hydrating Gel Moisturizer with aloe and green tea extract](http://imgur.com/a/q6TViPm) 75ml - $8.99\n\nIt's definitely one of their more expensive cosmetics but based on the ingredients it looks pretty good for the price. Luckily TJs has a great return policy so if I don't like it I can get my money back.\n\n\nFull ingredients list:\n\nWater (aqua), glycerin, saccharide isomerate, propanediol, ammonium acryloxyldimethyltaurate/VP copolymer, phenoxyethanol, polyamide-5, dimethicone, hydroxyacetophenone, polysilicone-11, squalane, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, laureth-12, ceteryl olivate, glyceryl stearate, ethylhexylglycerin, sorbitan olivate, sunflower seed oil, cetearyl alcohol, lactobacillus ferment, tocopherol, sodium stearoyl lactylate, sodium hyaluronate, milk thistle extract, birch leaf extract, beta-sitosterol, panthenol, squalene, coconut fruit extract, citric acid, green tea leaf extract, sodium citrate.\n\n\nIt doesn't have a fancy smell, in fact it kind of smells like a medicinal cream like tret or hydrocortisone, but the smell dissipates on application. It's a very light gel cream and it sinks in fast. It comes in a frosted plastic jar.\n\nI am patch testing it tonight so I will update when I get to know it a little better. I'm not great at analyzing the more chemically-sounding ingredients, but I can tell that it does silicones and does not have alcohol denat, which is good for me. I was drawn to the buzzword ingredients like squalane, aloe, lactobacillus ferment, hyaluronic acid, green tea, and other extracts. If anyone has any more knowledgeable insight based on the ingredients, I would love to hear it. \n",

I don’t know what it is, but I just vibe with that brand so much (except their sunscreens, which fall a bit short for me personally). I say this all the time, too, because I know people get so suspicious of comments on Reddit and people being paid plants or something, but I’m absolutely not affiliated with them at all! LOL Shit, I wish they supplied me with products! \n\nAnyway, Half & Half is my new favorite thing!! I’m really loving it. I do run oily, so I can use it alone during the day and be good. Or, I layer it under a heavier moisturizer at night just to amp up hydration and moisture. \n\nThe Multi Acid Milk Peel is interesting as well. I haven’t used it as frequently yet, since I just finished a procedure, so I’ve been pretty gentle and boring lately. But I do like it for a nice exfoliator. \n\nMulti-Quench I’ve been using for awhile and it’s great as well. But I think I love Half & Half better!

Been using these for a couple years). Now I’ve been using the Prequel on my face and body since January and plan on sticking with it. My skin looks and feels incredible. More hydrating than the DDG pads but still leaves that beautiful glow, pores are looking good, and my skin just looks nice and bouncy. AND it hasn’t irritated my rosacea (I also use Tret every other night). And for my body- no reappearance of KP on my legs or backs of arms, no booty acne, no ingrown hairs on my bikini line or underarms, knees and elbows are super soft, all of my skin texture in general is smooth af. And as long as it’s not crazy hot out, I can skip deodorant as long as I pat a bit of it under my arms. It’s light years better than the Ordinary acid\n\nAnd I was thinking about picking up these other two products.

You may remember me from my prior post “[A Comprehensive Guide to Hyperpigmentation and How to Treat it.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/30PlusSkinCare/comments/13vsnrv/a_comprehensive_guide_to_hyperpigmentation_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) I am back again with another comprehensive guide, this time on another skincare concern that I often see in skin-subs which is some version of the question “why do I have **chin/jawline acne** and how do I deal with it?” Now, you may be wondering why I’m choosing to hyper focus on one particular area of the face. You see, our chins are actually very unique environments which results in a really specific type of acne with very specific causes and treatments. Some people will have acne everywhere on their faces and bodies but some people will frustratingly develop persistent acne on just their chins and jaws. This post is specifically intended as a resource for people who find that their primary location of persistent breakouts is on their chin.\n\nAs it so happens, I also suffered from seemingly treatment resistant chin acne and I set out to figure out a way to solve it with years of research, trial and error, testing, talking to dermatologists and professionals, and scouring every medical article I could get my hands on. I wanted to share my findings and research since this is a common concern. I hope this resource is helpful!\n\n**DISCLAIMERS:**\n\n* Acne is an incredibly diverse condition with many causes and treatment courses and will always be unique to the individual struggling with it. While I will do my best to be as thorough as possible in my explanations and recommendations, it’s both possible and likely that I’m not able to detail every circumstance resulting in your personal case. This is meant to be a high level guide to serve as a jumping off point. \n* Speaking about acne requires sensitivity to very real personal implications. This post is not intended to moralize or act as a judgment of anyone struggling with acne. It is not a commentary on anyone’s personal hygiene, hormone profile, lifestyle, or environment. \n* There are a few conditions that can present similarly to acne present on the chin such as rosacea, perioral dermatitis, herpes simplex, allergies and autoimmune conditions, impetigo, hand foot and mouth disease, staph, and others. These will not respond to the same treatments as acne and should be addressed by a medical professional to properly diagnose and create a treatment plan for.\n* Shaving may also cause acne-like legions, but these are the result of irritation and ingrown hairs that also will not respond to the same treatment as acne. I will write a separate post on shaving in the near future to hopefully address these.\n* I do repeat myself a few times in here but that is for people who are skipping around the article. I want to be as thorough as possible even if you're jumping to the parts of the post you need.\n* I do run an online dermatology practice and skin care consultancy, but in order to protect the integrity of my advice, I do not promote my business, I don't give direct medical advice, I don't link to any products/websites, and I don't promote any products I've formulated myself. In spite of this being a heavily researched piece, please bear in mind that it also at its core an opinion piece. I also did not utilize AI for any portion of this post.\n\nThis is going to get long because I wanted to cover everything re:chin and jawline acne. But for your reading pleasure and ease, I have divided this post up so you can get whatever information you need:\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n1. Types of Chin Acne\n2.

Types of Chin Acne\n\nLike acne that appears on other areas of the face and body, chin acne can take a few different forms. Knowing the types of acne breakouts can help you understand the underlying causes and is key to figuring out how to treat them.\n\n**Blackheads:** Blackheads happen when your pores become partially clogged and the trapped debris oxidizes to a dark brown/black color. Because the top of the pore remains open, blackheads are known as “open comedones.”\n\n**Whiteheads:** Whiteheads happen when your pores become clogged all the way through causing a small white bump at the top. Whiteheads are known as “closed comedones” as the pore is completely blocked by debris. These are generally very small.\n\n**Papules:** Papules are raised red bumps that form when oil, dirt or excess skin cells block a pore and mix with bacteria on your skin. This bacterial infection extends into the surrounding skin creating an inflamed legion. Papules do not contain pus, thus they don’t really form a white point like you see with whiteheads or pustules.\n\n**Pustules:** Pustules are raised bumps with a white center surrounded by red, inflamed skin. They’re like the 2.0 version of a whitehead. They form when a pore becomes blocked by oil, dirt, or dead skin cells and gets infected to the point of creating a yellowish/white pus that’s visible under the skin, sometimes coming to a distinct peak. \n\n**Nodules:** Nodular acne occurs very deep within the skin. They can produce red or flesh-colored bumps at the surface, but they frustratingly may not appear to come to a definitive point. They are hard to the touch and are caused when the deepest part of a clogged pore gets infected. Nodular acne feels sore, or like there is a pressure under the skin.\n\n**Cystic:** Cystic acne, also known as acne cysts or blind pimples, are large, painful, pus-filled clogged pores that have become infected. They may not come to a definitive point on the surface and are fairly soft to the touch. They develop deep in the skin but create a red appearance at the surface. Like nodular acne, they often feel like a sore pressure point, but it’s difficult to really see where they are because they don’t form a peak or point, just an amorphous bump. \n\n# 2. What Causes Chin Acne aka Why is This Area Unique?\n\nThere are a number of factors that can contribute to the formation of chin and jawline acne, but this is a very unique spot which is worth discussing in detail. Generally, acne forms as a the result of a combination of bodily and environmental factors, but the chin and jawline have a few things going on that makes this area particularly interesting.\n\nFirst, I want to quickly discuss what causes acne to form in general:\n\n**Oil Production:** Oil on the skin, also known as sebum is the primary variable in the great equation of acne formation. Oil production is largely influenced by genetics, but it can be triggered by exposure to certain environmental factors. Many types of acne form around sebum that’s produced and then trapped in pores when combined with other things like dead skin cells, bacteria, and dirt. Sebum in an of itself is not bad, in fact it’s essential to maintaining the health of your skin, but preventing it from combining with acne-causing bacteria is key.\n\n**Comedogenic Reactions:** When sebum combines with other gunk, especially stuff that’s non water soluble, pores will sometimes clog. A comedogenic reaction is when a pore becomes blocked as a result of the accumulation of materials that cannot easily be cleared. This can happen with natural “gunk” like dead skin cells and environmental grime, but it can also happen with products that we apply to our skin such as skincare, makeup, SPF, and in some cases our hair products. Side note on this, there isn’t a generally accepted scale of comedogenic reactivity even though there are claims of one existing. Everyone is different, and certain things may trigger a comedogenic reaction in one person but not another. \n\n**Bacteria:** When bacteria enters the picture, clogged pores can go from simply being blocked to infected. This infection will trigger an immune response from the body, usually resulting in inflammation, redness, pain, and in some cases the production of pus. This is the difference between black/whiteheads and pimples/nodules/cysts. \n\n**Genetics:** Your genetics can greatly influence how prone you are to acne, what type, and at what severity. Genetics will predetermine certain aspects of your skin such as: \n\n* The size of your pores and how prone they are to blockage\n* Your natural level of sebum production \n* The rate at which you shed old/dead skin cells and replace them with new ones \n* Your hormonal levels and sensitivity to them\n* If you will have an allergic or inflammatory response when exposed to certain stressors, ingredients, or environmental factors\n\n**Skin Barrier Disruption:** Acne that forms as a result of skin barrier disruption is a form of an inflammatory reaction. Skin barrier disruption can occur when skin is exposed to environmental factors such as extreme heat or cold, dry air, wind, or pollution. It can also occur due to exposure to too many active or drying ingredients such as chemical/manual exfoliants, antioxidants, antiseptics, etc. \n\nExcessive exposure to these environmental factors and/or active ingredients can irritate and inflame the skin, disrupting the pH, triggering an immune reaction that results in pain, redness, and swelling. When the skin barrier is disrupted in this manner, it will often produce excess sebum in an attempt to moisturize the skin and rebalance its pH. During this time, the skin is less able to stave off bacteria and other environmental stressors which often mix with this excess sebum resulting in acne and breakouts. \n\n**Diet:** There is a great deal of controversy as to whether or not diet contributes to acne. It’s possible that foods themselves may cause acne through skin contact (more on that right below) and it’s possible that your body may react in certain ways that can trigger acne when certain foods are consumed, such as an inflammatory response or as a response to something like hormones in dairy products. Whether or not certain foods contribute to acne can be a purely personal experience. There’s no single body of research that can tell us one way or the other, many studies are conflicting, and it’s very difficult to objectively test when everyone’s own experience seems to differ.\n\n**B Vitamin Breakouts:** Now, there isn’t an established clinical consensus on this either, but there’s anecdotal evidence to suggest that certain B vitamins contribute to acne by possibly promoting sebum production. These include things like B12, biotin, and B complexes that can appear in multivitamins and in supplements that are marketed for promoting “hair, skin and nail health.” There’s also no clinical evidence to suggest a direct link between B vitamins and skin/hair/nail health except for the operating theory that in increasing sebum production, they promote healthy development in these areas, but for people who are prone to acne, it also seems to trigger breakouts. This isn’t unique to just the chin area, but it may be worth evaluating your supplements if you’re finding an increase in acne with use of supplements that feature B vitamins. \n\n**Hormones:** This gets its own section….\n\n**But why my chin/jaw** ***specifically***\\*\\*??\\*\\*\n\nFor people who struggle with acne on just their chin or jawline, this is a really common question, and the answer is part of the reason I believe it requires a unique approach to treating. Chin acne is the result of two things:\n\n**Gravity and Proximity to Your Mouth:** All the time we spend upright means that stuff on the surface of our skin will migrate downward over the course of the day. Now this is true for other areas of your face, sometimes our hair products migrate down to our foreheads, our eye makeup onto our cheeks. But what makes the chin particularly problematic for acne is not only do we have this drift of face stuff to this area, we also have our mouths. \n\nOur mouths are full of bacteria, and even if you don’t spend all day drooling on yourself, that bacteria can spread downward as a result of talking, laughing, coughing, sneezing, licking our lips, even just normal breathing. *Propionibacterium* *acnes* and *staphylococcus* *epidermidis* are bacteria that can originate in the mouth and migrate outward and downward causing acne legions. To a lesser extent, we also see some bacterial transfer from the hands as the chin/jawline tend to be high touch points.\n\nOur mouths are also where we eat. Even if you’re the most careful eater in the world, many times you’ll get some degree of food debris on your chin. Even though I just mentioned that there’s no general consensus on whether or not diet contributes to acne, it’s possible that the act of putting food in our mouths can; that getting even trace amounts of stuff like grease and sugar on the skin around our mouth can contribute to clogged pores and bacterial proliferation. \n\n# 3. What Exactly is Hormonal Acne and Why Does it Affect My Chin?\n\nEveryone’s biological processes are dictated in part by the influence of hormones in our system, but the link between hormones and acne isn’t as simple as “I have hormones, *ergo* I have acne.” Understanding the environment in which hormones contribute to the formation of acne can help us with more realistic treatments than just “stop the hormones.”\n\nThe reason hormones cause acne is that androgen hormones (aka male hormones like testosterone, DHEAS, DHEA, and androstenedione) influence the production of sebum in the skin: it increases as they go up, and decreases as they go down. A breakdown of the actual process is as follows:\n\n1. Oil producing sebaceous glands are powerful androgen receptors, producing more sebum when they collect more androgen hormones or convert their precursors. This causes oil production on skin and a build up of that sebum in the pores. \n2. Androgens themselves may also clog pores causing comedones to be formed.\n3. DHEAS is also inflammatory by nature, triggering immune response T cells to show up in and around clogged pores.\n\nThe levels of these androgen hormones can be globally elevated (as is the case with PCOS in females or generally for males with high testosterone naturally or supplemented, hence backne with steroid use) or they can fluctuate. This is why women sometimes breakout during their periods: it’s the downstream effect of elevated androgen hormones in the luteal phase when estrogen and progesterone naturally decrease. \n\nAs mentioned prior, B vitamins can also have this effect by triggering androgen receptors even though they themselves are not androgen hormones or their precursors. \n\nDue to the aforementioned reasons as to why the chin in particular is an area where we find the best ingredients for acne, we can see why increased sebum production from elevated androgens would result in breakouts there. Now, the knee jerk reaction may be to stop or reduce those hormones — and there are ways to do that such as using/stopping birth control pills or other forms of hormone replacement or suppression — but while these may work as an acne treatment, it’s an option you should only discuss with your doctor if appropriate for you.\n\nThere are other ways to address hormonal causes of acne such as the medication spironolactone or spearmint herbal tea. Spiro is a diuretic that’s been proven to block androgen receptors and spearmint is thought to have a similar effect but I have yet to find a study specifically supporting this, at least not to the rigor I would like to recommend this in earnest. \n\nGenerally, for those who either can’t or don’t want to use interventions that affect their hormone profiles or take androgen blocking medications, the most reasonable intervention is to temper the environment in which acne forms on the skin through the use of topicals and skin care. The reason I mention all of this is to pull back the curtain on what exactly “hormonal acne” means so you can address the resulting sebum that’s ultimately forming acne legions. This is where we look at the ingredients specifically proven to address the environment on your skin.\n\n# 4. How to Treat Chin Acne Part 1: The Ingredients\n\nWhen looking for skincare products to treat and prevent chin and jawline acne, it’s important to look for ingredients that can help encourage skin cell turnover, curb sebum production, kill off acne-causing bacteria, clear clogged pores, and block harmful UV rays. \n\nNow, this is not actually as extensive of a list as you might expect. There are lots of ingredients that target acne, including new and novel ones coming onto the market all the time. I’m choosing to focus on ones that are clinically studied and have the most compelling evidence, ones that have worked the best for myself and people that I’ve worked with, recommendations from dermatologists and formulators, and ones that are more readily accessible. I also find that having a consistent routine that includes proper cleansing is just as important as what you're using, as well as limiting the number of topicals to prevent the dreaded moisture barrier disruption which can have a backfire effect. \n\nThis also isn’t a shopping list. You don’t have to have or use all of these things to treat chin acne, but I’ll get into that in the routine portion. This is more to be used as a tool that can help you diversify your routine if you find one ingredient or another doesn't work for you. And it can help you determine if a product targets acne based on its ingredients. There's lot's of options. Some of the key ingredients to look for include:\n\n**Retinoids** that increases cell turnover. Retinoids like tretinoin, adapalene, retinol et al, can help treat chin and jawline acne by promoting the turnover of skin cells and increasing cell growth, which can help prevent dead skin cells from clogging pores. While retinoids are extremely effective, they do have some caveats. First, they can be sensitizing to a lot of users, but this can be tempered by using different form functions, different application methods, or different concentrations. Second, because it's constantly turning over skin exposing delicate new skin cells to the elements, it can actually worsen acne if you overdo it and damage your skin barrier. Lastly Tretinoin and other retinoids are firewalled behind a prescription in some countries and may be more difficult to obtain. But retinol/al is available in OTC forms.\n\n**Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs)** are water-soluble chemical exfoliants. Solubility of skincare ingredients matters because the natural moisturizer of the skin is our sebum, which is oil. Water-soluble ingredients don’t dissolve in oil, thus they do not penetrate into the pores as deeply. This, however, is not actually a downside, it means that these types of ingredients work on the top layers of the skin which is great for acne. Common AHAs that are used to fight acne include glycolic acid, lactic acid, and mandelic acid. There are numerous others, but these are the most promising and well-researched. Use of AHAs helps breakup and remove dead skin cells which prevents them from clogging pores. And while pore size cannot be reduced, AHAs can help reduce the dilation that happens when pores fill up with gunk.  \n\n**Beta Hydroxy Acid (BHA)** is an oil-soluble chemical exfoliant, the most well known of which is salicylic acid. Remember Stridex pads? Those are salicylic acid! Because BHA is oil-soluble, it dissolves in the skin’s natural sebum which pulls it deeper into the pores. This causes deeper exfoliation which makes this an effective ingredient for combatting deeper forms of acne. The caveat is, since it works in deeper levels, the risk of irritation is higher. But when carefully used especially when featured in cleansers, BHA is a very effective method of treating and preventing acne.\n\n**Azelaic Acid** has both anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties making this one of my all around favorite skincare ingredients due to it’s ability to both kill off acne-causing bacteria as well as reduce redness and acne scarring. It’s also a mild chemical exfoliant that helps strip away dead skin cells much like AHAs and BHAs. It's pretty awesome and available in OTC and prescription strengths.\n\n**Niacinamide or Vitamin B3** is a skin soother that decreases inflammation, but its real power is that it naturally reduces sebum production which can curb acne. It works by inhibiting the enzyme “sebaceous lipase” which is part of the process of oil production in the pores. Ironically, it’s a form of vitamin B3, but unlike ingested B vitamins that might trigger acne, as a topical it actually helps prevent acne. Like AHAs/BHA it can also reduce the dilation of pores which can make them appear smaller. Now, there are some people who are sensitive to niacinamide. I cannot find any studies to support why this may be, or if perhaps people are reacting to other ingredients in products that contain it, but if you find you do not tolerate niacinamide well, it’s best to skip it.\n\n**Benzoyl Peroxide** is an antiseptic which means it makes the environment incredibly inhospitable for bacterial proliferation. Unlike antibiotics that kill bacteria (which can contribute to antibiotic resistance), benzoyl peroxide as an antiseptic simply makes life miserable for bacteria so they fail to thrive and cause acne. Benzoyl peroxide is usually found in two forms, either as a leave-on topical or in face washes. Like many of the other ingredients listed here, it can be sensitizing with overuse, and in the leave-on form, it can sometimes bleach your clothes, but it’s an incredibly effective way to curb the proliferation of bacteria on the chin. It’s also one of the active ingredients in prescription Epiduo or Epiduo forte, which is compounded benzoyl peroxide and the retinoid adapalene. Benzoyl peroxide is generally available in concentrations of 5 and 10%. \n\n**Sulphur** is…. Sulphur. It does a couple things (other than stinking) when applied to treat acne. It helps absorb excess oil, it dries out dead skin cells to make them easier to clear away, it has some antiseptic properties especially against chin-loving *propionibacterium* *acnes*, and it’s also a mild exfoliant. It comes in two forms usually, as a face wash or as a leave-on mask or spot treatment. This can be a good substitute for benzoyl peroxide. Sulphur allergies or sensitivities are common, so it’s important to check for any reactivity you might have.\n\n**SPF** represents a class of many ingredients designed to protect the skin from UV rays and the damage that occurs from exposure. This doesn’t necessarily have an effect on preventing chin acne, but it is necessary to use when using active ingredients to fight acne. Just use it.\n\n# 5. How to Treat Chin Acne Part 2: The Routine and Recommendations\n\nAlright, let’s get to it. I’m providing two paths to take: a gentler option for more sensitive skin and a heavier-hitting option if your skin is more resilient to actives. But first, irrespective of your skin, there’s one really important part of the routine worth exploring if you suffer with chin and jawline acne which is getting your oral health dialed.\n\nI discovered this accidentally and then was able to later confirm with a dermatologist and dentist that the effect here can be real. A few years ago I decided to do Invisalign and I actually noticed my chin breakouts reduced significantly in part because I was brushing my teeth, flossing, and rinsing with mouthwash as much as 10 times per day depending on how often I was drinking or eating.\n\nNow, you don’t need to be doing that quite as often, but what I’ve found to be effective against chin acne is the following:\n\n**In the morning:**\n\n1. Scrape your tongue using a tongue scraper.\n2. Rinse and gargle with a mouthwash of your choosing and wait 5 or 10 minutes. This is a good time to do your skincare. I personally like CloSYS mouthwash.\n3. Brush your teeth but don’t rinse with water and avoid eating or drinking for a little while.\n\n**Throughout the day:**\n\n1. Keep a little travel bottle of mouthwash with you and if you can, swish a little after anytime you eat or drink (anything that isn’t just plain flat water.) This helps curb some of that bacteria that likes to meander out of your mouth and onto your chin. I have a 3oz refillable bottle that I fill every few days and just keep it in my bag.\n2. If you’re not able to rinse with mouthwash, swish your mouth with plain, flat water after eating or drinking. This helps clear away food/drink residue that oral bacteria proliferate in. \n\n**In the evening:**\n\n1. Scrape your tongue.\n2. Floss, and really get in there. SO many people don’t floss thoroughly enough. Many of the bacteria associated with chin acne are elevated in people with gum disease. \n3. Rinse and gargle with your mouthwash. Wait 5 to 10 minutes, again this is a great time to do your skincare. \n4. Brush your teeth and again, don’t rinse with water after.\n\nIf you can stick with an oral hygiene routine like this, for a lot of people struggling with chin acne, it’s half the battle. And I know it might seem obvious, like “of course I brush my teeth!!!” but adding maintenance steps through the day and *really flossing* are two of the biggest parts that plenty of people fail to do regularly. These are also great steps to take if you f\\*cking hate getting manhandled at the dentist.\n\nNow let’s talk about the actual skincare portion. Since this is targeted, you can apply the actives to just your chin area or your whole face if you would like. It’s up to you. Just be sure you get thorough coverage of your whole face when cleansing, moisturizing, and applying SPF.\n\n# The Gentle Routine\n\n**AM routine — In order of application following a lukewarm water rinse:**\n\n1: Niacinamide\\*\\*\n\n2: Azelaic acid\n\n3: Moisturizer\n\n4: SPF\n\n**For Niacinamide,** I have been extremely happy with the Ordinary’s Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%. \\*\\***If you can’t tolerate niacinamide**, you can skip this step and instead use **Effaclar Mat Oil-Free Mattifying Moisturizer from La Roche Posay** as your moisturizer step.\n\n**For Azelaic acid,** Paula's choice Azelaic Acid Booster is the only drugstore one I've really tried after sampling the Ordinary's in-store and not liking the texture. For a semi-RX, Dermatica has both a 15 and 20% “Clarifying Azelaic Acid Cream” which can be purchased directly from their site. \n\n**For Moisturizer,** it’s tempting to go with one formulated for acne or oil control, but I generally recommend a light and sheer moisturizer. I really like Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion (the one for face and body). If you need a niacinamide(B3)-free option Vanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer is a good option.\n\n**For SPF,** I personally like anything from La Roche Posay, any Neutrogena SPF that's not formulated with ethylhexylglycerin as this can be sensitizing for some, Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen, Trader Joe's SPF if you can get your hands on it, and EltaMD. Find one that you like and that you will wear.\n\n**PM routine: In order of application:**\n\n1: Gentle cleanse\n\n2a: Adapalene (Mon/Wed/Fri, start with 1x per week and build to 3x)\n\n2b: AHA (Sun) \n\n3: Moisturizer\n\n**To Gentle Cleanse**, this is a two-step process. Start with Cetaphil gentle cleanser. This is a gentle, hydrating cleanser that will break up your SPF really effectively. Massage in and rinse. If you need something a little stronger to breakup makeup or more stubborn SPF, Clinique “Take the Day Off” makeup remover is a great alternative. Then massage in a foaming cleanser, I recommend Cetaphil daily cleanser, and rinse.\n\n**For Adapalene**, OTC Differin cream is the one you’re going to want to go with as it’s the easiest prescription-strength retinoid to get without seeing a doctor. Apply a pea-sized amount. Oddly enough, of all the retinoids I’ve tried, my chin acne has responded the most to adapalene. I like to start people at once a week and build to 3 times per week, up to daily if you can tolerate it. If you’re using the AHA next step though, keep at least one day adapalene-free so you can also have an exfoliation day.\n\n**For AHA,** the one I like to go with that provides gentle, yet effective exfoliation is lactic acid. Lactic acid also binds to water which makes it a really good hydrating ingredient as well. The Ordinary’s Lactic Acid + HA in either 5 or 10% is a good one. \n\n# The Heavier-Hitting Routine\n\n**AM routine — This will be the same as the AM portion of the gentle routine, no need to go crazy. Pop back up there for that.**\n\n**PM routine: In order of application:**\n\n1: Benzoyl peroxide cleanse\n\n2a: Adapalene (Mon/Wed/Fri, start with 1x per week and build to 3x)\n\n2b: BHA (Sun)\n\n3: Moisturizer\n\nThis might not seem terribly different from the Gentle Routine, but both benzoyl peroxide cleansing and the introduction of a BHA can be particularly a\\*s kicking if your skin isn’t ready for it.\n\n**For Benzoyl Peroxide Cleanser,** first you will do a gentle cleanse with Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser to breakup your SPF and do a first pass on your skin. Massage in and rinse completely, then follow with Differin Daily Deep Cleanser. Depending on your tolerance, you can rinse this off right after massaging into skin, or you can let it sit for a few minutes (3 at the most) before rinsing. If you find your skin getting really irritated by this, switch to the gentle routine. \n\n**For Adapalene**, OTC Differin cream will work here, just like in the gentle routine.\n\n**For a BHA**, also called salicylic acid, there are a couple options I like. Paula’s Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant or the Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Solution are great options. This can be very sensitizing though, especially in a routine that includes a retinoid so only use once or twice per week and not on the same night as your adapalene.\n\n# 6. Is it Fungal Acne?\n\nIf the routines don’t seem to be working for you, it’s possible that you may have fungal acne. Fungal acne can show up on your chin for the same reason regular acne can, except instead of being cause by bacteria, it’s caused by an overgrowth of yeast. Fungal acne can have a distinct appearance, it’s similar to whiteheads/closed comedones with small, clustered white or flesh colored bumps, and it might not appear as red and inflamed as pustules/papules. There is some controversy as to whether or not fungal acne is a thing (mostly as a matter of semantics, it’s not technically a form of *Acne vulgaris*, rather *Pityrosporum folliculitis* or *Malassezia folliculitis*), but if you’re not successful with the routines above and you can rule out other medical conditions, it may be worth treating your case like fungal acne.\n\nThe solution to this is a simple one: cleanse your face with an antidandruff shampoo a few times per week —Head and Shoulder, Selsun Blue, Nizoral are great ones. Let it sit on your skin for a few minutes before rinsing, then top with a basic moisturizer. If you have a combination of fungal and regular acne, you can do this as your cleansing step a few times per week with the rest of the steps in the routine. If you just have fungal acne, you can literally just do this and follow with your moisturizer and SPF during the day. If it persists, talk to your doctor about a prescription anti-fungal.\n\n# 7. “I’ve Gone Too Far With the Actives” \n\nIt’s tempting to go nuts with the actives in an attempt to quickly stave off chin acne, but this can cause severe irritation that can actually contribute to more breakouts. The skin cell turnover cycle is about 30 days which means that it will generally take a few weeks to start seeing improvements with a new routine. Most people will know if a routine is working within 3 to 6 months, but a quick way to know if it’s not working because you’ve overdone it is if you experience a damaged moisture barrier which can happen as quickly as within a few days.\n\nA damaged moisture barrier is an injury to the skin that can be caused by using too many actives and is akin to a chemical burn. There are a few telltale ways to know if this is happened: first, the skin will have a really distinct feel. It will feel tight and dry, but confusingly, it may be very oily at the same time. It may also appear red and inflamed, it may peel or appear to crack, and it may burn, itch, or sting even when you apply inert topicals like a basic moisturizer. \n\nThe confounding thing is that in this state, your skin will produce more oil to try to calm everything down, but because the immune system is working on healing the damaged skin, it’s less able to stave off acne causing bacteria. So not only are you very uncomfortable and inflamed, you’re also probably going to have more breakouts. Healing acne means striking a gentle balance with your actives, but if you find that you have disrupted your moisture barrier, you should pull everything back until it stabilizes. \n\nI recommend dropping your routine down to absolute basics: In the morning, rinse with lukewarm water, use a gentle moisturizer like Cetaphil or Vanicream, and top with SPF. In the evening, double cleanse with Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser and then Cetaphil Daily Cleanser, then top with your moisturizer and/or an occlusive like Vaseline or La Roche Posay Cicaplast Balm. Stick with this until your skin feels normal again, and if you want, very slowly reintroduce your actives, or switch some of the recommended products for others that I’ve mentioned to see if there’s something else you get along with.\n\n# 8. Nuclear Options\n\nIn general, I recommend trying OTC and drugstore topical solutions for any skin concern before heading down the dermatology route. Part of this is because you can usually put a good dent in what you're struggling with by using OTC topicals, making in-office RX treatments easier and more effective. Generally, a doctor will be able to prescribe prescription-strength versions of many of the things I’ve already listed, or they will add oral medications. But by doing as much as you can with drugstore products AND ensuring you can stick with a consistent routine, you can make the most of your continued work with a dermatology.\n\nSide note: I haven't listed every possible compounded medication because there are a lot, and many compounded meds are formulated to tackle multiple issues. I also tend to favor single note skin care (aka, products with very few ingredients) as this allows you to combine or remove certain actives and gives you a better sense of reactivity.\n\nThis list also doesn’t include hormone-related treatments. If you believe a hormonal intervention is right for you, it’s best to talk to your doctor specifically about your individual needs. \n\nFor tougher-to-treat chin acne, if your topical routine doesn't totally clear the problem in 6 to 8 months, a visit to the dermatologist might be helpful. Here are the heavier-hitting topicals and medications to discuss with a dermatologist that can go the extra mile after you've exhausted other options.\n\n*This does not constitute medical advice, it is intended to act as a guide for you to discuss with your dermatologist or medical provider.*\n\n**Medical Grade Peels:** Medical grade chemical peels can be done in dermatology offices. High concentration BHA or AHA peels are also commonly used for acne. Because of the strength of the acids used, these must be done by a medical professional with careful followup. I recommend this over seeing an esthetician for peels. \n\n**Tretinoin and Prescription Retinoids:** This is going to be dependent on what part of the world you're in, but in a lot of countries, tretinoin and its counterparts like tazarotene are only available through prescription. These would be used in place of the OTC adapalene I mentioned in the routine if prescribed by your provider. There is a stronger prescription-strength adapalene as well as a compounded medication called Epiduo or Epiduo Forte, which combines adapalene with Benzoyl Peroxide. You should be mindful that it can bleach clothes and sheets if you are prescribed it. Aside from the ones already mentioned, common forms of prescription retinoids include: Altreno, Tazorac, Fabior, and Trifarotene (Aklief). They vary wildly in cost in availability so I recommend asking to start with generic options first before asking your doctor for brandname acne medication.\n\n**Prescription Azelaic Acid:** This is another one that's available in lower concentrations over-the-counter (which can still be quite effective) but there are prescription strength grades of azelaic acid such as Finacea and Azelex. This is usually reserved for rosacea treatment as it tends to target redness and flushing, but it can also be an effective acne treatment for its antiseptic properties.\n\n**Topical Antibiotics:** Topical erythromycin and clindamycin can be helpful in killing off acne causing bacteria but you need to be careful of developing antibiotic resistance. I am of the opinion that a topical antibiotic course should not exceed 90 days, but your doctor will know better based on your case. It may be helpful however to ask your doctor exactly how long you should be on a topical antibiotic, how you will know if it’s working, if they have a plan for you to gradually wean off of it, and what their recommendation for replacement would be after you have finished your course. Typically, a doctor will transition you to a topical retinoid or other medication following an antibiotic course. It’s good to have a clear plan prior to starting a topical antibiotic.\n\n**Oral Antibiotics:** Tetracycline antibiotics like doxycycline and minocycline are sometimes prescribed for severe acne cases and are usually the last line of defense before the ultimate treatment which I will get into next. It’s generally recommended to exhaust all other possible topical treatments before turning to this sort of intervention as oral antibiotics can have numerous side effect (such as hyperpigmentation, nausea, severe photo reactivity) and can also contribute to systemic antibiotic resistance. However, short (1 to 3 months) or infrequence courses of oral antibiotics can be effective in treating acne and helping prevent the repopulation of acne-causing bacteria. Like topical antibiotics, it’s important to have a clear plan with your doctor to understand how long you will be on it, how you will know if it’s working, and what you will transition to using after the course is finished. Having a routine to support an oral antibiotic is key to longterm success even after your course is finished.\n\n**Oral Tretinoin:** Also called isotretinoin or accutane, this is the true nuclear option for acne, chin or otherwise. Like its topical counterpart, oral tretinoin works by increasing skin cell turnover. Generally, it’s only used in severe cases as the courses are often long, fraught with side effects, and require lifestyle adjustments such as abstinence from alcohol and regular blood draws for liver enzyme and cholesterol monitoring. However for many people, the side effects are minimal, and the reduction in acne often outweighs the temporary discomfort of the treatment course. Many people can go years or even the rest of their lives without a severe reoccurrence of acne following an oral tretinoin course. \n\n—\n\n**If you made it this far, congratulations! This concludes my comprehensive guide on chin acne. I hope this information is helpful. While it is extensive and based on massive amount of research, experience, experimentation and work with professionals, it may not be perfect and it may not be suitable for everyone. Feel free to offer any constructive criticism or ask any questions in comments. I am always open to expanding my understanding.**",

I read your earlier post on Top 10-20 Cleansing Oils & Gels also. \n\nI'm looking to introduce a new cleanser to my daily routine and was playing with the idea of an oil cleanser.  So much choice, but this should make it easier.  Ideally, I'm looking for something without propylene glycol. butylene glycol, essential oils or added fragrance.  And no parabens - was shocked to see Phytomer still incorporating these!  The ATrue Black Tea Cleanser in your previous post looked interesting; simple list of ingredients, although ironically green tea is the first ingredient in the list, rather than black tea!  Aromatica Orange Cleansing Sherbet looks interesting, as does Clinique - so simple but effective.  Have you any idea what Kakadu (reference Sidmool) means??\n\nWhich do you use incidentally?  You are probably more geared up than most to recommend?  Thanks again.  Bev",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae](https://preview.redd.it/04x8cx1jvsy81.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db29ff28ad9fbcd3ff56a158d60e872ed63cb538)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\nand that's all from my side! I know its not much but then again kangaal haalaat mein kharidaari mushkil hai 💀. anyway, here's a list ss that I do want to try once this lot is finished:\n\n* sunscoop sunscreen serum (only if dermaco doesnt work lmao. really intrigued)\n* Face shop sunscreens (itne variants . ek try karne ka mann hai 😖)\n* beauty of joseon rice ss (stock mein aaja bhai 😫)\n* missha sun aqua gel and essence (bas aise hi lol)\n\nI've also tried the neutrogena ultra sheer, episoft , a few banana boat ones but way long ago so I don't clearly remember them to give the verdict on them. just if I haven't repurchased them, consider that they didn't work well for me.\n\nhope this was informational and you guys enjoyed! if you still have any other questions related to the product above, feel free to comment!",

    "body": "To me, price tag doesnt matter. Its whats INSIDE that matters. and i feel like i see a lot of people ignore the ingredients of their skincare and are getting scammed. on both the low dollar tree end and and the high end.\n\nNow i am not one to be scared of anything with a scientific name like Hydrogen oxide or call everything 'Chemicals'. But if a product claims to have a certain ingredient and its the LAST thing on the list under even fragrance and preservatives, i have questions. Or for what ingredients they claim to have they then package improperly like Vitamin C and Retinal in clear bottles.\n\nSome brands at the DT have proven time and time again to just not use enough of an active they claim they have in a product and its just a waste of my $1.25 (im looking at you BOLERO) while others have shockingly good ingredients like skin nutrition botanicals.\n\nAs a long time DT lover, this newer brand BPure is giving me Bolero vibes with some of their products, and thats an insult.... For example the new glow up serums. I took a look at the ingredients and they just dont line up with the claims on the package.\n\nHere are the ingredients for the strawberry one:\n\nWATER, GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, PEG/PPG-17/6 COPOLYMER, POLYSORBATE 80, HYDROXYACETOPHENONE, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, CARBOMER, SODIUM ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, ISOHEXADEC- ANE, NIACINAMIDE, CAPRYLHY-DROXAMIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, DISODIUM EDTA. FRAGRANCE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, SODIUM HYALURONATE. SALICYLIC ACID, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM. LINALOOL, FRAGARIA ANANASSA (STRAWBERRY) FRUIT EXTRACT, CITRIC ACID, CARMINE (CI 75470)\n\nThis claims to have AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) and just just does not. it has citric acid which is technically an AHA, but its at the end of the list and in that amount is not doing anything. and the strawberry extract can be considered a 'natural aha' but again, thats not the claims and its so low it wont work like an AHA.\n\nHaving most the actives listed under fragrance means its likely under 1%. The Salicylic acid has to be like 1-2% to work. At MOST this serum is hydrating. but a very basic hydration at that. Which isnt bad, but not what it claims at ALL.\n\nBut then there are brands like skin nutrition and their claims on their products and the ingredients are actually shocking. The actives they claim are there in their true form (not like the AHA lie in the last one). They have correct percentages (and often TELL YOU the % for a lot of things). While they might not be the most life changing product, based on formula alone, they weirdly outclass a lot of brands and their claims for $1.25\n\nWhile i enjoy trying all the new products that come out, when i see items like the BPure strawberry smoothing serum, i get frustrated. They clearly can make and sell quality products like skin nutrition. It feels like they have started to pump out poor performing products that probably have a better profit margin since they dont contain very much of the more expensive ingredients and its \"just a $1.25\" so people scoop them all up since its viral.\n\nIs anyone else seeing this with recent launches? And BPure has put out some great products too, but they are so hit or miss with their claims and how they line up with whats in them. Just because i shop at DT doesnt mean i want to over consume. and i know its easy to just try everything, but it adds up. \n\nwhat viral DT beauty products have you noticed like this? what are your thought on this? Do you just trust what the product is claiming? What are your thoughts?\n\n",

        "body": "Buying DT beauty/skincare is  an option for those who enjoy frequently trying new products, love to experiment, and prefer an inexpensive/budget shopping experience. Over the years I have tried some DT products but have left behind most I had initially considered.  Because after checking the ingredient list, I have concluded that many  products simply won’t meet my needs. Fragrance, niacinamide, floral/fruit extracts are a no. Instead I stick to the OG skincare/haircare/cosmetic products that have never disappointed and I know work for my skin.  I just buy these on sale, stack my coupons, use store promotions and CVS ExtraBucks to restock the products I have already learned work best. For example, a bar of Vanicream soap might be as low as $4 after coupons and promotions. A Maybelline mascara might cost $5. That’s the same cost as four DT products at the current 1.25 price point.  Sure, I could buy 4 DT mascaras for that same $5, but they likely won’t be as effective or as consistent as a Maybelline product. However, if I saw my favorite Maybelline mascara at DT I would certainly buy at least two!\n\nWe can choose how to consume and we can all become smarter consumers. If an active ingredient is dead last or very far down the list, there’s a good chance that ingredient has such a low percentage that it will not produce appreciable results.\n\nAn educated DT consumer is a happier consumer. ❤️",

        "body": "I agree with a lot of what you have said. I think that those specific watermelon, strawberry, Avocado, etc. bpure serums are sort of useless and definitely unnecessary. Not Worth even your $1.25. And so I totally agree with that. \n\nI also agree that there are definitely products that don't have amounts of ingredients that are even going to be effective just like you said. That being said, I think a lot of people hear \"Dollar Tree\" and think, there's no way there's anything good in there or anything in an amount that's effective, which just isn't necessarily true at all. And so I'm glad that you also mentioned a couple brands that are doing good things cause I actually think there are several brands that have extremely effective combinations additionally. \n\nOne thing I thought would be important to point out for those who aren't as adept at ingredient list reading, It isn't always just about how high up in the ingredient list the ingredient is. Some things just have to come in very small percentages for the best situation for your skin. People think they want retinol to be the second ingredient, but we don't usually want like a huge percentage of retinol or something else. AND sometimes a large amount of retinol isn't even helpful if it's not actually being delivered into the skin with proper mechanisms. So an amount of retinol or Vitamin C or whatever underneath 1% could still be effective depending on the situation. \n\nThe whole vitamin C thing is super complicated as well because there's different types of vitamin C that require different percentages to be effective. And also it's just a not a very stable ingredient and so there's a lot of confusion there. \n\nHowever, that being said, I don't think we should write off all clear bottles that have what we consider sun sensitive ingredients like retinol. Studies have shown that while some ingredients prone to deteriorating in sunlight, that is specific to sunlight and not just like the light within the store or within the warehouse. And so in actuality, most of the product is not going to be exposed to very much sunlight at all because it would be made in a factory, stored in boxes, transported in boxes. And then stored in the store until you take it home. And then you have to decide where you're going to put it. It probably experiences minimal deterioration in such circumstances. So saying oh the retinol etcetera in this product is completely ineffective because it's in a clear bottle is over-simplistic and negating a lot of the good. \n\nOverall I agree with you but I just wanted to add some of my thoughts.",

        "body": "I do think a lot of people aren't too familiar with ingredients in skincare and just TTP. As far as DT goes, I might try a product once but I will ALWAYS check the ingredients first (I will admit I did jump the gun on the b.pure serums though). From the products I've looked at and tried myself, \\*most\\* seem to be relatively clean but as you said some can be misleading and don't contain enough of the advertised ingredients to be effective.\n\nI also check for percentages, but for the most part I avoid getting my actives from there. I think it's very important people take the time to learn what different ingredients are for (retinol, AHAs, BHAs, etc.), which ones should be in dark bottles/stored in certain temperatures, avoid damaging/irritating your skin by mixing ones that shouldn't be applied together, etc. Your skin is an organ so I think it's important to keep educating yourself and protect your skin!",

        "body": "This is why I stick with Adapalene for my retinoid because I know it works because it had to be proven that works when it first hit the market as a prescription product. I buy cleanser and sometimes moisturizer from DT because I don’t really need actives per se from these products since I use Adapalene. I’m currently using the glow recipe watermelon moisturizer dupe which has niacinamide. I don’t know the quality of the niacinamide nor the percentage but for 1.25 I’m willing to try it since I’m not relying on it solely for an active ingredient. I prefer moisturizers with niacinamide when I can find them at DT. To me this moisturizer is meh - the packaging is nice since it’s a glass jar and it’s 2 oz. But it’s a very “wet” texture which I don’t like because then I can’t apply while my face is still damp which is customary for me. It takes a while to dry too. \n\nAs a side note - does anyone know if you can or need to exfoliate while using Adapalene? The packaging says not to use any other acne product so I just really haven’t really tried it but was curious if anyone knew.",

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

Pictured above.\n\n**Fragrance:**  ~~Yes. An extremely artificial flowery scent. Dissipates, but I find it slightly annoying while applying.~~. None. \n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:** Got this when my previous gel moisturiser got over. I had already used the other 3 and I started using this with fairly high expectations. And I was / am disappointed. **It's not bad. It moisturises**. But I was expecting a jelly like moisturiser that sinks in easily while still packing a moisture -filled punch. And this is not that. It takes way longer than I'd like to sink in.  I either have to compromise on the quantity I use and the moisturised feeling or go around feeling oiler than I would like. It's the kind of product that does everything to some level, but none of them spectacularly or to an above average level.\n\nAs far as healing for barrier damage is concerned, I get way faster results from the other three Bioderma moisturisers and I pretty much never touch this for that purpose after the initial trial period.\n\nThis does have a few de-pigmenting ingredients, but so far I've not been able to see anything results that I can directly attribute to this product.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:**  Moisturised feeling. I've used this with actives that are known to cause dryness and faced no issues. It can handle drying actives. No glow noticed. No standout effects.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:**  Can't think of anything. If you start using this with low / zero expectations, you'll probably like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status:**  Jury's still out, haven't decided. But as of now it's a **Will Not Repurchase.**\n\n\n***Additional Notes on whether the product is fake****\n\n**Tl;dr: Old tube is genuine, NOT FAKE.  Confirmed by brand too. Review still stands**\n \n\nOn 24th October 2023\n\n1. Some people's experiences does not coincide with mine in important ways such as fragrance and I'm now wondering if mine was a fake, I contacted Bioderma but haven't received any info yet. But I'll update and or delete the review when I do get it. \n\n2 Of 5 people, 4 can't smell anything from their product and 1 can (but doesn't sound similar to my description. & Bioderma still hasn't replied :(\n\nOn 1st November 2023\n\n1. Bioderma replied on Instagram that my moisturiser is genuine, By the time they replied, I had already repurchased another tube from Tira, to check for myself. The new tube has already arrived and they are identical in all ways. Including from the same batch 😅. \n\n2. New tube arrived with bioderma samples, which jogged my memory. Old tube had also arrived with samples. Two of which I still have unopened. So chances of old tube being fake is 0.\n\n2. But the smell was still different. My old tube smells like a flower. My new one doesn't smell of anything, unless I put copious amounts on my arm and put my nose in it and even then it smells like a teeny bit chemically, Thats all. I can understand why most people say it smells like nothing, because that's what I would have said too, if I wasn't looking that closely. \n\n3. Anyway, I was breaking my head trying to figure out why my old tube is has that smell, And then it struck me. I had a perfume leak incident in my travel kit many months ago. Most of the stuff is replaced and I don't still have that perfume, so I'd kind of forgotten. The tube was new then and I didn't use it enough to note the frag or lack thereof. I think the gel or top of the packaging still smells of the perfume and that's why I was mistaken. \n\nSo that was much ado about nothing, apologies. \n\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Atoderm Intensive baume\n\n**MRP:** 786 for 75 ml. Available in 45ml,  200 ml tube and  500 ml pump bottle.\n\n**Texture:** White Cream.  Pictured above.

It doesn't smell exactly like grease but it reminds me of grease. It's a dusty, chemically smell that I associate with Bioderma moisturisers. Like if you've smelled any of the Bioderma moisturisers, all except the gel-creme have the same DNA, though they are not exactly the same. It's not repulsive, but it's there. Does dissipate after a minute or so.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  I bought this on a whim after a few friends raved about it. They were so so so right. This was the second bioderma cream moisturiser I used, so I knew it would help with barrier issues but it does so much more. When I first used this, I had oily to combination skin and I never ever used cream moisturisers by choice. I had a misconception that since I was an acne / clog prone, oily skinned person, that I need to stay as far away from cream moisturisers as possible. This is the moisturiser than changed my mind.\n\nIf I want a one and done PM product when I'm too tired or too lazy or too whatever, I reach for it.\n\nIf I want a one and done travel moisturiser, this is the only one I pack.\n\nSuper dry climate, this is it.\n\nAirplane dryness, this is it.\n\nSlight tingling, or signs of barrier damage incoming, this is it.\n\nBarrier damage, this is it.\n\nDerm procedures, this is it.\n\nBut in even other scenarios such as humid climate or AM routine, where this is NOT my ideal or go-to product, it still does a decent job. It holds its own. It can be greasy but hey it can be worked with. It does an amazing job moisturising without clogging pores for me.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:**\n\nMoisturised feeling.  Super soft skin. Heals Barrier overnight depending on damaged your skin is. It's my tried and tested barrier recovery product.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The heaviness, I guess. Upto combination skin or barrier-damaged oily skin, it's fine. Very oily skinned people may want to avoid this for general use.\n\n**Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** Have repurchased 3 or 4 times. Will continue to repurchase till it's discontinued. Love it. **Holy Grail.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Bioderma Sensibio Forte Rapid soothing cream\n\nMRP: 1499 for 40 ml.\n\n**Texture:** White Cream.  Pictured above. Heavy feeling on the skin.\n\n**Ingredient List :**  [Aqua/​Water/​Eau](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum)](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/paraffinum-liquidum), [Beeswax (Cera Alba)](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cera-alba), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Cetyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-alcohol), [Glycyrrhetinic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycyrrhetinic-acid), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [Palmitic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/palmitic-acid), [Stearic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/stearic-acid), [Sorbitan Sesquioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitan-sesquioleate),[Tocopheryl Acetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tocopheryl-acetate), [Mannitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/mannitol), [Xylitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/xylitol), [Rhamnose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/rhamnose), [Fructooligosaccharides](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/fructooligosaccharides), [Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laminaria-ochroleuca-extract), 🌟[**Allantoin**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/allantoin)**, 🌟** [**Sodium Pca**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-pca), [Caprylyl Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylyl-glycol), [Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylic-capric-triglyceride), [Pentylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentylene-glycol),[1,2-Hexanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/1-2-hexanediol), [Carbomer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/carbomer), [Triethanolamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/triethanolamine)\n\n**Fragrance:**  Yes. A different version of that greasy smell.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  This was first prescribed by my then dermatologist for application after a MNRF session. And since then till Atoderm intensive baume came into my life, this was a re-buy. **Slightest irritation, and I used to apply it**. I have urticaria, this helped with many of my allergic reaction episodes. **Skin will feel greasy, but it was soothing at the same time.** As soon as the greasiness disappeared, I used to reapply. **This was never a daily use moisturiser for me.** I kind of used it like medicine. As and when needed, at the quantity, I needed. However the soothing it provides does overlap with the Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume and I've not repurchased this in more than a year. I simply use that, wherever I previously reached for this. I have a feeling this is a gold standard product for certain sub set of people who need a rich, soothing moisturiser, but for most of us, this can be a pass.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:** Moisturised feeling. Very soothing on irritated skin.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The heaviness, I guess. Upto combination skin or barrier-damaged oily skin, it's fine. Very oily skinned people may want to avoid this for general use. And the price.

I love it only slightly lesser than Atoderm Intensive Baume and mostly because it's comparatively way more expensive. 😅.  I wouldn't use this daily, there's no need, but definitely a barrier saviour product. I wake up with such soft glowy skin even when it's damaged, like the healthy part of my skin feel look glowy even if skin damage texture is still there to an extent.\n\n***Comparing with baume, since I use them both for similar reasons :*** I originally had the impression this was heavier than Atoderm Intensive Baume and that it forms a suffocating seal on the skin. This isn't true under normal circumstances. It does feel suffocating when barrier is SEVERELY damaged but not otherwise. I applied this on half and the baume of half my face to check if there's any major difference and no. **No functional difference noticed.**\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:** Soothing, Healing, Moisturising, it does it all.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The price. And for a lotion consistency product it's quite heavy.\n\n**Repurchase Status**: When I started writing this review, this was going to be a WNRP, because between all of them, I'd only repurchase Atoderm Intensive Baume, but ngl, the more I thought about it, I find myself wavering. **This is a WRP.** I don't know when, but I'll probably come back to this at some point.\n\n# \n\n# Comparision\n\n***Ranking based on Use Case***\n\n||1st Choice|2nd Choice|3rd Choice|4th Choice|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|As an AM Moisturiser|None of them|Intensive Gel-creme|Intensive Baume|Sensibio Forte|\n|As an PM Moisturiser|Intensive Baume, Cicabio, Intensive Gel-creme, Sensibio Forte||||\n|Time taken for Healing|Cicabio|Sensibio Forte, Intensive Baume|Intensive Gel-creme||\n|Versatility (Can work for any of the above use cases in a pinch)|Intensive Baume|Intensive Gel-creme|Cicabio|Sensibio Forte|\n\nI've ranked them after considering the following factors (these are the most important deciding factors for me personally).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***As  AM Moisturiser:***\n\n**I would use absolutely none of them as an AM moisturiser.** That doesn't mean they can't be used as such. it's just that none of them absorb in minutes or 'set' when you use a normal amount or slather it on. They're all occlusive but not the matte kind. Intensive Gel-creme is the easiest one of them to use as an AM moisturiser.\n\nThis gif will show you how long it took for them to sink into my arm, which is way dryer than my skin. But caveat is that I don't always use a AM moisturizer (infact I very very rarely do), but i when I do, I slather it on like below. If you use a teeny teeny weeny bit, you might not face this issue. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/isq9941kddwb1.gif\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***As PM Moisturiser:***\n\nI can't actually decide I love them all. Atleast I love Intensive Baume, Sensibio Forte and Cicabio, but there's nothing to complain about the gel creme either. ✨ **Skin just looks so nourished with all the Bioderma moisturisers.** ✨  If you use only a tiny amount, all of them will sink in by morning. I like to slather them all on. And how much is absorbed by morning completely depends on how damaged my skin is. If I catch signs of barrier damage early and use them, they'll sink in. If I've completely wrecked my skin, there will be residue when I wake up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***On healing***\n\nTime taken for healing: shortest to longest, ranked above. But honestly, most people don't need a moisturiser stronger than Intensive Baume even for barrier damage.\n\n**Note on the likeliness of clogging pores and causing acne: I've personally not had breakouts from any of them. None of them caused acne for me.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\n👉🏾 All 4 moisturisers are good.\n\n👉🏾 For most people Sensibio Forte & Cicabio is not necessary. Unless you have facial wounds, surgery on your face, intensive derm procedures, very bad rosacea and are prescribed or recommended these, I'd say skip them.  People with sensitive skin may like them though.\n\n👉🏾 If you have oily skin, you might like Bioderma Intensive gel creme.\n\n👉🏾 Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume has ceramides, fatty acids and cholesterol. Ratio unknown, will link if I can find anything.\n\n👉🏾 I've seen a fair number of people mention that baume is heavy and breaks them out in this sub. Something to be aware of.\n\n👉🏾  If I had to suggest only one product, from the above, hands down it'll be Atoderm Intensive Baume and it's best cost - benefit wise too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Im going to buy the cica +arnica to try out next. The Atoderm Creme Ultra doesn't seem interesting enough to me to want to try. If I can get a mini or sample somewhere just to update this post, I'll do that.\n\nETA2: After writing so much I still like left somethings out , so I'm editing to add them. Apologies 🙏\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs with any other review, YMMV",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F18 (umar badh gayi but dimaag nahi 💀)**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , acne (pustules, fungal and cystic) pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae ](https://preview.redd.it/fnjipguox9ma1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d880ff6b482ade3f03237375ef02cdd64fb4e3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol.

I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl  Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise!

I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a  fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\n* **The Derma Co.** **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum** \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredient list** : Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would  get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation.

I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :(  but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nupdate : this ones a hard no for me. is it calming? yes. but the whitecast is too much. and when i sweat it literally looks like I'm secreting milk from my skin  (~~nipple)😭😭~~\n\n**rating** : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure! in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh.

I used it as a body stick most of the time with how oily this was. but can be used by anyone ig\n\n**texture and appearance** : whitish yellow stick. has a fruity kind of smell. really oily and greasy on first application that doesn't absorb or goes away after a while.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Polyethylene, Isohexadecane, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Ozokerite, Paraffin, Synthetic Beeswax, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Neopentyl Glycol Diisostearate, Dimethicone, Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Fragrance, BHT\n\n**filters** :\n\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n\noof this was an impulse purchase that I regretted later on. mind you, this is a great sunstick for your body but definitely not for your face . not to mention its waterproof . but the tapti garmi really just melts everything in its way and this is no exception. bhai itna chip chipa lagta hai i dont even feel like putting this on just because of the MoIsT feeling it gives. unless you're going to a pool or beach (as it suggests duh) , if you're okay with feeling like [that peanut butter baby](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.ie%2Flife%2Ffamily%2Fthis-peanut-butter-baby-is-sure-to-brighten-up-your-day-31499579.html&psig=AOvVaw0Qc7SXcD436wP5Ywrn_yJv&ust=1678212392776000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCIDzt77yx_0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) , then you can give it a try. it  does provide a good amount of product for the price and is a solid waterproof one fosho. but nahi jhela jata for some reason 😣😣😫\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\nme after buying and trying all of these to find my HG\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zzjpjrbly9ma1.gif\n\nbut it was fun doing this in a span of a few years and I finally got one that fits all my boxes . the BOJ one is seriously godsent for me ✨✨~~lets just ignore that it makes my wallet cry every time I buy it .~~ But id rather spend more on stuff that works than just hit and trials lmao. also I've gone past my obsession on using sun sticks as a whole since they require quite a lot of pressing while applying and the application just irritates my acne a lot 😫 imma finish the ones I have but I have no intentions on buying anymore from any brands (even though the minimalist and earth rhythm ones look good 🤡)more reviews to come! ill be doing one on stuff my dad will be bringing from the U.S in the next few weeks so do let me know if you'd like a follow up on those too! (~~why do i treat my posts like a sitcom😭).~~  and as always, any other questions, comments are always welcomed and so are dms!\n\nbyeeee 💖💖",

        "body": "also my post exceeded the word limit so here's some more lmao :\n\n   \n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF      50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n   \n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte      Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable      UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB      filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV      filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB      mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change",

I have also incorporated the  **Be Minimalist's AA & TXA serums since 20/02/2021**  into my routine,so they are being reviewed here while the CTM+sunscreen products have gained my trust enough to be holy grail(s)! \n[You can fill yourself in regarding my skin type and concerns by reading this](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/lmjcxq/look_what_arrived_in_the_mail_today_upcoming_post/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and consider the routine to be nothing greater than anecdotal evidence :)\n\nPS: The length of the post might make it look like I accidently published a scientific paper on the Internet but I have compensated for that by using the '🐳' emoji as pointers because nothing emotes joy like a whale mindlessly sprouting water into the ocean :P\n\n🔹 **MORNING ROUTINE** 🔹\n\n🐳 Cleanser:  **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel**\n\n   \n   🐳Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   🐳Serum: **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%**\n   \n\n   🐳Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night             Repair**\n\n\n   🐳Moisturizer:  **Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**\n   \n\n    🐳Sunscreen :  **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++**\n\n\n\n🔹 **NIGHT ROUTINE** 🔹\n\n    \n   🐳Cleanser :  **Cera Ve Salicylic Acid Cleanser**\n\n   \n  🐳Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   🐳Serum:  **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA**\n\n\n   🐳Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair**\n\n    \n    🐳Moisturizer:  **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion**\n\n    \n    🐳Replaying that moment when I called my class teacher 'mummy' in the 7th grade before wrapping up the day is a cult ritual.\n\n\n\n\n🔵 **CLEANSER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water (Aqua), Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Cocoglucoside, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride, Ceteareth-60 Myristyl Glycol, Glycol Palmitate, Glycerin, Peg-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Propylele Glycol, Sorbic Acid, Disodium Edta, Fragrance, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract.\n\n🐳 **Application** : Just like how *normal* people apply a face wash. Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\n🐳 **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\n🔵 **TONER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **DermaFique All Important Toner** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\n🐳 **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you!

    "body": "So I always thought that ferments were a \"Asian skin care\" thing. But ever since getting some high end Western skin care as gifts, I noticed that many of them actually have a lot of fermented/yeasty ingredients in them.\n\nBut I can't find much on the \\~science\\~ or evidence behind why ferments can be good for your skin. But I also wonder, since ferments aren't really a thing that majority of consumers in the Western market are looking out for (like fragrance, rose water, coconut water, rosehip oil, fruit/veggie extracts that have label/experience appeal, but aren't necessarily good for skin), why would these huge companies bother putting ferments in their expensive skin care if they didn't have evidence that they do SOMETHING?\n\nI especially am curious because AB/Korean beauty are sometimes looked down upon as just being trendy and not using ingredients that are scientifically proven to be truly beneficial for skin.\n\nDo you think ferments are legit? What do they do for YOUR skin? Your fav AB fermented products or ones you are wanting to try?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are some of the leave-on skin care from [Sephora's \"Best Selling\" skin

Fermenting antioxidant rich ingredients such as ginseng, green tea etc. breaks down the antioxidants/complex molecules that are beneficial to our skin into smaller molecules, which allows it to be absorbed into the skin easily. Not only that, yeast/bacteria ferments produce additional metabolites (AHAs, peptides) that provide additional benefits such as whitening, hydration, skin repair, you name it!\n\nEdit: forgot to put my favorite fermented product!! I love the Manyo Factory Galactomyces Niacin Special treatment. :) \n\n2nd Edit: here are the links to some scientific literature articles on fermented cosmetics which were found through PubMed! You do need access to the database if you want to read them in its entirety, but you can get some brief information on the topic just through the abstract.\n\nFermenting red ginseng enhances its safety and efficacy as a novel skin care anti-aging ingredient: in vitro and animal study.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23126662\n \nEvaluation of tyrosinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of Angelica dahurica root extracts for four different probiotic bacteria fermentations.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254340\n\nSkin resistance to UVB-induced oxidative stress and hyperpigmentation by the topical use of Lactobacillus helveticus NS8-fermented milk supernatant.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598022\n\nBifidobacterium-fermented soy milk extract stimulates hyaluronic acid production in human skin cells and hairless mouse skin.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12637786",

I have been wanting to do this comparison since the minimalist released its peel, and I finally got the chance to that. I have uploaded a video and images for the comparison but I'll first start with the review.\n\nReview\n\n* *Your skin type-* Sahara desert dry skin\n* *Your current climatic conditions-* Hot af\n* *Your current AM/PM routine-*  \n**AM**\\- Nothing, I only apply sunscreen if have to go out  \n**PM**\\- Ponds cold cream (for my double cleanse), cleanser (Neutrogena hydro boost cleanser), tret (twice a week), ordinary peeling solution (once a month), innisfree jeju volcanic mask (once a month), moisturizer (I have like 4-5 moisturizers that I use)\n* *Your age- 22*\n\n**The Ordinary AHA BHA Peel**\n\n* *Usage timeline-* More than a year\n* *Ingredient List-* Glycolic Acid, Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Sodium Hydroxide, Daucus Carota Sativa Extract, Propanediol, Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Salicylic Acid, Potassium Citrate, Lactic Acid, Tartaric Acid, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Xanthan gum, Polysorbate 20, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n* *Holy Grail but Will Not Repurchase-* I fucking love it, it made my skin so smooth and my complexion brighter. I never had any skin problems before as such, but it just made everything better. I never experienced any sort of purging or irritation with this peel. Although, I will not be repurchasing it because I paid ₹1200 for this even though it lasted more than a year. The availability is an issue too.\n\n**Minimalist AHA BHA PHA Peel**\n\n* *Usage timeline-* 2 times\n* *Ingredient List-* Aloe Vera Juice, Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Gluconolactone, Mandelic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lecithin\n* *Holy Grail but Will Repurchase-* I loved it in the very first go, I saw immediate results much like the ordinary. I did not experience any sort of irritation or purging with this either. I honestly don't have much to say because the results are pretty much identical for both.\n\nComparison\n\n**Texture**\n\nAs you can see in the video below, apart from the colour difference the minimalist one a bit flowier than the ordinary. Also, I like the shape of the dropper of the minimalist one, it's pointy rather than the round tip and it looks classier ( at least to my eyes). That is really it when it comes to the texture and the feel of the products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/mobbuo/video/dxwg1bxpdes61/player\n\n**Application**\n\n*note- i forgot to take my before pics, pls forgive a newbie 😔😔😔*\n\nI did a half-n-half application of the peels. The immediate thing I noticed was the way they applied, ordinary being thicker is slightly easier to spread because it doesn't drip as much as the minimalist.\n\nAlso, idk what it is about minimalist peel but I had to apply it a tad bit more than its counterpart.\n\nThird, minimalist did not burn AT ALL while the ordinary always burns a little, even after a year of consistent use.\n\nIn the images below you can see my skin right after the application of the peels, the results are very much the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2kdr544sdes61.jpg?width=3464&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8425c82498afb958897ee5482979129fdc1c07d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In Conclusion-** I like both, I don't have a preference for one over the other when it comes to the results. The only thing is that minimalist is cheaper and easily available, so I will go for that one instead of the ordinary.",

    "body": "\nHey all! 👋🏻I want to review hair growth serum from minimalist-\n\nSo i have straight fine hair(little below shoulder length)(30s/F), oily scalp. \n\nI have been suffering from hair loss for past two years. I haven't checked with my derm. I have lost some hair (in patches) because of my tight hairstyle. Then came humidity season and my hair were everywhere. Before taking an appointment I decided to try hair serum. I started on 29th june. \n\n\n29/6: Started with serum. First application was hassle free. No burning or warming of the scalp. I used 4 drops front of scalp(problem area) and 4 drops back of my head, everyday, in the AM(as i take shower in the PM). Rubbed into my fingers and then Massaged only on my scalp and not on length. It was non greasy.\n\n\n01/07: In just two days I started to feel my hair fall is less, like 3-4 strands in my comb. I thought its a placebo effect.\n\n\nI continued it for two weeks straight, every day and my hair fall reduced by 20%. I stopped the application on 14/7 for two weeks as i was traveling and wanted to see if hairfall return and to my luck it Did. But it wasn't alot. I think some people miss understand that after stopping hairfall doubles but it's just the same amount you used to get(at least for me)\nI restarted again and still using it and now i can say I definitely see hair looks bit thicker, have seen baby hair growth especially at the hairline and hair fall has reduced to 80%. \n\nI will keep using it as it dint have any side effects except one stubborn cc which always occurs on my forehead if apply regularly. Thus i now use it 4-5 times a week(depends on which day i ll shampoo and workout)\n\nIts non greasy if applied less but if you directly use the dropper on scalp you might end up using alot and it will give oily look. My scalp normally gets oily on 3rd day but with everyday application of serum hair looks oily on 2nd day. \n\n\nPROS: 1. It works.\n2. New hair growth. \n3. Hair seem thicker.\n4. Less hairfall.\n\n\nCONS: 1.Everyday application is a task for long hair and oily scalp as you need to shampoo.\n2. Give cc on forehead with regular use.\n3. Don't think its a permanent cure.\n4. Expensive.\n\nInci:\nButylene Glycol, Aqua, Dextran, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3, Trifolium Pratense (Clover) Flower Extract, Propanediol, Arginine, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Gluconolactone, Calcium Gluconate, Glycerin, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Apigenin, Oleanolic Acid, Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Sprout Extract, Isomalt, Sodium Metabisulfite, Larix Europaea Wood Extract, Glycine, Zinc Chloride, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Saccharide Isomerate, Sanguisorba Officinalis Root Extract, Serenoa Serrulata (Saw Palmetto) Fruit Extract, Capryloyl Glycine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Lactic Acid\n\n\nTL:DR- True to its claims, will repurchase it!\n------------------------------",

Easy to spread texture for a natural, hydrated, shine-free finish leaving no white cast.\n\n*Fragrance free • Non-comedogenic • 50ml*  \nPrice- $499  \n \n\n**Ingredients**\n\n**Uvinul A Plus**\n\nThis Modern filter excels in protecting your skin from free radical and skin damage. Its Photostable nature provides continuous defence against the sun, while its excellent safety profile makes it perfect for all skin types, including the most sensitive. In the formula it not only promises potent UVA protection but also enhances the formula for broad-spectrum protection.\n\n**Tinosorb M**\n\nTinosorb M is an UV filter that revolutionises sun protection with its broad-spectrum coverage against both UVA and UVB rays, also provides even protection into visible (blue) light, Its dual-action mechanism not only absorbs but also scatters sunlight, offering unparalleled defence against the sun's harmful effects. Renowned for its photostability, it ensures long-lasting protection, maintaining its efficacy even under direct sunlight.\n\n**Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate**\n\nIt stands out as a UVB filter that effectively shields your skin from the sun rays. It's popular for its ability to prevent sunburn and protect against UV-induced damage. This UV filter is prized for its lightweight feel making daily application enjoyable without the greasiness.\n\nWater/Aqua, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Dimethicone, Ethoxydiglycol, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Diisopropyl Adipate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Isododecane, Pentylene Glycol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Acrylates/Polytrimethylsiloxymethacrylate Copolymer, Decyl Glucoside, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Propylene Glycol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Xanthan Gum  \n\n\n**Review**  \nSkin Type: Combination (Oily in T-zone), acne-prone, currently a bit dry due to acne medication  \nWeather: Pleasant, not hot enough to test sweat resistance  \nAge 25-30  \nTexture: Super watery in texture, close to the new Neutrogena Dry-Touch sunscreen.  \nApplication: for my skin, it blended easily, like a dream.  \nWhite Cast: My face is slightly darker than NC42 and most sunscreens leave a white cast including Minimalist SPF50. This left no white cast at all, I was pleasantly surprised.  \nWent out in the sun for an hour, no stinging/burning/tanning observed but that is too soon to judge.\n\nOverall: After application, it forms a slightly tight film which gives a glow to the face. I had slight barrier damage on my chin, it did not sting when I applied the sunscreen there but pilled after a while only in that area. I usually get sweaty on my nose post sunscreen application but that did not happen, it might be due to the pleasant weather. My skin feels slightly stretchy right now and lightly oily on my forehead  \nAM Routine today: Simple Moisturizing face wash-->.Cosrx propolis synergy toner-->Cosrx Vitamin C 23%-->Simple hydrating light moisturizer-->wait 5 minutes then sunscreen\n\n  \n**TL;DR**: I think I will repurchase this, it has great lab and human testing results, the texture and application seems great for summers for my skin and this is the first sunscreen which truly has no white cast for me. The last sunscreen to do this was Aqualogica which tanned me. (I don't mind tanning but it proved that it did not protect my skin). \n\nObviously YMMV but I hope this works for you. Feel free to ask any questions.",

Yet to test out reapplication, effectiveness against sun burns and water resistance claims but so far…looks promising enough for a repurchase. Could be a potential HG",

I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1.** \\[**BEPLAIN\\] Cicaful Ampoule - 4.34/5 (3,174 Reviews)**\n\n30ml/29,000 KRW\n\nCentella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyglycerin-3, Pentylene Glycol, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Sodium Hyalutonate, Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacilius/Rice Ferment, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Xantham Gum, 1,2 Hexanediol, Ethyhexylglycerin.\n\n*The few reviews I have read for this say that it absorbs fast, is pretty soothing, and some people state that it really helped their acne. The expectation seems to be that it's supposedly very good for acne prone skin. There are pictures of someone with pretty bad acne showing before and after pictures of their acne going away. (Korean skin care is more geared toward CALMING & SOOTHING acne than to go to war with it with drying treatments and whatnot. I guess because a large component of acne is inflammation?)* \n\n*Some people said it doesn't seem to do anything for them, sensitive types seems to like it a lot, that it absorbs quickly. They like that it's unfragranced. Some VERY oily types said they feel like their skin is a little bit more oilier when they use it and that it doesn't absorb well for them. It may be really popular due to Director Pi suggesting it as the #1 soothing ampoule in her recent video. I see Director Pi's name pop up quite a lot in reviews in general.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cvm5b0doc8731.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=75f5866f4847487e1271f277ff8db20353b394b0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. \\[BADSKIN\\] Collagen BOMB Hydrating Ampoule - 4.28/5 (5,002 Reviews)**\n\n400ml/24,000 KRW (400ml ampoule??!)\n\nHydrolyzed Collagen, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Water, 1,2 Hexanediol, Trehalose, Carylyl Glycol, Allantoin, Propanediol, Brassica Olearacea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Medicago Sativa (Alfalfa) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Brassica Campestris (Rapeseed) Extract, Raphanus Sativus (Radish) Seed Extract, Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic Acid.\n\n*Reviews for this basically say that this is ULTRA moisturizing. A little bit on the heavier side so oily skin may not like it, but all the dry skinned people seemed to really, really love this. It's cheap, very hydrating, absorbs well. However, a few oily people said it takes a little bit to sink in for them.*\n\n[BIG](https://preview.redd.it/d2pcet1rc8731.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e4fac533d2f3f52e206e338e85a10c33fc69df5)\n\nB I G\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. \\[Manyo Factory (Witch Factory)\\] Bifida Complex Ampoule - 4.21/5 (5,368 Reviews)**\n\n50ml/35,000 KRW\n\nBifida Ferment Lysate, Lactobacillus/Pumpkin Fruit Ferment Filtrate, Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, Copper Tripeptide-1, Aureobasidium Pullulans Ferment, Panax Ginseng Callus Culture Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Glycerin, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Caffeine, Hydrolyzed Algin, Red Ginseng Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Methyl Gluceth-20, Epigallocatechin Gallate.\n\n*This is a very popular product. This and their Galactomyces Niacin Ampoule have been consistently on #1/somewhere in the top 20 list since their debut in 2012 according to Director Pi. This ampoule has been #1 for like forever from what I'm gleaming. However, their expiry is 2 years unopened, and 6 months opened. Supposedly studies done by Estee Lauder say that bifida ferment has been shown to strengthen your skin barrier over time and make it less sensitive to things. Director Pi says ferments provide very, very gentle form of exfoliation.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/chi00fdvc8731.png?width=470&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a191ba338f59eaa0c66ece19e1e3b5311c87dfa\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. \\[SCINIC\\] First Treatment Essence - 4.16/5 (5,282 Reviews)**\n\n150ml/19,800 KRW\n\nGalactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Adenosine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Water, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rubus Coreanus Fruit Extract, Sea Water, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b08iueb0d8731.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=163f45d2760c17dfc195db29d3e667246a7c272c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. \\[TORRIDEN\\] Dive-in Serum - 4.42/5 (1,127 Reviews)**\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Trehalose, Betaine, Propanediol, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside, Madecassic Acid, Ceramide NP, Beta-Glucan, Malachite Extract, Cholesterol, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, PVM/MA Copolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Xantham Gum, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract.\n\n*This looks like Hada Labo lotions tbh. :o Except with more skin soothing things like panthenol, witch hazel, madecassoside, allantoin and such.

    "body": "Hwahae: It's a review/ranking app for Koreans for beauty-related things. I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm really excited about this section. I'm not happy that Korea is and has been for years, swamped in pollution from the winds carrying it over. There is a lot of microdust and even people with resilient skin reported getting redness & severe irritation from the pollution. Everyone has to wear these giant masks, sometimes special ones, and limit their exposure to the world outside of their homes.*\n\n*So there has been a lot of push for soothing, calming products and \"clean\" ingredients. A lot more focus on repairing the skin barrier. So I'm excited about those, but not the fact that people have to suffer.*\n\n*I'll be bolding some of the soothing, repairing and/or skin-identical ingredients in the ingredient lists. I don't know every good ingredient, but I will bold the ones that I do know of. Some other beneficial ingredients as well.*\n\n*\\*Also got random pictures of the textures of the creams and the users who posted it.*\n\n*If you're interested in barrier repairing/replenishing as I am, here are some good quotes from Susan, from Swift Crafty Monkey blog:*\n\n>**Natural moisturizing factor (NMF)** is found within the corneocytes, and makes up 20% to 30% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum. It **consists of amino acids (40%), sodium PCA (12%), lactate (12%), urea (7%), ions (18.5%), sugars (like glycerol – 8.5%)**, and a few other things. These are water soluble [humectants](https://swiftcraftymonkey.blog/better-crafting-through-chemistry/) (meaning they draw water out of the atmosphere to our skin) that have a huge impact on the biochemical and mechanical properties of our skin. Having an adequate NMF level in our skin can prevent or reduce skin tightness, cracking, scaling, and flaking. It improves our skin’s plasticity (thanks to the interactions of the amino acids with keratin) and helps maintain skin’s barrier properties.  \n>  \n>**Filaggrin** is a really important protein found in our skin! ...When we are in more arid climates, the filaggrin breakdown increases to produce more NMF. More NMF is a good thing!  \n>  \n>The contents of the NMF do more than act as humectants. The lactate and potassium can affect the pH and stiffness of the stratum corneum. The lactic acid stimulates ceramide biosynthesis and improves barrier function. The [hyaluronic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan) (HA – picture to the left) maintains hydration and structural integrity of our skin. It also interacts with intercellular lipids and regulates the mechanical properties of the stratum corneum.  \n>  \n>\\[The strateum corneum lipids\\] make up about 15% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum, and contain about **40% to 50% ceramides, 20% to 25% cholesterol, 15% to 25% fatty acids** (those with C16 to C30 chain lengths, with C24 to C28 being the most common), and **5% to 10% cholesterol sulfate**.  \n>  \n>Oils with **linoleic or gamma-linoleic acid** are always welcomed by our skin (like sunflower, sesame seed, borage, evening primrose, rice bran, and others), especially in the winter.\n\n**Squalane, beeswax, lecithin, lanolin** are also good skin replenishing ingredients.

So when I saw this Bring Green Artemisia pH Balancing Foam at my local kbeauty shop for $13.99 CAD I had to try it!\n\n\nSkin type: combination, dehydrated, acne and clog prone\n\n\nRound Lab Ingredients:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Butylene Glycol, Coco-Betaine, Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Artemisia Vulgaris Extract, Aspartic Acid, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl Glycol, Polyquaternium-67, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Malt Extract, 1,2- Hexanediol, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Allantoin, Madecassoside, Panthenol, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid\n\n\nBring Green Ingredients:\n\nGlycerin, Purified Water, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Lauryl Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Artemisia Capillaris Extract (8,000ppm), Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Malt Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Lavender Oil, Citrus Nobilis (Mandarin Orange) Peel Oil, Rosemary Leaf Oil, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Orange Peel Oil, Polyquaternium-39, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder (800ppm), Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Ethylhexylglycerin, Linalool, Limonene \n\n\nBoth cleansers claim to be pH balanced at 5.5 and gentle on the skin. That I will say is true, I never had irritation using the Round Lab, and in the 4 times I've used the Bring Green I didn't either. They both leave my skin feeing properly cleansed without being stripped or dry. \n\n\nTexture wise I prefer the Round Lab. It has a slightly thicker texture which foams up to a nice rich foam. However at times it can take a little extra effort to rinse away. The Bring Green does foam up just as well, but it isn't as rich of a foam. It contains very tiny visible bits of mugwort, but they're so small you don't feel them. It also rinses away much cleaner and faster. \n\n\nIn terms of scent the Round Lab doesn't really have one, it smells very faintly of mugwort. The Bring Green however has a light citrus scent due to the essential oils, but it isn't overpowering and doesn't linger once rinsed. \n\n\nOverall I think I might end up switching to the Bring Green. Although the user experience might not be as pleasant as when using the Round Lab, for almost half the price it's definitely worth keeping in my routine.",

Do note, I left out most of the tone-ups and lesser-known/accessible fast skincare brands. (I’ll update in the comments as more releases are rolled out as summer approaches. Just a bit... maybe...) So what’s hot this year?

It looks like Laneige recently (?) released a new sleeping mask with centella asiatica extract as its main selling point. At 60mL, it's smaller than the 70mL Water Sleeping Mask. It retails for about 32,000 KRW and so far I've seen it on Gmarket and Testerkorea. EDIT: It's also available for 20,000 KRW on Coupang for those who live in Korea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIngredients from [cosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_d77e425390.html)\n\n>water, propanediol, cetyl ethylhexanoate, squalane, hydrogenated poly(C6-14 olefin), gylcerin, panthenol, cetearyl alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Glyceryl stearate citrate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polyglyceryl-3 methylglucose distearate, Polyglyceryl-10 stearate, Hydroxyethyl acrylate / sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, butylene glycol, acrylates / c10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, gylceryl caprylate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA, Asiaticoside, Madecassic acid, Sorbitan isostearate, Asiatic acid, Melaleuca alternifolia leaf oil, Aureobasidium Pullulans Ferment, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Cymbopogon Martini Oil, Tocopherol\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI haven't used the Water Sleeping Mask before, but I've read mixed reviews on it and I'm curious how the two products will compare. The price is also right at that point where I'm not sure if I want to give it a shot. How about you guys? Anyone here going to go for this?",

The cream is an opaque white whereas the other sleeping masks are more gel like and translucent. It’s definitely not heavy or suffocating thick cream and it’s surprisingly spreadable and not as dense or oily as expected? I haven’t tried it so I’m useless lol but I hope that was some decent product description. I can’t remember if there’s a scent so probably nothing toooo strong. I have oilier skin so I really don’t use creams until the fall/winter. But I’m excited bc I love cica stuff and yeah Liah did hype it up a bit lol",

    "body": "Cleansing balms\n\nUPDATE 8/20/20: I’m adding a new balm I’ve recently tried (at the bottom of the list). If anyone has tried balms that you’d like to review in the format used, please post them below!!!\n\nOk, I’ve been (still am) on a mission to try and review all of the best/most popular cleansing balms in an effort to find the very very best one. I’ve tried nearly all of the most popular ones now. I searched everywhere for a comprehensive review of all of these and couldn’t find much so I’m hoping this will be a helpful resource to others who might be looking too. I welcome any input!!\n\nBackstory:\nI had been using The Body Shop’s Camomile balm since way before cleansing balms went mainstream, for probably a decade at least. I never knew there were other options until I was given a sample of Farmacy Green Clean and that’s what started me down this path - I wanted to see what the best option truly is! I liked my Camomile but could there be a better balm out there waiting for me??!\n\nAs always, YMMV but below are my results! All prices are in Canadian dollars and I have not researched pricing or availability in other countries.\n\nAs for what I actually use it for - I don’t wear a full face of makeup every single day but I do always wear a tinted sunscreen and mascara at a minimum, usually with a light powder foundation, blush and brow gel as well. I’ve tried every balm below on little to no makeup up to a full face of special occasion makeup.\n\nA note about ingredients - I’ve copied ingredient lists below from the brands websites. It was important to me to evaluate which ones have polyethylene (plastic) as well as essential oils.\n\nI would LOVE to hear your thoughts on those below or any other options I haven’t tried yet!\n\n**TL;DR FINAL VERDICT**: for a really good clean and soft face, Drunk Elephant’s Slaii is probably the best value in terms of value, packaging, ingredients, etc. I think this will continue to be my go to in the super dry winter months (especially since I tend to wear a bit thicker makeup in the winter), but to be honest, I think I will probably continue use my trusty Body Shop Camomile Cleansing Butter in the summers.\n\n**The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter**\n\nSize: 90mL (3oz).   \nPrice: $17 CAD @ The Body Shop reg price (but it’s often on sale).   \nPrice per oz: $5.67/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a wide and flat metal tin that is perfect for storing bobby pins or things in after (no plastic packaging, yay!). I have had a few times over the years where the threads get misaligned and stuck if it was tightened wrong and have needed to use a knife or screwdriver to pry it open again.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.   \nTexture & Emulsion: When scooping the balm out, it stays a little solid as you rub it into your skin. I wouldn’t say it emulsifies 100% to an oil but it feels great on the face and it’s super spreadable once warmed up. Doesn’t feel greasy/oily, more creamy.    \nScent: Very neutral scent, I don’t believe there are any added scents, essential oils or fragrances.    \nOn the Eyes: It doesn’t sting the eyes at all, but sometimes there’s a light film, if so I just blink a few times and it goes away.    \nAmount Required: A very small amount is required for my whole face (probably about 1/2 tsp max) and one tin easily lasts me a few months.    \nIngredients: No plastic to be found here! I also love that the ingredient list is short and sweet.    \nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Citric Acid.    \n\nVERDICT: I’ve loved this forever and to be honest, now that I’ve tried some others I’m not totally sure if the grass is actually greener on the other side. Still a top contender for me and the price is amazing! I do wonder though if my skin feels a just a tiny bit less moisturized after using this (compared to some of the others below)...\n\n**Farmacy Green Clean** \n\nSize: 90mL (3oz).   \nPrice: $45 CAD @ Sephora Canada.   \nPrice per oz: $15/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes, but the plastic tray it is stored in is very flimsy (sits in top of the tub).    \nTexture & Emulsion: When scooping the balm out, it melts easily and emulsifies quickly to rub around your face. Not greasy/oily.    \nScent: Light citrusy scent (almost like a lime sherbert or something) that smells so good I just want it all over my face all the time.    \nOn the Eyes: I do find it causes quite a bit of a film if I use it on the eyes (something I’d never really experienced before with the Camomile balm), no stinging unless it gets directly in the eyes. Makeup dissolves easily with minimal rubbing or tugging.    \nAmount Required: A small amount is required.    \nIngredients: While they say it’s not “microbeads” and that it melts in water, this product does contain polyethylene aka plastic. Take that for what you will. This product does have quite a bit of essential oils and extracts.    \n\nCetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Peg-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Peg-10 Isostearate, Polyethylene, Phenoxyethanol, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Amino Esters-1, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Amber Powder, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Water/ Aqua/ Eau, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Echinacea Purpurea Root Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Moringa Pterygosperma Seed Extract, Disodium Phosphate, Citric Acid.   \n\n\nVERDICT: I like it, I love it, I want some more of it. It smells amazing and feels luxurious on the face. Even though a little goes a long way, I do have a hard time justifying spending that much money on a first cleanser (and I don’t love that it contains polyethylene and a lot of essential oils).\n\n**Physicians Formula The Perfect Matcha 3-in-1 Melting Cleansing Balm**\n\nSize: 41mL (1.4oz).  \nPrice: $15 CAD @ Shoppers Drug Mart (also find at Walmart, Superstore etc).   \nPrice per oz: $10.71/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a screw top and an internal insert underneath. The insert holds the very tiny spatula.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes but it’s tiny, about the size of a safety pin.   \nTexture & Emulsion: It melts but it’s not overly emollient and isn’t as spreadable as others I’ve tried.    \nScent: Sort of a light essential oily/green tea/citrus scent. Some say it smells like Green Clean but I completely disagree and it’s nowhere near as nice of a smell.    \nOn the Eyes: A bit of eye stinging and a definite film was to be had.    \nAmount Required: Larger amount required to effectively remove makeup/sunscreen of any I’ve tried to date.    \nIngredients: Looks like we have that ever present plastic again (polyethylene) as well as fragrance, food colouring and citrus essential oils. Sad face.    \nCETYL ETHYLHEXANOATE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SORBETH-30 TETRAOLEATE, PEG-5 GLYCERYL TRIISOSTEARATE, PEG-10 ISOSTEARATE, POLYETHYLENE, FRAGRANCE/PARFUM, CAMELLIA SINENSIS LEAF POWDER*, PHYLLOSTACHYS EDULIS SHOOT WATER**, NELUMBO NUCIFERA FLOWER EXTRACT***, CITRUS NOBILIS (MANDARIN ORANGE) PEEL OIL, WATER/EAU, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBITAN SESQUIOLEATE, POLYGLYCERYL-10 OLEATE, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, LACTIC ACID, SODIUM BENZOATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, MALTODEXTRIN, YELLOW 5 (CI 19140), BLUE 1 (CI 42090). *MATCHA, **BAMBOO, ***LOTUS\n\nVERDICT: It’s a no from me, dawg. I couldn’t wait to finish this (relatively small) tub so I could try the next product. Having heard so many claims that it’s a perfect dupe for Green Clean, I was VERY disappointed. IMO they are nothing alike other than the colour (both balms are a light green colour). Smell, texture, effectiveness, price, ingredients - nothing wowed me.\n\n**Heimish All Clean Balm**\n\nSize: 120mL (4oz).   \nPrice: $23.95 CAD @ Amazon.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $5.99/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a flip top. Under the lid is a second lid which holds the included spatula. I like that the spatula is separated from the product but the extra lid makes it extra bulky in my cabinet.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes.   \nTexture & Emulsion: This balm I’d say emulsified almost immediately to a complete oil. It has a light oil feel (similar to say a sunflower oil, not as thick as an olive oil for example). It melts right away once it touches your face and feels like an oil face massage as you rub it in. It feels quite luxurious!    \nScent: Light floral scent (smells like essential oils). I like it and it’s not too overpowering IMO but I have heard some people find it too strong of a scent.    \nOn the Eyes: No stinging and the eye film is minimal.    \nAmount Required: I’d say a medium amount. Definitely more than the Camomile and Green Clean but it doesn’t seem excessive.    \nIngredients: There is polyethylene (plastic) in this as well as a number of essential oils which those with sensitive skin may wish to avoid.    \nEthylhexyl palmitate, cetyl ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, polyethylene, PEG-8 isostearate, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, cocos nucifera (coconut) fruit extract, citrus aurantifolia (lime) fruit extract, freesia refracta extract, iris versicolor extract, jasminum officinale (jasmine) extract, lilium tigrinum extract, leontopodium alpinum extract, nelumbium speciosum flower extract, narcissus pseudo-narcissus (daffodil) flower extract, rose extract, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel oil, lavandula angustifolia (lavender) oil, pelargonium graveolens flower oil, amyris balsamifera bark oil, citrus paradisi (grapefruit) peel oil, eucalyptus globulus leaf oil, melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) leaf oil, juniperus mexicana oil, boswellia carterii oil, citrus aurantium bergamia (bergamot) fruit oil, tocopheryl acetate, 1,2-hexanediol.\n\nVERDICT: There’s a lot to love about this - the scent and the texture are awesome, the price is definitely right, and I enjoy using it. My skin does always feel great after and it doesn’t dry me out. Cons for me are the bulky packaging, the amount of essential oils and the microbeads. I do like it but I’m not ready to stop my search quite yet.\n\n**Drunk Elephant Slaai**\n\nSize: 115mL (3.83oz).   \nPrice: $45 @ Sephora Canada.   \n(Note that this price includes a small vial of Bamboo Booster (physical exfoliating grains) as well).   \nPrice per oz: $11.75/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top. The spatula is magnetic and sits on top of the tub via a magnet (super handy for the makeup cupboard but also exposed/can pop off in a makeup bag while travelling).    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes.    \nTexture & Emulsion: Feels like softened butter and emulsifies to a thick oil feeling (similar to olive oil).     \nScent: Neutral, but a light olive oil type scent. I wish it had a nicer smell but it’s not offensive.     \nOn the Eyes: No stinging, easily removed eye makeup.    \nAmount Required: just a little, I’d say the smallest amount of any I’ve tried which is great news for it lasting a good while.\n\nIngredients: There don’t appear to be any polyethylene in this product and it’s lighter on the essential oils as well (good news if you have sensitive skin).\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Lauryl Laurate, Polyglyceryl-3 Laurate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Oil, Actinidia Chinensis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Ananassa (Strawberry) Seed Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl-2 Caprate, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Seed Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Schinziophyton Rautanenii Kernel Oil, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Ximenia Americana Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Glycerin\n\nVERDICT: Love love love! Definitely don’t use too much but when using a small amount the oiliness isn’t too much and it makes my face feel soft and clean. However, a second cleanse is a must.\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Balm**\n\nSize: 125mL (4.17oz).    \nPrice: $40 @ Sephora Canada.    \nPrice per oz: $9.59/oz.    \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.    \nTexture & Emulsion: Texture is comparable to a solid form coconut oil (similar to the Heimish balm in texture and colour also). Emulsified quickly to a soft oil.    \nScent: Unscented.    \nOn the Eyes: A light film, but no stinging. Takes extra rubbing to loosen stubborn eye makeup.    \nAmount Required: Medium amount (not as much as Heimish but not as little as Drunk Elephant).    \n\nIngredients: Very short ingredients list but unfortunately, those classic plastics are in this balm as well (polyethylene).\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate , Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil , Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride , Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate , Polyethylene , Peg-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate , Water\\Aqua\\Eau , Tocopherol , Phenoxyethanol\n\nVERDICT: Honestly, I have no real bad things to say. It’s utilitarian. It doesn’t feel luxurious but it works.\n\n\n**Acure Seriously Soothing 3 in 1 Serum**\n\nSize: 50mL (1.7 oz).   \nPrice: $23.49 @ well.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $13.82/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a glass jar with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.   \nTexture & Emulsion: A very soft solid serum that gets a little melty when room temperature is quite warm. It melts immediately in your hand/on your face and becomes a liquidy oil. It feels luxurious but does leave an oily film so a second cleanse is definitely required.\nScent: Strong scent due to the blue tansy oil (some might not like it but I do!)\nOn the Eyes: It’s very gentle and doesn’t sting or leave a film.\nAmount Required: Very little required. I’d say about half a teaspoon for my whole face including eye makeup.\nIngredients: No plastic here! Just very basic natural ingredients.\n\nCaprylic/capric Triglyceride, Euphorbia Cerifera(Candelilla) Wax, Copernicia Cerifera(Carnauba) Wax, Butyrospermum Parkii(Shea) Butter, Rosa Canina(Rosehip) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa(Argan) Oil, Tocopherol(Vitamin E), Tanacetum Annum (Blue Tansy)flower Oil, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant)seed Oil.\n\nVERDICT: I didn’t originally buy this for a cleanser, (just as a balm) but used it in a pinch as my first cleanse when I accidentally lost my jar of Slaai on a camping trip. I love how my skin feels soft and soothed after using it as a cleanser and it feels so silky on my skin. It is a little on the expensive side but I think it’s a keeper for sure seeing as it’s so versatile!!\n\n**Banila Co. Clean It Zero Original Balm Cleanser**\n\nSize: 100mL (3.3 oz).   \nPrice: $27.96 @ Amazon.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $8.40/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: TBD.   \nTexture &amp;amp; Emulsion: TBD.   \nScent: TBD.   \nOn the Eyes: TBD.    \nAmount Required: TBD.   \nIngredients: Doesn’t look like there’s any microbeads in this bad boy, thankfully!\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, PEG-10 Isostearate, Synthetic Wax, Onsen-Sui, Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Lithospermum Erythrorhizon Root Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Ethylhexylglycerin, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Bambusa Vulgaris Leaf/Stem Extract Aspalathus Linearis Extract, Angelica Archangelica Root Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Polydiethyleneglycol Adipate/IPDI Copolymer, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Acrylates/Methoxy PEG-15 Methacrylate Copolymer\n\nVERDICT: TBD - haven’t tried it yet but I plan to so I’ve included the info I was able to find so far.\n\n\nYour turn!

    "body": "I vaguely remember signing up for the notification for Charlotte Cho's new launch about a month or so back and received an email about the opening of her new brand, '[Then I Met You](https://thenimetyou.com/),' this morning. While I only looked at Soko Glam during the very beginning of my skincare days, I know it's a popular outlet for a lot of people since it's a convenient, one-stop-shop for a lot of the most popular Asian beauty products. \n\nIt appears that Charlotte Cho wants to dive into the realm of making her own skincare products and the new brand touts a very similar story to a lot of other online-owned brands. Based on the 'Our Story' page, she's focusing on \"**natural, premium ingredients, even when it means cutting into our own margin.\"** (ok, sis).  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe initial launch is a cleansing balm and a cleansing gel sold separately or as a pair. Here's the breakdown:\n\n* LIVING CLEANSING BALM (38.00 USD): **Massage this luxurious, sorbet-soft oil cleanser into the skin to melt away oil-based impurities, such as sunscreen, makeup and excess sebum while nourishing the skin with antioxidants, essential fatty acids and vitamin E.**\n\n>Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Trii-sostearate, PEG-8 Isostearate, Cera Microcristallina (Microcrystalline Wax/Cire Microcristalline), Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Ceresin, Synthetic Wax, Orbiignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Diospyros Kaki Fruit Extract, Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Rosemarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Ethylene/Propylene Copolymer\n\n* SOOTHING TEA CLEANSING GEL (36.00 USD): **This premium gel cleanser with antioxidant and antibacterial properties uses gentle cleansing agents to clear skin of any impurities, without stripping the skin. The mandarin citrus scents are designed to awaken your senses during every use.**\n\n>Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake), Aqua (Water/Eau), Sorbitol, Glycerin, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Diethylhexyl, Sodium Sulfosuccinate, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, 1,2 Hexanediol, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Diglycerin, Potassium Cocoate, Propylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Citrus Reticulata (Tangerine) Peel Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Panthenol, Gluconolactone, Butylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, T-Butyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously, I haven't tried any of them yet but I probably won't be investing in these products. First, neither are fungal acne friendly unfortunately. Second, holy price point batman. They're expensive on their own and together they're 68.00 USD. Also, and this isn't a dig at Charlotte Cho, but the way some of these companies advertise their products as if they're absolutely revolutionary kind of blows my mind and is overdone. Cleansing balms and cleansing gels aren't new and there are only oh-so many ways you can reinvent the wheel. Does anyone else have any initial reactions?",

The ingredients list for these products are relatively simple so there was little worry for breakouts. It definitely did not disappoint!\n\nA little background: I live in a humid country with dehydrated, combination, acne-prone skin. My main concerns with my skin right now is CCs, calming and hydrating.\n\n-\n**Greenful pH-Balanced Cleansing Foam** ***4.5/5 MRP***\n\n*Glycerin, Mung Bean Extract, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Lauryl Betaine, Betaine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Extract, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phaseolus Radiatus Seed Powder, Dextrin, Allantoin, Water, Ceramide NP, Green Tea Powder, Ethylhexylglycerin*\n\nCompared to all cleansers I’ve used so far, this was probably one of the best. It’s a pretty light green with a thick paste texture, and has small bits of what seems to be mung bean. In my opinion, you can smell mung bean, just slightly, but I didn’t mind it at all as it reminds me of those asian dessert places haha. The cleanser itself foams, but for me it wasn’t stripping at all. The cleanser contains lots of extracts which could be good for the skin, but honestly since it’s a wash-off product, I couldnt feel any of the benefits :”) The downside would be the price. In my country, it is sold for $12 for 80ml, which is more expensive than any other cleansers I’ve ever used :(\n\n-\n**Chamomile pH-Balanced Toner** ***3.5/5 WNRP***\n\n*Chamomile Flower Extract (80.65%), Propanediol, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Trehalose, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Betaine, Butylene Glycol, Allantoin, Cellulose Gum, Disodium EDTA, Ceramide-NP, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin*\n\nOkay so this was a 3.5 for me, just because of my skin type and the weather in my country. For oily-combo skin in humid weather, this toner felt slightly too moisturizing, so it felt kind of heavy for me. This would definitely be amazing for dry skin in the summer or oily skin in the winter. It’s a runny toner with a slight slip if you rub it against your hands. I could smell a bit of the chamomile as I apply it to my face but it wasn’t overpowering at all. It was soothing, but the main thing it did for my skin was honestly the moisturizing/hydrating component. If that was what you’re looking for in a runny toner, I’d definitely recommend this!\n\n-\n**Cicaful ampoule** ***4.5/5 WRP***\n\n*Centella Asiatica Extract (81.44%), Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyglycerin-3, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Tromethamine, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylate/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Hydroxyacetophenone*\n\nI understand you probably are sick with all the cica products dominating the market, but this ampoule was *really good* for me. This ampoule is clear and very viscous, almost like a gel but still relatively runny. As you rub it on your skin it becomes like water, and sinks in reaaally quick. I’ve heard people say this was hydrating for them, but it wasn’t *that* hydrating for me. The calming effect was *amazing* though—redness in my face can minimize as soon as a few hours after application. It felt cooling and very soothing to the skin. Though I would say I run out of the bottle relatively quicker than other serums haha. If you need a calming, no fuss ampoule with minimal ingredients and low breakout risk, this is definitely one to try out!\n\n-\n**Chamomile pH-Balanced Lotion** ***3/5 WNRP***\n\n*Chamomile Flower Extract, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Ethylhexyl Stearate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Kelp Extract, Eclipta Prostrata Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Acmella Oleracea Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Purified Water, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Butylene Glycol, Squalane (Plant-derived), Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Fructooligosaccharides, Beta-Glucan, Allantoin, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide-NP, Sodium hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Pentylene Glycol*\n\nCompared to other lotions/emulsions I’ve tried, I don’t think I prefer this one. This lotion was a bit thick and holds it’s shape better when you try making it run down. It has the chamomile smell similar to the toner, but far more minimal that you really can’t smell it unless you’re trying to. It’s very moisturizing, probably enough if you use this as a moisturizer in the summer. It spreads well and you don’t need a lot to cover your entire face, but it sinks in less quick, so after using it, it feels like you’ve put a legit cream moisturizer on your face. This was *not* a bad product, but it’s probably better geared towards those with dry skin.\n\n-\n**Hyaluronic Aqua Moisturizer** ***4/5 WRP***\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Methyl Trimethicone, Methylpropanediol, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP, Copolymer, Raffinose, Betaine, Sodium Hyaluronate (100ppm), Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid (100ppm), Allantoin, Madecassoide, Beta-glucan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ethylcellulose, Butylene Glycol Cocoate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Polyquaternium-51*\n\nRight off the bat, the texture surprised me. This came out as a translucent balm-like gel with no scent, like a less strong vaseline, so for those with dehydrated skin, this one is for you! I was kinda scared using it thinking it was going to be heavy, but I have been using it at night and it’s done wonders for my skin the next morning. Perhaps because my skin is dehydrated, but with this product, my skin texture really improved. As this also was not like a very emollient moisturizer, it felt like it was a layer sealing in all the serum and toner I used before and did not feel clogging at all. Honestly, this product turned out faaaaaar better than I expected!\n\n-\n\nOverall I am really impressed with the brand. None of their products broke me out, which is incredible! All in all I’d say I recommend the cleanser and the cica ampoule for all skin types, the chamomile line for dry skin types (or combo/oily in the winter) and the aqua moisturizer for dehydrated skin. I hope this review was helpful for you and have a great day!",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

    "body": "Good Skin Days On The Bright Side Moisturizer\n\nWhat an interesting journey it has been having the Soko Glam Good Skin Days products in my routine.\n\nThings started off great with the C’s The Day Serum, fell apart a bit with the Prime Time Cleansing Toner, and then rebounded with the wonderful A New Leaf Cream Cleanser I’m so happy to have had the chance to try out all of their offerings and end on a really good note with the On The Bright Side Moisturizer.\n\nThis lightweight/creamy gel style moisturizer reminds me a lot of some of the other lotions I have had in my routine over the past few months. Products like the Oat So Simple Water Cream and By Wishtrend VItamin 75 Maximizing Cream have a similar consistency/feel.\n\nThe offering from Good Skin Days focuses on hydration, nourishment, brightening/probiotic power with ingredients like Sake (the first ingredient to be exact), Squalane, Ceramides, and Madecassoside.\n\nThe formulation is pretty simple compared to some other moisturizers I have used and with  the addition of a few other ferments I didn’t mention above...the ingredients list reads more like a first treatment essence than a moisturizer lol.\n\nOne of the main things that stood out to me upon initial application was the super lightweight and cooling application. The On The Bright Side Moisturizer glides onto skin easily and absorbs quickly. On hot summer days/nights...I really appreciated the effect.\n\nI worried that this light/gel-like product wouldn't be enough for me on days where my skin felt dry or hot wind zapped all of my skin’s moisture. But, I found that layering/customizing each application of this moisturizer was sufficient in keeping my skin happy and hydrated throughout the day. A bit more on dry days...a bit less when I was planning on staying in. All without feeling greasy or heavy.\n\nHowever, those that prefer something a bit more “intense” may need to layer another cream or product on top of the On The Bright Side Moisturizer in the PM (I took to adding a few drops of the Sweet Chef Beauty Oil on certain nights).\n\nAs a bonus to the general hydration/nourishment I noticed from this product...the fermented ingredients do come through to offer some brightening benefit. The On The Bright Side Moisturizer really seemed to compliment/boost my first treatment essence (I was using Iope Bio Essence alongside this moisturizer) as I noticed slightly faster results in terms of skin tone balancing and glow.\n\nFor me, the Good Skin Days On The Bright Side Moisturizer was the stand-out of the range and something I would totally come back to. It might not be quite enough during the dry/cold Colorado winters but I could see it being an excellent choice for the rest of the year.\n\nOh, and it smells like root beer gummies...just thought I’d throw that in there.\n\nFull Ingredients List: Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake), Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Squalane, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Lactobacillus Ferment Lysate, Isopentyldiol, Water, Ceramide NP, Propanediol, Glycerin, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Streptococcus Thermophilus Ferment, Madecassoside, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nWhere To Buy (Soko Glam $24.00 USD): [https://sokoglam.com/collections/good-skin-days/products/good-skin-days-on-the-bright-side-moisturizer](https://sokoglam.com/collections/good-skin-days/products/good-skin-days-on-the-bright-side-moisturizer) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4wmbx52pvsj51.jpg?width=5472&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b16f7800b910516d3a0fd898fc91e743bd09169",

    "body": "Review Day 1/7\nI recently purchased most of the new acne line by Pyunkang yul and I'm pleasantly surprised.\nUnlike the minimal ingredients the other lines have has these products contain a whole list of beneficial ingredients such as Centella Asiatica, Licorice Root extract, Niacinamide, a peptide complex as well as many more. The star ingredients for this line is white willow Extract and Forsythia fruit extract. \n\nPyunkang Yul ACNE Toner:\nIt's very watery so great for those with oily skin. It absorbs pretty quickly and has a sweet scent despite it not having any essential oils. After two weeks of using it I prefer the essence toner to it but it did help with the breakout I had and helped with clearing out my pores but it's not hydrating enough for me to see using in the long term. \n\nPyunkang Yul ACNE Facial Cleanser:\nMade with almost the exact same stuff but includes Citric acid and other agents for cleansing the skin. I'm not going to lie I love the cleanser it's so gentle and uses micro bubble technology. You might be disappointed that it doesn't lather well but I don't really care abut that aspect. It's a thicker consistency than their ato cleanser and 500ml cleanser but thinner than the foaming cleanser and has a pH of 5.5-6. My friend tested the pH on her one and she got a pH of almost 5.8. It also doesn't strip me of any moisture i feel more hydrated after cleansing. I'll definitely repurchase when I run out i prefer it over the Cosrx salicylic acid cleanser or my cereve hydrating cleanser. \n\nPyunkang Yul ACNE Spot Cream:\nI got this for my sister but tried some myself I didn't really notice any difference on my skin but my sister who has sensitive acne prone skin saw improvements on her acne. I prefer to my a'pieu pimple patches over it. \n\nThis line is perfect for acne prone sensitive skin while people like me that has combo- dry skin might not like it as much it. \n\nEdit (I think their listed on cosdna if you want to check what is what) : Ingredients for the cleanser\nWater Cocamidopropyl Betaine Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate PEG-75 Acrylates Copolymer Glycerin Disodium cocoamphodipropionate PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate Dimethyl Sulfone Pyridoxine HCl Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract Forsythia Suspensa Fruit Extract Butylene Glycol Centella Asiatica Extract Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract Sodium Chloride Copper Tripeptide-1 Allantoin Citric acid Potassium Hydroxide Sodium Benzoate Phenoxyethanol Disodium EDTA\n\nIngredients for the toner:\nWater Butylene Glycol Dimethyl Sulfone Pyridoxine HCl Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract Niacinamide Forsythia Suspensa Fruit Extract Centella Asiatica Extract Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract Copper Tripeptide-1 Glycerin Hydroxyacetophenone Myrtus Communis Extract Tropaeolum majus Extract Ethylhexylglycerin Disodium EDTA\n\nSpot cream ingredients \n\nWater Pentylene Glycol Glycerin Behenyl Alcohol Cetearyl Alcohol Niacinamide Glyceryl Stearate Dimethyl Sulfone Silica Polyacrylate-13 Polyisobutene Polysorbate 20 Allantoin Madecassoside Asiaticoside Panthenol Pyridoxine HCl Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract Xanthan Gum Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer Forsythia Suspensa Fruit Extract Butylene Glycol Centella Asiatica Extract Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract Copper Tripeptide-1 Hydroxyacetophenone Myrtus Communis Extract Tropaeolum majus Extract Ethylhexylglycerin Disodium EDTA\n\n*For the cleanser and toner everything has an EWG rating lower than 3 these are all available in sale on style korean for $10 USD and under (shipping was dreadful to Canada its probably good if you live in the US) \n\nEdit x2? I just saw it on yesstyle too and they are doing a sale on the products as well . To clarify i broke out by using the moisture cream from this brand I added those products plus olivarrier products to sooth my skin. I'm planning on reviewing that brand later this week \n",

    "body": "Just received my order of Illiyoon's Ceramide Cream and initially, I thought I received a fake cuz of the differences (specifically '7 Free' vs '9 Free' and the text on the label) but I did a bit of research and turns out its the new reformulated version 😭 Bought it from TOP Korea then cross checked other shops and it seems SUI SUI's stocks will be the new one too.\n\nRight after I fell in love with my experience sa old formula from the mini bottle I bought in trying to heal my skin barrier 🫠 Not doomposting it naman but like... I hate it when something works really well for me and they go reformulate the whole thing. The money spent is no joke either.\n\nI realized too late and already applied it on my whole face without patch testing first so... we'll see how it goes\n\nSo far though...\nConsistency wise, new formula is a bit more watery compared sa old na very thick. \n - New feels a little lighter and less greasy vs. Old thats heavier to the point that u can feel it on you even on the back of my hand.\n - Maybe it could be a good thing with the PH weather. Cant say if the new one is less moisturizing yet but comparing them on my hands, Old formula is more slippery/greasy, new one feels a little matte thats slightly greasy if that makes sense?\n\nScent wise, theres a subtle difference but new one is still unscented.\n\nI'll update in maybe a week and see how it goes. Hopefully it still performs the same and nothing happens to me lmao. So far naman I'm not itching yet lol\n\nHere are the ingredients for comparison!\nTLDR the little search I did: \"One of the former occlusives used was Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, which was replaced by much lighter, less occlusive emollients like ethylhexyl stearate and dicaprylyl carbonate.\" + Added Madecassoside\n\nOLD\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Stearic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Palmitic Acid, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Arachidyl Alcohol, C14-22 Alcohols, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA(Ceramide PC-104), Polyacrylate-13, Arachidyl Glucoside, Mannitol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Polyisobutene, Glyceryl Caprylate, Panax Ginseng Root Water, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Carbomer, Perilla Ocymoides Seed Extract, Myristic Acid, Arachidic Acid, Cholesterol, Bupleurum Falcatum Root Extract, Angelica Acutiloba Root Extract, Ophiopogon Japonicus Root Extract, Glucose, Silica, Glycine Max (Soybean) Oil, Ceramide NP, Phytosphingosine, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Tocopherol, Canola Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract\n\nNEW\nPurified water, butylene glycol, glycerin, ethylhexyl stearate, dimethicone, dicaprylyl carbonate, behenyl alcohol, stearic acid, palmitic acid, cetyl ethylhexanoate, hydrogenated poly(C6-14 olefin), 1,2-hexanediol, arachidyl alcohol, C14-22 alcohol, cetyl-pigmentohydroxyethyl palmitamide (ceramide CPP-40 7622 ppm), polyacrylate-13, mannitol, arachidyl glucoside, C12-20 alkyl glucoside, hydrogenated polyisobutene, glyceryl caprylate, ethylhexylglycerin, polyglyceryl-10 laurate, hydrogenated lecithin, ethylhexyl palmitate, Dimethiconol, Ginseng Water, Carbomer, Sorbitan Isostearate, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Gold Extract, Propanediol, Cholesterol, Silica, Plum Extract, Arachidic Acid, Black Soybean Oil, Squalane Madecassoside, Polyglyceryl-10 Pentastearate, Tocopherol, Ceramide NP (4ppm), Oleic Acid, Phytosphingosine, Pentylene Glycol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Canola Oil, Rosemary Leaf Extract",

Got sick for a while so I couldn't muster the strength to be in front of a screen for long during the past few days.\n\nAnyway, here we go! **Please check replies for continuations as I'll be splitting it due to the character limit!**\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that my experiences with the old formula and the new formula have both been about 2 weeks-ish so I cannot give a HG / experienced user comparison with old formula.\n\nSkin Type: Oily-Combination (normally) but currently Dry and Sensitive due to a damaged skin barrier\n\n* Just like the old formula, I didn’t experience any breakouts, clogged pores, or signs of irritation *(just a few small pimples here and there as im nearing my period)*\n* As mentioned previously, the new formula is definitely lighter and easier to absorb vs. the old formula. I used it side by side one day and the side with the new formula didn’t feel as heavy and the finger swipe wasn’t as greasy.\n* I’m not sure if its viable as a morning moisturizer now, but I did use it as such under my Omi Sunbears Sunscreen. \n   * I avoided using this sunscreen when I damaged my skin barrier as it dried so matte it made my skin so dry and my old moisturizers *(Hyaloo and Klued)* weren’t enough for it. But the new formula was just right to keep me moisturized but not oily with this sunscreen\n\nPART 1/2",

    "body": "This was my first time using a non-Western sunscreen and I don't think I can come back to that ever again. I already tried a Purito product that worked well for me so I was pretty excited about their new unscented version of the sunscreen. The consitency of the sunscreen is very similar (if not the same) as a light moisturizer. It applied very nicely and was pretty hydrating. I didn't seem to experience any pilling when applied over my other skincare products, so if you do apply makeup over this sunscreen you'd probably be safe. After applying, it left no whitecast (I have a lighter skintone with yellow undertones) or any greasy residue on my face. Most sunscreens I wear leave a gross sunscreen smell on my skin, but as advertised this one left no scent. It also doesn't contain any essential oils like its counterpart, so anyone sensitive skin would have a safer time trying out this version. I would recommend this sunscreen and would purchase it again for myself.

    "body": "As the title suggests, this is my current sunscreen collection, and I'll be reviewing the products and mentioning the ones I love and the ones I don't ! (This post might be half cooked, not very organised and all over the place, but it's my first time, so bear with me :P) \n\nSo as I mentioned, this is my first post here (eeep! :D) and initially I thought of sharing my entire shelfie, but I realised that being the junkie/hoarder I am, it'd end up being a terribly long post , hence after much deliberation I decided to post different categories of products separately  (sunscreens, moisturisers, serums etc) and after I'm done with that, I shall be making a post with only the products I use in my  current skincare routine!\n\nWithout further adieu let's get started! Please do like, share,  subscribe and don't forget to hit the bell icon!... lmao jk\n\n**Skin Type** : Oily - Combination, Comedonal Acne Prone, Rosacea Prone,\n\n**Major skin concerns** : Hypersensitivity, Non inflammatory acne, Sebum Production. \n\n**Age** : Early - Mid 20s, F\n\n**Current Climatic Conditions** : Semi- Arid, Dry winter \n\nSpecie : Homo Sapien\n\nHeight : wait.. I'm not supposed to divulge all these details! \n\n**Product reviews** :\n\n*Note* : None of these products have been used by me on a strictly daily basis, except for a week (or two) in a row during vacations, as I rarely step out of the house (lockdown, duh!) and don't apply sunscreen indoors (\\*gaasp\\* 😨)   \n Rest assured, I've reapplied some when out, and have used them on and off in a span of 6 months. \n\nFrom L-R \n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/s2C99g0N/IMG-20211119-184403.jpg\n\n\n**1-  Nivea Sun Protect And Moisture, moisturising sun and collagen protection SPF 50+ PA++++** \n\n**Quantity** **- Price** : 125 ml - ₹495 MRP\n\n(bought on Amazon for ₹396)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, Titanium Dioxide, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Alcohol Denat, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Panthenol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Myristyl Myristate, Silica, Cetyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Stearyl Alcohol, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Methylparaben, Dimethicone, Trisodium EDTA, Ethylparaben, Sodium Citrate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citric Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Linalool, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Eugenol, Coumarin, Methyl Benzoate, Benzoic Acid, BHT, Parfum/Fragrance\n\n**Texture** : White - Chalky Color. Medium - Thick Consistency   \n , you have to rub it in for a while for it to get completely absorbed, medium drying speed. Kinda greasy, semi matte finish. Leaves a moderate white cast, not a ghastly one though. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. Smells mostly of Alcohol! (it's one of the ingredients, so obviously..), fragrance is definitely not unnoticeable, but I don't mind it for my body, lingers around for a while. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : Hell yeah! It won't wear off unless you bathe, it survives water splashes and friction from clothes. Be careful while applying it on your feet though, I slip a lot while walking, esp when there's a rush and I put on sandals right after applying it. Give it ample time to dry before stepping out. \n\n**Reapplication** : Since the lotion sits thick on the skin, reapplication is not a bliss, the white cast becomes more noticeable after reapplication, and if you sweat after, oh god it feels a heavy /sticky mess lol, also tends to attract dust, but it's for the body, so I can compromise. 🤷‍♀️\n\n**Overall experience** : It's the best body sunscreen I've tried so far, with the highest protection and I think the brand can be trusted for its spf claims. \n\nI tried using it on my face once, oh nooo, I will never do that again! it kept moving around and just wouldn't get absorbed, plus it stung like hell because of the alcohol, and I literally felt like I was applying fevicol!   \n For my body, yep a thumbs up! \n\n\\*But\\*, if you get acne on your arms  (my arms have a tendency to break out / get textured if I use the wrong product) it wouldn't be the best choice, it seals and chokes the pores, I'd prefer something lighter. I usually wear tops/suits with long sleeves, so not much of the arm is exposed. below the elbow it feels comfortable enough. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WRP**, Hit! (for the body) \n\n**2- Iba Halal Invisible Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++**   \n **Quantity - Price** : 80 ml - ₹395 MRP\n\n(I bought it on Amazon for ₹ 337)\n\n**Ingredients** : WATER CONTAINING EXTRACTS OF ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) EXTRACT & HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) WATER, WATER & ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE & BENZOPHENONE-3 & BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE & PHOSPHOLIPIDS & 1,3-BUTYLENE GLYCOL & PHENOXYETHANOL, GLYCERINE, AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/BEHENETH-25 METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL AND TRIETHYLENE GLYCOL, ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE, ALUMINIUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE, NIACINAMIDE (VITAMIN B3), TITANIUM DIOXIDE, PERFUME, DISODIUM EDTA, SODIUM HYDROXIDE\n\n**Texture** : White color. Light lotion - cream consistency, very lightweight and water like, kind of runny, it trickles down when you place a dallop on the palm and tilt it.   \n The Best consistency of a sunscreen I've used so far! Not at all heavy, takes some time to dry, esp when using larger amounts (I use 2-3 finger lengths) and still it doesn't feel too much on my face, easy to work with, requires a lot of gentle massaging because it's watery and takes some time to dry and settle in. High dry time.   \n It contains no silicones! My oily skin loves it! Doesn't give a matte finish though, on the glossy (satin?) side, but nothing bothersome.  \n Doesn't leave a white cast! On the Low I'd say, because of the presence of Titanium Dioxide. Absolutely love the texture. Skin feels very hydrated and plump and non greasy. (taaza nikhaar 😆) \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Has a \"fresh\" smell, (bamboo room freshener? idk something like that), moderate level, doesn't linger a lot. I haven't found a \\*good\\* fragrance free budget (\\*my\\* budget) friendly sunscreen yet. So I'm okay with this for now. Sometimes I'm guilty of enjoying the fragrance 😅 because all other products I use are strictly fragrance free. \n\n**Water Resistant?** :  Nope, doesn't survive water splashes or sweat (it won't come off completely in a single splash though, will wash off when sweating profusely) white colored droplets roll down the face if out in the sun for long. (the survival time is slightly more than the La Shield urban protection mineral sunscreen gel though) \n\n**Reapplication** : Breezy! Since it's lightweight, although, you might experience some moving around if there's a \\*lot\\* of product, I'd suggest applying pea by pea instead of taking a finger length at one go, I squeezed out a good amount once while in the car and kept massaging it in for a couple minutes (or more) and felt embarrassed at the weird looks my family and people outside the car gave me.. So yeah.. lol.  It doesn't feel uncomfortable after layers have been built up. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I love it! Although I'm not sure if the sunscreen has undergone the required tests to justify the actual sun protection claims, but that's all I got so far, it fits my requirements of no silicones, negligible white cast, high declared protection, non oily texture, and most importantly budget! \n\nOne important point, it stings when used after physical / chemical exfoliation. So you may want to avoid it after threading / waxing / scrubbing / masking / exfoliating.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Hit! **WRP** (for face) \n\n**3- La Shield Pollution Protect Mineral Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹280 MRP\n\n(bought it on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Purified Water, Octinoxate, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Caprylyl Methicone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Diisopropyl Adipate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetearyl Alcohol, Brassica Campestris/Aleurites Fordi Oil Copolymer, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Phenoxyethanol, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, C20-22 Alcohols, Isohexadecane, Fragrances, Aluminium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 60, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trolamine, Disodium Edetate, Sorbitan Isostearate\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Light - Medium gel - cream consistency. Lightweight. Doesn't require a lot of rubbing in. Doesn't move around a lot. Leaves a Low- Moderate white cast. Not the kind typical to mineral sunscreens, but more than the Iba Halal sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Lingers.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Naah, it melts away almost instantly if you happen to sweat while applying it, just a spray (accidental rain drop for example) on the face and it wears off from that spot, minor sweating and it rolls down the cheeks, doesn't adhere to the skin. \n\n**Reapplication** : Medium ease. Moves around, kind of sticky when built up. Medium White cast (visibly noticeable) after reapplication. \n\n**Overall Experience** : Um, I had expected a better performance from this one, looking at the ingredients and all, but it stings around the eyes, and on the face, makes my face somewhat tacky, my face becomes oily by afternoon (if applied in the morning). Personally I didn't like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Miss. **WNRP**.\n\n**4-  La Shield Fisico Matte Sunscreen Gel SPF 50+ PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹630 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹441)\n\n**Ingredients** : Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate\n\n**Texture** : White color, pasty. Very thick, \\*very\\* silicone-y (it's silicone based.. So), chokes the skin, spreadability is good, doesn't require a lot of massaging in, quick dry time. Moderate - slightly high white cast. Makes my face sweat! \n\n**Fragrance** : No. Silicone like.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Definitely. Strong staying power. Survives sweating and water splashes too well. Requires double cleanse or a heavy duty face wash to remove. \n\n**Reapplication** : Hahaha! Go ahead and try it if you want to look like a freshly frosted cake! Don't even \\*think\\* about it. Unless you plan to scare people with your literal white walker look. Been there, done that. I'm forever terrified, and will \\*never\\* do it again.\n\n**Overall Experience** : It's a thick paste, Stings around the eyes, which was surprising it being a physical sunscreen (probably because the zinc is micronized? idk) Reapplication is painful, can't apply more than 2 pea sized amount in the first application. Attracts dirt, Chokes my pores, I can't afford to apply something so pore clogging and then strip my facial skin away to remove it.   \n For me, it's not worth the price performance wise.   \n I'm finishing it off as a primer for occasions, smoothes out the face surface, my face gleamed during diwali :P\n\n**Repurchase status** : Miss! **WNRP**.\n\n**5- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Mineral Sunscreen, SPF 50+ PA++++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹295 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹236)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Sodium Chloride, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Perfume, Magnesium Sulphate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Thick cream. Low - medium effort required for blending in the skin. Doesn't move around a lot. Medium - High Dry time. Low white cast (for a mineral sunscreen), medium matte finish. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : No, doesn't survive low- medium sweating. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I haven't used this sunscreen much. My mom used it a few times, and the moment I saw it melting down her face I didn't want to use it. Could have been a great affordable mineral sunscreen, but it's not even mildly water resistant, so I instantly passed on it. Might give it a try in the future. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WNRP**. \n\n**6- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Sunblock and Anti Tan Lotion Tinted Sunscreen, SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 60 ml - ₹245 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water,Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Propylene Glycol, Glyceryl Monostearate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Kaolin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Sodium Sulfite, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Extract, Saxifraga Sarmentosa Extract, Acetyl Tyrosine, Arbutin, Glutathione, Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dimethiconol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, Perfume, Disodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ci 77492, Ci 77491, Ci 77499\n\n**Texture** : Orange color (literally). Medium consistency lotion like. Lightweight. Medium matte finish. Easy application. Doesn't require much effort to blend in. But the color is a literal disaster, it's impossible to apply a full finger length of this sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. On the Higher side. \n\n**Water Resistant** : Maybe a bit more than the mineral sunscreen variant? Not sure, rubs off on the mask \\*very\\* readily. Haven't noticed orange sweat yet, maybe because I haven't worn it enough. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. But I'm pretty sure it's not possible provided the intense color. \n\n**Overall Experience** : It could have been a good,  affordable tinted sunscreen, but the tint is just a disaster.. It dulls my face overall, and it doesn't even work as a bb cream (or sorts) although I don't expect to provide any coverage as per se (which it doesn't anyhow), but I can't find a way to finish it off other than applying it on my hands. Maybe color corrector?? Omg what'd I just come up with 😃💡. Let's see lol \n\n**Repurchase status** : Nope. **WNRP**. \n\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/RVccCB01/IMG-20211119-173651.jpg\n\n**7-** **Malibu LipCare Balm, SPF 30, UVA/UVB** (watermelon variant) \n\n**Quantity - Price** : 5 gm - ₹249-₹299\n\n(bought 2 on amazon for ₹199 each )\n\n**Ingredients** (watermelon) : Petrolatum, Paraffinum Liquidum (Mineral Oil), Paraffin Wax, Ozokerite Wax, Homosalate, Octocrylene, Carnauba Wax, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Flavor  \n May Contain: Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Citral, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol\n\n**Texture** : Ultra Rich, stiff stick, application is not smooth and breezy, tugs and pulls on the lips if you rush it, tightly press it against the surface, let the balm melt and glide on slowly. Makes lips very soft though. Staying power is great! \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Watermelon. Strong. \n\n**Taste** : Bitter Af! Avoid applying it on the insides and corners to keep it from seeping in. \n\n**Water resistant?** : Definitely! Survives liquids (tea, water, juice for me) not very heavy meals. Apply a thick layer to fight the mask rubbing off. Stays on for hours, afternoon - evening, for example. Keeps lips very soft and supple, no stinging sensation. \n\n**Overall Experience** : The only lip balm with spf 30 (plus uva/uvb protection) that has all the ingredients disclosed. Can't ask for more.   \n The only issue is, I can't use it with my waterproof /transferproof matte lipsticks. It makes them water loving and easily transferable, need to figure something out for that.. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : Unless I find some other lip balm with spf 30 mentioning all the ingredients, in a more affordable range, with no bitter taste, and better sunscreen filters. I **WRP** this. \n\nThats about it! Congrats for making it this far! Thanks!\n\n*Edited to add links to images, since I couldn't upload them with the post*",

I feel like I often have to choose between having the complexion of a sad day, or looking **so** greasy.\n\nMy skin ranges from light-medium to medium-dark. To visualize: I'm Doja Cat when it's cold out and Kerry Washington once I can get some sun - strong golden tones. I tan fast, with or without SPF (though I am very pro-SPF), and have burned exactly once in my entire lifetime. I'm still not interested in putting myself at risk for skin cancer.\n\nI'm not going to claim that this sunscreen will not leave a white cast on people with deeper and darker skin-tones than my own, though I truly hope it works for you. So... here's my review!\n\n**Banana Boat: Light as Air, 50+ SPF UVA/UVB Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Lotion**\n\n* **Price**: $5.99 on sale at Kroger, regularly $10.99 here.\n* **Size**: 6 oz. ($0.99/oz. on sale, regularly $1.83/oz.)\n* **Scented**? Yes, it's pretty noticeable at first but fades (not completely). I'm VERY sensitive to scents (I can't wear perfumes, they trigger migraines), but it's not the usual *Eau de Banana Boat* I expected.\n* **White cast?** None on my skin tone. Absolutely none. It's decently liquid-y for the SPF, and if you apply it more liberally, it can be rubbed in and absorbs fairly quickly.\n* **Greasy**? NOPE. It's not one of those slick sunscreens. Alcohol is the fifth sunscreen, and I'm no scientist, but I suspect this may contribute to it.\n* **Pilling**? None. I tried applying more and more to dare it to pill, it didn't! Usually, sunscreen will build up and 'highlight' my hair follicles/stubble (I have hairy arms and can't be bothered to shave regularly) - didn't happen!\n* **Ingredients**: Water, Diisopropyl Adipate, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Tapioca Starch, Acrylates/C12-22 Alkyl Methacrylate Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Coco-Glucoside, Chlorphenesin, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, Fragrance, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice.\n\nI read a lot of reviews on here and think \"Yeah, can't relate!\" since a lot of sunscreens with 50+ SPF have white casts, and many AB sunscreens are either intentionally white cast-y or, worse, pink-tinted, which are both a no for me. \n\nI hope this block of text helps another medium-skinned beaut who has been walking around intermittently looking like a tombstone and/or bacon grease. Feel free to ask any questions, I haven't seen much about this sunscreen before, and I've been trying it out for a while now :).",

I saw this when it first came out and at the time there was nothing on it online and figured I'd let others be the guinea pig. I've been looking for a chemical sunscreen for my face. I myself am white but obviously not enough because the white cast looks horrible, especially if I haven't shaved. And the tinted sunscreens are great, but then their too dark and it can make for some uncomfortable looks out in public. Plus, they cost more per ounce and require more care in application. But then most chemical sunscreens aren't as safe for sensitive, acne prone skin like myself. Several of the supposedly sensitive ones I saw today at Target still had oxybenzone and other irritating ingredients. But this one didn't. So yeah-thanks for the heads up. I'm hopeful about it now!",

Apart from some Neutrogena products and No7 Beautiful Skin Blemish Defence Serum, they contain \"alcohol denat.\", which is a dealbreaker for me as I try to avoid drying alcohols as much as I can. \n\nBHAs are few and very far in between, in addition to not being labelled as such and most probably without the percentage of salicylic acid contained or whether it's in the right pH to be effective. \n\nI haven't done a price comparison, and since I found them in Boots I've used the online site's price point. Prices are only as a guide, they may be cheaper/more expensive elsewhere. Ingredients are highlighted to point out the position of salicylic acid, as well as presence of drying alcohols and parfum for those irritated by them. \n\nAdditional suggestions, opinions and reviews are very welcome!\n\n* PRODUCT: Boots Skin Clear Deep Blackhead Cleansing Lotion\n\nPRICE: £2.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua (Water), **Alcohol denat.**, **Salicylic acid**, PPG-1-PEG-9 lauryl glycol ether, Butylene glycol, Potassium hydroxide, Ammonium glycyrrhizate, **Parfum (Fragrance)**, Dipropylene glycol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Deep Cleansing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.29 for 65 exfoliating pads\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat., Salicylic Acid,** Isoceteth-20, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Hydroxide, Triethanolamine, Allantoin, **Parfum**, **Menthol**, Benzyl Salicylate, Disodium EDTA, Limonene, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Pads\n\nPRICE: 5.39 for 65 pads\n\nINGREDIENTS:Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, **Salicylic Acid**, Hydrogen Peroxide, **Parfum**, Sodium Hydroxide, Dextrin, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Superfruits Refreshing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.07\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, Glycerin, **Salicylic Acid**, **Parfum**, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Sodium Hydroxide, Propylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Limonene, Citronellol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Hexyl Cinnamal, Rubus Idaeus Juice, Trideceth-9, Vaccinium Macrocarpon Fruit Juice, Geraniol, Bisabolol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Garnier Pure Active line (various)\n\nPRICE: from £4.99 to £7.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: I can't find an ingredients list anywhere, which is frustrating but as a guide, I remember putting all the Garnier products down because they contain \"Alcohol Denat.\" The packaging lists 2% salicylic acid.

While I could see the improvements, it would feel like my skin was burning. I'm not sure if it's due to the age of the bottle, or just the ingredients, but I discontinued use.\n\nThen I bought *Boots Skin Clear Deep Cleansing Lotion* which is exactly the same as the Blackhead version just with an extra word on the front. It feels just like[ L'Occitaine's Shea Butter Toner](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8adf20777.html) that's alcohol free, but a month in and I don't really feel like it's doing anything.\n\nI used to use Neutrogena a lot and I really liked their grapefruit range, but the *Neutrogena VISIBLY CLEAR Pink Grapefruit Oil-Free Moisturiser* stopped being effective far too quickly. It goes on really light which I like, but after a while my skin either feels dry, or really oily. I felt it was super hit and miss.\n\nWith the Neutrogena Visibly Clear Spot Stress Control Hydrating Spot Treatment, is that just on acne, do you put it on under moisturiser or as a moisturiser?",

Photos 5 and 6 are from an Orang County, CA TJ Maxx. Stores are clean and organized.\n\nHAUL and mini review: (dry/dehydrating/30/Socal)\n\n**Laneige cica sleeping mask $20 60 mL**. My ride or die cica cream that I always need to have in stock. I ran out in March and was gonna buy more on my Japan trip, but couldnt find it in Japan. I didnt really wanna deal with the shipping and tariffs mess with online retailers so I intended to buy it whenever theres a sale at my local Amorepacific/Aritaum store. Regular price is $34, I was hoping to snag it on a 30% sale for \\~ $25, but TJ Maxx selling it for $20 is fantastic. Even Stylevana only has it on sale for $24 right now. I was devastated that this TJ only has 1 in stock. \n\nMini review: Nothing soothes my skin the way this cica cream does it, especially on hotter days. Its my fall back whenever my skin acts up. 10/10. Have been repurchasing for 5 years I think.\n\nIngredients: Water, Propanediol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Squalane, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Glycerin, Panthenol, Cetearylalcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, 1,2-hexanediol, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Hydroxyethylacrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Tauratecopolymer, Butylene Glycol, Acrylates/C10-30alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Caprylate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Sorbitan Isostearate, Asiatic Acid, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Aureobasidium Pullulans Ferment, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Cymbopogon Martini (Palmarosa) Oil, Tocopherol\n\n**Parnell  cicamanu cotton clear pad $5 90 pads.** This was a clearance item. I didnt even know Parnell sells skincare. I thought they're a makeup company that focuses on cushions. Just checked Stylevana, its being sold for $18.\n\nIngredients: Water, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, C12-14 Pareth-12, Glycereth-26, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Glyceryl Caprylate, Betaine, Allantoin, Trehalose, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Leptospermum Scoparium Leaf Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Honey Extract, Gluconolactone, Ceramide NP, Anastatica Hierochuntica Extract, Lactobacillus Ferment, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Madecassoside, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Disodium EDTA\n\n**Dr. Jart Ceramidin cream $25 30mL + 50mL**. Have not tried. The Dr. Jart cica cream is a thin gel that was too thin for my dry skin so Im hoping this ceramidin cream is thicker. Currently $30 for 50 ML on Yesstyle.\n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Methyl Trimethicone, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dicaprylyl Ether, Cetearyl Olivate, Panthenol, Glyceryl Stearate, Behenyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Olivate, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Extract, 2,3-Butanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Ceramide NP(2,070ppm), Ceramide NG(2,070ppm), Ceramide NS(2,070ppm), Ceramide AS(2,070ppm), Ceramide AP(529ppm), Cholesterol, Pentaerythrityl Distearate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cellulose Gum, Dextrin, Glyceryl Polymethacrylate, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil, Citronellol, Tocopherol, Tartrazine\n\n**S.Nature Aqua Squalane Moisturzing Cream $10 60 mL.** Have not tried. Currently $20 on Yesstyle. Interested in trying because the ingredients look good for this price. New brand to me.\n\nIngredients: Water, Squalane (150,000ppm), Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Betaine, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Adenosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Arginine, Allantoin, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Glucose, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n**Sulwhasoo Perfecting Cushion $25 for 2.** Crazy good deal. Its usually $65 for 2. I know its on sale because this is the old version and the new version in store is that ugly boring orange packaging. Got it for my aunt.\n\nAt this point, Im going to TJ Maxx every other day. Its my form of stress release. Thank goodness the deals are reasonable. ",

    "body": "\n[here’s a lil picture](https://imgur.com/a/pdhUDav)\n\nSkintype: Extremely oily & Acne prone\n\nAge: 21 Yrs\n\nFormulaRX Barrier Relief Moisturiser\n\nReview Type: Liked it but would NOT repurchase \n\nPrice: 699 for 50 g\n\nUsage Time: around   2 month with intervals, 2-3 days a week.\n\nIngredients: Water, caprylic/ capric triglyceride, glycerin, niacinamide, propanediol, cetearyl alcohol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, sodium hyaluronate, colloidal oatmeal, panthenol, allantoin, ceramide np, ceramide ap, ceramide eop, phytosphingosine, cholesterol, linoleic acid, sodium lauroyl lactylate, xanthan gum, butylene glycol, carbomer, tocopherol, phenoxyethanol, dimethicone, disodium edta, linolenic acid, ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n1. Reviewing FormulaRX Barrier Relief Moisturiser\n \n* Texture and consistency:  It sinks right in the skin and has a gel like texture. It doesn’t feel heavy nor makes me sweat on application unlike other moisturisers make me do. I loved the fact it’s so lightweight and has the gel consistency.\n\n* Effect/ Result: to be very honest, when I first started using this moisturiser, I felt like it was breaking me out, at one point I even stopped using the moisturiser for a while because I was just upset. I loved the texture so much but had been doubting if it’s breaking me out. But later I realised it wasn’t the moisturiser, it was just my usual hormonal acne. I’ve been using it for 2 months and lately it has been working just fine. \n\n• It has 4% niacinamide, confirmed with brand. I had thought of using it as an alternative to a niacinamide serum, but didn’t show any added visible effects.\n\n* Would not repurchase because: \n1. The price, 699 for a 50 g basic moisturiser?!?!\n2. It does it’s job, moisturises my face. Nothing exceptional about it and honestly the Minimalist moisturiser does the same thing for a lesser price.\n3. It makes my face extremely oily and greasy in an hour. My face looks extremely dull. I wouldn’t use it in day time.\n\n•PROS.\nThe thing I love the most about this moisturiser is its consistency and lightweight feature but then the fact it makes my face oily AF is a bummer :(\n\nCute packaging: I’m a sucker for pastel colours and aesthetics and gohd I love the tube in my skincare cabinet, looks so pretty ✨\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS \nLike I’ve been mentioning again and again, I really wanted to love this moisturiser but the price point and lack of any exceptional feature wouldn’t make me purchase it again. \n\nMinimalist Sepicalm 3% + Oat Moisturizer\n\nReview Type: RAVE\n\nPrice: Rs. 345-349 for 50 g\n\nUsage Time: 4 Months, every night and sometimes day too\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Squalane, Glycerine, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Sodium Cocoyl Aminoacids, Sarcosine, Potassium Aspartate, Magnesium Aspartate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Avena Sativa (Oat Kernel) Flour, Sodium Polyglutamate, Undecane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Tocopherol Acetate, Arginine, Glycine, Alanine, Histidine, Sodium Lactate, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Tridecane, Aluminium Starch Octenylsuccinate, Trehalose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n* It has a creamy texture and is quite a thick moisturiser for an extremely oily skin person like me.\n\n* It does not have any actives and I can layer it on top on any active I use, is the fact I love this moisturiser.\n\n* It is decently priced, would definitely repurchase it. \n\n* I’ve used it under makeup and it has worked wonders since the makeup didn’t cause any breakout or any dryness or flakiness.\n\n* I’ve been using it since July, taking a pea sized amount every-night and still have almost 3/5 left, a little goes a long way for me which makes it super affordable. \n\n* I think it’s safe for me to call it my HG moisturiser. It has never broken me out or caused any CCs or any another issue.\n* Literally soothed me, I had been using pulp vit C earlier which was quite strong and potent, Sepicalm moisturiser came handy every time\n\nCONS\n* it’s thick and greasy\n\n* Does not sink in skin immediately unlike the FormulaRX one. It sits on skin for a while\n\n* Makes me sweat after application \n\n* Cannot use it in day (except under makeup)\n\nWhy do I still use it\n- No matter what texture it has, it has soothed my acne, vit C burn, and improved overall skin texture.\n\n- I love the price point \n\n- I use it at night so I don’t worry about how I look, all I care is how well it works. And it does work for me!\n\nI know we’ve missed detailed reviews on this sub here so here’s one from me, more coming in!\nHope y’all find it helpful :)",

This usually comes in very expensive creams.\n\nMinimalist on the other hand is the basic moisturiser\n\nIt’s a difference in needs and wants regarding which one would be preferred by a user.",

Not the $8 Korean retail price, but still, it seems really worth it to me considering the amazing ingredients.\n\nPanthenol is especially really underrated but it seriously kicks ass for dry & sensitive skin/tret face like mine (make sure it's at least 5% tho to be most effective). I love the Aveeno Eczema Therapy Cream bc it's so moisturizing & healing, but it PILLS LIKE CRAZY. Grrrrrrr. And it's a litttle sticky. Otherwise, it would be perfect.\n\n(Also, if you have super tret face/super dry skin, urea is very much worth looking into. It's super underrated as well. It's probably one of the most scientifically proven to be effective dry skin ingredients, but it's not marketed in the US for whatever reason. Maybe bc people think it's from \"urine\"? That's obviously not where they get it in skin care products lol, which is why education is so important. \n\nThe Eucerin 5% Urea face cream is the most accessible one I have found, but there's also Balea? Sebamed, Numis, Medisei Panthenol Extra (also 5% panthenol, but may be clogging) from Greece, Bioturm - all 5% urea creams, for those outside the US. I don't suggest going above 5%, as it can be exfoliating and I personally have those to be really heavy/greasy.",

    "body": "What it looks like on me (sorry still getting rid of the acne): http://imgur.com/a/pqiQUAe\n\nI haven't seen a review for this one yet on here, so I thought I would give it a go as a mini review! \n\nFirst of all, here is the ingredients:\n\n\nWater, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Dibutyl Adipate, Beta Vulgaris (Beet) Root Extract, Alcohol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Glycerin,  Pentylene Glycol, Isoamyl p-Methoxycinnamate, Polysilicone-15, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Methylpropanediol, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polysorbate 80, Lithospermum Erythrorhizon Root Extract, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Sorbitan Oleate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Allantoin, Epigallocatechin Gallate, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Butylene Glycol, Resveratrol\n\nAccording to [Cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_d3ef383038.html) Basically lots of nice antioxidants and the UV filters are Uvinal A Plus, Tinosorb S, Parsol SLX. \n\nNotably, it contains alcohol so avoid if you have issues etc. Also, it's not waterproof.\n\n**The Review**\n\nFor background, I'm oily, dehydrated & acne prone (as the pictures show lol)\n\nI like this sunscreen because:\n\n1) ZERO whitecast (and I used a generous quarter dollop like we are supposed to)\n\n2) Non-drying despite alcohol (and I'm currently very dehydrated so alcohol has been a problem in the past)\n\n**EDIT** \nJust washed it off after wearing for a couple hours and I do have a liiiittle flakes... However if you prepped your skin properly/don't have dehydrated skin you probably won't have the an issue.  (i.e was super lazy and didn't put moisturizer underneath)\n\n3) Dries down in 5 min or less to what I could consider a pretty transfer proof finish to the touch. \n\n4) No Scent\n\nHowever, what I don't like is how greasy this sunscreen is on my face (IRL looks greasier than the picture too). To be fair, most sunscreens are greasy for me because I'm oily, and Liah does mention in her intro video for this that this may not be the best sunscreen for oily skin. I'm a bit bummed because I was hoping I could finally find a sunscreen with no shine... But I'm not surprised either. \n\nWith that said, with a matte powder on top (just using a basic Neutrogena matte powder here) it looks like a really nice skin I'm-not-wearing-anything finish. Which I like, as I don't wear any other makeup. Just don't except to skip the powder step if you are normal/oily to oily. \n\nIt also sliiiiiightly irritates my eyes, but it's not that noticeable and it wouldn't bother me majorly on a day to day basis (for reference I have only found 1 other chemical sunscreen among many to irritate my eyes, but that was a much more severe reaction). Interestingly enough a YouTuber who reviewed this said it really irritated her eyes (Genevieve Fields if you want to look it up) so YMMV.\n\nThis does remind me of the Make Prem Blue Ray Defense Me Gel which is also SPF 50+ PA++++ , 0 whitecast. The MP also supposedly protects you from IR and the blue light from screens but... I honestly don't believe that lol. Otherwise, the greasiness is much more pronounced with the MP (I'm pretty sure this would only be non-greasy if you have dry skin), if you use a matte powder on top I'm not sure how much that matters. Price wise, the BS is more expensive, as I paid 26.40 for 50ml (1.89 ml per dollar when you factor shipping), and the MP is 32 for 75ml (2.3 ml per dollar, free shipping for me bc Prime). Although, Krave Beauty does do free shipping for orders over $40, so if you buy 2 at a time, it then makes the BS 2.5 ml per dollar and the cheapest of both! \n\nOverall, while a little expensive I would recommend this to all skin tones and especially dry/normal skin. Oily/combination types, only go for this if you are willing to powder! Oh and if you're sensitive, this is probably a gamble\n\n**4.5/5.0! :)**",

    "body": "**TL;DR: Don't fuck up like me. Make sure your moisturizer, primer, and foundation all have the same base or you will regret it.** \n\nOk, I know that this topic has come up a lot recently, but I feel like a lot of discussions leave out a key part of the problem. By now, I think most people know that you have to make sure your primer and foundation have the same base i.e. are they water based or silicone based. It makes sense since those two are layered one on top of the other and if they're immiscible then the foundation will just settle on top and come off on everything, defeating the purpose of a primer. Now, what I haven't seen discussed is how your moisturizer may be interacting with your primer and foundation. I've discovered some interesting things through trial and error recently and wanted to share it with the MUA community.\n\nFirst, I recently switched moisturizers. My skin has been a disaster this winter and I needed a major skincare overhaul. I have sensitive skin and Neutrogena has always had my back with great products that don't irritate my skin. One of the new things I got was a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, the [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/hydro+boost+water+gel.do?sortby=ourPicks). I love this product because it absorbs quickly, eliminated my dry spots, and hasn't caused any irritation. What I didn't take into account when I bought this product was the ingredients list; I was just happy to find a non-irritating hyaluronic acid delivery system. \n\nwater, **dimethicone**, glycerin, **dimeticone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer**, phenoxyethanol, polyacrylamide, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, dimethiconol, C13-14 isoparaffin, **dimethicone crosspolymer**, chlorphenesin, carbomer, laureth-7, sodium hyaluronate, ethylhexylglycerin, fragrance, C12-14 pareth-12, sodium hydroxide, blue 1 \n\nThe bolded ingredients indicate it's a silicone-based primer. Yes, the first ingredient is water, but the silicone is present in large amounts, and it interacts differently with water-based products.\n\nMistake 1: I was going for a low-effort look one day and decided to used some of my face powder and call it good. With face powder I usually wear my [NYX HD Primer](http://www.nyxcosmetics.com/high-definition-primer/NYX_180.html) because it's lighter but still holds the powder in place. That day my makeup was slipping and sliding everywhere and I looked like a cakey hot mess when I got home. I checked the ingredients on my moisturizer, found all the silicone, then looked at the primer ingredients. \n\n**Water/Aqua/Eau,** Propylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Diethylhexyl Maleate, Glycerin, Ethylene/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Dimethicone, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, PEG-15 Glyceryl Isostearate, Trihydroxystearin, Adipic Acid/Neopentyl Glycol Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Tocopheryl Acetate, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax/Cera Carnauba/Cire de Carnauba, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7, Silica, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin,  Propylene Glycol Stearate, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Laurate, Propylene Glycol Laurate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Butylene Glycol, Salicornia Herbacea Extract, Copper Tripeptide-1,  Chlorphenesin, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, VP/VA Copolymer, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, C12-14 Pareth-7, Amodimethicone,  Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance/Parfum, Citronellol, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. MAY CONTAIN / PEUT CONTENIR (+/-): Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Zinc Oxide (CI 77947), Chromium Hydroxide Green (CI 77289), Ultramarines (CI 77007).\n\nThe water-based primer just sat on top of my moisturizer, making my makeup come off all over everything.\n\nMistake 2: I somehow spaced and forgot all about my moisturizer issues and yesterday I was rushing to leave and decided to just throw on some Sonia Kashuk Radiant Tinted Moisturizer and go. Wrong move. I had already washed my face and moisturized previously, so the Neutrogena moisturizers was under the tinted moisturizer. As I was rubbing the tinted moisturizer on my face, it started to ball up and look disgusting. I quickly wiped it off and left bare faced, but later I looked at the ingredients in the Sonia Kashuk Tinted Moisturizer. \n\nFluorphlogopite, Sorbitan Is Os Tearate,\nTris Iloxane, D Is Teardimonium Hectorite,\nCetyl Peg/Ppg‐10/1 D Imethicone,\nD Imethicone Cros S Polymer, Butylene Glycol,\nSilica D Imethyl Silylate, Synthetic Bees Wax,\nTetras Odium Ed Ta, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium\nChloride, Alcohol, Talc, Peg‐30\nD Ipolyhydroxys Tearate, Aluminum\nHydroxide, Potas S Ium Sorbate, Stearic Acid,\nCaprylyl Methicone, As Corbyl Palmitate,\nTocopherol, Pentaerythrityl Tetra‐Di‐T‐Butyl\nHydroxyhydrocinnamate.\nMay Contain: Mica, Titanium D Ioxide, Iron\nOxides , Zinc Oxide.\n\nThis one is a little more tricky, as it does have some dimethicone ingredients, but my best guess is that the other ingredients react negatively with the ingredients in the Neutrogena moisturizer.\n \nNow, I know this sounds like using the Neutrogena moisturizer is too much of a pain, but it's really not that big of a deal. My favorite primer, the [ELF Poreless Face Primer](http://www.elfcosmetics.com/p/poreless-face-primer?dept=face-faceprimer), works perfectly with this moisturizer and my HG foundation, [Revlon Colorstay Whipped](http://www.revlon.com/products/face/foundation-makeup/revlon-colorstay-whipped-creme-makeup#309971347054||0), goes on better than ever. I just wanted to make this post to inform people that mismatched moisturizer can cause just as many issues as mismatched primer and foundation!",

The About Me Be Clean seems to be alcohol and fragrance-free (non sure if rosemary leaf oil is an essential oil and fragrant??). I would probably go with the Innifree though because I prefer alcohol in my sunscreen, otherwise they are too too dewy and greasy looking, and the ingredient list is rather simple. If only it didn't have fragrance, but I can compromise with that. The Dr. G has too many unnecessary ingredients and many comedogenic ingredients like myristic acid, so I would stay away from it.",

    "body": "[Shelfie](https://imgur.com/a/oLge8Bq.jpg)\n\nHairType: 1A/1B leaning towards 1A. Fine hair, High Porosity, Waist length. Virgin hair, never been chemically treated, I don't do any heat styling, no blow-drying. Only Air-drying\n\n[Pic 1, Im turning away from camera](https://imgur.com/a/3YQDuew.jpg). Hair is so hard so photograph properly, If I get more accurate pictures, I'll edit to add.\n\nSo life's pretty bad right now, so I'm not able to do the elaborate hair care routine I used to. Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This is an anti-dandruff shampoo and the best I've used so far.\n\nOther than the usual supermarket brands I've used Bioderma Node Ds (Excellent but pricey. Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles. Bottle looks super tiny and the plastic waste bothers me.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Re'equil Anti-Hairfall Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:   [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-c14-16-olefin-sulfonate), [Cocamidopropyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-hydroxysultaine), [Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-cocoyl-isethionate), [Decyl Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/decyl-glucoside), [Coco-Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/coco-glucoside), [Dexpanthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Glyceryl Oleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-oleate), [Biotin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/biotin), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Nasturtium Officinale Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/nasturtium-officinale-extract), [Tropaeolum Majus Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tropaeolum-majus-extract), [Polyquaternium-22](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-22), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Glycol Monostearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycol-stearate), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Methylchloroisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylchloroisothiazolinone), [Methylisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylisothiazolinone), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Ci 45100](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-45100), [Ci 42090](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-42090)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.450 for 250 ml.

Normal shampoo consistency\n\nUsage:  I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: Oh my god, you guys. Best find of this year. This gives super shiny, sleek looking hair. I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember. I used up the entire bottle. I think 9ish months?? or more.\n\nConsistency: Normal shampoo consistency, HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above. Forever Repurchase. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Oriental Botanics Red Onion Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients: This has an ingredients list a mile long. Will update soon.\n\nPrice: MRP 449 for 300 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years and I'm only done with half the bottle\n\nConsistency: Normal Shampoo\n\nUsage: I take a lot and apply it from shoulders to ends, if I've not oiled my hair.\n\nReview: I literally had to go and check what the name of this product was to type this review and I've been using it for 2+ years. I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

    "body": "Hello, I got [Corsx ‘s new products : Hyrium ampule,gel cream and Centella cleansing powder](https://imgur.com/a/cNAduGY) with the benefit of free delivery as launching promotion. I used them about three days, and it's too early to write review.  However, I want to share some general feeling for those who are wondering abt it.\n\n**Skin type** dry,complex skin\n\n\n**Price** ampule -24000krw, gel cream-23000krw,centella cleansing powder -14400krw\n\n\n\n**Texture and smell**\n1. centella aqua soothing Ampule: It's literally watery. It doesn't feel sticky at all. Frankly, The scent is not fragrant; it is rather odorless. It is absorbed into the skin lightly and instantly. When I used this, I doubted,”huh, what?? 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️Is this ampule? Really?”\n\n2. Hydrium greentea Aqua Gel cream :  I hate oily cream. I always prefer gel-type cream. This gel cream is light as the ampule and is absorbed quickly into the skin. I really love the fresh texture. Though it doesn’t smell bad,nor does it smell as fragrant as flowers. There is little incense.\n\n3. Centella cleansing powder : I ordered it bc it was cheaper(to me, in Korea) than Kanebo’s cleansing powder which I liked. I don't know the difference between the two. The amount of foam from it and the feeling of washing are similar to the original. It also has no special scent. \n\n\n**Strengths and weaknesses**\n1. Ampule : 👍 It has the advantage of rapidly hydrating into skin. There is no long-lasting irritation on the face, which I feel whenever I use too heavy ampule or essence. They also do not have powerful points (like full of vitamin C or propolis blah blah) so it can be used at any time without pressure. \n\n🔺 It is difficult to replace one existing ampule. It is so light that it is more like a good toner than an ampule. I'd better add one to the existing routine. \n\n2. Gel cream : 👍It can also be absorbed quickly if applied to the face no matter how much you put on! Its cooling effect is pretty good so I will love to use in this summer weather. This is much better in soothing than the snail cream I'm using.\nSkin turns soft state right after. \n\n🔺 This is also not enough as a lone moisturizer. It's colorless and odorless, so I don't feel this Hydrium line special or unique. Of course, I think I'm used to fragrances and marketing though..I use this at the final step. It's inappropriate to change the existing cream. Also it runs out very quickly. It seems thar I can use it all within 2weeks.\n\n3. Cleansing powder: 👍It’s not stimulating skin. The foam is soft when washing. It washes away the feeling of slipperyness after makeup cleansing with oil. It is good as a substitute for foam cleansing. \n🔺 It’s dry to me. Of course it is natural to be dry after cleansing. But it is far drier so I had to run toward moisturizer. In addition, it is hard to pull the lid when compared to Kanebo’s.  Kanebo’s lid opens at once, while I had to take it off with the teeth!!😥\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Ingredient**\n1. Ampule : Water, Centella Asiatica Extract, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Betaine, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Octanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Allantoin, Madecassoside, Panthenol\n\n\n2. Gel cream :\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Betaine, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Octanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Allantoin, Madecassoside, Panthenol\n\n3.Cleansing powder : Zea Mays (Corn) Starch, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Sodium Lauroyl Aspartate, Maltodextrin, Allantoin, Centella Asiatica Extract, Lipase, Protease\n\n\n\n\n\n*My thought* :I don't regret getting the products. It's a perfect ampoule and cream for my taste and I'm satisfied. It was very good choice in this hot weather for my skin. However, I think I won’t and can’t expect any special effects like whitening. And somehow,,, I think it’s a bit pricey.\n\n\n\nP.s : I’m not good at English. So there must be grammatical and fuctional errors. Some of my expressions may not be right.😱Please let me know if anything is wrong.\n\n**edit**\nThe ingredient of centella aqua ampule.",

You don't have to be a Costco member to purchase it. They also have Cremolab cleansing balm on clearance for 16.97 USD and Commleaf essence for 19.97 USD and gel cream for 14.97 USD. And the Urang rose ceramide cream for 26.99 USD I think which I'm planning to get if I get Christmas money. All great prices and no membership needed for these.

Just because it takes the # of reviews into account. You can find lots of good reviews vouching for very good products with lesser amount of reviews. It doesn't necessarily mean that just because a product is extremely popular, there can't be lesser known amazing products as well. For some categories, like toners and creams, I feel that it's worth to look all the way down towards the 40s and 50s. I think I will make certain categories longer if you guys don't mind my spamming, lol.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm thinking doing creams or gels next. =) Thank you everybody for the comments, glad to see the time I spent making these posts is helping some of you!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Oils & Gels](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6dqq7/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing_oils_gels/)\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Balms/Milks/Creams & Foams](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6fso3/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing/)",

    "body": "This isn't a new product (to me or the sub) but I rarely see it talked about, so I figured I would give it a review. I've been using this cleansing oil on and off for about 18 months.\n\n**Skin type:** I'm in my 30s, and my skin is generally oily (formerly dehydrated/oily), but has recently become a lot more dry due to the dry winter weather and prescription tretinoin use. My primary skin concerns run a wide gamut - I'm focused on anti-aging because of my age, but I also have acne, clogged pores, PIH, and melasma. My skin is very, very clog prone. Basically, my skin is a \"special snowflake\" that thinks the world should tremble in fear.\n\n**Location/weather:** I live in the Mid-Atlantic area of the US, so the weather is hot and humid in the summer, and cold and dry in the winter.\n\n**Other first cleansers I have tried:**\n\n* Heimish All Clean Balm\n* LJH Dr's Care Cleansing Oil\n* Whamisa Organic Flowers Cleansing Oil\n\nI have also, in the past, tried traditional OCM with mineral oil. It did not go well (lots of clogs), and in general, I now try to avoid cleansing oils with mineral oil in them, hence why I haven't tried some of the more popular cleansing oils on this sub. The LJH Dr's Care also contains mineral oil, and also didn't go over well with my skin.\n\nAnyway, onto the actual review.\n\n**Ingredients (copied from Ulta.com):** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Peg-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Peg-10 Isostearate, Bis-Ethoxydiglycol Cyclohexane 1,4-Dicarboxylate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Water, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Black Sugar Extract, Sodium Pca, Betaine, Threonine, Sorbitol, Proline, Lysine, Lepidium Meyenii Root Extract, Glutamic Acid, Arginine, Alanine, Butylene Glycol, Cholesterol, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Serine, Glycine, Alcohol Denat., Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake), Hydrogenated Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Ceramide Np, Sarcodon Aspratus Extract, Sucrose, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium Edta.\n\n**Price:** This oil cleanser is easily found on tons of websites. I most often buy from Amazon, and pay about $14-15 USD for a 200mL bottle.\n\n**Smell:** This oil smells *strongly* of lemon, with the faint hint of sugar. The smell is very noticeable on application, but once the cleanser is rinsed off, it dissipates completely. I happen to like the smell, but others may find it a little too reminiscent of Lemon Pledge.\n\n**Texture:** This cleansing oil seems rather thin - it seems to be slightly thinner and less viscous than vegetable oil. Sometimes this is annoying, as I have to use a little more oil than I'd like to really massage my face well without pulling my skin (3 pumps or so).\n\n**Cleansing Power:** In my opinion, this oil cleanser does a fantastic job with face makeup and sunscreen. It does not excel with waterproof eyeliner and mascara - it will remove some but not all waterproof eye makeup. I, however, do not like to use this on my eyes. I wear contact lenses and it always causes them to get milky, making it difficult to see. The cloudy residue lasts several hours. I do not know if this would impact someone who doesn't wear contacts. However, with face makeup and sunscreen, as well as with some superficial clogs, this oil cleanser does a great job. I sometimes, but not routinely, feel grits coming out of my skin. It does not help break up deeper clogs or closed-head blemishes.\n\n**Emulsification:** This stuff turns pretty darned white when mixed with water. I make sure to rinse all traces of it off my face so I don't see any of the cleanser, especially near my hairline. It emulsifies and rinses off easily, and doesn't leave any feeling of residue on my face. I always follow with a second cleanser, but I do not feel a film or greasiness with this cleanser. It also doesn't make my skin feel tight or dry - just clean.\n\n**Overall:** I really like this cleanser and have repurchased it many times. At the price point, it does what I need it to do. It breaks down the face makeup (Mac Studio Fix Fluid or Estee Lauder Double wear, topped with Innisfree powder) and my sunscreen (La Roche Posay Ultra Fluid). It rinses cleanly, and it is inexpensive and easy to find. I don't expect **any** cleanser to address aging concerns, or to meaningfully use acids. Any claims of brightening from a cleanser are probably worthless, since the product isn't on your face long enough to do any meaningful chemical exfoliation. This cleanser is best at what it does not do: it doesn't create new acne for me and it doesn't irritate my skin.\n\nIt is probably not my favorite of all oil cleansers. Right now that would be Whamisa, which is great, but expensive, and which also doesn't seem to penetrate pores as deeply as the Skinfood cleanser. Skinfood Black Sugar Perfect Cleansing Oil is a great choice that I will probably continue to buy it, especially since it's easy to get in the United States. I think it's an excellent pick for a first cleanser that isn't based on mineral oil, but only if you are not sensitive to fragrances.",

Part of why I stayed with this oil is because it doesn't make my eyes sting when I use it to remove tight-lined eyeliner. The only problem I've had with it is some slightly blurry vision like you'll get with any liquidy product that's in your eyes, but even that effect seems to not be as present anymore since they updated the product.",

Still probably way higher than most other brands).\n\nThough with these products in general, particularly for the ones with “real” (not pseudo/ceramide precursors), honestly I would be shocked if they were present at more than 0.1 %. Even if they come before the preservatives, the preservatives are probably present at like 0.9% so the company can list them after the fancy ingredients even though the expensive ingredients are at minuscule concentrations. Maybe I’m too cynical, but a >1% concentration of any ceramides would be such a HUGE selling point (not to mention very expensive to produce) that I can’t believe they’re not advertising it\n\nLike Regimen is coming out with one and they are trumpeting the HELL out of it (and I mean fair enough)",

    "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nJust wanted to put out a quick review on this mask.  I hardly ever use sheet masks as most of them make me itchy (even the Klairs Supple Prep mask).  Luckily, this one did not and really hydrated my skin, which lasts through the next day.\n\nThese are pretty good!  Maybe even great, depending on your skin's needs.\n\nThey come split into two parts.  The mask material itself is cross-hatched and sturdy.  You can give it a good tug while fitting it on our face and it's no big deal.  Other than that, it feels like regular mask material (cotton).  The fit for me was good.  It was definitely big enough to cover most my (normal-sized) face with a bit to spare.  \n\nVery saturated with the juice.  It's not a creamy formula, just the usual serum style.  And get this...NO FRAGRANCE.  I know many people love the nice smelling stuff, but this one is great option for people who can't tolerate it.  Plus it has tons of ceramides.\n\nIn terms of how long until the masks drys out...well I've never made it that far.  I wore one yesterday for 40min (youtube! stop being so distracting!), pulled it off and it was still soggy.\n\n\n**Ingredients List:** Water, Butylene glycol, glycerin, 1,2-hexanediol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycereth-26, Propanediol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Panthenol, Betaine, Allantoin, Cellulose, Hydroxyethyl cellulose, Sodium hyaluronate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hydrogenated lecithin, Ceramide NP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide AP, Ceramide AS, Ceramide EOP, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Carbomer, Arginine, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Acetate, PVM/MA Copolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Glyceryl Acrylate/ Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n\nOverall, I would rate this mask positively.  It's hydrating and benign...which is what I look for in a mask.\n\n\n**Pros:**\n\nGood material\n\nNo fragrance\n\nHydrating AF\n\n\n**Cons:**\n\nCost (USD 3$/mask)\n\n\nEdit: my goodness I need to learn to spell",

I personally might try it out as an alternative to my CosRX AHA/BHA Toner (although they are not the same and the CosRX is more like the Pixi in that its more inert/less active.) I do already use a 14% glycolic product several days a week, so not sure if I want to put my money in another product that uses glycolic alone.

    "body": "I am trying to understand what is the deal with Purito and their sunscreens.\n\nThey have two different sunscreens\n\n* Centella Green Level Safe Sun \n* Centella Green Level Unscented Sun\n\nAlthough they have the same two UV filters (one UVA filter and one UVB filter), the formulation is not the same. However, the company claims the exact same SPF and UVA PF results for both sunscreens: PPD of 22.59 and SPF of 84.5 (you can see the videos below). This is very strange as even if the exact same formulation is tested twice, we will not get the EXACT same results.\n\nApart from the fact that they have used one set of results for both sunscreens, which is fairly suspicious, they have disclosed the percentage of UV filters used in their unscented formulation. According to their website: “The PURITO Centella Green Level Safe Sun contains 3% of Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate and 2% of Ethylhexyl Triazone.”\n\nThis means that they claim an SPF of 84.5 just from 2% of a single UVB filter.\n\nNow in contrast to this sunscreen, we have the Invisible fluid (formerly known as the Shaka Fluid) from La Roche Posay. This sunscreen claims to feature a special technology to “gel and stabilize the droplets containing the filters, thus forming an extremely tight and protective structure”. With this technology on board, the company still uses a good amount of UV filters, namely Octisalate (5%), Uvinul T 150 (4.5%), Tinosorb S (4%), Avobenzone (3.5%), Mexoryl XL (2%), Mexoryl SX (0.495%).\n\nAs in Europe any SPF above 60 can only be labelled SPF 50+, we can only learn more information about this product’s SPF from other countries. In Brazil, it is marketed as SPF 60 when they are able to market products with SPF 70 (https://www.laroche-posay.com.br/anthelios/hydraox-fluid-fps60). So I will assume it has an SPF of 60 - 70.\n\nSo, La Roche Posay must use a special technology and 9.5% UVB filters and 6.495% of broad spectrum filters, i.e. a total of 16% of filters blocking UVB (8 times more filters) to get a lower SPF.\n\nEven the filter used by Purito at 2%, is used by La Roche Posay at 4.5%, i.e. more than double.\n\nNow for the UVA protection, La Roche Posay claim a PPD of 46 as opposed to 22.59, but still there, they use 10% of UVA filters as opposed to 3%. So, they are using more than 3 times the amount of filters to achieve double the PPD value.\n\nIs it possible that the formulation of the Purito is so special that they can use 8 times less filters to get a higher SPF???\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Centella Green Level Safe Sun**\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dibutyl Adipate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, Niacinamide, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Silica, Cetearyl Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Centella Asiatica Extract (4315 ppm), Hyaluronic Acid, Tocopherol, Sorbitan Olivate, Glycery l Stearate SE, Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Sorbitan Stearate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Disodium EDTA, Adenosine, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nPPD = 22.59 and SPF = 84.5\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZy0t\\_UCgNk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZy0t_UCgNk)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Centella Green Level Unscented Sun**\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Glycerin, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene , Acrylates Copolymer, Silica , 1,2-Hexanediol, Niacinamide, Dibutyl Adipate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Cetearyl Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Sorbitan Olivate, Glyceryl Stearate, Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Sorbitan Stearate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Disodium EDTA, Adenosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol\n\nPPD = 22.59 and SPF = 84.5\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOQJzdQaiF4",

They'll buy it, and a lot of them will go out under the sun thinking they're protected. But no they're not, and will increase their chances of sunburns and melanoma.\n\nYes, I do think that promoting Purito sunscreens is harmful to most consumers. Because not everyone knows how unprotective this sunscreen is.\n\nAnd then, people say this is an inside sunscreen. UVA penetration through windows is highly overestimated by people.

Of course filter concentrations don't say everything, different grades of mineral filters, coatings and inactive ingredients can influence the SPF a lot. So you can't determine the SPF solely based on filter concentrations, but going from on average 15-25% needed for SPF50+ to 3.6-5%, I mean it's at least something that jumps out and makes me curious. It's the first time I see a sunscreen with such a high filter efficiency. I hope Regardsurlescosmetiques or someone else will test the Purito Comfy and Green Level, although it's of course difficult to say how reliable these in vitro results are, maybe it will give some insight.",

Honestly, there are ways to make them work, like applying no moisturizer or less moisturizer underneath and allowing them to dry for a while before applying makeup.

        "body": "I think this is a really interesting topic, and I did a bit of digging, and here's what I think, however I preface this that I'm not a professional here.\n\nIt could be due to the way the sunscreen was manufactured(like how it was mixed), as Lab Muffin Beauty Science describes in [her video](https://youtu.be/aTNcbLHZusc?t=333), she explains that the manufacturing process is just as important as the actual UV filters used. \n\nLike the Purito suncreen, the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50 also uses the same UV filters and I believe is manufactured by the same lab, and again, Lab Muffin Beauty Science explains why she thinks that product is protective enough [here](https://labmuffin.com/sunscreen-reviews-klairs-mecca/).\n\nAnother idea is that the sunscreen has a hefty amount of niacinamide which has [photoprotective properties](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20354654/), and since SPF is a ratio between the amount of UV required to cause a burn sunscreen protected skin and UV required to burn unprotected skin, it means that SPF doesn't measure the actual SPF absorbed or reflected from the UV filters themselves but rather whether or not your skin will burn. It also looks like La Roche Posay sunscreens do not contain the array of antioxidants that the Purito one does, because antioxidant plant extracts may [enhance the SPF value](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4177626/).\n\nAn interesting note, while looking at the La Roche Posay sunscreen from the Brazilian website the Google translation says that it is water and sweat resistant, which is interesting, because in Australia, we have the same product but it does not have any water resistance claims.\n\nTaking all this together, in my opinion there might be differences in how the products are manufactured which would play a very big role in the tested SPF, but also the ingredients other than the UV filters would affect their SPF. \n\nThat would be my take on it.",

Ultra elegant, yet SPF50+, PA++++ (ok, it only means PPD >16, but still)... something doesn’t quite add up, even factoring in the amount of alcohol that goes into the some of them. If high protection EU sunscreens have taught us anything, it’s that (currently) you can’t have high protection without harming (to some extent) the elegance of a sunscreen. And in many cases a good balance has been found (eg Shaka Fluid for a lot of people), but I’m really skeptical of these ‘seemingly perfect’ sunscreens from Asia because the SPF-branding is less regulated and the results just don’t seem to align with what Europe offers.",

So if we take it that it’s SPF is indeed 60, and if the UVA is 46, wouldn’t that mean the Invisible Fluid would have a Boost Star rating above 3 since the SPF and UVAPF are much closer to one another, compared to say the P20? We don’t have a Boots Star rating for the Invisible Fluid (as far as I know), but the Ambre Solaire Fluid, which we are assuming is very close to the Invisible Fluid, only has a Boots Star rating of 3. If it did have the same protection as the Invisible Fluid (SPF60 & PPD46) shouldn’t it have a higher star rating? I don’t like the Boots system, as I think it is confusing and misleading, but it got me thinking. Also I have been using the Garnier Ambre Solaire Advanced Fluid since March and it’s great (briefly went back to Shaka/Invisible Fluid, but prefer the more matte Garnier), so I hope it has a similarly high UVA protection.",

Yeah, rare beauty does have a lot of aesthetics taken from k-beauty but like everyone else is saying, it's probably not exactly the same.

    "body": "My foray into skincare began around July last year when I decided I wasn't happy with my skin and wanted to do something about it. Initially I researched foundations, but none of the products I tried evened my skin to my satisfaction, which is when I found /r/SkincareAddiction. Here, I learned that my skin was dehydrated, more than likely due to using Dove bar soap and BP on my face and zero moisturizer every day. :) My skin has changed so much since I started and I am finally ready to review some products I have been using and maybe help others find their way.  \n**Disclaimer** This is my first Reddit text post, I'm really hoping the formatting turns out the way I anticipated.  \n\n**Where we started:**  \n* 25/F/FL; combo/oily dehydrated skin with mild acne, some PIE, sporadic CCs and occasionally painful nodules usually on my forehead, chin, or temples. Noteworthy: I have been on oral contraceptives since I was a teenager and switched to Skyla in 2015. I don't believe my acne is hormonal, but since I've always had some sort of hormonal birth control it's hard to tell how much it has affected my skin.  \n\n\n* No real routine, just washing my face with bar soap in the (scalding hot) shower, using a Neutrogena BP mask to annihilate acne. I was under the (false) impression that since my face was oily I certainly wouldn't want to add moisturizer!  \n\n\n* Mostly concerned with the nodules I was getting because they were big and painful and took forever to heal. Admittedly, I am a skin picker and just recently I realized this is probably the cause of the nodules because the two that I have dealt with recently developed in spots that I had messed with just a few days before.  \n\n\n**Level one: Build a routine.**  \n* At this point, I read everything. EVERYTHING. I spent a couple of months just researching products, learning about skin types, and poring through threads on SCA. I put down the BP mask and bought Neutrogena foaming face wash and CeraVe PM. This was around September when Irma hit and I was without power for a few days, but still managed to keep my fledgling routine. \\o/\n\n* Unfortunately, I felt that CeraVe PM was contributing to a new outbreak of whiteheads around my mouth, where I don't normally get whiteheads. I wound up replacing it with Peach Slices Citrus Honey Aqua Glow which I LOVE. More on that later.\n\n* I also incorporated Neutrogena Sheer Touch sunscreen around this time, but that gave me small breakouts as well and I just didn't like the way that it sat on my skin so I decided to put sunscreen on hold while I did more research.\n\n* While incorporating these products into my routine I tried my best to follow SCA's advice and start slow, one product at a time, and patch test first. I don't really feel that patch testing helped me determine if a product would break me out, as I wouldn't notice any difference in the area I patch tested but then within a few days of trying a new product on my whole face I would see an increase in whiteheads in strange areas. It sucked, but it's alright since the breakouts were mild and didn't take long to appear so I knew fairly quickly that a product wasn't working for me. I still recommend patch testing for sensitivity purposes.\n\n**Level 2: Sunscreen and acids.**  \n* Finally, after months of reading, I felt ready to take on an acid. I settled on CosRX BHA Blackhead Power liquid because it was purportedly more mild (and less expensive!) than other options and I felt that I should start gentle. I picked this up from Ulta in early December and used it every three days for 4 weeks. During that period I don't feel like I had a purge; I kind of expected my acne to go into overdrive but it didn't really get any worse. After the 4 weeks I started using it MWF. \n\n* I also bought Skinfood's Aloe Watery Sun Water Gel from Amazon, but shipping took about a month so I was able to incorporate it well after the BHA.\n\n**Level 3: Skincare God.**  \n* *Just kidding.* So here we are in mid April and I have repurchased the Neutrogena cleanser once (although I switched to hydrating instead of foaming), Peach Slices moisturizer three (!!!) times, Skinfood sunscreen once, and am 1/3 of the way through the CosRX BHA. Let me tell you, I am SO much happier with my skin. \n\n* My skin is more bright and even and I have had much fewer blemishes than I used to, which I would attribute equally to a marked decrease in picking. Taking better care of my skin and working towards a goal makes it easier to keep myself from messing up my progress, although I still have setbacks during times when I am very stressed out, but I try not to let that discourage me.\n\n* Oil production WAS down, but a couple of weeks ago I tried to incorporate Cosrx Ultimate Moisturizing Honey Overnight Mask at night for added hydration, but it wound up drying me out? Additionally, I am running dangerously low on Peach Slices Moisturizer and could not find it at any of my local CVS locations so I have been rationing it while I wait for more to come in the mail. :'( \n\n* From here, I want to try to find a more hydrating cream for nighttime and an easily accessible drugstore sunscreen because currently it takes the Skinfood 2-4 weeks to come in so I have to make sure I order it in advance. I also REALLY want to try Krave Beauty Kale-lalu-yAHA, but I am waiting until I get back from vacation next month before I incorporate a new exfoliant. Finally, someone talk me out of buying something from the Dr Jart Cicapair line because I'm not quite sure what it's for but I really want it.\n\nI hope this will be helpful for those still figuring out what works for their skin, as I know I felt completely overwhelmed when I first started. I am still interested in experimenting with new products but I feel that I have a really solid routine as it is so I am content to wait until I am in a better situation financially to mix things up.\n\n**Current routine**  \nAM: splash with water  \nPeach Slices moisturizer  \nSkinfood sunscreen  \n\nPM: cleanse with Neutrogena  \nCosRX BHA MWF  \nPeach Slices moisturizer  \nSometimes a sheet mask when I'm feeling fancy (I really like Ariul Seven Days masks)  \nVaseline (not so much lately after I read a thread here about Vaseline potentially trapping bacteria if your face isn't cleansed properly)\n\n**Reviews**  \n* Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser: Not much to say here, but from what I have read that is good to say about a cleanser. It took a little time to get used to not having that tight, \"squeaky clean\" feeling that I got using the foaming cleanser, but ultimately I think this has been better for my skin. I have had my eye on Glossier's Milky Jelly cleanser for MONTHS but I can't bring myself to buy it when I am pretty satisfied with how this has been for my skin.\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Glucoside, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol*\n\n* Peach Slices Citrus Honey Aqua Glow: Light gel formula, sinks into my skin really well. I am still a bit oily toward the end of the day, but I have kind of resigned myself to the fact that that may not fully go away. Maybe when I start incorporating a more hydrating night cream it will help. Either way the slight oil doesn't bother me much and I really like this moisturizer.\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Polysorbate 60, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Honey Extract, Ceramide NP, Sorbitan Stearate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Isohexadecane, Tromethamine, Hydroxyacetophenone, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Polysorbate 80, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitan Oleate, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Oil, Disodium EDTA, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Butylene Glycol, Bixa Orellana Seed Oil, Tocopherol*\n\n* Skinfood Aloe Watery Sun Water Gel 50+ PA+++: Very happy with this sunscreen, although the oil control is hit or miss. Some days when I apply it after moisturizer it has a nice, almost powdery finish and I forget it's even there. Some days I'm more oily but I'm still figuring out what the cause of that might be. I don't wear foundation so I can't speak to how this sits under makeup but I do wear a little blush and I can still see it at the end of the day. When I apply it I pat it around my face and then rub it in, there is a slight white cast at first but for me it disappears very quickly, however, I am fair skinned.\n\n*Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Octyl Methoxycinnamate, Octyl Salicylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Peg/Ppg-10/1 Dimethicone, Lauryl Peg-9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Stearalkonium Hectorite, Titanium Dioxide, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Propylene Carbonate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Fragrance, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Tocopherol*\n\n* CosRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid: I use three pumps MWF and occasionally a tiny amount to spot treat nodules. Overall I feel like it helps existing acne heal more quickly and keeps it from getting to that huge, inflammatory state. It applies and dries down very nicely and I typically wait 15-20 minutes after application to apply moisturizer. I didn't realize until recently that it has niacinamide, which I had thought didn't agree with my skin because it was also in CeraVe PM, but I think it has really helped lighten my PIE, particularly a spot on my forehead that I really went to town on last year and it was a pain in the ass to heal.\n\n*Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Water, Butylene Glycol, Betaine Salicylate, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Arginine, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol*\n\n**Links that I found helpful along the way**  \n[Try a gentle hydrating cleanser -- even if you have oily skin.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7j6juf/psa_try_a_gentle_hydrating_cleanser_even_if_you/)\n\n[Routines which involve inadequate cleansing, high moisture, and heavy occlusion are risky...](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/86twai/psa_routines_which_involve_inadequate_cleansing/)",

So my Physicians Formula booster and Olay Luminous booster came in the mail today!\n\nI'm just really excited to share because I searched HIGH AND LOW for affordable niacinamide products that have a high % of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLINK TO MY PICTURES:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/7ab5NZ8](https://imgur.com/a/7ab5NZ8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe PF I have not used before. But it's the FIRST affordable product that I came across that has high % of niacinamide AND  Acetyl glucosamine ---- not just those, but a small amount of supposedly the most powerful vitamin c derivative!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Niacinamide and NAG work synergistically together](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/n-acetyl-glucosamine-nag) to be a brightening powerhouse as well as repairing your skin barrier.

Probably because Olay developed it. But it works great on its own as a brightener, and even better combined with vitamin c (which is why you see ascorbyl glucoside here, a stable derivative of ascorbic acid). The miracle boost USED to contain n-acetyl glucosamine (which is the one I used) as well the other ones listed here. But I guess it got too expensive or whatever.\n\nThis also has some other great ingredients, like xylitol, gylcerin, panthenol, zinc and copper gluconate for soothing and healing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used this booster in conjunction with the Luminous cream, which has niacinamide and NAG. My skin looked so much brighter and prettier. The texture was really smoothed out and my skin started getting a more like.. translucent ?? quality? You DO need to give brightening ingredients *at least 3 months* to work their magic though, especially for things like arbutin/hydroquinone. (Arbutin breaks down into hydroquinone.) But for niacinamide, I saw results for skin texture/overall brightening before that.\n\nI honestly couldn't believe the price Target was selling it for, because I got it for a much higher price elsewhere before. I couldn't keep affording it so I let it go, sadly. :'(\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe [**Luminous Tone Perfecting Treatment ($24.99)**](https://www.olay.com/en-us/skin-care-products/regenerist-luminous-tone-perfecting-treatment) is a simpler formula, but still has the same active ingredients.\n\n*Water,* ***Niacinamide\\*****, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Dimethicone,* ***Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine***\\*, Silica, Boron Nitride,\\* ***Ascorbyl Glucoside***\\*, Polyglyceryl-2 Oleate, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Dimethiconol, Aminomethyl Propanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Oleate, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, \\*Vitamin B3\\*\n\nBut ironically, it costs more than the more complex booster if you purchase at Target online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DIY:**\n\nI have made DIY niacinamide NAG serums before. But because I'm too lazy to make it properly, they really lack penetration power. I'm really into cosmetic science and have read from professional cosmetic chemists that a simple DIY isn't effective if you don't do it right. You gotta keep the powders dissolved right and STAY dissolved instead of them recrystallizing on your skin and not penetrating your skin/being useless. I experimented for months with the DIY but I DEFINITELY noticed a difference as soon as I started using well-formulated, commercially available niacinamide serums.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy personal experience with certain products:\n\n\\- [**Eva Naturals 5% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-Niacinamide-Serum-Eva-Naturals/dp/B0147PDMYY/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=eva+naturals+niacinamide&amp;qid=1561763684&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3)**:** Pretty awesome, works well, you get 2 oz. But it has avocado oil and such, and may break some people out. (This is definitely a private-label product and you can find the same exact formula for cheaper on DIY sites - which is why you see like 324982394 bottles of the same formula of everything from niacinamide to vitamin c serums on amazon.) I get the same sort of overall brightening and translucency I get with Olay. Better results with my other products, Benton 0.5% salicylic acid (very gentle) aloe BHA toner, Purito green level centella buffet serum (also has niacinamide, like 2%), and Naturie Hatomugi gel essence. Bright, translucent skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Cerave PM:** Supposedly has 4% niacinamide. Loved this as a lightweight moisturizer, but did NOT see the results I got with other niacinamide products. Makes me feel skeptical. Or perhaps there's a pretty big difference for my skin with 4% and 5%. I doubt it, but you know. Maybe it's just cuz it's formulated for skin-replenishing and not for brightening. But you'd think same ingredient will have same effects, y'know?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.skinlex.com/product/10-niacinamide-serum-60ml/)**:** Ingredient list looks GREAT and some others seem to love it, but I saw absolutely zero niacinamide benefits for my skin. Penetration issue?\n\nI have other products I've used with niacinamide, but these are the main ones I can remember on the top of my head. La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ baume has it as well, but I do not know the %. Very good moisturizer for the body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther commercial products you can find SEPIWHITE in:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Black Opal skin care products**](https://blackopalbeauty.com/collections/skincare): They have multiple.

Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid. Shelf life is no indication of the stability of actives and doesn't say anything about it's stability on skin.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water. The key here is to make it fresh every 1-3 days I guess.\n  * [€5.80/20g TO Powder](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g?redir=1)\n  * [€89 /20mL Philosophy Turbo C booster](https://www.sephora.com/product/turbo-booster-c-powder-P204606)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Anhydrous formulas**: best stability, but not much research on penetration\n\n* [€9.60/50mL - The Ordinary C23](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)\n  * **Pros:** Cheap, anhydrous (stable), together with TO Ferulic+Resveratrol a very affordable good combo\n  * **Cons:** No other actives,  no vitamin E, relatively unpleasant texture, stinging, for me too thick/greasy for daytime use.

The reviews on Sephora have been fantastic and it has 20% THD ascorbate (which they call a mega-potent, ultra stable form of vitamin c. They claim that the THD ascorbate is 50x more powerful than traditional vitamin c (I am skeptical and what are they referring to with “traditional vit c”).  Also has 3% vitamin E and 2% ferulic acid. The only negative I read in the reviews is people saying it was not ideal for dry skin types. Do you have any experience with this? \n\nPS- thank you so much for your comprehensive list, it is much appreciated!!

It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

I had initially planned to write this review 2 weeks after using the latter, but I’ve had a below average experience in one week itself so I’d like to share my review in hopes of being of help to those who want to purchase it.\n\n*I have dry skin not prone to acne, have very little to no pigmentation and use Vitamin C as a preventive measure against ageing, sun damage and dullness. I live in an area with high UV levels and a very humid climate.*\n\n*My routine: Episoft Cleansing Lotion, Laneige Cream Skin Refiner: Toner & Moisturiser, Minimalist's Vitamin C Serum, Bello Photostable Emulgel SPF 40 (day) and Moskina Cream (night).*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Texture Shot](https://preview.redd.it/35qouoy87q871.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9053ecf1c188f97b487b54a5a2b714b59a0a04cd)\n\n**INGREDIENTS:**\n\nChemist At Play:\n\n>Water, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic acid, Propan-di-ol, Sodium Isomerate, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Ferulic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Oryza Sativa (Rice Phytoceramide), Amorphophallus (Konjac Phytoceramide), Hamamelis Virginiana, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Polysorbate 80.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMinimalist:\n\n>Centella Asiatica Leaf Water, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Ethoxydiglycol, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Glycerin, Sodium Gluconate, Acetyl Glucosamine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Pullulan, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Lecithin, Lactic Acid\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Comparison](https://preview.redd.it/q0l52oub7q871.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=452589ce63e896b49a2bb5a08fbc6956ad6b9cf5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChemist At Play has Witch Hazel and Citric Acid; this may not be problematic for all, but if they are for you then keep this serum away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, Minimalist gave me the actual results a Vitamin C serum is supposed to give but Chemist At Play did the reverse. I'm just glad that it didn't give me any CC's or acne. I'm going to go ahead and reverse the dullness through Minimalist's serum. I'm better off using a ceramide infused moisturiser after my serum than have it in my serum in this case, which is a pity because if this serum had worked for me, it would've been an all-rounder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, everyone's skin is different and this is just one, hopefully helpful review.",

I am quite new to making reviews with pictures so please let me know if there is any error in the review and if I need to change anything and how to change it. Now, on to my review.\n\nReview: I bought this sunscreen as the ingredients list really fascinated me and given how their facewashes did great on my skin and the sunscreen seemed so affordable I thought I would give it a try and see if it works in this humid climate for my oily skin. \n\nUnfortunately today it's very cloudy so my camera could not pick up the colour of the sunscreen. I had applied it along side the Re'equil on my hand to show the difference between both as both claim to be matte and sweat proof and very light on the skin. The Deconstruct one is a very light flesh pink/light peach colour while the Re'equil one looks like white with a touch of very light green. \n\nThe texture of Deconstruct seemed to resemble butter cream frosting on cake that was left in the fridge overnight. It was a bit stiff and sort of grainy. When I began to apply it on my face, it was horribly waxy.. like rubbing a candle on your hands or face and having that waxy residue stick behind which does not go away while the Re'equil one was very light and powdery and dry and had a very smooth, fine finish.  The Re'equil one had a pleasant baby powder scent like the one the Pink Johnson's baby powder does while Deconstruct did noy have any scent. \n\nTrying to spread and apply this sunscreen on my face and neck was a nightmare. I tried everything from gently applying it over in swiping motions to tapping it. Nothing worked. I even tried applying a moisturiser first in the hope that it helps spread the sunscreen better but that made no difference. The only plus point was how soothing it was on my skin which no sunscreen has done so far for me and it did not sting under my eyes. But sadly because it feels like applying candle wax and it feels coarse, it discouraged me from applying it and even when I applied super tiny amounts it was hard. Soon after I ended up getting breakouts and even worse skin texture from it.  It did make me slightly sweat above my upper lip and below my lower lip area and a bit under my eyes but not as much as the Minimalist SPF 50 sunscreen did. That one made me sweat buckets in seconds! I resolved the sweating due to the Deconstruct sunscreen issue by dabbing a bit of baby powder ( its my cheap dupe for setting powder or compact powder)  all over and that gave a nice matte and dry powdery look. \n\nAdditionally similar to Re'equil, cleansing it off is a pain in the butt! 😵‍💫😵‍💫🤧🤧I used so much cleansing balm ( Earth Rhthm Propolis cleansing balm) and the Bioderma Micellar water AND a foaming cleanser TWICE or THRICE  and it still remained on my face without going away. I had to spend 30 mins and tons of cleansing products,( and get drenched all over like I stood under the shower)  just to remove even half of it all and in frustration I ended up going to bed with some of it still on my face and neck.  I was severely disappointed in it but I guess for this price point I am not surprised since Indian brands rarely give you a bang for your buck when it comes to affordable sunscreens. 🥲🥲 Also, from the looks of it, it seemed they were trying to make a silicone free, cheaper dupe of the Re'equil ultra matte dry touch sunscreen ( blue one) but gosh.... I would take my risks with Re'equil far more than this one  😓 and for all its affordability, I ended up wasting precious expensive cleansing products in desperately trying to take it off of my skin. \n\n\nI will say that it did give  decent protection from the UV rays and I did not tan as much as I usually do. Since this sunscreen is sweat and water proof but terrible for my face, I decided to use it on my hands and feet since the sunscreen in these areas also wipes off quickly and this will give me perfect protection there. \n\nAll in all, I will give this sunscreen 2/5 and will not recommend it for indoor use either except for your hands and feet. Definitely WNRP.",

I'm definitely not going through an entire bottle of newly opened sunscreen in a week. Was relieved that 3 out of 4 above had preservatives but the sad thing is this isn't 100% across the board. We're not even at the stage where we can evaluate if the preservative system is sufficient, I'm having to go with \"well, at least there's one.\"\n\nCan anyone chime in one whether one preservative like ethylhexylglycerin or phenoxyethanol is as sufficient as we can compromise on for commonly used products? I can't tell an entire industry to bring back parabens (which sadly accompany formulas with other irritating/comedogenic ingredients for me like niacinamide, alcohol/alcohol denat., shea butter, etc. and I don't think my skin likes the high ratio of propanediol in many products) so this is me on copium.  \n\nI still use skinsort even with all its problems, but too bad they only have \"paraben-free\" as a filter option and not \"with parabens or preservatives\" as one.\n\nUpdate: To clarify, I'm personally expressing my own concern based on the resources I've access to as a public consumer. I appreciate people giving me balanced pushback (and thank you to those sharing resources for me to look into further), and still, given that we're all forced to navigate these cloudy waters on our own if we don't have a background in this field already means these questions come up for me. I think it's okay to ask questions and have a discussion as flaired, even if it seems silly to some. Thank you for keeping it respectful.",

For example, I am an engineer, and while I took chemistry and did clinical lab there's absolutely no way that I am qualified or knowledgeable enough to understand and judge every single ingredient in a formula or what each one of them do when put together. It would be completely foolish of me to do so without any solid, evidence based, backing behind it; every single opinion that I give on this sub or any other has anywhere between many years of experience or solid hours of googling behind it, and I expect others to do the same. \n\nTaking the word of someone, anyone, regardless of their qualifications or credentials without doing research on their claims and finding how it lines up with the general consensus it's also very foolish. LabMuffin is not infallible, she's one woman who can make mistakes and will make them in the future, and relying on her word alone is not enough when it comes to complex topics and discussions. \nThe Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, the branch of government that oversees and imposes The Comestic Act, is where you have to go if you want to further understand any ingredient of any product made and sold in Korea. There are plenty of [documents](https://www.mfds.go.kr/eng/wpge/m_24/de011014l001.do) and webpages made available in English for you to look through, and many other [websites](https://cosmetic.chemlinked.com/cosmepedia/regulatory-requirements-for-cosmetic-ingredients-in-south-korea) who dive deeper into the topic by reviewing and translating documents. \n\nIn short, to try and raise alarm on a topic based with very little backing and even less proper research is definitely not helpful in the current anti-science climate we're living in.",

        "body": "Eh, while I understand the concerns of many commenters, and I also appreciate many points raised up that I didn’t consider myself, I think some of the pushbacks are overblown and to link OP’s question with anti-science and anti-intellectualism attitude is itself a somewhat a lapse of judgement. \n\nThe worry about the demonization of preservatives is very valid considering that clean beauty marketings have been practically the default within the past few years, and brands itself have been kinda sneaky with the way they advertise. They either justify their short-life products as ~it’s meant to be that way because it’s au naturel~. Or they still use preservatives, just not the largely demonized and widely recognized ones like paraben, then they market it as paraben-free, which is technically true and they don’t explicitly state preservative-free, **but you can’t pretend that the fear of paraben isn’t read as the fear of preservatives as a whole to the public**.\n\nAnd Lab Muffin isn’t just some random influencer who doesn’t know what she talks about. Yes, she is flawed and fallible. But she is very passionate about consumers’ science literacy. Now is it possible for her viewers to watch her videos and not perfectly grasp her message? Of course! Each of us is deeply imperfect as a communicator and an audience. \n\nBut it’s still incorrect to conflate someone like Michelle as the typical influencer who loves to talk out of their a** and someone like OP as the anti-science crunchy type. After all, the examples OP listed are all Korean sunscreens, which btw I literally just received my stock-up haul of Skin1004 sun serum, but you can’t ignore the fact the K-beauty brands literally had a scandal not too long ago regarding their sunscreen regulation. And guess who was the big influencer that originally went bat for K-beauty brands when the allegations started to bubble up? It was Lab Muffin beauty.",

    "body": "Evenprime Daily Moisturizer\n\nWhen I think about what I want in the perfect daily moisturizer things like long-lasting hydration, soothing, nourishment, and brightening come to mind. Luckily, I have found a couple great products this year including the Good Skin Days On The Bright Side Moisturizer and Pureforet Centella Multi Lotion.\n\nAnd, I’m happy to say I’ve found another awesome option with the Evenprime Daily Moisturizer.\n\nThis ingredient packed lotion features niacinamide, panthenol, allantoin, sunflower seed oil, chamomile, licorice root, madecassoside, ferment filtrate, and several forms of hyaluronic acid...essentially covering all of my bases.\n\nIn addition, the lightweight gel/cream contains knotweed, mushroom extracts, and soybean seed extract to add a boost of antioxidant and anti-irritation properties. Seriously, this is one of the most well-formulated and impressive ingredients lists I have seen in a single product.\n\nBringing things home...the Evenprime Daily Moisturizer absorbs incredibly quickly without leaving behind a film, residue, or heavy feeling making it perfect for my oily/combination/changes every day skin. \n\nOver time I have really appreciated how this moisturizer helps to calm my skin, provide a decent amount of hydration, and even enhanced the brightening effects of my exfoliation/essence steps. I honestly cannot get enough of this product!\n\nBut, now that the cooler weather is upon us alongside the dryness in the air (hello Colorado)...I’ve found myself looking for a bit more in the way of emollient “moisture locking” products. The Evenprime Daily Moisturizer hasn’t provided quite enough recently, especially for my pm routine.\n\nWhile I have been able to work around this by incorporating the Solved Skincare Jojoba Oil Serum into the mix (3 drops in the am and 6 in the pm), I could see those with particularly dry skin looking for more. \n\nThe Evenprime Daily Moisturizer is still an incredible product that I think just about anyone could see some benefit from...and rumor has it there might be a heavier version in the works! But for now, I’ll be continuing to add an extra boost and then reaching for something more rich in the coming months.\n\nFull Ingredients List: WATER (AQUA), GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, POLYGLYCERYL-3 METHYLGLUCOSE DISTEARATE, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, NIACINAMIDE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, SORBITAN STEARATE, ADENOSINE, ALLANTOIN, PANTHENOL, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, SEA WATER (MARIS AQUA), CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA (MATRICARIA) FLOWER EXTRACT, GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA (LICORICE) ROOT EXTRACT, GALACTOMYCES FERMENT FILTRATE , PENTYLENE GLYCOL, POLYGONUM MULTIFLORUM ROOT EXTRACT, PHELLINUS LINTEUS EXTRACT, ANGELICA GIGAS ROOT EXTRACT, PAEONIA LACTIFLORA ROOT EXTRACT, SESAMUM INDICUM (SESAME) SEED EXTRACT, SOPHORA FLAVESCENS ROOT EXTRACT, CIMICIFUGA RACEMOSA ROOT EXTRACT, MORUS ALBA BARK EXTRACT, SCUTELLARIA BAICALENSIS ROOT EXTRACT, CENTELLA ASIATICA LEAF EXTRACT, SODIUM HYALURONATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE CROSSPOLYMER, HYDROLYZED HYALURONIC ACID, HYALURONIC ACID, HYDROLYZED SODIUM HYALURONATE, MADECASSOSIDE, CARBOMER, TROMETHAMINE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, XANTHAN GUM, SODIUM PHYTATE, BETAINE\n\nWhere To Buy (Evenprime Site - $32.00 USD - 50ml): [https://evenprime.co/collections/all/products/evenprime-moisturizer](https://evenprime.co/collections/all/products/evenprime-moisturizer) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3fpmjp8sm3w51.jpg?width=4478&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed52b4aa2ef9dc48a80f5148feea62f55e8f8c83",

    "body": "A quick review right before I shower HAHAHA.\n\nInfo:\nI have combination skin leaning towards oily. My skin is acne and clog prone and I do have some KP on my bottom cheeks/jaws. My skin is also a sensitive and moody chicken if anyone’s wondering so I’m super picky about the products I use. \n\n\nRoutine:\n\nAM: Splash with water -> Vanicream daily facial moisturiser -> some sunscreen sample lol\nPM: Dokdo cleanser -> vanicream daily facial moisturiser\n\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Coco-Betaine, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Potassium Benzoate, Sodium Chloride, Polyquaternium-67, Potassium Cocoate, Citric Acid, Fructooligosaccharides, Saccharide Hydrolysate, Disodium EDTA, Pullulan, 1,2-Hexanediol, Allantoin, Panthenol, Sea Water, Sodium Acetate, Butylene Glycol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Caprylic/​Capric Triglycerides, Beta-Glucan, Phosphatidylcholine, Hyaluronic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide NP, Glycine, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Glutamic Acid, Serine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lysine, Alanine, Arginine, Threonine, Proline\n\n\nThis cleanser had a very creamy and sticky texture. It foams a little when you rub your hands together with water. As the whole line is targeted towards sensitive skin, it is a very gentle cleanser.\n\n\nThoughts:\n\nOkay I actually didn’t really expect much from this product when I first used it. It was a huge impulse buy and I actually regretted buying it. Prior to using this cleanser, I was using the Rovectin Conditioning Cleanser and let’s just say that it was one big roller coaster haha. I switched over to this cleanser in hopes to save my skin and also because it was just collecting dust on my desk lol.\n\nThe texture is sooooo fun to play with. Even though it’s creamy, it’s also rather sticky. It’s nothing like the other cleansers I’ve tried before. It doesn’t foam up too much so my skin doesn’t feel stripped.\n\nWhile it doesn’t have any added fragrances, it does have a smell. Personally to me it smells like someone threw up in it, but some people say it smells herbal like or plastic like or mineral like. Yeah lots of different smells LOL. I thought I had bought a fake so I went and bought another cleanser (travel version) from the official store and it smells the same so rip ;-;. \n\nIt’s a no nonsense kind of cleanser, does what it needs to do and does it well. It doesn’t remove makeup that well because it’s quite gentle, so you might need a first cleanser for that. For sunscreen it depends, but I’ve heard some people just cleanse their face twice with the cleanser just to be safe. \n\nCompared to the previous cleanser I used, this one was so nice to use. It made me feel so excited to shower LOL. I didn’t get any reactions from this and in fact, some of my CCs and pimples actually went down when I started using this. \n\nIs this HG? I guess it is. I’m genuinely hesitant to call something a HG because I’m scared that my skin will go no u on me. But I guess at this moment? It is close to being one. I bought mine off of SHOPEE and it cost about SGD$18-$20+ with discount. I think the original price is about $30? I might actually repurchase this once I’m done HAHAHA.  9/10\n\nRoundlab is also well known for their Dokdo toner and I’m really tempted to try it LOL. But I have my pyunkangyul essence toner coming in soon for me to try so ummmm one day one day. My friend actually bought it and said that it’s such a good toner.",

    "body": "**Context for reviews:** I posted [a haul of mineral-based sunscreens](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1c8400r/mineralphysical_spf_haul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) a few weeks ago and wanted to share my thoughts so far! My goal this summer is to find at least one alternative to Dr. G (my HG, see below) since sometimes it's harder to find in stock, and the other goal is to find a water-resistant sunscreen, possibly mineral, that doesn't irritate my skin; this review post does not includeany water resistant products. Hope to post part 2 in a couple weeks after I can test more!\n\nMy skin seems to react better consistently to zinc oxide-based sunscreens for daily use. (Typically, not so good with titanium dioxide as the primary SPF ingredient, that has been drying for me.) I haven't totally ruled out all chemical sunscreens, though I've had reactions of irritation, break outs, flushing or burning with some chemical-based sunscreens (including the oh-so-lovely BOJ Rice + Probiotics, Skin1004 hyla-cica sun serum, HaruHaru Wonder airyfit, some Skin Aqua products). Mineral sunscreens also seem to help reduce shine/oil on t zone.\n\nI opt for products that are fragrance free (I find it distracting on my face but also some concern for irritation) and avoid or minimal use of essential oils. \n\n**Skin type:** Combination, acne-prone, sensitive, rosacea type 1. Mid 30s. Pale skin.\n\n\n\n**Climate:** \"Mediterranean\" according to google, extra hot and very dry spring/summers, mild winters.\n\n**Relevant routine notes:** I typically apply a daytime moisturizer under sunscreen and sometimes a serum, such as Aestura Hydro Soothing Cream and Cos De Baha Tranexamic Acid + Niacinamide Serum. I also double cleanse most nights using a cleansing balm and a water-based cleanser. I do try to reapply SPF every 2 hours in direct sun and before going out for walks during the workday. I don't often wear makeup beyond concealer.\n\n**Skin concerns:** barrier care, acne, redness, PIE\n\n---\n\n**KEY:** WRNP = Would Not Repurchase. MRP = Might Repurchase. WRP = Would/Will Repurchase. HG = Holy Grail/Multiple Repurchases/I Rely On This!\n\n*Note: All of these sunscreens contain butyloctyl salicylate, which seems to be generally considered an unregulated chemical sunscreen ingredient; some ingredient sites consider it an \"emollient\" and others a \"sunscreen booster.\" I don't seem to react negatively to this ingredient but I do consider it worth mentioning, given the various factors that many folks seek out mineral sunscreen options.*\n\n**Isntree - Hyaluronic Acid Natural Sun Cream** SPF 50+ PA++++\n\n**Ingredient list** (from Olive Young): Water, Zinc Oxide, Cyclohexasiloxane, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propanediol, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Isododecane, Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Niacinamide, Caprylyl Methicone, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Lauryl Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Tocopherol, Sodium Hyaluronate (10 ppm), Betaine, Inositol, Panthenol\n\n**Use time:** about 1 week of daily use in springtime.\n\n**Overall Impression:** Creamy in texture and fairly moisturizing. It does have kind of an extreme white-cast. It takes a fair amount of rubbing in to reduce for me, it's a dedicated process, hah! I noticed it most around my nostril creases and uhhh my mini mustache. My partner who has a deeper skin tone found the white cast intolerable, TBH. That said, it has a decent pore blurring effect if you get it rubbed in enough, heh. I found it to be non-drying. I originally thought I could possibly skip moisturizing with this but I noticed some days when I didn't reapply in the PM, my forehead looked more dehydrated than usual. I think it's a dewy-ish finish. I didn't experience any irritation while using, so that's also good.\n\n**Rating:** WNRP as I think there are better options out there! I will use up what I have later this summer.\n\n**Torriden - DIVE IN Mild Suncream** SPF 50+ PA++++\n\n**Ingredient list (from Olive Young Global):** Water, Zinc Oxide, Cyclohexasiloxane, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Isododecane, Lauryl Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Caprylyl Methicone, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Hyaluronate, Dimethylsilanol Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Dimethylsilanol, Panthenol, Allantoin, Trehalose, Ceramide NP, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, 2,3-Butanediol, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Lauryl Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Malachite Extract\n\n**Use time:** about 2 weeks of mostly daily use in springtime\n\n**Overall:** I really enjoy this sunscreen! It's quite cosmetically elegant and I would say very very easy to apply. I do sort of apply in layers a bit. It is a slightly gel-creamy texture, the texture feels \"plump\" for lack of a better word. The white cast disappears much faster and with less rubbing in than most mineral sunscreens for me, though I have to be mindful of white cast along my hairline more than I'm used to and it takes longer when reapplying. It dries down fairly well, feels both moisturizing and hydrating somehow! My skin feels extra soft at the end of the day. I can use it interchangeably with my HG below, which for my sensitive skin is *saying somethin'.* I would say it's a more dewy or maybe satin finish. Extra plus, it comes in a cute narrow tube that is quite convenient in my packed purse!\n\n**Rating:** WRP for sure\n\n**Dr. G - Green Mild Up Sun+** SPF 50+ PA++++\n\n**Ingredients (from Olive Young Global):** Water, Zinc Oxide, Propanediol, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Caprylyl Methicone, Isododecane, Lauryl Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Methyl Trimethicone, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Lauryl Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Caesalpinia Spinosa Fruit Extract, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Kappaphycus Alvarezii Extract, 7-Dehydrocholesterol, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Ectoin, Buddleja Officinalis Flower Extract, Lactobacillus Ferment, Hydroxycinnamic Acid, Rutin\n\n**Use Time:** about 1 year with pretty regular use as a daily sunscreen, all seasons\n\n**Overall:** This is a slightly loose, more liquidy texture but not runny. It applies easily and dries down pretty quickly. There is a distinct white cast that for me disappears effectively once rubbed in and after it settles; it gives a nice pore blurring effect. I find this non-drying, non-irritating and reliable. I don't seem to notice white cast around my hairline, in comparison to Torriden, and find it easy to reapply. While it does have more plant extracts than I typically aim for, I've had no issues so I'll keep using! It's a bit plain -- which is great for sensitive skin, but I admit I find the Torriden just a bit more *fun* somehow. I do think it is the best matte finish with nice oil control.\n\n**Rating:** HG always want to have a backup at the ready\n\n  \nNext on my list: Biore UV Kids Pure Milk (water resistant - spoiler: didn't have a great start on day 1&2, broke out immediately), Biore BarrierMe (water resistant), Axis Y No Stress Physical Sunscreen, Benton Mineral we'll find out if I can tolerate rosemary oil. \n\nAny other suggestions to try? I've tried Haruharu's mineral SPF but wasn't a fan of the texture or white cast, and I've used the hybrid Skin Aqua Moisture Milk (seems to break me out, boo). \n\nThanks for reading! Let me know any questions! ",

Im fair skinned and Same skin type as you but living in a hot and cold seasonal climate (Canada) \n\nI was looking for a non drying mineral sunscreen as I’ve been recently dealing with rosacea that suddenly walked into my life when I got skin damage from UV \n\nInstree - I tried the physical one. I found it cosmetically beautiful . Never saw my pores. But definitely the slightest white tint since my eyebrows went a shade lighter lol. Dries matte. dunno if I have a hyaluronic sensitivity from my damaged skin barrier but I found as the day wore on it was VERY drying. I did use it to almost full bottle but prolly will not repurchase \n\nBiore kids UV pure milk - used for a week. While moisturizing left me shiny and oily looking. Now I give it to my 2 year old lol. Since they always need extra protection. I would still use this in a clutch cuz I believe it’s more water resistant and good for those pool days (when you look gross and sweaty anyways) \n\nColorescience no show mineral - I got a sample of this from my esthetician. While it went on great, inbetween dewy and matte, I swear it’s pilling. Especially when I wear a mask all day at work. Still testing this with different moisturizer in day to see if that was the issue. \n\nI was still on the hunt for a sunscreen I could tolerate. I will definitely try dr G. It felt great on my hand so now big test onto the face….\n \n\n\n- another side comment. Sorry if this is making my post extra long. Even tho I cannot tolerate chemical sunscreens. Oddly enough my HG was la Roche Possay melt in sunscreen. It was a titanium dioxide sunscreen hybrid. I ONLY used it for hikes and pool days. Never burned. Which makes me want to research more hybrid sunscreens. Have you tried any?",

Some of these are repeats and some were first time bought. Let me start with the repeats:\n\n**1) Minimalist Vitamin C + E + Ferulic Acid 16%**\n\n**💸Price:** Rs. 599/- for 20 ml. I got Minimalist Invisible Sunscreen SPF 40 free with it.\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Butylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Citrate, Citric Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Gluconate, Ferulic Acid, Coceth-7, Phenoxyethanol, PPG-1-PEG-9 Lauryl Glycol Ether, Fullerenes, Tocopherol Acetate, Ethylhexylglycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PVP, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n**🍶Packaging:** Dropper black bottle, comes with an extra carton\n\n**Fragrance:** None \n\nIf there's one product I've always raved about, it's this Vitamin C Serum. This has become my HG that I've purchased Multiple times now, and will probably repurchase in future. \n\nI love how it lasts longer and doesn't oxidise quickly compared to other Vitamin C Serums, and there's a no difference in my skin on its usage. It does a good job at lightening and fading acne spots and marks. The only other Vitamin C Serum I like is Cosrx 23%, but it's quite heavy on the pockets. \n\nI'm quite tempted to try out the Klairs and the Numbuzin one. Would appreciate the reviews if anyone has used them.\n\n**2) Formularx Hydrashied Vitamin C + Peptide Watery Gel Sunscreen SPF 50 PA ++++**\n\n**💸Price:** Rs. 699/- for 50 ml. It's frequently available on BOGO offers on their website.\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Vitamin C, Peptides, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin B5\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Octocrylene, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Titanium Dioxide, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate/VP Copolymer, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Gold, Disodium EDTA, Pentapeptide-4, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glutathione, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract\n\n**🍶Packaging:** Tube\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\nThis is my second tube, and I love the texture. It's very lightweight, absorbs easily, no greasiness on the skin and yes, No whitecast. It also doesn't burn my eyes, like the Minimalist Invisible Sunscreen. I doubt it's waterproof, as the tube does state to reapply after exposure to water. Using this post snail mucin essence or a hyaluronic moisturizer gives a dewy look. \n\nAs far as protecting against sun exposure goes, I do cover my face with a dupatta when I leave home. I'd say there's a light tan on my face coz the summer heat is at its peak. Though labmuffin says that good sunscreen don't always prevent tan so I don't know what to say about that. \n\nAs far as the texture goes, it's Amazing, just don't expect miracles when it comes to sun protection.\n\n**3) Pyungkal Yul Calming Moisture  Barrier Cream**\n\n**💸 PRICE:** Rs. 1250/- for 50 ml. Frequently available on discounts at Maccaron\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Centella Asiatica, Ceramides\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Isohexadecane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Stearic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Glucoside, Pentylene Glycol, Trehalose, Ceramide NP, Arachidic Acid, Glucose, Palmitic Acid, Oleic Acid, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Squalane, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Hydroxyacetophenone, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, Disodium EDTA, 1,2-Hexanediol, Tromethamine, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Packaging:** Tub\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\nThis is a BOMB moisturizer. Having a combination skin with oily Tzone always meant trouble finding a good barrier repair cream. Most barrier repair moisturizer having ceramides have thicker textures that feel either too heavy or too greasy, or both, on the skin.\n\nNow I had just started Olay Retinol Serum, and was in need to a ceramide moisturizer to protect my skin barrier. I just randomly bought this on Maccaron when it was available on a great discount.\n\nAnd I've found my HG. It's so good, so lightweight, not at all heavy and soothing. I always end up with a pimple while trying ceramide cream but this one was so light it didn't feel greasy at all. \n\nI'm in love and this has definitely entered my list of future repurchase. \n\n**4) Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Essence Water**\n\n**💸Price:**  Rs. 1500/- for 150ml Available on discounts at multiple websites\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Ginseng, Niacinamide, Adenosine\n\n**Ingredients:** Panax Ginseng Root Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Propanediol, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Water, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glyceryl Glucoside, Panthenol, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Adenosine, Dextrin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Disodium Edta, Glucose, Panax Ginseng Callus Culture Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Panax Ginseng Berry Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Lactobacillus/Panax Ginseng Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n**Claims:** Cruelty free, no artificial fragrance, colorants, mineral oil, parabens, sulfates.\n\nA cult favourite toner, how could I skip this? And here's my judgement, it's good to damp your skin and give a nice plump. Not ideal if you're looking for the glass skin effect. I think this is one of those products that don't give an immediate result, but when you use it consistently, you do feel your skin looks better. \n\nHaving said that, I don't think this would be a repurchase. It's good, but nothing that stood out. I'd rather experiment with multiple other toners available in the market. ",

    "body": "The Fig Boosting Essence from I’m From is the last of three fig based products the brand released earlier this year that I have worked into my routine.\n\nEach one featured a different percentage of fig extract or powder which is said to offer deep hydration and anti-aging properties. This essence has the highest concentration of the three offerings with 62.7% fig extract.\n\nI’ll be honest...by the time I had worked this essence into my routine the Fig Cleansing Balm and Fig Scrub Mask had already “failed” for me. Both of them were just a bit too heavy for my taste...either by being too abrasive or leaving behind a waxy residue.\n\nAnd the Fig Boosting Essence falls into that same category unfortunately. Rather than being a super thin/watery essence (like those from Missha or Secret Key) the goal here is more about rich hydration and nourishment and the consistency is ever-so-slightly thicker than water.\n\nWhile it totally delivers on that hit of hydration...I found there to be a slight oily feeling residue after patting in even one layer. It’s not something I really like during my essence stage and I had a similar issue with the Laneige Cream Skin.\n\nI could 100% see those with drier skin types or those that love heavier/more occlusive formulations to really get along with this product. I just dont think this range from I’m From is meant for me and I’ll be passing the rest of my bottle off to a friend.\n\nFull Ingredients List: Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Propanediol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Water, Pentylene Glycol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Chlorella Vulgaris Extract, Glucose, Panthenol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Diphenyl Dimethicone, Fructooligosaccharides, Fructose, Triethylhexanoin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Allantoin, Betaine Salicylate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Octanediol, Tocopherol \n\nWhere To Buy (Wishtrend - $35.00 USD - 150ml): [https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/fig-boosting-essence/](https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/fig-boosting-essence/) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jmeqcar4jxo51.jpg?width=4868&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=080ea30b81a9fd01b57752b3a6ff6800c3875c7c",

I’ve heard some people say that they can smell rosemary extract in it, but it’s so light that I truly can’t tell if I’m smelling the ingredients or the extract (the rosemary extract is the last ingredient). The little beads break down really quickly and settle nicely. This is one of the few moisturizers I’ve tried that feel truly “nourishing” on the face so far. It’s hard for me to find stuff to hold in water so this is a pleasant discovery. As far as any film, if I drag my finger on my face, I can feel something, but it dries matte-ish/natural finish. I can stretch my face and it feels very elastic compared to when I feel dry. So far, I’m impressed.\n\n**AM Usage:** I found that it did not make my face look greasy and kept it quite hydrated for a long time, but the scinic was quite drying and eventually my sunscreen would siphon the water out of my face, particularly in the anteromedial cheek region (the skin that connects to the side of the nose, under the eyes and the rest of the cheek). It did its best to stand up to it as much as it could without making me greasy (I tested other moisturizers and the same thing happened, so its not just this one). I began to notice some pimples on my face after using it for a week that just wouldn't go away, and I postulated that this must be the culprit. I decided to use it as a summertime body balm, but I also broke out on my back and shoulders (where I applied it). I am sooooooooo sad about this because it's otherwise really lightweight. It doesn't really hold much moisture on the rest of my skin.\n\n**PM Usage:** I found it was comfortable to buffer with tret. It held the moisture in my skin all night long and felt comfortable by the morning. Very few moisturizers do this.\n\n**Conclusion:** While it has an airy finish and is very moisturizing, I did have break outs from it (maybe due to some of the fatty acid concentrations). It's a great value for its price. I wanted to post this review as not many reference breakouts; however, there are some. I would think it's worth at least a try, but please just be a little wary if you're very acne-prone.\n\n**Final Rating:** *6.5/10, WNRP because of the breakouts*\n\n**Pros + Cons List:**\n\n|Pros:|Cons:|\n|:-|:-|\n|moisturizing, yet mattifying and lightweight|break-outs|\n|good for dehydrated skin|not exactly the best body balm|\n|great value||\n|can buffer tret||\n\n&#x200B;",

    "body": "\nSkin Type: Extremely Oily and Acne Prone\n\nWeather: Hot and dry\n\nReview Type: Rave\n\nUsage Period: 3 months \n\nActive ingredients: \n\n* 3% tranexamic acid \n* 1% HPA (hydroxyphenoxy propionic acid)\n*  3% mandelic acid \n* 0.3% salicylic acid\n\nAll ingredients: aqua, avena sativa (oat) kernel extract, tranexamic acid, dimethyl isosorbide, mandelic acid, pentylene glycol, methylpropanediol, acetyl glucosamine, hydroxyphenoxy propionic acid, sodium polyglutamate, sodium hyaluronate, ethoxydiglycol, salicylic acid, xanthan gum, lecithin, phenoxyethanol, sclerotium gum, pullulan, ethylhexylglycerin, curcuma longa (turmeric) root extract, trisodium ethylenediamine disuccinate.\n\nTexture: it is liquidy but not runny, and it has a yellow colour due to presence of turmeric.\n\nReview\n\nThis product is the most favourite part of my skincare because when I apply the serum at night, it always lives up to my expectation of waking up with a clean shiny skin next morning. \n\nWhen I first started using the product, I built up tolerance by starting once a week, then twice, then thrice and gradually everyday (except on the nights I use a AHA BHA Peel)\n\nI love the formulation of this serum the most because it honestly has everything which an oily, acne prone skin needs.\nMadelic acid is a really gentle exfoliant and since the serum has the same amt of Mandelic acid as Tranexamic which we can call it a gentle exfoliating serum too. It also a tiny amt salicylic acid which makes it an all rounder for my routine. \n\nI’ve been using the serum along with 2% granactive Retinod from Be Minimalist.\nI apply the Tranexamic acid serum, wait for a couple of minutes for it to sink it, and layer it with a pea size of Granactive Retinoid. This has been advised to me by the Be Minimalist team. I top it up with moisturiser. I’m the happiest when I wake up to smoother skin.\n\nOne thing I don’t understand is no matter how flawless my skin looks in the morning, it becomes a little bumpy, oily, filled with CCs by the end of the day. Does this happen to y’all too?\n\nI’ve definitely seen a reduction in hyperpigmentation and acne with this routine and especially the Tranexamic acid serum over past 3 months but I’ve been battling with greasy oily skin at the end of the day and formation of small CCs which go away in the morning. The Tranexamic acid serum fades my new acne marks a lot quicker than the amount of time it took me earlier to get rid of a scar. \nAlso, I didn’t take sunscreen seriously earlier and had grown a shade darker than my original skintone, with use of this, I’ve been back to my original skintone. \nI had this little small visible black heads on my cheeks which have faded too over past 2-3 months. \nI will definitely repurchase the serum. \n\nMy routine \nAM: \n- Pulp Vit C serum\n- Sepicalm moisturiser (sometimes)\n- Neutrogena Sheer Zinc sunscreen\n(It has white cast but it’s the only one that suits me and doesn’t irritate me or cause breakouts, idc about the white cast much because most of times I’m at home and when I’m out I wear a mask)\n\nPM:\n- Double Cleansing with\n* The Face Shop Rice cleansing oil\n* Bioderma Sebum Cleanser\n- Cosrx Snail Mucin \n(I usually go for a walk or run and come back sweaty so I splash my face with plain water and do my night routine at 11)\n- Tranexamic acid serum\n- Granactive Retinoid \n- Sepicalm Moisturiser from Be Minimalist",

        "body": "Oh, this is the first I'm noticing the mandelic acid in there! This is an exfoliating serum! 🤔 Thanks for the thorough review, OP ❤\n\nAs for your developing CCs by the end of the day - the Sepicalm moisturiser might be too heavy for you to use in the AM, but more than that, I suspect you're over-exfoliating 😅 The vitamin C in the morning, AFAIK, is an L-ascorbic one, so that's acidic, and causes some mild exfoliation. The TxA serum at night is exfoliation. Then on top of that, you do the AHA-BHA peel as well? *Plus*, getting used to a retinoid already compromises barrier function. \n\nIt's a *lot* of exfoliation, combined. You may not be peeling, but it causes that shiny-plasticky look, and makes skin more vulnerable to acne bacteria and fungal acne and general infections. \n\nLuckily, people with oily skin have a bit more of a natural barrier function. I'd say maybe stop using the peel, and dial back using the TxA serum to alternate days, and you should see your skin become more balanced. Give your skin some time to function between actives.\n\nEdit: the Minimalist team and their website have terrible suggestions for how often to use their products, don't go by that!",

We’re so excited in this growth and the thought provoking and interesting discussions that have sprouted in such a short time.\n\nDo you like the new CSS? /u/smallrobots is a beautiful wizard and put this together while I was sleeping. If you see any issues or areas of improvement, please let us know!\n\n---\n#Asian Beauty Network\n \nAs the Reddit Asian Beauty community grows, it has become increasingly obvious that a single catch all subreddit no longer fits the needs of the community. \n \nr/abdiscussion was created to be a thoughtful discussion oriented space, and was always intended to be a companion subreddit. That's why we’re really happy to work together with a group of dedicated moderators to be part a network of subreddits that allows you to create the perfect AB Reddit experience for you.\n \n* /r/AsianBeautyRehab\n* r/asianbeautyexchange \n* r/ABCJ \n* r/ABCJDiscussion and  \n* r/AsianBeautyAdvice. \n \nEach space caters to a different need, you can find them all [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeautyNetwork) with an explanation of what each subreddit focuses on. \n \nThere’s also a multireddit feed which can be found [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/user/stufstuf/m/asianbeautynetwork/) that you can copy, save  and edit!\n \nWith that in mind, this post will outline how we intend to manage Reviews, Help Threads and The Wiki on ABDiscussion.\n\n\n--- \n#Reviews\nReviews are back, with a format and a dedicated weekly thread! Thank you to /u/rumazazil for the initial template.\n \nAlongside Asian Beauty Reader’s Digest Monday, Monday will also feature a Review Thread! Each month, we will have a Monthly Review thread based on a central theme based on an interesting discussion topic raised by the community.\n \nReviews using the review structure are encouraged in the ‘Ingredients and Studies Tuesday’, ‘Makeup Discussion Wednesday’ and ‘Miscellaneous AB Thursday’ Weekly threads. \n  \n##Format\n \n* **Full Product Name**:\n* **Skin Type/Skin Tone/Current Climate**:\n* **Reason for Use**:\n* **Product Size & Price**:  \n* **Packaging**: \n* **Ingredients**: \n* **Product smell, texture & finish**:\n* **Product effects compared to claims**: \n* **Where it fits in the routine & how it behaves with other products**:\n* **How long it has been used for**:\n* **Has it been/will it be repurchased**:\n* **Concluding remarks**:\n\n*example*:\n\n* **Full Product Name**:  Neogen Bio-Peel Gauze Peeling Lemon\n* **Skin Type/Skin Tone/Current Climate**: Oily, acne prone, humid and cold.\n* **Reason for Use**: For gentle exfoliation\n* **Product Size & Price**: Box of 8 pads, price unknown as it was a sponsor gift. \n* **Packaging**: Individually wrapped pads in a foil pouch. I really like this set because it makes it easy to carry around for overnight stays or on the plane.\n* **Ingredients**: Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Alcohol Denat., PEG/PPG017/6 Copolymer, Sodium Hyaluronate, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract , Cymbopogon Citratus Extract, Citrus Unshiu Peel Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Tricholoma Matsutake Extract, Cordyceps Sinensis Extract , Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Extract, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Fruit Extract, Saururus Chinensis Leaf/Root Extract, Arnica Montana Flower Extract, Artemisia Absinthium Extract, Broussonetia Kazinoki Bark Extract, Coptis Chinensis Root Extract , PEG-60 Hydrogenated Cator Oil, Carbomer, Tartaric Acid , Glycolic Acid , Lactic Acid , Tromethamine, Disodium EDTA, Benzophenone-5, CI 19140, CI 17200, Fragrance\n* **Product smell, texture & finish**: It smells like lemon, which is really off putting as I've had lemon = bad drilled into my head. It leaves a sticky finish but you have to wash it off. \n* **Product effects compared to claims**: Claims - \"this product provides gentle yet effective exfoliation of dead skin cells and impurities, leaving skin smoother and clear.\" Sure, I guess? It's gentle, but I didn't think it left it particularly smoother than any of my regular acid products.\n* **Where it fits in the routine & how it behaves with other products**: I use it as my acid step after cleansing, but it's a wash off acid, so you have to bear that in mind.\n* **How long it has been used for**: I've used two pads so far.\n* **Has it been/will it be repurchased**: Has not been repurchased, and will not be repurchased.\n* **Concluding remarks**: I like them well enough and I'm glad I got to try it because those tubs have been super inviting, and I've been lemming HARD. But honestly it just hasn't wowed me to make me want to use it often. Especially as I have to wash it off, which is like, WHY. This is effort, I don't see a huge change and compared to the Innisfree Green Barley Peeling Pad, it's pretty meh. What I will say is that you can use it as a body pad just before a shower which is actually not bad because it is mega mega soaked in product.\n \n\nIf there are other points you think should be included in the template or removed, please let us know. \n\n--- \n#Help Threads, Asking for Advice & The Wiki \nFor the foreseeable future we will not have help threads. The daily threads are discussion threads, not help threads, so while advice has been freely given we want to make it very clear that **no member of the community is obligated to give advice or help anyone**. Every discussion topic should feel like a slumber party where you're talking stuff out with your friends. Advice should be part of an organic discussion. \n \nInstead of, “I'm NW15, should I buy The Face Shop Super Ultra Cool to the MAX in 13?”\n \nTry, “It's summer and I've seen a lot of cooling cushions around that make me really curious. Do they work? I have no idea! I read this review that said they do and this one that says they don't. My NW15 skin thinks they're a gimmick, but I'm tempted to get this The Face Shop Super Ultra Cool to the MAX in 13 I found on Peony Peony Store. Anyone tried any cooling products from this line?”\n\nPlease remember, if you can easily do an internet search for the answer, you should do so, not expect anyone else to do it for you.\n\nAs r/AsianBeautyAdvice have awesome plans for a wiki, we will not be curating one in the traditional sense.  \n \n--- \n#Other Points:\n\n**Flairs**\n\nThere is also no need for post flairs as everything should be a discussion! \n\nOther than no self promotion (ie no link to your blog/external platform) we have no restrictions on personal flairs. Skin type, location and skin tone are common flair content, but you can also have fun with it as long as it isn’t offensive.\n \nAn example of suitable flairs would be:\n \n* Snail enthusiast\n* Dry/Sensitive Skin | Australia\n* NW20 | Passionate about AB makeup!\n* Tony Moly Banana Pack needs more love\n \n\n**Blogger, Businesses & External Content Creators:**\n\nNo shameless self promotion and no stand alone threads centered around your content. All content creators must follow a 10:1 rule, where for every post of self promotion (ie, relevant link to external content in a discussion post) there must be 10 posts that have nothing to do with themselves or their brand.\n \nIf you are a blogger or external content creator you are expected to participate as any other member of the community, there will be no special flair given.\n \n**Business Rules:** \n\nBusiness representatives who are hoping to post on behalf of their business (ie, clarify ingredient list, or use of product) must first identify themselves to the moderators and they will be given a special flair. Failure to do so will result in all unverified ‘official’ posts being removed.\n \nBasically, you have to prove you’re posting on behalf of Jolse before we let you post on behalf of Jolse.\n \n \n \n#Next Steps:\n\nWe are looking for new mods! Horray!\n \nUS Timezone preferably as I am in the EU and /u/smallrobots is in AUS.\n \nWe are looking for 3 mods:\n\n* 1 CSS Dedicated mod, has no other responsibilities. \n* 3 to help with the day to day moderation. \n\nThis involves clearing out the spam queue, moderating to the rules and responding to modmail.\n \nIf you are interested please send us a modmail with the title, “ABD Mod Application” with a little bit of information about yourself and why you think you would be a great mod!\n\n---\n\n#Thank you!\n\nThat's it for now, thank you guys for all your feedback, we are always listening and we are always working to make ABD the best space we possibly can. New rules take effect immediately, and the sidebar will be updated to reflect that from tomorrow.\n\nAs always, the comments are open for your comments!

    "body": "Ive been searching for a replacement for a good cleanser for my dry-dehydrated-sensitive skin. I thought I found my HG cleanser this year with the B Lab Matcha Cleanser which left my skin clean but soft. I fell in love just from trying a free sample from Stylevana. Unfortunately B Lab changed the formula and packaging for this cleanser. I bought the new version and hated it. It was dry and stripping like the Senka whip cleanser. \n\nSo I went through some suggestions from this sub and made a list. I was browsing a local shop today and saw the Round Lab Dokko cleanser for $11 for 150 ml and bought it. Beauty of Josean Green Plum cleanser was also on my to try list but it was $12 for 100 ml so I went with the Round Lab just cuz of the better price per ml.\n\nOverall rating: 4/5\n\nScent: mild soapy scent. Nothing offensive. Barely noticeable. \n\nI latered a dollop in my hands with water then washed my face and rinsed with water. It doesnt really foam up. It cleaned off my skincare, Etude eyebrow pencil, Lilybyred blush, Romand water tint, and Stila eyeliner well.\n\nMy skin didnt fee taut/tight. The cleanser didnt leave a weird filmy layer either. It was just my skin but clean. Its light but I wouldn’t call it hydrating — probably because of my dry skin. Best of all, no irritation. \n\n It didnt feel as soft as the og B Lab matcha cleanser though. I might explore other options after I use up this Round Lab one, but this is going to be my fallback cleanser from now on as long as the formula didnt change. \n\nIngredients: Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Coco-Betaine, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Potassium Benzoate, Sodium Chloride, Polyquaternium-67, Potassium Cocoate, Citric Acid, Fructooligosaccharides, Saccharide Hydrolysate, Disodium EDTA, Pullulan, 1,2-Hexanediol, Allantoin, Panthenol, Sea Water, Sodium Acetate, Butylene Glycol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Caprylic/​Capric Triglycerides, Beta-Glucan, Phosphatidylcholine, Hyaluronic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide NP, Glycine, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Glutamic Acid, Serine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lysine, Alanine, Arginine, Threonine, Proline",

    "body": "Hello everyone, I’m a long-time lurker and first-time poster on this sub.\n\nI’m 29(F) and my skin type is fucked up (dry cheeks, oily T-zone, with a recent bout of hormonal acne along cheekbones and jawline).\n\nI use Epiduo that has adapalene (0.1% w/w) + benzoyl Peroxide (2.5% w/w) and Glyco-12 cream (glycolic acid 12%) in my PM routine (alternatively, with a break day in between each treatment). In the AM, I finish up my skincare routine with Re'equil Ultra Matte Dry Touch Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA++++ and touch up with a sunscreen stick every two hours or so (I go over the same area 3-4 times with the stick for optimum protection).\n\nLike most people, I struggle with sunscreen reapplication because, honestly, it’s a pain in the ass. I’d rather put it on once in the morning and then forget about it for the rest of the day. However, as I’m currently battling hormonal acne and PIH brought on by PCOS and the fact that I stopped taking oral birth control pills, I’ve been subjecting my face to some pretty strong actives like adapalene and glycolic acid. And, I’ve also recently had some warts removed from around my eyes and on my neck via cauterization. Given these treatments and because I spend a lot of time outdoors, I knew I had to become more diligent with sunscreen reapplication to prevent sun-related hyperpigmentation. And since I’m lazy af and don’t like touching my face often, I turned to sunscreen sticks. Please note that I do not know much about the ingredients, but have listed them below for reference. Here is my review of the three sunscreen sticks I’ve tried so far:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e4v40q0j04t91.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57160c139b133d631630407c20ffca566e08110b\n\n**1.** **TOCOBO Cotton Soft Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Niacinamide, Tromethamine, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol, Polysilicone-15, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Extract, Sophora Flavescens Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum Root/Stalk Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Oenothera Biennis (evening primrose) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Seed Oil, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n\n**Where to buy and price:** Beauty Barn for INR 1240\n\n**Experience and opinion:** I really had high hopes for this one, I saw so many good reviews online. To be fair, its not a bad sunscreen stick. It glides on the skin easily enough, and sinks into your skin to give a matte powdery finish. But, it has a strong (imo) scent. It’s a linen-y kinda scent, which I just don’t like. This scent even lingers for quite some time after application, which makes it even more annoying. Honestly, I don’t care about fragrance in skincare as long as I like the fragrance, and I just don’t like the fragrance in this sunstick.  Another con is its shape, which makes it hard to use under the eyes. Overall, if you don’t mind the fragrance, it’s a decent sunstick.\n\n**Repurchase status:** WNRP, I can’t get over the smell.\n\n**2.** **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**Where to buy and price:** Beauty Barn for INR 1480\n\n**Experience and opinion:** My absolute favourite and current HG for reapplication! You can see from the picture that the writing on the packaging has faded because I’ve handled it so much. It has no fragrance, just a faint chemical scent which dissipates quickly after application. It takes a few seconds to warm up on your skin, after which it glides oh so smoothly. It has no white caste, and has a matte satin-y finish, which I LOVE. A little bit tacky to touch immediately after application, but sinks into your skin in a few minutes and becomes barely noticeable. Best part: its tear drop shape!! This makes such a difference, it makes it so easy to touch up under my eyes and around my nose.\n\n**Repurchase status:** WRP absolutely I love it so much!!\n\n**3.** **Avène SunsiStick KA SPF 50+**\n\n**Ingredients:** Octyldodecanol, Polyethylene, Butylene Glycol Cocoate, Hydrogenated Microcrystalline Wax, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Beeswax (Cera Alba), Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Water (Aqua), 1,2-Hexanediol, Aluminum Hydroxide, Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Caprylyl Glycol, Cichorium Intybus (Chicory) Root Extract, Disodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Oxothiazolidine, Saccharin, Sodium Benzoate, Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Tocopheryl Glucoside.\n\n**Where to buy and price:** Box of Color for INR 743.\n\n**Experience and opinion:** This was the first ever sunscreen stick I purchased and it made me almost give up on all sunsticks. It has a chemical-y waxy kind of fragrance but my biggest qualm with this sunstick is its texture and finish. It has a Vaseline-kinda balm-y texture that just sits on top of your skin and looks like you’re slugging during the day. Needless to say it gives an oily finish, not even dewy, which looks awful on my skin type. Its extremely transferrable and gets all over your hands if you happen to touch your face. I despise it and I’m not sure how I’ll use up the product.\n\n**Repurchase status:** WNRP never ever, god I hate it.",

    "body": "I have dry, eczema-prone skin, some light rosacea, and a couple of diagnosed skin allergies.  Here are reviews of the empties that have been in my bathroom recycling bin for the past few months:\n\nLa Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5 - At the start of winter my skin went crazy.  I picked this up in a moment of desperation.  I'm so glad I tried this stuff.  It was a great night time occlusive.  It also made a great daytime moisturizer/primer on makeup days.  WRP\n\nInkey List Snow Mushroom Moisturizer - The first time I tried this my skin was tight, dry and itchy by late afternoon.  It's probably fine, but it's not for me, it's probably better suited for oily skin types.  I used it up by adding an oil to it.  The lesson I learned here is that I need to stop being enticed by pretty sounding ingredients.  WNRP\n\nMay Coop Raw Moisturizer - I picked this up at TJ Marshall's just before I was diagnosed with a number of allergies (fragrance high among them) in 2018.  The amount of fragrance in this stuff is eye watering.  I used this up on my feet and lower body.  After being fragrance free for over a year, I can't believe that once upon a time I would have used this stuff on my face...  WNRP\n\nCeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream - I've been through numerous jars of this cream.  It's a good stand alone product for my dry skin, it doesn't require the addition of oils or anything else to make it work.  I wish it was a little less pricey, but it's totally worth it to me.  I pick it up when it's on sale.  WRP\n\nPaula's Choice Lip & Body Treatment Balm - It's a great lip balm.  But there are lots of great lip balms out there.  I probably wouldn't have purchased this on my own, it was a free gwp, and I'm glad I tried it.  It's nicely moisturizing and fragrance-free.  Once I go through the million other lip balms I have laying around I'll probably circle back to this one.  WRP\n\nBenton Cacao Moist and Mild Toner - I picked this up when I was having moisture barrier issues.  It really is nice and mild, not particularly moisturizing though.  I'd say it's on par, maybe a step below, the Etude House SoonJung Toner.  WNRP\n\nMissha Near Skin Phyto Azulen Cream - This was just ok.  My skin didn't feel particularly calmed by this moisturizer, but it wasn't irritated either.  The packaging was annoying, it's an old school aluminum tube.  I may have liked it more had I tried it during the summer.  WNRP\n\nCosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence - I will buy this stuff as long as it's being produced.  It really is soothing.  This makes a good mixing medium for cocktailing serums that are too irritating to be put directly on my skin (vitamin C's and some retinols) and other random (mostly TO) serums that I'm trying to use up before expiration.  WRP\n\nCSI Collagen Nourish Anti-Wrinkle Serum - The ingredients list looked promising: Chondrus crispus (seaweed) extract, purified water, hyaluronic acid, pseudoalteromonas ferment extract, hydrolyzed wheat protein, hydrolyzed soy protein, tripeptide-10 citrulline, tripeptide-1, phenoxyethanol and ethylhexylglycerin.  This was ok at first.  But something irritated me while I was using this.  I stopped using it (and nearly everything else) for about a month, when I went back to try it again, it had gone cloudy, so I didn't finish it.  There are other peptide serums that I know and love.  WNRP\n\nMissha Time Revolution Night Repair - I've been using this stuff for years, it's something I always come back to.  It's a good basic all around serum.  I use it both day and night.  Missha has a number of sales throughout the year.  WRP\n\nThe Ordinary Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate Solution 20% in Vitamin F - I gave TO's 23% Vitamin C a bunch of chances, but it totally messed me up.  This was a much friendlier alternative for my skin.  I didn't usually use it neat, since it was and oil I usually added it to a moisturizer or a moisturizing serum.  WRP\n\nThe Ordinary 100% Organic Virgin Chia Seed Oil - I have really dry skin, and this winter was especially bad.  I use a lot of different types of oils.  I went through this one very quickly, it was nice.  I'll probably pick it up again in the future after I finish everything else up.  WRP\n\nThe Ordinary \"B\" Oil - I wanted to like this.  But I had some irritation while I was using this.  I'm not sure if this was the culprit, but it does have rosemary.  I did finish it, mixed in with moisturizer.  But there are plenty of other oils that I like and that I'm 100% sure of.  WNRP\n\nLotioncrafter Neossance Squalane - I've tried The Ordinary, Acure, and a sample of Drunk Elephant.  I can't say I noticed a major difference between any of them.  This one is cheapest and works just as well as any of the others.  I'll stick to this one or The Ordinary.  WRP\n\nVMV Hypoallergenics Red Better Deeply Soothing Cleansing Cream - I picked this up when my skin was recovering from an allergic reaction.  It's just ok.  Nothing from this brand has been worth the high price tag in my opinion.  The CeraVe non-foaming cleanser works just as well.  And the Paula's Choice Moisture Boost One Step Cleanser is even better than the CeraVe.  WNRP",

But I’m gonna do it anyway…I think out of all the sunscreens I have tried/reviewed (this will be number 16) I haven’t had one recommended and pushed in my direction more than the Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun. And on paper…I 100% understand why.\n\nThis is the first K-Beauty sunscreen that I have used that doesn’t contain fragrance, essential oils, and has absolutely no white cast…all in one product. The first time I applied this sunscreen I thought “No way…absolute magic.”. The look and feel of this product really reminds me of the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence. But, I find the Purito to be lighter and a bit more creamy/milky (if that makes sense LOL). The Klairs Airy UV Essence is a bit more jelly-like and thicker…although honestly the difference is very minimal.\n\nAnother quality I love about this Purito Unscented Sun is the fairly concentrated blend of Centella Asiatica. 5 different forms of “Cica” are here including Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, and Asiatic Acid. I found this blend (along with the Niacinamide also found here) to help in reducing redness/irritation from a few blemishes and the introduction of Curology/Tretinoin into my routine. \n\nAnd finally, while the scent is very similar to that of the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence…its a bit more mild/approachable. If you remember, I compared it to super glue or artificial nail glue (but not as intense). My first week using the Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun had me feeling very impressed. It seemed to be doing all the things that I loved about the Klairs Sunscreen but with a lighter feel and at a more affordable (per OZ) cost. I was totally ready to do my happy dance…until I decided to go for a walk/jog without my sun hat LOL!\n\nI posted about it in a few places (so you might already know the story LOL)…but after 57 minutes outside with my forehead exposed (just the Purito Sunscreen on) and I had a fairly noticeable tan line where my head wrap stopped just along my hair line. Honestly, to say I was shocked and a bit disappointed by this was an understatement. I’ve been working so hard to keep my skin away from UV exposure to give the Tretinoin/Hydroquinone as good of a chance to reduce my hyperpigmentation as possible. It really felt like a step back to see this kind of result. \n\nOver the course of the next week (up until today)…my skin just seems to have darkened a bit. Between the combination of being near windows, getting the mail/walking the dog, and having my mask off as I drive to and from places…the Purito Centella Green Level Sunscreen just doesn’t seem to offer as much protection as other products have. I don’t think there has been another sunscreen I have used that I can say this about. Other products may have been greasy, smelly, or white-cast inducing…but they all did the basic function of screening the sun LOL!\n\nNow, this isn’t to say that this product doesn’t have the ability to work. Korea has some strict standards and testing in place so this product is by law…SPF 50+ PA++++ if it’s allowed to be sold as such. However, there are so many other factors that can play into the efficacy of sunscreen once it’s on.\n\nMy sweaty face while exercising, putting on and taking off my face covering, and just daily life will absolutely take a toll on the efficacy of my sunscreen...I get that. But this product from Purito seemed to degrade and become less effective faster (on my skin) than other products I have used including the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence and other “non-waterproof” products. The Klairs in particular came with me on early spring hikes a few times where I was sweating my fat butt OFF (LOL!)…without issue.\n\nOne last thing that kind of tipped me off to the Purito Centella Green Level’s tendency to not get along with my skin was the amount of stinging it caused to my eyes. I have had this happen with other chemical sunscreens…but I felt like it was particularly constant and hard to keep at bay this time around. Usually, by keeping a product a fair distance from my eye line or patting on some physical sunscreen to create a “wall” around my eyes will do the trick. But, this product seemed to find its way to my eyeballs every time LOL!\n\nSo, moral of the story. Is this a “bad” sunscreen…probably not. It’s been tested to provide SPF 50+ PA++++ and I’m sure that it does a fine job for most people. But, depending on your habits/lifestyle…it might not be the best fit (just like anything else). I’m not here to scare anyone into thinking that this product will 100% cause them to burn or tan or spontaneously combust (LOL)…I’m just saying that I’d rather pass on this product in favor of a sunscreen that more accurately fits MY needs. Your experience with this (and any other product) will vary. Right now, that would be the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence.\n\nI love, love, love that people are so passionate about their SPF. While it sometimes makes it hard to feel comfortable talking honestly about SPF, sun protection, skin damage, and even disease caused by sun exposure…I feel like keeping an open/honest discussion about it is important. Especially for those that might be learning about the importance of sun protection for the first time. \n\nRegardless of how intense my “tan line” was…the fact that it was there is a problem for me. Any amount of tanning, skin tone change, or burning is your skin’s response to damage…bottom line. Skin doesn’t do it for fun or know that you prefer that color in the summer time LOL! And you know…some of us will take that knowledge and continue to get our summer tan on. While I don’t love that…I understand it (I mean was the exact same way not too long ago). I just hope that people at least acknowledge the risks and really think about the long-term consequences before heading outside without sun protection. The worst option is to see posts like this or hear warnings and ignore them/pretend you’re the exception. You’re not…no matter your background of skin tone.\n\nAlright, thats it.

    "body": "I’ve been putting this post off for too long, but it’s 4am and I can’t sleep, so I may as well get ‘er done.\n\n**Background:** I’ve used two full sized bottles of SK-II’s FTE, and I’m about 1/4 of the way through Missha’s! I feel both have been given a fair chance to show their results. I have oily skin with rosacea, and have been using prescription retinoids for a couple months now.\n\n**SK-II Ingredients:** Galactomyces ferment filtrate, butylene glycol, pentylene glycol, water, sodium benzoate, methylparaben, sorbic acid.\n\n**SK-II Review:** It’s no surprise that I loved this stuff, seeing as I used up two bottles of it. The texture is lighter than water, and it sinks in in a matter of seconds. My skin legitimately felt healthier, bouncier, and more resilient after continued use. It doesn’t feel hydrating by itself, but after a while I felt as though I didn’t need as much additional hydration as I normally do. I would say my skin looked brighter, but only marginally. There are downsides though—because of the mild exfoliation, I experienced a slight purge the first week of use. I also don’t think it’s compatible with strong retinoids because of its exfoliative properties. After being on adapalene for weeks, I noticed a stinging sensation when I would apply it. Luckily I was towards the very end of the bottle and was able to use it up.\n\n**Missha Ingredients:** Bifida ferment lysate, diethoxyethyl succinate, niacinamide, 1,2 hexanediol, adenosine, water, lecithin, saccharomyces ferment filtrate, potassium sorbate, glycerin, hydrogenated lecithin, acetic acid, water, polyquaternium-51, ceramide NP, phenoxyethanol, dimethicone, yeast ferment extract, lactic acid, hordeum vulgare extract, cassia alata leaf extract, ethylhexylglycerin, sodium PCA, butylene glycol, dipropylene glycol.\n\n**Missha Review:** I switched to Missha because I couldn’t justify dropping another $200 on a FTE without at least trying a dupe, and I’m glad I did. If SK-II is lighter than water, Missha is about the same as water. It’s by no means thick or heavy, just not quite as light, and doesn’t sink in as immediately. Besides the texture, the first thing I noticed is that it felt very hydrating. I’m assuming there has to be some degree of exfoliation going on because of the small amount of lactic acid, but it didn’t sting my retinoid treated skin in the least. In fact, it felt very soothing. Even when I ramped up adapalene to tretinoin, there were no bad reactions. My skin doesn’t feel quite as healthy/resilient as it did with SK-II, but despite that it *looks* better. It’s smoother, my redness is noticeably reduced, and overall looks brighter.\n\n**Final comparison/wrap up:** If I’m considering price, Missha is the winner. It accomplishes some pretty impressive things for being less than a 1/4 of the price of SK-II. If price isn’t a consideration, I think it’s less clear cut. SK-II feels higher end on the skin, and I’ll forever miss that healthy skin feeling and subtle luminosity—but again, I don’t think it’s suitable to use with super strength actives like tretinoin, unless you’ve been on it for a long time and are 100% adjusted to it. IMO Missha is better if you’re after immediate hydration, want more soothing action, and prefer to use harsh actives.\n\nI tried to be as thorough as possible, but I did start this at 4am after not sleeping well… so if I need to clarify anything please let me know! As always I love questions, and hope I helped :)",

I’m out of the loop, but I really thought - wow, when did missha sponsor some esports team??!\n\nsecond, I can actually add something on topic. I used to really like the missha one and used it for a good while (easily 4 bottles). but a couple years back they changed the formula again and that made me breakout pretty fast (normal/dry skin). not sure if it was that yeast ferment, but it didn’t really agree with me. I’m still using the night ampoule from the same line. it has been changed twice aswell, but without negative effects for me. \n\nI feel like this duo of fte and ampoule is one of their staples, but by the time (which is a really long time usually) you need to repurchase, there might be a new edition. not sure if that is the case for skII aswell.",

    "body": "[Here](https://imgur.com/a/Mnijy) are some pictures of the goods! \n\nWhen you get a haul, even a mini one, there is always at least one thing that doesn't work out the way you thought it would. For my finicky skin, it's usually several things. So I was ***shocked*** when not only did everything from my recent AB haul work for me, but it all worked ***really*** well. So well that I wanted to share my excitement with all of you! I'm still mildly in disbelief right now, this never happens. \n\nCVS was having a BOGO 50% off sale so I decided to try a couple things that I’ve had my eye on. I thought these reviews might be helpful for those in this sub that aren’t very familiar with AB products. My routine is a mix of different types of brands (I do love my French pharmacy products) but I’ve had a lot more luck finding things that work for my skin type in the AB world. Some people get scared off at the idea of ordering things from overseas - either because of shipping cost or the length of shipping times. Since these are all products carried at CVS, they are a lot more accessible for those in the US. \n\n**Skin type:** Oily, dehydration-prone, sometimes sensitive (depends on its mood that day), with a very low tolerance for silicones. \n\n**Holika Holika Aloe Cleansing Foam -** I've had rough luck with foaming cleansers as they all seem to strip my skin (other than my HG LRP Toleraine but it's fun to switch it up sometimes). Not this guy! My skin loves anything aloe and this did not disappoint (aloe is the best humectant for oily skin imo). It has a very dense, thick foam that feels very nice on my skin. The scent is very fresh, it almost reminds me of fresh-cut watermelon and aloe mixed together. It leaves my skin very soft and not remotely stripped. No squeaky-clean feeling here! I'm not positive of the pH but it does contain potassium hydroxide (a pH adjuster) so I'm assuming it's in the normal range and not on the higher end. I think this is going to make a great AM cleanser since it's so gentle. \n\nIngredients: \nAloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Water, Lauryl Hydroxysultaine, Myristic Acid, Lauric Acid, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Chlorphenesin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Palmitic Acid, Capric Acid, Butylene Glycol, Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Potassium Sorbate.\n\n(*Ah-ha! I just saw the watermelon extract as I was adding this, so that explains the lovely scent.)\n\n**Peach Slices Citrus-Honey Aqua Glow Hydrating Moisture Gel -** Holy shit you guys, this is ***everything*** I've been looking for in a winter moisturizer. It's lightweight, a gel, has ceramides, is hydrating *and* moisturizing and doesn't make me oily. The search is over! Seriously, I've been trying to find the perfect moisturizer for about 8 months now. I thought I had the perfect one (Etude House Moistfull Collagen Water Jelly Cream) but turns out it was perfect *for summer*. Once winters cold, dry air came it just wasn't enough. I've desperately wanted to add ceramides to my routine with no luck (Rosette Ceramide Gel was a greasy disaster). The inclusion of ceramides is what originally caught my eye and also the lack of any -cones. My skin is sensitive to silicones and finding a heavier winter moisturizer without any has been virtually impossible. This does include a couple -anes so I was skeptical at first but they don’t seem to bother me as much as straight up dimethicone. Dimethicone + my skin = a greasy mess and lots of clogged pores (and fun little whiteheads all over). The first time I used it, I squeezed out too much but thought 'what the heck, I'll see what happens'. As I began to spread it around, I realized that it was *way* too much product and figured I was doomed for an oily face that night. Cut to a few minutes later, when I was shocked to find that it had ***all*** absorbed. It dries down quickly to a soft, almost-matte finish. It legit gives my skin a healthy glow without making it oily, something that I didn't think was possible. The first time I wore it to work, I was ***incredibly*** impressed by the fact that my skin was still matte at the end of the day. My work's super dry air usually drives my dehydrated skin nuts and by the end of the day, it's over-produced a ton of oil to compensate. But not with this!! It gives my skin the hydration it always needs with just enough moisture to seal it all in. I am absolutely over-the-moon in love with this product and I can't recommend it enough! \n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Polysorbate 60, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Honey Extract, Ceramide Np, Sorbitan Stearate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Isohexadecane, Tromethamine, Hydroxyacetophenone, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Polysorbate 80, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitan Oleate, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Oil, Disodium EDTA, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Butylene Glycol, Bixa Orellana Seed Oil, Tocopherol.\n\n**The Saem Iceland Hydrating Soothing Gel -** The name pretty much says it all and it lives up to those claims. It's very hydrating, soothing and feels very refreshing. The fascinating thing about this product is how it dries down. It leaves an almost undetectable finish. I've never had anything disappear into my skin before - and I say that in the best way possible. It doesn't leave a tacky film the way most gels do. I use the Skinfood aloe gel daily (which does leave a bit of stickiness) and out of curiosity, I applied this on top of it. The combo dried down to almost nothing! It took away the stickiness all together. I am highly impressed with this gel! It is definitely a staple in my routine now and (*gasp*) may just replace my beloved Skinfood aloe (at least in the AM).\n\nIngredients: Water, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate 20, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Perfume, Sodium Acrylates Crosspolymer-2, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Disodium EDTA, Silica, Betaine, Heptane, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Propylene Glycol, Butylene glycol, Cetraria Islandica Extract, Sorbitol, Citric acid, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Prunus Mume Fruit Extract, Lactic acid.\n\n**Elisha Coy Refreshing Ampoule Solution Sheet Mask -** Another product that lives up to its name. I was nervous because these are on the cheaper side and usually the quality reflects that. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised! The mask itself fit very well. It's on the thinner side and it reminds me a lot of my fav sheet masks, the Etude House 0.2mm Air Therapy. It stayed in place and despite the essence being very watery, it didn't drip everywhere. The mask really seemed to hold onto the essence. After I took it off, I patted in the remaining essence from the pouch and it all absorbed completely. I was able to continue my routine with no issues. My skin was left hydrated, soothed and happy. \n\nIngredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Magnolia Kobus Bark Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Betula Alba Juice, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Chrysanthellum Indicum Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Fragrance.\n\nI haven’t had the chance yet to try the rest of the sheet masks yet but I am very excited to do so!! If anyone has any questions, I’m happy to help! :)\n",

    "body": "I’ve been using these toners for the past month or so. I’ve been looking for a milky toner that works for my skin for a while now and Purito’s one was immediately of interest to me, but given how much I enjoy Isntree’s Yam Root Vegan Milk Cleanser, I thought I should try the toner from the same line as well. Other than meadowfoam seed oil and glycerin, they don’t have any ingredients in common, but they’re both hybrid oil-water toners and they’re both aimed at dry and/or sensitive skin. So, I thought it would be worthwhile comparing the two.\n\nMy skin type: Combination, sensitive skin which leans oilier (esp t-zone) in summer and dryer (esp cheeks) in winter. I’m also in the 40+ age range, so I guess I have mature skin (or heading towards mature). It’s currently Autumn/Fall here and it’s usually this time of year that my skin becomes extra sensitive so it was the right time to introduce this type of product into my routine.\n\nInitially, I used both toners and put Purito on one side of my face and Isntree on the other. By doing this, I noticed that Isntree is slightly oilier than Purito and while my skin was like a sponge when it came to absorbing the Purito toner, it took longer for the Isntree one to be absorbed. The finish is also quite different. On the Purito side, it felt very silky (I guess it’s well-named) while the Isntree side remained a little oily. I also noticed the Isntree side developing a bit of congestion, but I wasn’t prepared to write it off for that because that’s the side that I usually sleep on.\n\nNext, I used Purito on its own for two weeks. Totally satisfying! It’s soothing, lightweight and overall enjoyable to use. It smells pretty much exactly like oats which I don’t hate. I can definitely see this becoming a regular part of my routine.\n\nFinally, I’ve just completed a week of using Isntree on its own and yep congestion increased on both sides of my face and I didn’t like the finish much. In terms of smell, I didn’t really notice one, so that might work quite well for some folks. This might still be worthwhile for me to try again in the winter, but it’s definitely not working for me now.\n\n**Isntree Yam Root Vegan Milk Toner Ingredients:**\n\nYam Root Extract (80%), Butylene Glycol 1,2-hexanediol, Purified Water, Trehalose, Panthenol, Sunflower Seed Oil, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Sodium Surfactin, Ceramide NP, Cholesterol, Stearic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hibiscus Esculentus Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Root Extract, Undaria Pinnatifida Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Seed Extract, Avena Sativa (Oat) Meal Extract, Malt Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Disodium EDTA, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Sodium Polyacrylate, Citric Acid, Deoxyphytantriyl Palmitamide MEA, Glycine Max (Soybean) Seed Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract\n\n**Purito Oat-In Silky Toner Ingredients:**\n\nAvena Sativa (Oat) Seed Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Water, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Beta-Glucan\n\nIf I left anything out, or you want anything more specific on either product, please let me know.",

But now, i think it retails for around $20 usd each full price? But Olive young does have sales quite often. It's also 50ml.\n\nIngredients:\n\nPurified Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid (500 ppm), Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Trehalose, Betaine, Propanediol, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel) extract, Madecassoside, Madecassic Acid, Ceramide NP, Beta-Glucan, Malachite Extract, Cholesterol, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, PVM/MA Copolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Ethylhexylglycerin,Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract,Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, I don't know that much about ingredients.... sorry to those that are sensitive to EO's and fragrance etc. However, I do prefer products with no fragrance. And this product seems to be fragrance free.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReview:\n\nSo, i first heard about this product a while ago, when another redditor posted the hwahae ratings. I saw that this ranked so highly, it was like number 1 or 2? Something like that, I dont remember exactly, but it was defs in the top 5. I've never heard about this product from this sub before. I have seen a few korean youtubers use it before, but it really wasnt widely advertised or anything like that. But when I saw that oliveyoung had the 1+1 deal, I thought why not just try it out? Another thing, is that this serum contains panthenol, an my skin lovesss panthenol, and i find it to be alot more soothing and effective for my skin in comparison to centella products. (Maybe this is why i like this product so much? idk).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I am near the end of this product now, and can for say for sure that I absolutely love this so much. Not only is it moisturising, its also very effective in soothing my redness and acne. I think its hard for me to find a serum that does both so effectively at the same time. Another serum I really like for soothing is the Be Plain Cicaful Ampoule, but i find that not moisturising at all. It's nice that this serum is very effective in both moisturising and soothing. \n\nFurthermore, another effect i realised two weeks in, was that my skin felt so plump?? It's not a thing I usually care for/look out for/desire, but my skin was just so plump and bouncy and it wasnt like this in the past at all. I guess thats another plus of this product?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I love this serum so much, and especially at the price point and at 50ml, I think its quite a steal and I would definitely repurchase and recommend it to all skin types :-----)",

I cam across this serum while researching for serum to buy in Korea, as chatGPT was recommending iunik tea tree serum, cosrx ac blemish serum. I found Mediheal had more popular tea tree serum, and I found this. First I decided to have Torriden's dive in low molecular mask for hydrating, then notice they even have the serum. I have oil skin, thanks to your post, I decide to give it a chance for the serum. \n\n\nI guess if you use jt once daily, 50ml will last for 2-3 months? I may end up getting 4-5 serum, and plan not to use them simultaneously. So the supply will last for 1-2 years, which is good.",

    "body": "- Skin type - oily acne prone, sweaty face\n- Climatic conditions - hot & humid\n- Age - 22F\n- Usage timeline - one month \n- Routine in that duration - Himalaya neem purifying facewash > Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel > Nature's Tattva Rose water (twice a day)  \n- Ingredients list - Water, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Dimethicone/vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethanol, Polyacrylamide, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Dimethiconol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance,C12-14 Pareth-12, Sodium Hydroxide, Blue 1\n- Status - HG, WRP\n\n\n- Review & How I used it : \n\nSo this is the 15gm [mini version ](https://www.nykaa.com/neutrogena-hydro-boost-water-gel/p/875156?productId=875156&pps=1&skuId=875155) that I bought for Rs.370 \n\nMy face is very oily and sweaty. I used to use Neutrogena oil free moisturizer for combination skin before and it was quite decent but my face would feel sticky after a while and it's kinda uncomfortable. I tried Suganda white lotus moisturiser and it made my skin very sticky and oily within an hour. \nI tried Earth Rhythm phytogel and it was nice, decent like a light weight aloe Vera gel but not worth the price imo. So I was always on a hunt for a good gel type moisturiser that just didn't make me oily or feel tacky. \nI didn't want to spend 950 bucks to try this hydroboost moisturiser so I was always hesitant till one day I found a trial size available for 370 and decided to look past the fragrance and give it a go. \n\nThe first day I used it on dry skin after washing my face and it felt just okay and after a bit it started feeling tight and weird. I thought since it has Hyaluronic acid I should use it on damp skin. \n\nSo the next day I used it on damp skin and it felt way better but still it was just okay, nothing too crazy. Meh. \n\nThe third day I tried the moisture sandwich technique, something I've seen James Welsh do many times. \nSo I wash my face, wiped off the excess dripping water with my hand so that it's still damp, applied this moisturiser on my damp face and then sprayed rosewater on top of it. \nFelt quite crazy doing it the first time ngl but it was totally worth it. \nI didn't wash my face for the next 12 hours and I could not believe that my face was not oily at all. Maybe after 8-9 hours it was very slightly oily around my nose but it's nothing compared to how oily and greasy I would get within 2 hours after using other moisturiser. \nI observed the same results after doing this at night and waking up the next morning to a non greasy face. \nI also feel like with this moisturiser the way of application matters a lot and I only get this result when I apply in this way. \n\nThe small tub lasted me a month after using it twice a day everyday. It definitely lives up to all the claims made. \nMy skin feels healthy, supple and so balanced. I felt so happy when I randomly touched my face during the day and it was NOT tacky or greasy or matte even, just felt like normal healthy skin. \nIt does have fragrance but it does not bother me, I'm okay with it. \nIt did not break me out at all. \nI hate that I love this moisturiser so much and really want to save up to buy the big tub lol.",

I had completely clear skin and one day was baffled to witness small open pores allover. It took some time to realise it's because of this. Apply it at night always woke up with a redddish eye. My friends to found it's building up acne in them. We really thought of filing a case on this. We feel cheated, even the brand suggests that if ur doctor recommends it and u get side effects , remember it's because it's doing good on ur skin...this is the caption of the product..something like this. May I remind u all that this is johnson and johnson company who have absolutely no ethics nor science backedup . It's proven that their products do cause cancer. This company is hell bent in exploiting indian market because our laws are not stringent. Be very very cautious",

    "body": "I love Sidmool because they're often transparent about exactly how much of a given active ingredient they put in their products (and actually use functional amounts!) and most of their products are fragrance and EO free, and this new ampoule is no different.\n\nIt's called the [Macenna 115 Ampoule](http://www.sidmool.com/shop/shopdetail.html?branduid=77195&xcode=020&mcode=029&scode=&type=Y&sort=order&cur_code=020029&GfDT=aWV9), although I'm not sure what macenna (마센나) means. The price is 18,600 won, which is about $15.50 USD. (If you're buying it in the US, the price will likely be a bit higher due to shipping costs). In addition to what's listed in the title, the serum contains 67% centella asiatica extract.\n\nThey don't state exactly how much panthenol is in the serum, but based on its position in the ingredients list, there must be between 1-5% in there. (In Korea, ingredients must be listed in order of amount unless it's less than 1%.) The only thing that would make this better is if they included n-acetyl glucosamine to boost the niacinamide, but alas, we can't have everything.\n\nFull Ingredients: **Centella Asiatica Extract** (67%), Butylene Glycol, **Niacinamide** (50000ppm), Glycerin, Water, **Panthenol**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycereth-26, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, **Madecassoside** (10000ppm), **Asiaticoside** \\+ **Asiatic Acid** \\+ **Madecassic Acid** (10000ppm total), Citric Acid, **Sodium Hyaluronate**, **Polyglutamic Acid**, Methylpropanediol, **Hydrolyzed Algin**, **Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate**, **Allantoin**, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sorbitan Olivate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Arginine, Ethylhexylglycerin.",

This product was a complete impulse purchase after being frustrated with my skin for very long (acne + PIH).\n\nThe serum is a milky white colour in the dropper that is barely visible once you take some in your hand.\n\n[All Pictures Included Here](https://imgur.com/a/bZ9Rj3S)\n\nThe consistency of the serum is a little thicker than water. It feels very *slightly* sticky for a couple of seconds when you put it on your skin but absorbs easily (as is expected from a serum).\n\nIn terms of using it under makeup, I never experienced any pilling. The formulation is very light-weight and with this product, you definitely never feel like you are wearing too much on your face.\n\nThe product also **does not contain fragrance** and should not cause irritation to sensitive skin girlies. However, people with niacinamide sensitivity should probably steer clear of this one.\n\n*Overall, in terms of the feel of the product on my face, it's a 5/5.*\n\nHowever, what matters most is the results which is where this product did not perform as I expected.\n\nI have been using this product for exactly 2 months (or 8 weeks) now. The same time period that Suganda claims is needed for this product to show results.\n\nHas this product shown results? I cannot say no. But has it been satisfactory for me? Honestly... Also no.\n\nMaybe this is just a me thing because my acne and PIH are moderately extensive in terms of severity but this product just did not deliver as much as it had promised.\n\nWithin the first month, there was a definite visible difference in my skin. Some of the lighter pigmentation had faded away for sure and my skin looked so much clearer than usual that 2-3 people commented on the difference.\n\nThis gave me a huge boost of confidence in this product and I kept applying it diligently, looking forward to what other changes it'll bring.\n\nHowever, that's where the progress pretty much stopped. Once all of my light pigmentation was sorted, this product became quite useless. For over a month now, there has hardly been any difference in my skin.\n\nIn fact, this serum did not help with some of the deeper pigmentation caused by new acne as well! I got a couple of hormonal acne 2 weeks ago that left behind pretty ugly marks. Unfortunately, this serum has not yet shown any effect on those.\n\nIt was a huge let down, ngl. After one month of miracles, it felt like the product had become a total dud and was not taking me anywhere useful in my skincare journey.\n\nThat's why I gave it an overall rating of 3/5 with a meh review. The initial benefits are great and I have no complaints with how the formula feels on my skin but this is honestly not a product worth the investment when you consider the price point at which it sells.\n\n**✅ In Conclusion:**\n\nIf you are someone who wants to target mild PIH then this serum is the best thing for you! It'll get rid of those pretty quick and you'll see a visible difference within a month.\n\nHowever, for all my acne prone girlies who have seen the ugly side of PIH, this serum would probably not benefit you that much. You might feel encouraged by the initial progress when some of your lighter PIH clears up quickly but trust me, that's the end of the road for this product.\n\nP. S. Since I am not repurchasing this serum, I'm switching to niacinamide from another brand and thinking of adding azelaic acid to my PM routine. Any suggestions for these two? Thanks!",

        "body": "Ooh, new product to me, thanks for sharing! ☺️ Kinda pricey, but I may give it a shot... sulforaphane is an interesting antioxidant, I remember broccoli extract being popular in Korean skincare as a lightening ingredient, and it's the active component of that. Plus, always here for combination products with multiple lightening ingredients 🙌🏼\n\n... TBH, two months to fade old acne marks is kind of short 😅 Even with new marks, I've never had a product prevent dark marks from forming, or even treat new marks super fast. The most I've noticed is that the mark isn't AS dark as if I wasn't using products targeting PIH. Still takes time to fade. The brand does mention that you'll see more results with prolonged use in 6 months. \n\nThe only thing that really helped speed things up is using multiple angles - so, lightening products AND exfoliation. A single product alone never gave me dramatic results. And even doing all that, when I'm happy with having some minor acne and PIH at any time, some of my dark marks from really inflamed, deeper pimples have been around for like... five or six months, even 🤔 Like, really faded, but they're still there. Granted, I have slow healing skin, and I'm in my early thirties, but PIH just takes time.\n\nI really enjoyed your review, OP, especially the clear formatting and the images! You really covered every detail 🤌🏼 Just some thoughts I had about the uphill battle of acne and PIH.",

The “Glycerol” product page title is a typo, as there is no glycerol in there.\n\n-\n\nRetinol & Niacinamide toner http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_9b0a443774.html\n\n> Aqua, Niacinamide, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Betaine, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Citrate, Ethylhexylglycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Panthenol, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxyacetophenone, Parfum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Jasminum Officinale Extract, Poloxamer 235, Retinol, Sodium Ascorbate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Epigallocatechin Gallate, Rosmarinus Officinalis Leaf Oil, BHT, Lavandula Angustifolia Oil, BHA, Jasminum Officinale (Jasmine) Oil, Linalool, Coumarin. \n\nRetinol is quite low down but this has 5% Niacinamide, so it should be a good “lots of Niacinamide but not as hefty as 10% Niacinamide” product, replacing the Simple soothing toner which never specified the exact content but has been reformulated to have less active ingredient since I last tested it, so here are some new tests and ingredients: https://imgur.com/a/QJhFAxZ\n\n-\n\nRose & hyaluronic acid toner http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_65a8443777.html\n\n> Aqua, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sambucus Nigra Flower Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Glycerin, Polysorbate 20, Propylene Glycol, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Parfum, Allantoin, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Sodium PCA, Bisabolol, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice Powder, Sodium Hyaluronate, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Hydroxide, Citronellol, Geraniol. \n\n-\n\n-\n\nRose oil http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8dcc443757.html\n\n> Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil, Punica Granatum Seed Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Parfum, Tocopherol, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis Peel Extract, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Citronellol, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate.\n\nHappy to see there are no plastics or silicones in there. Like the Pixi one it’s mostly almond and jojoba oil, plus (with the help of google) pomegranate, rosehip, vit E, orange peel extract, “sweet scented geranium”(?), rose flower oil, various fragrances. Wasn’t sure if there was any point testing this, as oils are said to “not have pH” (what) but this does appear to have a pH of approx. 5 (~face pH) https://imgur.com/rkvQeer\n\nI didn’t buy the Pixi version as it’s still £17+ on offer (at that point no), ingredients can be found at https://www.boots.com/pixi-rose-oil-blend-10256339\n\n-\n\nThese were all released in store today, toners are still available online and Aldi seem to have made more of them this time around. Rose oil is sold out online, *might* have to be quick to get it in the store.",

    "body": "This is a pretty long review that I have been adding to and compiling for a long time, so please bear with me. Hair and climate details are:\n\n**Hair and scalp type:**\n\n3A/2C curls, very dry and course strands, low-porosity, silicone and protein sensitive, oily scalp. I am not sensitive to fragrance, and find the fragrance of these products very mild. However that might be different for other people.\n\n**Climatic conditions:**\n\nHot and Humid.\n\n**Age range:**\n\nTwenties.\n\n**Usage timeline:**\n\nThe Moisture Duo have been my favourite styling products for about two years now.\n\nThe Protein Duo was bought approximately a year ago and has been used intermittently for 6-8 months since then.\n\nThe Wash-Day products were also bought at around the same time, and I have regularly used the Cleansing Shampoo and the Conditioner every wash-day since.\n\n# ✨Wash-Day Bundle✨\n\n# 🔹Cleansing Shampoo\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua),Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Panthenol, Polyquaternium -7, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-73, Fragrance, Apple Cider Vinegar, Disodium EDTA, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Oil, Polyquaternium -10, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick gel that lathers into a thick foam.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit while massaging into hair, completely washes off on rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nIt is sulphate-free so it is only mildly cleansing. If you are not prone to a lot of build-up and don’t have dandruff, this is good enough. Does not strip off moisture from the hair strands and doesn’t dry out the scalp either. I use this as my regular shampoo and use a sulphate shampoo every once in a while to clarify any build-up since this shampoo isn’t enough for me.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nEven though this is a cleansing shampoo, the website clearly states that this is not a Clarifying Shampoo. They actively encourage using a sulphate shampoo if you are prone to build-up, which I thought was a refreshing change from the usual marketing of sulphate-free shampoos.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n## 🔹Everyday Moisturising Shampoo\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua) Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium -7, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Panthenol, Phospholipids (and) Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/Palmitate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-73, Cetrimonium Chloride, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Fragrance Polyquaternium -10, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Citrus Aurantium (Neroli) Oil\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Mild to no lather.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit while massaging into hair, completely washes off on rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nI did not like this shampoo at all. It didn’t clean my scalp well at all and the strands felt weirdly brittle after washing. It isn’t hydrating enough to use without following up with a conditioner. However, if I am going to be using a conditioner anyway, the additional step is pointless for me. It might work for someone who needs extremely mild cleansing, but it is not for me. I stopped using after 2-3 washes at most, and switched full-time to the cleansing shampoo alone. Though the fact that this shampoo has proteins might be contributing to my dislike of it.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n1/5. Will Not Repurchase.\n\n## 🔹Hydrating Deep Conditioner\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Quaternium-87, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Phospholipids, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Polyquaternium -7, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/​Palmitate, Polyquaternium-73, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Avena Sativa (Oats) Extract, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Tamanu Oil, Honey Extract, Goji Berries Oil, Taraktogenos Kurzii Seed Oil, Jojoba Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Oil, Disodium EDTA, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, Potassium Lauroyl Wheat Amino Acids, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Leptospermum Scoparium Branch/​Leaf Oil, Capryloyl Glycine, Cysteine\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Low to medium slip.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit even after rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis conditioner is protein-moisture balanced, and this is the max protein my hair will tolerate. It doesn’t have a lot of slip, so if you are someone who detangles with conditioner, this one might be difficult to detangle with. My hair is always dry, and it felt softer immediately on the first use with this. It does tend to make hair a little greasy afterwards. But after adding styling products, it works out for me so I don’t really mind the greasiness. I have also used it as a deep conditioner and kept it in my hair for 30 minutes and then washed off. It didn’t make much of a difference in comparison with leaving it in for 5 minutes like I usually do, so I didn’t bother to do that again.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nFMC says the conditioner can also be used as a leave-in conditioner, though I have never tried this myself, and do not plan to try either.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Protein Duo✨\n\n## 🔹Leave-in Cream\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Dicetyl Phosphate & Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Panthenol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-87, Polyquaternium -7, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/Palmitate, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acids, Sodium PCA, Hydrolysed Milk Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Cetrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Polyquaternium-68, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Ceramide, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Fragrance, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Tocopheryl Acetate, Potassium Lauroyl Wheat Amino Acids, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Leptospermum Scoparium Branch/Leaf Oil, Disodium EDTA, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, Taraktogenos Kurzii Seed Oil, Capryloyl Glycine\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Thins out a little on emulsifying.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHeavy fragrance that lasts for the whole day. This is the only FMC product whose fragrance is too much for me.\n\n**Review:**\n\nI purchased the Protein Duo when I was still experimenting and figuring out the needs of my hair. I very quickly realised that my hair is protein-sensitive and this cream does not work for me. Thankfully I had only bought the 50g travel pack. It is very protein-heavy, not very hydrating. If your hair is already healthy, this may work well. However for very dry hair, this will not provide enough moisture.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nI know now that the cream doesn’t work for me in regular usage. However I do keep the 50g tube around for the rare moisture-overload days to give my hair a little boost of protein. I only need a tiny amount for that purpose, so the tube is going to last me a very long time.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n1/5. Will Not Repurchase. Didn’t work for me, might work for someone else.\n\n## 🔹Defining Hair Gel\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Polyacrylate-2 Crosspolymer, Phospholipids (and) Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Polyquaternium -7, Polyquaternium-73, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Panthenol, Fragrance, Disodium EDTA\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nVery sticky, thick gel.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays for a few minutes, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis is a very strong-hold gel. It is a part of the Protein Duo, but it isn’t as protein-heavy as the leave-in cream. Even with my protein-sensitive hair, I was able to use it occasionally on days when I wanted some serious definition. If I used it 2-3 times consecutively, it caused protein-overload. Overall, a nice gel that gives pretty good definition and hold. I haven’t bought it again, though I might do so once my current hoard of gels is finished.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n3/5. May repurchase sometime.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Moisture Duo✨\n\n## 🔹Curl-Quenching Hair Butter\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract, Salvia Hispanica(Chia) Seed Extract, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-87, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Panthenol, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond Oil), Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Glycerin, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, PEG/​PPG-8/​3 Diisostearate, Astrocaryum Vulgare Kernel Oil, Tocopherol, Olea Europea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Euterpe Oleracea (Acai) Fruit Oil, Mauritia Flexuosa (Buriti) Fruit Oil, Fragrance, Polyquaternium-73\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick white cream. Emulsifies into a thinner non-sticky cream.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nMild fragrance that lingers around for a few hours, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis one is an extreme boost of hydration. It is a heavy product, and tends to make hair greasy if too much is used. Since my hair is very dry, this works really well to keep it considerably soft and frizz-free. It doesn’t help me a lot with definition though, I don’t feel my hair is more defined on the days I use this butter as opposed to some other leave-in cream (usually the green Arata styling cream). Since it is heavy, it might weigh down wavy or fine hair. But for tighter curl patterns and/or coarser drier hair, this is great.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nThe product label mentions that it can be used as a one and done styling product. But for better definition, I prefer always using the gelly with it.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased. \n\n## 🔹Curl-Quenching Flaxseed Gelly\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract, Sorbitol, Propanediol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Salvia Hispanica (Chia! Seed Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-73, Panthenol, Sodium Gluconate, Fragrance, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Vinegar\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThin to medium, non-sticky gel.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays for a few minutes, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis is protein-free and quite hydrating honestly. Has a lot of slip, so it is a nice experience to style. It doesn’t have a lot of hold. Curls last for a day or two maximum, and that is after all protective measures like a satin pillowcase, satin scrunchies, etc. If long-lasting curls are not a goal for you, and you don’t mind refreshing more frequently, I would highly recommend this. The Moisture Bundle would probably be my most highly recommended FMC products.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nThe product label mentions that it can be used as a one and done styling product. I do use it as my sole styler sometimes, and it works out fine.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Miscellaneous Notes About Fix My Curls✨\n\nFix My Curls website used to have the full ingredients list of their products on the product pages prominently displayed. However during their recent website update, they have replaced it with Key Ingredients. So, minus points for that from me.They do have a photo of the back label in the product images, which shows the ingredients, but I feel that is not good enough. I prefer having the ingredients easily accessible. \n\nThey always have some kind of sale, discount offers, freebie offers, etc on their website. A lot of Indian Curly Hair Influencers also have affiliate codes for FMC. If you are planning to buy anything, I’d recommend comparing prices from the official seller on Amazon and the website during sales. I would have included other platforms like Nykaa, Foxy, Purpple, etc, but they are pretty much always out of stock or very highly priced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ✨Frequently Asked Questions✨\n\n🔹How do I find my curl type/porosity?\n\nI used [this quiz](https://www.naturallycurly.com/quiz)!\n\n🔹How do I know whether my hair needs moisture or protein?\n\n[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/mzhv17/haircare_guide_to_proteinmoisture_balance/) might help.\n\n&#x200B;",

Thank you for the reviews.\n\nI've seen FMC go upto 35%off on kindlife & 30%off on their own website.\n\nEdit - I have fine 2a wavy hair, & medium porosity from what I can tell. I'm hair dumb tbh. I use FMC leave in cream, hair mousse & defining hair gel & quite like them as they don't weigh down my hair while making them soft enough. Provide moderate hold & don't make them look crunchy. \n\nI agree with your assessment that they don't provide much moisture. So sm1 with Frizzy or dry hair would need other more rich / moisturizing products.\n\nThe leave in cream & mousse are my more used products, I haven't quite figured out how to use the gel properly yet.",

Not heavy, not obtrusive, dissipates after application.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Experience and thoughts in detail\n\nBackground:\n\n1. I've been using tret (prescribed) twice a week since August, increased to daily in September, decreased to twice a week in mid - October when I started with Foxtale. *(I always either go on a maintenance dose or discontinue tret based on term's advice once the immediate problem is solved)*\n2. Started introducing Foxtale AHA BHA Serum once a week, mid October. I use it twice or thrice a week now.\n3. So I'm fairly confident that the below changes were due to Vit C, but it's definitely not ONLY because of Vit C.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Effects on Skin***\n\n🌸 Was gentle, didn't cause any barrier issues (historically other Vit C serums have broken me out.)\n\n⚡ Lightly stings when used on over-exfoliated skin, or on scratches, micro scratches etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***During Introductory period, when I used it once or twice a week***\n\n* Saw no visible changes\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***One month since I started using it daily***\n\n⬆️  ***Texture :*** Skin looked good.. Like I still had acne, PIH etc but skin looked healthy and my atropic scars were not eye-catching.\n\n⬆️  ***Glow***: Previously had a glow, but felt like this also slightly contributed to it.\n\n⬆️  ***Tan:*** Faded slightly. Faster then it would have when I used nothing except tret (because I tanned in July and there was barely any improvement from August till I started the Vit C). Like with sunscreen use, my tan didn't deepen, but with the combination of this and more stringent sunscreen application, my tan started lightening.\n\n⬆️  ***PIH:*** Faded ever so slightly. Like they're still there but not eye catching. Previously as soon as I look at that cheek, it was all I could see (looked started), but now I kind of have to search for it. **But pics don't really show any difference.**\n\n# ---\n\n# TW: Trypophobia trigger. I HAVE ATROPIC SCARS. Comparison pic is a close up of a part of my cheek that has icepick, rolling, box scars. That's why image is not embedded. PLEASE DON'T CLICK THE LINK BELOW IF YOU HAVE TRYPOPHOBIA.\n\nYou can see the comparison pic [here.](https://imgur.com/o38QQ6i.jpg)\n\nIf you cannot view the pic, don't worry. You're not missing much. I genuinely can't spot a difference in the pics. Probably because they are zoomed in and focused.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Skin-feel***\n\n* It looks glowy (non T-zone) and greasy (T-zone)  in different parts of my face or greasy depending on\n   * quantity\n   * PM routine\n* With 3 pumps, which is what I used since the serum started oxidising, I was pretty much always in greasy territory.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kxk07sbtsp2c1.jpg?width=1303&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d88eab20a1d85eca2775782521643704074810a\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* You might be able to reduce the greasy look if you use very little, but you need to find a balance between the greasiness and how much you need to use to finish it up before it oxidises to a unusable level.\n* Oily skin people might need to powder.\n* No issues with applying sunscreen on top of this, No unusual pilling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Tl;dr :***\n\n1. **No standout effects. Like there isn't an effect I can attribute to this and only this.**\n2. I feel like a **lot of what it does either is BTS or by boosting the effects of other products (like sunscreen)**\n3. I think this is a good beginner Vitamin C.\n4. I use Vitamin C for the anti-oxidant effect and for overall skin health. This met both my expectations.\n5. Depending on your skin type, it can look glowy or greasy.\n6. No issues with applying sunscreen on top of this.\n7. At its full price, it's a decent product, But at 50% off, it's a very good product. Worth paying 275 for. ETA: It finished on Dec 3rd. So 3 pumps lasted about 2 months. It'll cost around 1650 a year. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status: WRP** but not immediately. I want to try a few other Vitamin C products first.\n\n&#x200B;",

    "body": "Hiya,\n\nI hope you enjoy the below reviews. I'm just a regular consumer buying everything with my own money - i.e., nothing sponsored, etc. Note, I've bought all of them on sale for around AUD$15-20 because I like sales haha.\n\nProducts:\n\n1. PKY - essence toner;\n2. PKY - mist toner;\n3. Secret Key - fresh nature toner - milk brightening one;\n4. Benton - Aloe BHA Toner;\n5. Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner; and\n6. Purito - Centella Green Level Calming Toner & the unscented version (Purito Unscented Centella Toner)\n\nMy skin used to be severely dry but is now slightly dry on the cheek areas and slightly oily on the t-zone during summer and slightly dry on the whole face in the winter.\n\nAlso note that the below two PKY products have different 'actives'/hero ingredients notwithstanding them seemingly being quite similar! I've bolded the plant extracts under the ingredient headers below.\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Essence Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495), Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. *Note, this one is generally recommended for people with drier skin whereas the mist version is generally recommended for those with oilier skin* Friends with eczema have also used this with success. *.* I can use both year round without breaking out. I've had friends with oilier skin who've used this one and have broken out. YMMV.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** LOVE THIS. May repurchase this for the rest of my life. I've used this after breaking my moisture barrier, after chemical peels, after active masks, and also *after getting my face ablatively lasered (after the the initial few days of only using an ointment)*. It's REALLY benign in a godly way. If you want it to do anything other than hydrate or increase the penetration of your other actives, this isn't the product for you (note, it doesn't claim to do anything else apart from hydrate & calm really).\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a little bit thicker than water but not as thick as the Purito centella toners. Won't run off your hand/face like water will but will eventually run off.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** None at allll, even when I broke my moisture barrier.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? Yes**/I have rebought this 4 or so times so far.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Mist Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance. This is in a spray bottle and is better suited to oily skinned persons.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1060395517?cpid=1060395516&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1060395517%3Fcpid%3D1060395516%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=876677637398885328), and Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/pyunkang-mist-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. This one is more for people with slightly oilier skin too. It's a lighter formula than the essence one.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Decent hydration, I prefer to use this in the toner stage instead of after my skincare but I have enjoyed using it as a 'refreshing' spray during the day.\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a nice mist, doesn't run on the face. Feels like a spray of water?\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a spray bit on top. I've had no issues with it but one mate had a couple that didn't spray properly.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** Unsure. I've rebought it once but haven't gone to use this one as much as I have the PKY essence toner or the Purito Unscented Centella Toner. I also don't like mists a whole bunch as they can go onto your clothes (if you're out) or jewellery if you're wearing any. But, I did go through a phase of keeping it in my handbag and using it when out and about for a bit of hydration.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Coptis Japonica Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Secret Key - Fresh nature Toner (Milk Brightening)**\n\n**What is it:** Hydrating toner that's meant to brighten your skin.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$18, available at most Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1046235717?cpid=1046235720&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1Qdkb986HWmYC5sW0qasR1pWtsW7lghSexIGgi-jRjHsBnCFbuQ2bVPKRoCtMgQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1Qdkb986HWmYC5sW0qasR1pWtsW7lghSexIGgi-jRjHsBnCFbuQ2bVPKRoCtMgQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1046235717%3Fcpid%3D1046235720%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/secret-key-fresh-nature-toner-248ml), [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/collections/secret-key) etc\n\n**Who's it for:** Unsure - it's advertised on YesStyle for 'sensitive skin' and dry skin.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** Tried a couple of times mid 2020, tried again at the end of 2020.\n\n**My thoughts:** Not a fan. Couldn't use it long enough to notice anything.\n\n**Smell:** A very strong scent that I could barely use it. I think I used it around 5-10 times before binning it - I couldn't even put up with the scent of this to use it on other parts of my body.\n\n**Feel:** really watery.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Fortunately (given the high fragrance), no reactions to this. If you had any irritation though, I'd expect some sort of reaction.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? No**, given I threw mine out.\n\n**Ingredients:** Not a comprehensive list given there's a generic list on yesstyle then a list below it for the main ones in the milk one but here -\n\n700ppm) \\[**sic**\\], 1, 2-Hexandiol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata Extract, Nonoxynol-12, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Tremella Fuciformis Extract, Allantoin, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Cucumber Extract, Propylene Glycol, Tomato Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Rice Extract, Lanoline, Tea Tree Leaf Water (9, Sciadopitys Verticillata Root Extract, Pumpkin Extract, Papaya Fruit Extract, Oleth-10, Viola Tricolor Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Ethanol, Glyceryl Stearate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Chamomilia Recutita Flower Extract, Morus Alba Bark Extract, Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Lemon Extract, Oleth-5, Sodium Hyaluronate, Potato Extract, Pomegranate Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Sap Extract, Bean Extract, Aloe Vera Leaf Water (9, Broccoli Extract, Glycerin, Green Tea Extract, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Hollyhock Root Extract, Witch Hazel Extract (9, Phenoxyethanol, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Mineral Oil, Ulmus Campestris Extract, Carrot Extract, Polysorbate 80, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rose Damascena Flower Water (9, Korean Raspberry Extract, Milk Protein Extract (9, White Willow Bark Extract, Psidium Guajava Fruit Extract, Witch Hazel Extract, 4-Terpineol, Algae Extract\n\nand then it says the main ones in the milk version are -\n\ngalactomyces ferment filtrate, pomegranate extract, physalis alkenkengi extract, milk protein concentrate, raspberry extract, pasque flower extract, potato extract, carrot extract, pumpkin extract, rice extract, usnea extract, broccoli extract\n\nso who really knows what's in it...\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Benton Aloe BHA Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating toner which is meant to gently exfoliate with 0.5% salicylic acid.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$23. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/benton-aloe-bha-skin-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1053033537), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** people with sensitive and dry skin as it's quite rich.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** on and off since mid 2020, still using it randomly to just use it up.\n\n**My thoughts:** Per Google (may not be accurate), it has a pH of 5.5 which is too high for there to be any noticeable exfoliation with 0.5% BHA present. I've not noticed any calming effects. It is definitely hydrating but given it's advertised as a BHA toner I'm quite disappointed at the lack of BHA efficacy here. I would much rather use the purito centella toner to hydrate and calm my skin as the centella has other benefits such as helping to stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** Similar to the PKY essence toner. Not as thick as the purito centella toners.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a pump on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **No**, almost threw it out but am trying to use it up.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nAloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Water (80%), Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Beta-Glucan, Polyglutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea (Green Purslane) Extract, Psidium Guajava (Guava) Fruit Extract, Salicylic Acid (0.5%), Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract (200mg), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice (200mg), Arginine, Pentylene Glycol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Polysorbate 20, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**E**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804)**tude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 relief toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$25 for 180mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/etude-house-soon-jung-ph-5-5-relief-toner-180ml-180ml/info.html/pid.1058586258), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone. It adds light hydration with benign ingredients - akin to the PKY toners but very minimally more expensive. It'd be good if you have irritated and/or dry skin.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** I used it once/twice a day until I used it up. Bought it in December 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Pretty decent. I'd recommend this to the same group of people who'd use the PKY essence toner. Nothing ground breaking. I prefer the calming nature of the Purito Unscented Centella Toner or even the PKY essence toner if you want zero actives (if you consider centella an 'active').\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** A watery toner.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** No but for no fault of the product. I just prefer using the Purito Unscented Centella one as it's just as benign, a bit cheaper, and has the benefits of centella.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, Propanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Madecassoside, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Polyglycerin-3, Disodium EDTA\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**Centella Green Level Calming Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804) **& the** [**Centella Unscented Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380)\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating and calming toner - may also stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$30 but I've always bought it on sale for approx. AUD$20-25 for 200mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380), [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml)\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone however this is best suited to those with any sort of irritation, acne, or redness. That is, if you have basically perfect skin you're probably not going to notice much of a difference but if you have irritation etc then you'll likely fall in love. Also good if you're wanting to help stimulate collagen production especially for the low price point - target ages for this is probably mid twenties and up.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** religiously since April 2020, sometimes twice a day.\n\n**My thoughts:** *BLOODY EXCELLENT*. I'm on my second bottle of this. My first bottle was the first listed one (scented) and then they released the unscented one so I bought that! It's incredible. I love it. In my opinion, it's partially why my skin is able to tolerate me using actives so much. It's excellent to use before actives as it doesn't interact with anything and really good to use after an 'active' mask or a clay mask etc. I switched to the unscented one to just reduce the risk of irritation.\n\n*also studies, which I haven't read but have seen derms I trust on insta etc, say that* ***centella can help stimulate/produce collagen... a big yes from me given it's a calming ingredient that shouldn't purge you or break you out*** *(unless you're allergic/sensitive to it)!*\n\n**Smell:** The scented one smells herbaceous (akin to Asian herbal medicine - I don't mind it but others may). The unscented one doesn't really smell like anything / I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** thick/fat/heavy water. Not a watery toner. Enjoyable.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Neverrrrrr, this helps me reduce the side effects from using actives such as retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, etc.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **Yes** & I have. Will probably rebuy for life.\n\n**Ingredients:** 4 variants as they've got the scented and unscented versions, and then those with and without witch hazel\n\nnon-witch hazel unscented version -\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract (strengthens skin barrier), Butylene Glycol (humectants), Pentylene Glycol (skin-conditioning agents), Dipropylene Glycol (humectants), 1,2-Hexanediol (stabilizers), Trehalose (humectants), Sodium Hyaluronate (natural moisturizing factor/ humectants), Hamemelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiaticoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiatic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Madecassic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Panthenol (strengthens skin barrier), Carbomer (viscosity increasing agents), Allantoin (skin protectants), Arginine (skin-conditioning agents), Portulaca Oleracea Extract (skin-conditioning agents), Ethylhexylglycerin (skin-conditioning agents), Disodium EDTA (stabilizers)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope these reviews were useful & feel free to ask any questions / start any discussions :)",

    "body": "Green tea is one of my favourite skincare ingredients, but I wanted something that is not from Innisfree (no hate, just wanted to try something new). So I purchased Beauty of Joseon's Calming Serum from Althea Korea ([https://my.althea.kr/products/calming-serum-green-tea-panthenol](https://my.althea.kr/collections/beauty-of-joseon/products/calming-serum-green-tea-panthenol)) last year to give the serum a try and also because I've been seeing it being shared on Instagram a lot of times.\n\nI apply 2-3 drops every night and I love how it **instantly hydrates** the skin. I've been using a Glycolic Acid toner so my skin has been feeling a bit sensitive, and this serum really helps to **calm any redness/irritation**. It's **fast-absorbing** too so it doesn't feel too tacky on the skin, which I appreciate as someone with oily skin. Happy to say that I'm on to my 3rd bottle and it's currently my go-to calming serum. The price isn't too bad too. It's RM37 on Althea Korea for 30ml which could last me 3 months. \n\nIt would be so great if Beauty of Joseon would produce larger versions of this serum so it could last me longer lol.

    "body": "*Moisturisers seem to be the most boring and ignored category in a skincare regime but I have learnt over the years that they actually play the most important role. Sometimes actives are not what your skin is looking for and a good moisturiser can be the game-changer.*\n\n[Just a pic](https://preview.redd.it/p39fzjc4kx661.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=027cc219d95e8947525507a3beec33a9d459f961)\n\nBefore I review the products, these are my expectations from my moisturiser.\n\n1. ***Hydrate:*** Bring water/moisture to my skin\n2. ***Emolliate:*** Thanks to kindofstephen (google his blog or insta if you haven't) for providing a term to my feelings. Make my skin soft and supple by nourishing my stratum corneum with nourishing lipids without clogging my pores.\n3. ***Strengthen my barrier:*** To reduce TEWL by strengthening my barrier so that my skin stays hydrated and supple for longer. This also means I want the moisturiser to have slight occlusive properties.\n4. ***Repair:*** To help my damaged/sensitised skin by repairing my skin barrier.\n5. ***Extras/added benefits:*** Would like if the moisturiser additionally helps to deliver certain ingredients that help with targetted issues like ageing, hyperpigmentation etc. This is not a must though.\n\n\\---\n\n***1. Avene Skin Recover Cream -*** ₹*1500 (depends on discounts); Cost Per gm: ₹30/gm*\n\nThis is my go-to skin-emergency product. I do not use it on daily basis. The texture is cloudlike but not mousse-y. It is a lightweight cream. Nevertheless, it packs a punch. I have gone through 8+ tubes of this stuff. It is the only cream that does not aggravate any sensitised areas (burning/redness/dry patches/peeling patches) and absolutely calms my skin. This cream is true to its name. Repairs compromised flaking, sensitised skin in two days with twice/thrice a day usage. The ingredient list is very minimalistic. It is expensive and the sterile patented packaging kind of sucks because you will most definitely have face squirts if you are not careful. However, I can rely on this cream to fix my skin mistakes.\n\n* Hydrate: 4/5\n* Emmoliate: 4/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 4.5/5\n* Extras: 0/5\n* Status: HG, It is easily available in India but shit is expensive.\n\n***Perfect for: All skin types, Sensitive skin***\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene Aqua), Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Squalane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Serine, Carbomer, Tetrasodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, Water (Aqua)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***2. Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream -*** *$10/* ₹*1300 (with shipping/customs); Cost per gm* ₹6.5/gm\n\nI tried this product a month back and I am in love. This cream is perfectly balanced. It adequately hydrates and emolliates my skin. My skin feels supple and bouncy without being too greasy and the moisture lasts. I did not see noticeable calming benefits but as a moisturiser it is lovely. The tube is huge and a little goes a long way. This has a slight cooling effect when applied to the skin. Also uses a patented encapsulation delivery mechanism to delivery pseudo-ceramides (lab-made) which help to strengthen your skin barrier. In short, it is a simple no frill moisturiser that is easy to use - not too thick, not too thin, not too heavy, not too light, doesn't sensitize, not too silicone-y, doesn't pill, value for money.\n\n* Hydrate: 4/5\n* Emmoliate: 4/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 3.5/5\n* Extras: 0/5\n* Status: will repurchase.\n\n***Perfect for: All skin types***\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Stearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Palmitic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide Mea, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Magnolia Biondii Flower Extract, Cholesterol, Perilla Ocymoides Seed Extract, Lactobacillus/​Soybean Ferment Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohols, Glyceryl Caprylate, Dimethiconol, Mannitol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Alcohol, Acrylates/​Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polysorbate 20, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Propanediol*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***3. Eucerin Q10 Anti Wrinkle Face Cream -*** *$9*\n\nThis is my third tub of this cream. This cream is richer than any cream in the lot. It has a thick emollient texture without being too greasy. It absorbs easily in the skin. It also contains shea butter, SAP and Ubiquinone (Q10). This cream has helped me transition into tretinoin. Do not recommend it for day time use (especially in summers) but for night time/winters it is perfect. It keeps my face moisturised through the night and it has a soft blurring effect on fine lines/skin texture. It did not sensitize peeling skin but helped repair my barrier. I use this regularly at night and it helped to fix the acute dryness that comes with tretinoin. I use it around my eyes and it hasn't given me milia/ clogged my pores. My mom loves and swears by it. She finds it makes her wrinkles look softer.\n\n* Hydrate: 3.5/5\n* Emmoliate: 4.5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 4/5\n* Extras: 3/5\n* Status: HG but not readily available in India. Will stock up when relatives come post covid.\n\n***Perfect for:*** *Combo-dehydrated/Dry/ Mature skin*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Cocoate, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Stearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Octyldodecanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ubiquinone, Biotin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Zea Mays (Corn) Oil, Beta-Carotene, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Phenoxyethanol*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***4. Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume -*** ₹*1300 (with shipping/customs); Cost per gm* ₹6.5/gm\n\nThis cream is unique. As the name suggests it is a cream-balm hybrid but the texture is surprisingly lightweight. Highly emollient with occlusive properties. It absorbs quickly into the skin as the texture is not too heavy. Sadly, it leaves a greasy feeling/film on my skin. I can not use it the day time and worry that it will clog my pores if I use it on my face. I love it for the body especially my Sahara hands. It seriously brings life to my hands and I do not need to reapply often. I did notice a calming effect. Many of my friends from the community love to use it on their face. It is a little too heavy for my face. If your face is very dry, I think you may like this.\n\n* Hydrate: 3/5\n* Emmoliate: 5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 3.5/5\n* Extras: 0\n* Status: WNRP at least for my face.\n\n***Perfect for:***  *Extremely Dry Skin*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Aqua/​Water/​Eau, Glycerin, Paraffinum Liquidum /​ Mineral Oil /​ Huile Minerale, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Behenyl Alcohol, Sucrose Stearate, Canola /​ Canola Oil /​ Huile De Colza, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Pentylene Glycol, Beta-Sitosterol, Xylitol, Zinc Gluconate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Palmitamide Mea, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Rhamnose, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Phytosphingosine, Ceramide Np, Mannitol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide Ap, Cholesterol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Ceramide EOP*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***5. Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream -*** ₹2700 *(estimated); Cost per gm* ₹45/gm\n\nI was sort of disappointed with this product. It is not a bad product but it is not necessarily better. The soft blue colour deceives your mind to think the cream texture may be light. It is actually slightly thick with a silicone-y feel. It has a cooling effect on the skin when you first apply it which tricks the calming feeling. While it is hydrating when you first apply it but compared to others I feel the moisture does not last as long. Also, it makes the sensitised area skin sort of burn. The feeling is not intense but very much against claims. I did not notice any calming/repairing benefits. It may also not be enough moisturisation for the winters. The colour is aesthetically pleasing and silicone-y texture + cooling feel can outwit you into enjoying application but I do not see many real benefits.\n\n* Hydrate: 3/5\n* Emmoliate: 2.5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 3/5\n* Repair: 3/5\n* Extras: 1?\n* Status: WNRP, Expensive.\n\n***Perfect for:***  *Oily/ Combo Dehydrated Skin?*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Centella Asiatica Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Glyceryl Stearate, Stearic Acid, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Polysorbate 60, Bees Wax, Chlorphenesin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Morus Alba Root Extract, Tromethamine, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Guaiazulene, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Lecithin, Acetyl Glutamine, SH-Oligopeptide-1, SH-Oligopeptide-2, SH-Polypeptide-1, SH-Polypeptide-9, SH-Polypeptide-11, Bacillus/​Soybean/​Folic Acid Ferment Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol*\n\n&#x200B;",

It is still manageable and I would wear this if I plan on just staying home. It is probably great on fairer skin. It reapplies fine on top of make up, but again, leaves a slight whitecast on me. The consistency of the product itself is a bit thicker than my favorite sunscreen. To me, it goes on just a tiny bit heavier than my favorite sunscreen, but eventually dries down light. The best thing about this sunscreen is the SPF50+/PA++++, which ultimately is what we want from a sunscreen. I guess I’m just picky and I do believe the best sunscreen is one you’ll wear everyday.\n\nOverall, I would give this sunscreen a 7 out of 10 for the consistency and whitecast. I WNRP mainly because I have other much more cosmetically elegant options for a fraction of the price.",
