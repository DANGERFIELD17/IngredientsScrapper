I asked what the active exfoliating ingredient was, and she said \"sodium hyaluronate\".  I then pointed out that was a humectant, not an exfoliant, and she ran away.\n\nAnyway, the product website says \"Dispense 2 pumps onto fingertips and massage onto face for up to 20 seconds until exfoliating ‚Äòresidues‚Äô appear noticeably and are peeled off.\" But looking at the active ingredients, there are no chemical or physical exfoliants in here.  In fact, it looks to me like the \"residue\" is just the carbomer or thickeners starting to clump after the large amounts of alcohol have evaporated.\n\nWhat do you think?  Have I missed something?\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Alcohol Denat., Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Carbomer, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Palmitamidopropyltrimonium Chloride, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Quaternium-80, Parfum, Behentrimonium Chloride, Linalool, Citronellol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Isopropyl Alcohol, Crithmum Maritimum Extract, Eryngium Maritimum Extract, Leontopodium Alpinum Callus Culture Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Citric Acid, Xanthan Gum.",

    "body": "**Background**\n\nI live in an area with very hard water (Minneapolis), and it‚Äôs definitely been tough on my hair. I had done the Malibu C hard water treatment packets in the past, and found them helpful. My tap water pH is 9 (!!!!! yes, nine!) and contains an average of 3.5 ‚Äì 4.0ppm of chlorine (not sure how that stacks up).\n\n I have caucasian 2a wavy-ish hair that is very fine and splits easily and is very prone to frizz if I don‚Äôt use the right products. It's virgin but damages easily. I almost never blow dry it, and flat iron it occasionally - 1x a week at most. Despite being fine textured, it can take wayyy more product than you would expect. \n\n^(Extra: I was previously using the Cantu shampoo and conditioner, doing a CGM-ish routine, but have decided to switch it up my hair care this year. I think the shampoo caused buildup over time, despite me not using silicones, because I did a single wash with Malibu clarifying shampoo and swimmers treatment and holy hell did it make my hair so much lighter and bouncier! So I‚Äôve decided to stop the CGM and look for a better routine for my hair. (That means anything goes as far as ingredients.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Problem**\n\nI got the Malibu C Hard Water Wellness Shampoo & Conditioner, thinking it would be the answer to all my life‚Äôs problems. I desperately wanted them to work for me, but I'm starting to realize that they are a total bust. :(\n\n**I‚Äôve used them for 1.5 months and I wash my hair 1-2x a week. As soon as I started using them, my hair became *noticeably more frizzy*, and over time it seems to be getting worse, not better.** My hair hasn‚Äôt been this frizzy since I had a stint living in a very humid island climate. The conditioner also doesn‚Äôt feel particularly conditioning to me.\n\nAt this point I‚Äôm kind of at a loss on what to do, since I don‚Äôt have a go-to shampoo/conditioner to go back to. I‚Äôm trying to figure out what the problem is so that I know what direction to go in with my next product. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Theories**\n\nI also tried HealthySexyHair Moisturizing Conditioner for one use, and that didn‚Äôt help the frizz. It was about the same. I see they both have glycerin prominently on the list. Could that be it? Another hypothesis I have is the shampoo may be too harsh on my hair, even though it‚Äôs supposed to be ‚Äúprotective‚Äù according to the manufacturer, and the conditioner isn‚Äôt ~~moisturizing~~ conditioning enough to combat the harshness. The pH of the Malibu C shampoo is supposedly 6.0-6.8, but I got that info from an Amazon review and can‚Äôt verify (it cited the manufacturer‚Äôs website but I can‚Äôt find it). (Not sure that shampoo pH matters relative to my tap water anyway...). Malibu C claims their shampoo is not harsh, very gentle, and can be used daily. According to the site, the purpose of the shampoo is to prevent minerals from attaching to your hair, as opposed to removing them. So I honestly can‚Äôt tell if the shampoo is harsh, or the conditioner just sucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** I‚Äôm trying to figure out what it is about these products that made my hair suddenly frizzy, so I can figure out what to avoid and/or look for in a replacement. Thank you üôèüèªüñ§\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Malibu C Hard Water Shampoo:** Water/Aqua/Eau, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamide DIPA, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, PEG-16 Macadamia Glycerides, Polyquaternium 10, Linum Usitatissimum Seed Extract, Sodium Gluconate, Glucose, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Fragrance/Parfum, Limonene, Benzyl Benzoate, Linalool.\n\n**Malibu C Hard Water Conditioner:** Water/Aqua/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearalkonium Chloride, Dimethicone, Behentrimonium Chloride, Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Tocotrienols, Tocopherol, Panthenol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Tocopheryl Acetate, Polyquaternium-4, Linum Usitatissimum Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Fragrance/Parfum, Citric Acid, Cyclohexasiloxane, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Limonene, Benzyl Benzoate, Linalool.\n\n**HealthySexyHair Conditioner:** Water (Aqua, Eau), Behentrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Isopropyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Polyquaternium-37, Lactic Acid, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/ Dicaprate, Polyglyceryl-3 Caprate, Silicone Quaternium-22, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Hydroxy-ethylcellulose, Sodium PCA, Propylene Glycol, Quaternium-80, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone,Panthenol, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, C11-15 Pareth-7, Disodium EDTA, Dipropylene Glycol, C12-16 Pareth-9, Trideceth-12, Magnesium Nitrate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Palmitamidopro- pyltrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Magnesium Chloride, Trisodium HEDTA, Acacia Dealbata Flower Extract, Citric Acid, Moonstone Extract (lol), Fragrance (Parfum), Methylchloroisothiazolinone,Methylisothiazolinone, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Glyoxal, Sodium Nitrate, Limonene.",

A few weeks ago I used [Overtone Espresso](https://www.reddit.com/r/henna/comments/1gg42bd/before_and_after_espresso_overtone_conditioning/) and this week I used Aura Bold Sonoma red. I've been using these over henna for over two years and they don't seem to affect dye uptake when I eventually henna the roots, but I do clarify with a sulfate shampoo and do hard water treatment before doing henna. The Aura masque certainly added some color and does help the roots blend even if it doesn't fully cover grey.

        "body": "AHA's can potentially alter how the hydrogen bonds respond to water, essentially making the hair more water resistant.  This is a phenomenon that has been documented when using [at least 5% of a carboxylic acid](https://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/testing/efficacy/article/21837243/your-hair-on-acid-the-influence-of-carboxylic-acids) (AHA's are in this category of acids), however given the list of ingredients you shared, the first AHA ingredient is malic acid at #11 of 29 ingredients.  It's highly unlikely that the amount of malic acid is 5% or higher in that formula.  What I see above it on that list are almost all cationic ingredients, which are really helpful for conditioning damaged hair, but they're nothing new or unique and wouldn't change it from the inside.\n\nAs for the Omega 9, I have never heard of this being marketed as a bonding ingredient.  [Their website says](https://www.wella.com/professional/en-EN/ultimate-repair/behind-the-science/omega-9):\n\n>With time and all the different stressors, hair loses its natural surface lipids. These lipids help protect the integrity of the cuticle. Omega-9 is a bio-identical lipid, targeting the hair surface. It does not only coat the surface but also penetrates the cuticle and on its way fills the spaces to re-create a protective barrier. This reduces cuticle lifting and is noticeable in a smoother feel, less frizz and less breakage.\n\nIt's true that hair loses its natural surface lipids, this is the F-layer or lipid layer of the cuticle, composed of 18-MEA fatty acid.  Oils can't really stick to hair to condition it unless this layer is in decent shape, because oils attract oils.  However I don't know enough about the molecular structure of oils to confirm whether Omega-9 is bioidentical to 18-MEA.  So far as I know, there's no way to replenish the 18-MEA/repair the lipid layer once it's damaged. [https://new.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/qljifi/comment/hj3jvun/](https://new.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/qljifi/comment/hj3jvun/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nThe animations they're providing are just dumb and completely uninformative, which also makes me skeptical of these claims that accompany it, although that could just be because they have a crappy website team, who knows.  I would love to hear from any chemists who have deeper knowledge than I do, but I think it's unlikely that this product does much beyond what a normal conditioner for damaged hair can do.",

I read an article recently about the benefits of using \"sulfate-free\" products on your hair and I'm here to preach! My hair has felt not only softer, but healthier over the weeks using this product. \n \n**The Basics**\nEverCurl is Sulfate-Free Curl Care system. Key word ladies, \"SULFATE-FREE!!\"\n\nThe Ingredients (as listed on product): \nAQUA / WATER / EAU ‚Ä¢ CETEARYL ALCOHOL ‚Ä¢ GLYCERIN ‚Ä¢ BEHENTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE ‚Ä¢ CETYL ESTERS ‚Ä¢ ISOPROPYL MYRISTATE ‚Ä¢ QUATERNIUM-80 ‚Ä¢ POLYSORBATE 20 ‚Ä¢ PARFUM / FRAGRANCE ‚Ä¢ PHENOXYETHANOL ‚Ä¢ ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL ‚Ä¢ BENZYL BENZOATE ‚Ä¢ BENZYL ALCOHOL ‚Ä¢ POLYQUATERNIUM-37 ‚Ä¢ PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM / MINERAL OIL / HUILE MINERALE ‚Ä¢ COCOS NUCIFERA OIL / COCONUT OIL ‚Ä¢ VITIS VINIFERA SEED OIL / GRAPE SEED OIL ‚Ä¢ CHLORHEXIDINE DIHYDROCHLORIDE ‚Ä¢ LINALOOL ‚Ä¢ HEXYL CINNAMAL ‚Ä¢ BUTYLPHENYL METHYLPROPIONAL ‚Ä¢ PPG-1 TRIDECETH-6 ‚Ä¢ COUMARIN ‚Ä¢ AMINOMETHYL PROPANOL ‚Ä¢ HIBISCUS ESCULENTUS / HIBISCUS ESCULENTUS SEED EXTRACT ‚Ä¢ CITRUS AURANTIUM DULCIS OIL / ORANGE PEEL OIL\n\n**Price**\nFound this miracle formula for a steal - only $6.99!\n\n\n**Where to Buy**\nI found this gem at a local grocery store. I bet you can pick it up at most CVSs or Walgreens as well. \n\n**How to Use**\nSimple. Apply like any other conditioner and leave in for 2 minutes. Then, Rinse. \n\n**Pros**\nTo put it simply, I have fallen in love with this product! It leaves my curls feeling well nourished and FRIZZ-FREE for most of the day. Since I don't put any gels or creams in my hair after showering(yup, I leave my curls naked), this product does the trick for keeping my hair looking fresh and healthy for the day. \n\n**Cons**\nUnlike the other conditioners I've tried, I noticed my hair is pretty tangled when getting out of the shower with this product. It leaves me dreading the combing routine after the shower a bit more. \n",

Generally things that contain silicone substances can buildup easily in hair, and will usually require a stronger surfectant to remove.\n\nThe amodimethicone would be water soluble if it had both trideceth-12 AND centrimonium chloride, but it seems to be missing the chloride part of the equation so I would say that is a likely culprit. \n\nAlso the divinyldimethicone/dimethicone copolymer is water insoluble, which needs a stronger surfectant to remove.",

Should i continue using the line or switch to an all natural like Hello Hair?\n\nI'll post ingredient list for Goldwell Kerasilk Reconstruct Shampoo:\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Coco-Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Glycol Distearate, PEG-18 Glyceryl Oleate/Cocoate, Lactic Acid, Polyquaternium-10, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Sodium Chloride, Quaternium-80, Propylene Glycol, Amodimethicone, Cocamide MEA, Silicone Quaternium-22, PGG-3 Myristyl Ether, Hydrolyzed Silk PG-Propyl Methylsilanediol, Sodium Acetate, Trideceth-12, Cetrimonium Chloride, Isopropyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Benzoic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance/Parfum, Limonene, Linalool, BCC12-Base 44477\n\nHello Hair Moisturising shampoo: \nWater (Aqua), Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Lauryl Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Polyquaternium-10, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil*, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil*, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil*, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil*, Pogostemon Cablin Oil*, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Triethanolamine, Benzyl Alcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid *Certified Organic Ingredient\n\nI naturally have curly frizzy hair that used to be very thick although in the last few years it has thinned out a lot in comparison and i now have fine frizzy hair. Although ive noticed these little hairs sticking up all over my head so i hope thats a sign of new regrowth. I also was told by the hair dresser i now have some silicone buildup in my hair that i need to clear up too. \n\nThanks in advance guys :) \n",

As far as I can tell, it only has evaporative silicones in it, which, according to the wiki, wouldn't work I think? Will these be sufficient as a heat protectant for blow drying? Or will they evaporate out too quickly?

    "body": "Hi! A little background - after years of fighting with my hair, about three months ago I learned about hair porosity and figured out that I have low porosity hair. Since then I've been making the switch to low porosity friendly and protein-free products, and my hair has been doing really well. I have very fine type 3a curls. \n\nI have a question about other people's experience with Its A 10 Miracle Leave-In. I started using it about 2 months ago when a friend gave it to me, and it felt like my hair really enjoyed it. It's just run out and I've been trying to figure out how to order it online to my country (EU) and debating whether its worth paying exorbitant delivery fees. However while I was doing my research, I realised that the product is actually not protein-free (I must have just blanked on it when switching out to low protein products). I'm now sitting here doubting whether I've been right about my hair not really liking protein and whether I should actually continue using it, or if I just *thought* it was doing a good job and its actually something different in my routine and my curls will gradually stop cooperating with me if I keep using it. I'm curious if anyone with low porosity hair has found it to be good for their routine, and also wondering if anyone can suggest an alternative to it? My only option to actually get my hands on it right now is to buy it off Amazon and pay the same amount for shipping as for the product itself. \n\nI'm just pasting the ingredients list here for reference: \n\nWater  (Aqua, Eau), Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane,  Behentrimonium Chloride, Panthenol, Silk Amino Acids, Aloe Barbadensis  Leaf Juice, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Helianthus Annuus  (Sunflower) Seed Extract, Quaternium-80, Butylene Glycol,  Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Fragrance  (Parfum), Citronellol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool",
