    "body": "Naisipan kong dumaan sa Watsons ngayong araw para bumili ng lotion, dahil paubos na yung ginagamit ko. Nakita ko tong lotion na 'to ng Luxe Organix na naka B1T1 for Php 405, kaya naisipan kong subukan. 2 variant yung binili ko, itong Retinol + Gluta, tsaka yung Niacinamide + Arbutin. \n\nTLDR:\n\nMay microfoaming, malakas ang fragrance, heavier skin feel kumpara sa ibang serum lotions sa Market, mali-mali ang IL, mislabeled dahil imbes na retinol, Retinyl Palmitate ang laman base sa IL. \n\nUnahin muna nating tingnan ang packaging. Sa unang tingin, di nalalayo material sa packaging ng mga serum lotion ng Vaseline. Tho, yung sa Vaseline, rounded yung tabas ng seal ng tube sa both sides, samantalang itong sa LO ay pointed. \n\nSa itsura naman mismo ng laman, off-white na medyo madilaw yung kulay ng lotion. Medyo clumpy din yung itsura pagkalabas nito sa tube, at madali ding mag-break yung emulsion upon skin contact. Malakas yung fragrance nya na dominated ng floral notes. Unang naisip ko nga nung naamoy ko e amoy poon, dahil sa sobrang floral. \n\nMedyo matagal ipahid sa balat, kumpara sa ibang serum lotion na nasubukan ko na. Naka-observe din ako ng microfoaming during application nitong lotion. Ang microfoaming ito yung nagkakaroon ng puti-puting streaks sa balat habang pinapahid ang isang product, kadalasan mga emulsion gaya ng lotion at creams. Ang microfoaming ay dulot ng pagkaka-trap ng air sa product habang ipinapahid sa balat. Kung ikukumpara ko ito sa ibang serum lotion na nagamit ko na (Vaseline Gluta-Hya Serum Burst Lotion, Smoochkins Nia-Arbutin Nano White Serum Lotion), ito yung pinaka heavy ang skin feel. Hindi ko masyadong na-feel yung pagka serum lotion. And lastly naka-experience din ako ng pamumula at pantal sa braso ko after ko gamitin itong lotion na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list. \n\nWater (Aqua), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Myristate, Fragrance, C15-19 Alkane, Stearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Triethanolamine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Glutathione, Polysorbate 20, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ceramide NP, Mannitol, Pentylene Glycol, CI19140, Phosphatidylcholine, Retinyl Palmitate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Polyglyceryl-10,  Citric Acid, Tocopherol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nHindi na talaga nawala ang mga errors sa IL ng mga local products. Di yata talaga uso ipa-check man lang sa regulatory personnel ang IL na ilalagay sa final layout ng packaging bago ang ipa-mass printing. Para sa product na ito, hindi Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol ang tamang INCI name, kung hindi Cetearyl Alcohol. Next, Polyglyceryl-10, what? Incomplete yung ingredient name. Ang daming Polyglyceryl-10 esters na nag eexist, wag nyo na kami paghulain. (Side Note: Ang Polyglyceryl-10 esters ay kadalasang ginagamit as non-ionic emulsifier sa cosmetics.). \n\nPangalawa kong napansin, CI19140. Ang CI19140 ay isang dye na kilala din bilang Tartrazine Yellow or FD&C Yellow #5. Ito yung nagbigay ng medyo madilaw na kulay sa lotion na ito. Konektado ito sa kasunod kong punto. \n\nIkatlo, bakit Retinyl Palmitate ang nakalista dito sa IL? Kaya nyo ba nilagyan ng Yellow #5 ang lotion na ito para magmukhang may retinol, kasi nakakapagdulot ng paninilaw sa mga product ang retinol kapag ihinalo ito? Ngayon, ano ba ang problema kung retinyl palmitate ang nakalagay, imbes na retinol? Ito kasi yun: maliban sa obvious na mislabelling sa product na ito, mas mababa ang potency ng retinyl palmitate kaysa sa retinol. Sa buong retinoid family, ang mga retinyl esters kagaya ng retinyl palmitate ang may pinakamababang potency, dahil kailangan pa nito ng isang extra conversion step (retinyl palmitate -> retinol). Tandaan, ang mga retinoids, kailangang ma-convert into retinoic acid para ma-activate ang retinoic acid receptors natin sa balat at makuha ang benefits. \n\nRetinyl esters -> Retinol -> Retinaldehyde -> Retinoic Acid\n\nKada conversion step, bumababa ang potency ng isang retinoid, kaya sa kaso ng retinyl palmitate, na isang retinyl ester, eto ang may pinakamababang potency. \n\nMay peptides din pala itong lotion na ito: Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9 at Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11.\n\nAng acetyl tetrapeptide-9 ay isang signaling peptide na nagbibigay ng message sa fibroblasts sa ating dermis na magproduce ng collagen (specifically Collagen Type 1) at proteoglycans, na mahalaga para mapanatili ang structure at mapanatiling tight (hindi sagging) ang balat natin.  Nakakatulong din itong mabawasan ang appearance ng fine lines sa mukha, dahil na rin sa stimulation ng collagen at proteoglycan production. \n\nKung ang dermis ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, ang epidermis naman ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-11. Kagaya ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, signaling peptide din ito na nagbibigay ng mensahe sa epidermis na mag-synthesize o magproduce ng Syndecan-1 at Collagen XVII. Kapag mataas ang dalawang ito sa balat, nag-iimprove ang elasticity ng balat. \n\nKaramihan ng mga nabanggit na benepisyo ng dalawang peptides na ito ay base pa lamang sa mga in-vitro studies na naisagawa na. Wala pang gaanong in-vivo clinical studies na lumabas kaya medyo skeptical pa din ako sa mga peptides na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo lastly sa product claims. \n\n* Retinol + Gluta\n\n* Whitening Serum Lotion\n\n* Lightening\n\n* Firming\n\n* Hydrating\n\n* 24 hr Supple Smooth\n\n* 3X Peptide Youth Repair + Hyaluronic Bright + Ceramide Glow\n\nUnang claim pa lang, sablay na. Wala namang retinol tong lotion na 'to. Pinaglololoko ako nitong LO e. \n\nSa claim na lightening at whitening, medyo duda ako. Mukhang glutathione lang ang pwedeng masabi ng brand na ito na skin lightening ingredient. Pero duda ako sa efficacy ng glutathione na makapagpa lighten ng skin topically. Maraming limitations yung mga published studies tungkol sa efficacy ng topically applied gluta, gaya ng mababang bilang ng participants sa studies at sobrang iksi na study period. \n\nSa claim na firming, mukhang inilagay ito gawa nung mga peptides. Sa hydrating claim, meron namang hydrating ingredients (glycerin, hyaluronic acid derivatives, olive oil, Plukenetia Volubilis oil, tsaka Ceramide NP). Same din dun sa mga sumunod na claims, dahil sa presence ng mga nabanggit na ingredients. \n\n\nFinal words:\n\nHindi ako masaya sa nabili kong lotion na 'to. Hindi kasing lightweight at fast absorbing nung iba kong nasubukan na serum lotions. Amoy poon yung fragrance. May microfoaming during application. Nagkapantal ako sa braso. Mali-mali ang IL. Pero yung pinaka disappointing sa lotion na 'to e yung claim na may retinol daw, pero retinyl palmitate lang ang nasa ingredient list. May paglalagay pa ng yellow dye para magmukhang may retinol. Napakalaking red flag para sa akin ang pagmi-mislabel ng product.\n\nAyun lang. Salamat sa pagbabasa. At laging maging mapanuri sa mga binibili at balak nating gamitin na products. \n\n",

        "body": "*TL;DR for anyone scrolling past*\n\n* LO Retinol + Gluta uses retinyl palmitate and not retinol, which is a low potency variant of retinol that requires extra conversion steps to get the same effects as retinol. Yellow dye appears to have been added to the lotion to give the appearance of fully evolved retinol being an ingredient as retinol usually makes creams look yellow.\n* The peptides used claim to target fine lines and elasticity, but only proven by in-vitro studies (i.e. in controlled lab environments) vs. in-vivo (i.e. on living organisms)\n\nThank you for this in-depth review, skincare\\_chemist19!

    "body": "I used to post on GOMI analyzing the ingredients of different Glossier formulations and would generally comment on their product releases, but I thought I'd move to reddit for this one since I think it's more helpful here.\n\nMe: I work in the beauty industry on the product development side and because of that I'm constantly testing new products from competitors either just to keep up with the industry or when clients bring them in as comparisons. Recently I came across a product that I thought omg, I need to post this on reddit bc there are a ton of people who would probably want to know this.\n\nThis post will cover the first [Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser](https://www.glossier.com/products/milky-jelly-cleanser) dupe which is a 99.999% match, is half the price (or usually less) - and the sole difference is that it has a different fragrance.\n\nIf you look up “Glossier Milky Jelly Dupes” the one that is always coming up is the Bliss Makeup Melt Cleanser. That one is annoying because is not a real dupe at all; it’s just vaguely texturally similar and has a similar bottle, but the formulation has nearly nothing in common with Milky Jelly in any way. Kind of pointless.\n\nPresenting the last word in Milky Jelly dupes, the [ELF Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser](https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9). It is \\*nearly identical in every way\\* to Milky Jelly and is usually on sale for $3. Srsly.\n\nIngredients comparison:\n\nE.L.F. Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser Ingredients: Water (Aqua), PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Dipropylene Glycol, Poloxamer 184, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Betaine, Isohexadecane, Xylitylglucoside, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Juice, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Panthenol (Vb5), Hydroxyacetophenone, Isopropyl Myristate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Anhydroxylitol, Polysorbate 80, Allantoin, Xylitol, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nGlossier Milky Jelly Ingredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Propanediol, Isohexadecane, Poloxamer 184, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Xylitylglucoside, Betaine, Allantoin, Glycerin, Panthenol, Symphytum Officinale Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Anhydroxylitol, Polysorbate 80, Xylitol, Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Isopropyl Myristate, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nThese formulations are nearly identical. They have the same cleansing agents in almost exactly the same order, and even the same textural ingredients. E.L.F. was definitely duplicating the formula exactly when they were formulating.\n\nAs I've said, I've tested the E.L.F. Bounce Back Jelly Cleanser and the Milky Jelly face wash and they are nearly identical. The texture is bang-on and the use experience is the same. There is just one real difference - the Glossier cleanser uses rosewater as the scent ingredient, and the Bounce Back uses a coconut fragrance. I’m sensitive to fragrances and it doesn’t bother me at all, it’s pretty light.\n\nThe best part? The E.L.F. Bounce Back Milky Jelly dupe is $6.00 for 100ml.\n\n$6.\n\nAnd when I ordered it for testing, it was actually $3 because E.L.F. always has sales.\n\nTo compare, Glossier Milky Jelly is $18.00 for 177ml + shipping.\n\nWhere to buy the Bounce Back: it’s is a little annoying, since they don’t have it in Target, or on Amazon it seems, but you can get it on the ELF website. Here’s the link:\n\n[https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9](https://www.elfcosmetics.com/bounce-back-jelly-cleanser/57147.html?cgid=skin-cleanser#start=9)\n\nAlso, disclaimer: I don't work for ELF, and never have, and think most of their products are very mediocre. But this one is clearly a copy of something already tested and popular (and I don't feel bad about sharing it because the Glossier Milky Jelly was a total rip-off/copy of the LaRoche Posay Physiological Gel, soooo)",

    "body": "Hi again, AB!! So I came across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/) talking about how most companies that claim to have ceramides actually use 2 ceramide \"soups\" basically, of the purpoted \"ideal\" ratio of ceramides/fatty acids, of which contain actually very, very little ceramides. Basically, it's for marketing and such a low % won't really do much. But the research for actually using an efficient amount of ceramides is apparently ***very*** good for barrier repair.\n\nSO I was severely disappoinT in my beloved CeraVe and other things. HOWEVER, I came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/celc5y/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu3j2mw/?context=3) conversation between the OP of that post and someone else:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Yes, the technology behind Atopalm is the same behind Zerafite, which Dr. Baumann believes in and sells through her practice. The research and invention originally came out of Korea, so I am not surprised Korean brands are using it.**  \n>  \n>\\-  [u/nocloudstoday](https://www.reddit.com/user/nocloudstoday/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhaaat???? Ceramides for skincare was **invented in Korea**?? Idk, should I be surprised ?\n\nAnd:\n\n>**Neopharm & Amorepacific have their own patented, lab-made ceramides that have been heavily researched.**  \n>  \n>\\- u/[royalsincognito](https://www.reddit.com/user/royalsincognito/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInteresting! I'm able to read some Korean so I looked into this on Korean sites + Korean reviews.\n\nSo it looks like [**Neopharm**](http://www.neopharm.co.kr/en/brand/brand_atopalm.do) owns these brands: **Atopalm, RealBarrier, Zeroid, Derma:B.** And [**Amore Pacific** owns many brands](https://www.apgroup.com/int/en/brands.html), but I have only seen \"ceramide\" products so far in these brands: **Illiyoon, Aestura & Mamonde.**\n\nI was like, why does this sound familiar? Then I realized that I've seen them ranked very high on Hwahae (Korean beauty review & ranking app) many times before!\n\nNeopharm's ceramide technology is called **\"MLE\"** and Amore Pacific's is **Ceramide PC-102 and PC-104.**\n\nPersonally, I like the look of ZEROID & AESTURA, because their products don't seem to contain fragrance. *(Fragrance can be a trigger for very, very sensitive skin types, but it seems the majority of people tolerate it pretty well in their skincare? However, I have seen derms say it can become problematic the longer you use it. YMMV. For what it's worth, I read many reviews from sensitive-skinned folks saying the fragranced ones never bothered their skin & they love it. Many posted pictures of putting the creams on their babies.)* But they're super hard to find online as of now!\n\nFrom all the reviews I'm reading, these brands and Illiyoon ato products are what is recommended by Korean dermatologists and skin care clinics. I read that some derms recommend these specifically for the ceramides. (In Korea, products for people with skin conditions like eczema and such are called \"ato\" products, assuming short for \"atopic\".)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(eBay links are from my trusted eBay sellers/ones I bought from before)\n\nAll of these have really good ratings due to being in the TOP 100 for their respective categories.

It doesn't bother her skin, and really helps calm her skin & works well under makeup. She also highly recommends the soothing gel for summer & concentrate cream.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream** (4.20/5 out of 3,162 Reviews)\n\n[Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/ILLIYOON-Ceramide-Ato-Concentrate-Cream-200ml/132526755796)\n\n[Apmall](http://global.amorepacificmall.com/en/shop/pr/illiyoon/P000006418/shop_product_view.do?i_sProductcd=P000006418)\n\n[Mini-review by Dr. Dray @ 13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1X4RmFTJQ8&t=877s)\n\nThis cream has little beads in it that break up when you apply, according to reviewers. Some wondered if it's the ceramide encapsulation technology. A few people were bothered by the \"scrubby bits\" when using it on their face. Cream is apparently slightly heavier than lotion, but still great absorbency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Derma:B Daily Moisture Body Lotion**](http://www.dermab.com/main/contents.asp?Mcate=188&Pcate=12) (4.27/5 out of 2,075 Reviews)  **fragranced**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the Body section, both [Illiyoon](http://www.apgroup.com/int/en/brands/illiyoon.html) and [B:Derma](http://www.dermab.com/main/) are in the Top 10.\n\nWhile Illiyoon's ceramide ato lotion & cream are regarded as **body moisturizers**, lots of people commented that they use it on their **face** also. So, good choice for those of us whose budgets may not allow the more pricier options.\n\nOilier/combo skin types did not like to use it on their face, while the dry & sensitive-skinned folks loved them. No mention of the lotion not working under makeup. I came across 1 review though saying that they experienced pilling when they used the cream under makeup.\n\nMany people emphasized that they like how light and non-greasy these feel, yet very moisturizing. Some oily types said it felt too heavy. Some said during the summer, they felt it doesn't absorb as well (keep in mind that Korea is EXTREMELY humid during the summer though. Like, you would be drenched in sweat as soon as you stepped out of the shower -\\_- and you'd just be all sweaty and nasty alllllllllllllllll summer it was dISCUSTING) but they still agreed with other reviewers saying it absorbed well during colder months (it gets really cold & snowy in Korea during winter).\n\nRave reviews up & down from dry skinned folks. Some drier skinned folks said it's not enough for winter, however. Illiyoon often goes on sale in Korea and people like that they get can it for like, half off. 1 or 2 reviews saying they had some sort of an allergic reaction. As always, YMMV.\n\nI hope this helps some of you!\n\nYou don't have to read the below info, but I thought it may be helpful for those of you with damaged skin barriers. My skin used to be severely damaged too so I feel your struggle. T-T\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**MORE ON FRAGRANCE** [**FROM LAB MUFFIN BEAUTY SCIENCE**](https://labmuffin.com/mythbusting-vitamin-c-serums-bad/)**:**\n\n>On the flip side to the little rant I had above: **if you aren’t sensitive to fragrance, there’s no compelling reason to avoid it**. There’s a lot in the dermatological literature on fragrance, but that’s because people who go to the trouble of seeing a dermatologist are those who have serious skin issues. It’s estimated that less than 5% of the population will have allergic reactions to fragrance on their skin. It’s great that there are more fragrance-free products available for people with sensitive skin, but for the rest of us, fragrance isn’t an issue (damage from [“invisible inflammation” from fragrance](http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/sensitive-skin/_/why-fragrance-free-products-are-best-for-everyone) isn’t supported by any convincing evidence).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BARRIER REPAIR SUPERSTAR? UREA:**\n\nI'm particularly impressed by Zeroid's new [5% urea cream](http://www.zeroid.com/main/contents.asp?step1=0&step2=0&Pcate=280&Mcate=284). It also has panthenol, centella, madecassoside, allantoin, bisabolol and physosterols.\n\nNow, there's SO much mumbo jumbo about efficient skincare, but so much of it is marketing bullshit and there are actually **very few** ingredients (compared to everything else out there) that are scientifically proven to REALLY WORK on our skin. As OP mentions in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu354ub/?context=3) thread, urea is a severely underrated ingredient:\n\n>The one thing that comes to mind, actually, is **urea**. **Of all of the ingredients researched for barrier repair, urea probably has the most consistent and longest track record for repairing the barrier.** You see it a lot in pharmacies in Europe. It's not sexy, but it's often very effective - for very impaired skin suffering from everything from eczema and psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. I'd recommend trying a 5% cream and seeing how that works for you. The bad news is that there are not a lot of options on the US market (which is not bad news if you happen to be somewhere else!).\n\nUrea is a natural moisturizing factor (NMF) that exist naturally on our skin, it's a mild exfoliator in high concentrations, and it's also a penetration enhancer, meaning that it's also used to deliver actives into the skin better. Now, there are a lot of other penetration enhancers, used both in medicine and the beauty industry, such as dimethyl isosorbide (DMI),  isopropyl myristate, propylene glycols/ethoxydiglycol, emu oil/MCTs (fractionated coconut oil or caprylic/capric triglyceride)/other oils, oleic acid (a component in many oils), etc.\n\nBut AFAIK, the reason a lot of them work is because they disrupt the skin barrier long enough to deliver the actives (except perhaps, some oils? Oleic acid has been shown to be disruptive tho. Apparently there are studies that show [emu oil](https://gardenofwisdom.com/products/emu-oil) is able to penetrate very deeply into the skin bc of the tiny-ness of the molecules or some shit. Which is why it's used with herbs/medicine a lot). I'm not a derm or a chemist, but from what I've been reading from the [chemistscorner.com](https://chemistscorner.com) forum, **this isn't always a good thing**. But I have not come across anything that says urea may be damaging. Quite the opposite.\n\n(Mineral oil is also another penetration enhancer, and a wonderful, stable moisturizer that will not go rancid like plant oils do **-** [**squalene on your skin oxidizing leads to acne**](https://simpleskincarescience.com/squalene-squalane-oil-review-acne/)**,** also [confirmed by Lab Muffin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKjKDj9plaI) \\- coming in close to petrolatum for reducing Trans Epidermal Water Loss. And petrolatum is pretty much irrefutably, scientifically proven to be the #1ingredient in reducing TEWL. Mineral oil feels quite heavy, but it's used a lot as it doesn't have too many other chemicals in it to cause skin reactions.)\n\nFor people with eczema who use colloidal oatmeal creams to soothe skin, make sure the active concentration is 1% or higher, not just claimed \"so and so lotion with natural oatmeal to reduce itching!\", because\n\n>[in order to be listed as an active ingredient, it must be included in a formula at a minimum 0.007 percent concentration, or 0.003 percent minimum concentration if combined with mineral oil.](https://www.mydadthechemist.com/reviews/best-oatmeal-eczema-lotions/)\n\n\\^I'm not 100% sure what this means, but I just know that this is probably bc mineral oil's ability to help things penetrate.\n\n**Don't confuse** urea with diazolidinyl urea and imidazolidinyl urea btw, which are preservatives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Some moisturizers with urea:**\n\n(I will list 10% ones here, but I personally don't go above 5% because of the exfoliating effects of urea for my face. It may be mild at 10% & below, but I still don't want to risk it as I use a lot of other actives and have problematic skin. But for those who WANT exfoliation and don't get along with AHAs, it may be another option.)\n\nI know Hadalabo Premium lotion is mentioned a lot, but 3% urea is not going to perform as well as concentrations above that (chemistscorner forums). I'm not entirely sure the difference between [Hydroxyethyl Urea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethyl-urea) and regular urea is, but some say it's the same thing just different name and some say it functions more as a humectant rather than being skin-identical.

The ingredients for the lotion are (or at least were last time I checked) identical to their UreaRepair PLUS 10% Urea Lotion. I asked Eucerin if they could confirm the percentage of the RRL, but they declined, saying they only disclose what they legally have to. **Udderly Smooth** also makes products with urea, including at 10% and 20%. At the moment I use the Eucerin Advanced Repair on my face daily, but use the Udderly Smooth Extra Care Cream (with 10%) in the cooler months. I use the Roughness Relief on my body (I have KP on my arms and legs, and urea's been *immensely* helpful for it), but found it *way* too greasy for my face.

It looks like it's just the light bouncing off the sheen of the sunscreen, but there's a cast there, too.](https://preview.redd.it/m9565scau5k21.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b43d498f3c72fffdba742642082a4762d1435f2)\n\n|NEW shaka fluid|OLD ultra-light fluid|\n|:-|:-|\n|Has a sheen, but less than ultra-light. Tends to be patchy at first on my face; rubs in to leave white patches. You think it's going to pill, but then you rub in the patches a little more and there's no pilling and the patches are gone. No white cast whatsoever :)|Has a significant sheen. Doesn't like to \"sink in\" on the face; remains spreadable and moves around. Doesn't rub in evenly; leaves white streaks on the face that are literally impossible to 100% blend out (also [these tiny white specks](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ff5f815faede7ce5649a190212000a4a/tumblr_pnuvm7CC2x1vnh3sio1_540.jpg)).

Sometimes the shine is unevenly distributed/there are patches that are less shiny, not sure what's up with that. Overall the shine is bearable; some days I don't powder it and it looks fine. Shine leans more dewy than oily. Despite the shine this is neither moisturizing nor drying.|Still has a white cast (though it fades very slightly) and looks shinier than the shaka. On the face it looks quite ridiculous and I always find the need to powder over it to hide the cast and shine. The shine is not \"dewy\", it's definitely oily. I would not say this is wearable for any skin tones darker than NC30 without a colored foundation/powder on top. Despite the shine this is neither moisturizing nor drying. |\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After 15 minutes, with flash. Neither sunscreen has much flashback.](https://preview.redd.it/6qtwlqauu5k21.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=239868fe76c2e83dd6fd28fdf6a1d9a2b370341c)\n\nIn terms of protection: I've worn the new formulation for normal office days (no reapplications) and skiing in moderate snowfall (also no reapplications). In both cases I was sufficiently protected; no burns or tans, no deepening of PIH (and I tan/get PIH very easily -- most US and Asian formulations aren't protective enough for me). For me this works just as well as the old formulation, if not better.\n\n\\--\n\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised by this reformulation. Not only is it more cosmetically elegant in terms of both shine and white cast, but it has a slightly higher PPD and doesn't contain octocrylene, which was one of the ingredients I didn't quite like in the old formula. \n\nI will continue to purchase this sunscreen and look forward to seeing how it holds up in higher (summer) UV indices.",

I'm sure you can get the ultra light cheaper in other places, so this is just a general price comparison.",

    "body": "**Review**\n\nSkin type: oily, hormonal acne, very fair - Fitzpatrick I. Freckles and burns easily. Cannot tan at all. Somewhat sensitised by actives (retinol, AHA and BHA)\n\nLocation: UK. UV 1-2 in winter, 5-7 in summer. Not extremely hot, but it rains often and is quite humid at times. \n\nWhat I look for in a sunscreen: wearability. I use spf every day, and I love to exercise outside. I sweat ALOT, so I sunscreens that dry down fully, and I usually opt for waterproof formulas if I’m spending any time outdoors. I usually wear a sun hat also.\n\nWNR: Would Not Repurchase  \nWPR: Would Probably Repurchase  \nWP: Would Repurchase  \nHG: Holy Grail, will repurchase until the end of time\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Boots Soltan Once Face Advanced 8hr Protect**  \nSPF 50+  \nUVA 5\\* (boots system)  \n£5 for 50ml in Boots (on offer, usually £10)\n\nI bought this before discovering AB, and it’s not too bad for a European beach sunscreen. It is a thick, shiny cream - not as sticky as some I’d used before, but probably the worst on this list. I’ve since found better though, and I’m using this up on my neck. \n\nValue: 7/10 (on offer) 3/10 (regular price)  \nFinish: 3/10   \nOil control: : 0/10  \nSweat resistance: 10/10  \n**WNR**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Garnier Ambre Solaire Anti Dark Spots & Anti Pollution Super UV**  \nSPF 50+  \nUVA 'broad spectrum'  \n£8 for 50ml in Boots  \nThis is the popular La Roche Posay dupe, and I bought 3 when I saw it in Boots for only £8! Unfortunately, my skin hates it. It’s a thin, sticky milk that burns my eyes, and has isopropyl myristate in the top 5 ingredients. I can’t handle anything myristate or palmitate without breaking out after a few days, so I don’t use this on my face. Anyone want an unopened bottle? \n\nValue: 5/10 (would be great value if I actually liked wearing it though!)  \nFinish: 5/10  \nOil control: : 0/10  \nSweat resistance: 10/10  \n**WNR**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Calypso Once a Day**   \nSPF 30  \nPA +++  \n£5 for 200ml in Aldi (2021, don’t think they stock it anymore)\n\nThis is a pretty basic gel formula. Alcohol denat is the first ingredient, followed by a bunch of filters and not a lot else. It’s a very cheap, light body sunscreen, and I did not burn at all last summer using it. But please, for the love of AB, don’t use this on your face!! I’m not generally sensitive to alcohol, but I flushed bright red when I tried this XD\n\nValue: 10/10  \nFinish: 6/10 (on body)  \nOil control: 1/10  \nSweat resistance: 7/10  \n**WR**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Neogen Daily-Light Airy Sunscreen**  \nSPF 50+  \nUVA ‘broad spectrum’  \n£3 for 2x5ml samples of Yesstyle\n\nHeavier than most ab sunscreens, it’s a cream and it uses US filters. Burns my eyes a bit. I wouldn’t buy this full size, but the tiny tube is handy to keep around. \n\nValue: 5/10  \nFinish: 5/10  \nOil control: : 1/10  \nSweat resistance: 4/10  \n**WNR**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Make P:rem UV Defense me Daily Sun Fluid**  \nSPF 50+  \nPA ++++  \n£15 for 150ml on Stylevana\n\nI couldn’t find many reviews for this, but I had high hopes as I’d heard it was similar to the Skin Aqua Moisture Milk, which I love. Unlike the Skin Aqua, this never dries down on my oily skin, and it doesn’t actually feel moisturising at all - just slightly greasy. It’s a milky fluid, similar in texture to the Garnier Anti Dark Spots, and will probably work on drier skin types, but I ended up washing this off after a hour. It doesn’t claim to be water or sweat resistant, but the ingredients look less comedogenic than the Garnier, so it probably won’t break me out. I may use it around my eyes, or try again in winter.\n\nValue: 7/10  \nFinish: 5/10  \nOil control: : 0/10  \nSweat resistance: 3/10  \n**WNR**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FrezyDerm Colour Velvet Second Skin**  \nSPF 50+  \nUVA 27 (according to this [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/rftq2n/misc_frezyderm_declares_the_uva_protection_of/))  \n£20 for 50ml on Amazon\n\nMy Mum (dry, Fitzpatrick III skin) swears by this. She first picked some up on holiday in Greece - apparently Frezyderm is a popular pharmacy brand there. It seems to be very effective and tenacious, designed for beach use. The texture is like a silicone primer - smooth and silky, blurring and with a subtle tint that completely melts into my Mum’s skin. It is a bit dark for me, but can look ok if I blend well. It dries down well, but I feel like I sweat more with it on, and it doesn’t help my oil production as much as I’d hoped. \n\nValue: 4/10  \nFinish: 7/10  \nOil control: : 5/10  \nSweat resistance: 10/10  \n**WNR**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Etude House SunPrise Natural Corrector**  \nSPF 50+  \nPA +++  \n£6 for 50ml on Stylevana\n\nI was looking for a tinted or tone-up product for lazy, low exposure days. I wouldn’t dream of applying 1/4 tsp of this as my only spf, but used as a BB cream it’s ok. Very sheer coverage, which is what I wanted. Dries down better than expected, but doesn’t stay matte without powder on top It also contains alot of comedogenic palmitate and myristate ingredients, but quite far down on the list. Hopefully this won’t break me out!\n\nValue: 6/10  \nFinish: 6/10  \nOil control: : 3/10  \nSweat resistance: 3/10  \n**WPR**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Biore Perfect Face Milk**  \nSPF 50+  \nPA ++++  \n£10 for 30ml(!!!) on Stylevana\n\nI really wanted to love this. It goes on silky yet mattifying, and it doesn’t seem to budge all day. It was also the only sunscreen I’ve ever tried that dried me out to the point of flaking skin :( plus it broke me out badly. Biore seems to have added isopropyl palmitate to all it’s sunscreens, I’m scared to use any of them as I’m only just starting to fade my PIE. \n\nValue: 3/10  \nFinish: 6/10  \nOil control: : 11/10  \nSweat resistance: 10/10  \n**WNR**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Kose Suncut UV Perfect Gel Super Waterproof**  \nSPF 50+  \nPA ++++  \n£8 for 100ml on Stylevana\n\nThis is a great basic sunscreen. It’s a light, clear-yellow gel. Cheap, with high protection. I mainly use this on my body now, but it was my main face sunscreen last year, and it didn’t irritate or break me out at all. Dries to a natural finish, although I can kind of feel a film on my skin. On long days outside it kept me from burning or freckling, even though I didn’t reapply properly. Only downside is it pills under makeup.\n\nValue: 10/10  \nFinish: 7/10  \nOil control: : 7/10  \nSweat resistance: 8/10  \n**WPR**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Kose Suncut UV Perfect Essence Super Waterproof**  \nSPF 50+  \nPA ++++  \n£11 for 110ml on Stylevana\n\nI bought this because the reviews say it pills less than the Perfect Gel, and I think that’s true. It’s a quite moisturising cream, and a lot thicker than the gel, but it dries down nicely to a natural finish. The film feels more flexible than the gel. I like this, but probably won’t use it up until Autumn when it’s cool but rainy.\n\nValue: 8/10  \nFinish: 8/10  \nOil control: : 5/10  \nSweat resistance: 8/10  \n**WPR**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Rohto Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Gel Gold**  \nSPF 50+  \nPA ++++  \n£11 for 110ml on Stylevana\n\nI bought this at the same time as the Suncut Essence, as a potential replacement for the Suncut Gel. Honestly, this performs more like the Essence - it’s a white cream consistency. I tried using both of different halves on my face, and couldn’t really say one was better than the other. I’ll probably buy whichever is cheaper when I run out.\n\nValue: 8/10  \nFinish: 8/10  \nOil control: : 6/10  \nSweat resistance: 7/10  \n**WPR**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Rohto Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Milk (not pictured)**  \nSPF 50+  \nPA ++++  \n£14 for 40ml on Amazon\n\nThis is much cheaper on Yesstyle/Stylevana, but I wanted Amazon Prime delivery, as I’d over exfoliated (eek) and this is supposed to be really gentle. It’s a thin, alcohol free milk, and it’s somehow both moisturising and a little bit mattifying once it dries down?! It’s water resistant, so it worked great in the rainy-but-cooler months, but I need something a bit more heavy duty for the summer heat. \n\nValue: 4/10  \nFinish: 8/10 (in the spring)  \nOil control: : 6/10  \nSweat resistance: 8/10  \n**WR, Possibly winter HG**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Nivea Sun Water Gel**  \nSPF 35+  \nPA +++  \n£9 for 80ml on Yesstyle\n\nI love how this feels. It’s like a watery toner, it really does dry down to nothing, and it’s easy to remove. I like that it doesn’t require double cleansing, I don’t need to be slathered in waterproof spf all year round. Last winter this was my HG for dog walks in low UV (1-2) but I really doubt it will offer any protection after getting caught in the rain! I’ll probably keep this as my indoor sunscreen, as it’s much cheaper than the Skin Aqua milk. Plus there are 140g pump dispensers on Stylevana for £10!\n\nValue: 10/10  \nFinish: 10/10  \nOil control: : 4/10  \nSweat resistance: 0/10\n\n**WR**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish**  \nSPF 50+  \nPA +++  \n£7 for 50ml on Yesstyle\n\nI have a complicated relationship with this sunscreen. On the one hand, I LOVE the finish on my oily skin. It is a thin milk that dries velvety matte, but doesn’t make me flake like the Biore Milk. It blurs my skin tone slightly, and doesn’t make me sweat. BUT I’m not certain I trust it. I really doubt it to be SPF 50+, and I can’t find any information about it’s water-resistance, so I currently use this as a daily primer/my indoor summer spf. I’ve never burned wearing this, but I do freckle slightly.\n\nValue: 10/10  \nFinish: 9/10  \nOil control: : 10/10  \nSweat resistance: ?/5  \n**WR**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Missha Water Proof Sun Milk**  \nSPF 50+  \nPA ++++  \n£13 for 70ml on Yesstyle\n\nThis is quite similar to the Etude Milk Airy, but is advertised as waterproof. It layers really well over the Mild Airy, so I reapply with this if I’ll be outside for a while. Beautiful texture and satin finish, I really enjoy wearing this, but I fear it will break me out if I use it regularly. It has isopropyl myristate halfway down the ingredients list, luckily I’ve only got CCs from using it once or twice a week. I’m also not completely sure of it’s SPF claims, as I’ve not seen any third party test results.\n\nValue: 7/10  \nFinish: 9/10  \nOil control: : 8/10  \nSweat resistance: 4/10\n\n**WPR**",

        "body": "Oh man... Biore Perfect Milk broke you out? My friend with really acne prone skin on the other hand been raving this sunscreen so much cz it's the only one that didn't gave her breakouts. Just goes to show how different everyone's skin are. \n\nI really2 enjoyed using this. It's actually less matte than my usual (Biore UV Perfect Protect Milk moisture) which has a more powdery matte finish. But both worked super well controlling sebum for the whole day in this hot and humid climate. \n\nI get that it dried the f* out of your skin. Cz it did to me too but in that my skin turned dehydrated (tight, irritated, rough. Not flaky). So instead of replacing my sunscreen, i just switched my moisturizer to Illiyoon Ceramide Cream and it worked super well keeping my skin not dried out/dehydrated after using the sunscreen.\n\nI've used Kose Suncute Perfect Gel but damn my skin looked extremely shiny, it's embarrassing. So i decided to only use milk/mattifying sunscreens ever since lol. \n\nThanks so much for your review on all of the sunscreens tho. I've been eyeing the etude house and missha sunscreen as it has been mentioned a lot for oily skin so I'll definitely try those out one day. My next purchase gonna be Anessa sun milk. It took me a very long time to try a new sunscreen cz I've been grabbing the same Biore UV milks every time i run out of it 😂",

    "body": "Dear gals and guys, \n\n—-TLDR at bottom—\n\nI fell for it too… the idea that i must purge, toil and boil, cry and scream, etc, in order to finally have good skin. I want you to know— i went through HELL. I lurked in this sub, i obsessively watched Dr. Dray, and lurked on random skincare subreddits.. based on the advice i tried sandwiching, then use every week, use every three days, use every day, i switched to cerave, then vaseline, then to cetaphil, then acne.org, then micellar water, I ate nothing but broth and stopped eating sugar, i ate kimchi, etc all in an attempt to figure out how to mitigate the purge. hell, I looked through legit research studies to try to pull myself through this… to no avail… until… I FOUND MY PANACEA! So instead of ditching this subreddit that gave me the motivation to keep going, I wanted to share my story and leave it at that, because I suspect this will help a poor soul like me who felt lost and isolated with their skin and no where to turn. \n\nI started my journey with tretinoin like many— I saw ads in FB and tiktok with before and afters, and I thought i’d try apostrophe to start because it seemed relatively safe and recommended. I also used eucerin cream to moisturize extra to prevent what i thought would be very drying. after about 2 weeks of tret formula use every other night, i developed a bunch if tiny white bumps all over my face and neck. Some call them “grains of sand”. I thought the purge had begun… but this period alone lasted for 3 months. I felt nervous, so i did more research on apostrophe and found that their formulas are not lab tested for every batch for clean and clear formulas and i also learned that compounded forms of tretinoin can be ineffective or irritating. So after those three months of what i’d call mild-to slightly more frequent purging, I decided to get a script for .025 tret through Nurx. \n\nThis is where it all went to shit. After 2 -3 weeks my skin had gotten notably worse. what used to be mild texture and closed comedones became cystic, papule-covered, and angry as hell. I was panicking but watched more youtube videos to remind myself about the necessity of the purge. I reached out to my nurx provider to question the efficacy of this purge and what to do. I got no response for 2 weeks and was eventually told that the purge is normal and the formula is fine. spoiler alert- the formula was in fact not fine for my skin. \n\nafter purging horribly for ~10 more weeks i stopped tret, went to an esthetician and sobbed about how bad my skin had gotten. She took pity on me did a face mask and tried to sell me $200 worth of skincare products that would fix my skin. She admitted she never had a reaction to tret like i did and always had good skin, but she was hopeful she could help me get clear skin in 6-12 months. I politely declined to buy the products and knew in my heart that there was another quicker solution. I went back to reddit and scoured and scoured and finally found my holy grail. Simple Skincare Science. a blog created by a reddit user who suffered horrible skin for years. i obsessively researched the blog and realized that i have (and many of us purgers have) skin that is prone to both bacterial acne and fungal acne (malessezia  \npityposporum). i told my esthetician i thought my acne may be fungal and she said, no i dont think so! i disagreed and took matters into my own hands.\n\nI began my investigation and got a black light on amazon. Woods lamps are used by derms to diagnose fungal or bacterial acne. if you see yellowish, green, and even blue.. then you know you have fungi on a surface including your skin. If you see coral, pink or red then you are seeing bacteria. well can you guess what i saw when i looked? green and yellow and blue… everywhere. \n\nI then checked all the ingredients in my makeup & skincare and found that many of them have fungal acne triggers and even feeders (fungus loves fatty lipids, oils ~except caprylic~ and esters). i had to throw away most of the expensive shit i had just purchased to save myself. this includes sunscreen and face wash and blush etc. \n\nI then purchased (and yes, i spent way too much but those of you going through this know what it’s like to be in this state) fungal acne safe products both makeup and skincare. The beauty of FA safe though is that your options become severely limited and you end up saving the money you would have spent on $$$$ experimental and luxury products later down the road. my holy grail product is now a sulphur mask i buy for $6 on amazon. Lol \n\nMy fungal acne fighting products were: Happy cappy zinc shampoo, nizoral (only used about 3 x its strong) and 10-30 min sulphur masks. building up the time i wore them. I knew then that this was fungal because my face got angry as fuck and red. The acne was dying off quickly and this, I could tell, was a real purge. It was so so challenging. but i stuck with it because i knew and could feel it had figured it out once and for all and now it was just a matter of waiting for my skin to cleanse itself and heal. \n\ni eventually went to a dermatologist and told him my findings and asked for diflucan (an oral antifungal)— just in case. Because i had also been on antibiotics for a month back in the fall before starting tret, so wanted to make sure it wasn’t also internal. He agreed and said it seemed like i knew my shit Lol. \n\nDuring that time my skincare involved a transitionary period as I purchased the Malezia brand of everything and shipping times were delayed. So in the meantime i used cerave foaming cleanser, acne.org benzoyl peroxide, and urea moisturizer from hado labo. then i switched to all malezia brand. i also used stridex pads alternating or throughout the day. I eventually added Paulas choice 8% AHA GEL (not liquid as it has FA triggers). And in a matter of a month my skin stopped producing new acne and began to just have scarring. for another 2.5 months i used paulas choice, still adding in sulphur masks weekly and my skin made more progress. \n\nThen, when my skin was clear and scarring was faded a lot more, i SLOWLY checked out altreno- a micro-ionized form of tretinoin with no known fungal acne triggers. but i used it incredibly slowly for 1-2 months; every 3-4 days and less than a pea size. i noticed some dryness and a little but of tiny red spots where black heads or cc’s— this was the type of purging you are meant to have on tret/exfoliants if you have no active acne. I could slow down and begin my basic FA safe routine. \n\nIt turns out those itnital “grains of sand” that popped up everywhere were actually the fungal acne on my skin starting to react to FA triggers in apostrophe (which may have been whatever their moisturizer was) and then again to the isopropyl myristate in the nurx. the thing with tret is that it increases skin turnover rapidly and therefore can allow fungal acne to grow rapidly too… this is what I suspect is happening to us poor souls who have terrible “purges”.\n\nso know this... You WILL have clear skin but you need to check your current tret, maybe even pause tret altogether, and ditch other products that are exacerbating your “purge. Go back to basics. YOU WILL SAVE MONEY LONG TERM. I can't even believe this but I now really only wash my face once a day!!! In the am I used a stridex pad or use hyloronic cleanser if I feel like it, benzoyl peroxide and sunscreen. then at night I use my hyolornic acid cleanser and altreno or BP/stridex if I want an off-night. I never thought my skin would be back and BETTER than it started! \n\nand when/if you want to try tret again… though for anyone who thinks they might be prone to it, i would fix your skincare and product lineup for at least a month and THEN try it. I waited until i had no active acne and until my scarring faded significantly before trying it again because i wanted to know if it was just tret or if it was my overall skincare. \n\nGo find a micro-ionized one (for me altreno is well worth the cost) with no known FA triggers. You need to overhaul your skincare and get rid of anything with FA triggers. \n\nmy skin is totally clear now and by golly i just want to hug myself back then and say it will be okay you will get through this. because man do i empathize with you folks struggling right now. \n\nAnd in fact, I may be down voted for calling the “necessary” purge a myth..  however… the proof is in the muhfuggin pudding baby!!!! i brought my skin through the depths of hell and back, not only lived to tell the tale, but got sustainably clearer skin in the process.\n\n\nTLDR; i believe the terrible purge is a myth and is a result of many tret users having fungal acne and using poorly formulated tret. get rid of all fungal acne triggering products including sunscreen and makeup, get your skin right again and then try tret again if you want using a micro-ionized formula. \n\n-----------\nEDIT: I'm getting some questions about routine, products, etc. So I'll link those here. someone also mentioned shampoo/conditioner being a culprit and YES! I have had seborrheic dermatitis/ itchiness/ orange colored dandruff on my scalp before using products with essential oils, shae butter, things they say are natural... For FA skin, natural AINT IT!! We must get chemical ;) Lol. When I started treating my FA, I went fully clean of anything that could trigger it. I washed my pillow case every other day, slept on my back so it wouldn't spread to my pillow, cleaned all brushes i used, tried to avoid makeup if I could. Please check out this man's blog, it's a goldmine... and if you need help just DM me <3 https://simpleskincarescience.com/ \n \nPRODUCTS: \n* The light I used: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091CXT2Q9?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details (if you wash your face before using this, it might change what shows up... and i initially didn't think what i saw was fungal but it turns out it was, so know that YMMV. Also do not buy a UV light by accident like i did, get this one hehe.) \n\n* The Zinc Shampoo mask I used (about once every 3-4 days, based on how my skin responded. I will still occassionally use this on my scalp and body and face in the shower and leave it on there for like 2-5 mins if I notice some reactions): https://happycappyshampoo.com/product/shampoo-for-cradle-cap-and-seborrheic-dermatitis/ \n* Nizoral mask (I kept this on for about 20 mins, which is intense, but i really wanted to kill the Mf'ers. I used this about 2-3 times total in the very begining. It is very drying heads up. It's also not totally FA safe in ingredients, so don't rely too heavily on this one, but it will give the FA a big kick due to the ketaconozole) https://www.amazon.com/Nizoral-Anti-Dandruff-Shampoo-Ketoconazole-Dandruff/dp/B00AINMFAC \n* MY HOLY GRAIL MASK I USED DAILY AND WOULD MARRY IF I COULD: DE LA CRUZ SULFUR!!!!! I wore the masks for 10 mins to start then upped it to 30-60 mins. Don't waste your money buying some 30$ spot treatment from an esthy which is a marked up and worse version.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WP6KK7B?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details\n\n* Face washes that I used: Cetaphil Foaming Cleanser: https://www.amazon.com/Gentle-Foaming-Cleanser-Pack-Fragrance/dp/B077FJJDVD/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1UCOL7Q6RRLFT&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.cxMRnJFjMDE-9MbJX5M42iXhjLASy_X6zZcSDyQa3HFzNO_BQsyX39dt4pPApcNQdcV0usGUPRl1C1yyMOUaQHOJt6w4DjIqh2e0YbBRE-U8tXBYoIHMZKySexP84LzZDkPF2dS7zTspK2WQpwm2OUYQW1oCjcMGTv7-Afq3IJMhFUm3UkyCZKAUIx9wfdRV9iN4vgVT8FX2c_A8oTxvWGzznjXQhrgpq63acG_OMqG3stH_kQBZrqy4U21izZlsKTGsPCcfedHbz_h50auO3lvfWYQ9Ax55X9iSmHpe_1g.t3XYnyIxSEeYJp0_OgOxo-YGlY1Az9VVmcfASGRwLdk&dib_tag=se&keywords=cetaphil+foaming+facial+cleanser&qid=1723819503&s=beauty&sprefix=cetaphil+foaming+facial+cleanser%2Cbeauty%2C86&sr=1-2 \n\n--> OR go the Malezia route, I really enjoy their stuff. Sacylic acid cleanser + caprylic acid cleanser alternating days, followed by a hyaluronic acid cleanser: https://malezia.com/pages/regimen-guide \n\n*I used stridex saylic acid pads sometimes AFTER the BP or randomly during the day if I felt anxious and like I wanted to do something. It I watched my skin for irritation, so just be careful. https://www.amazon.com/Stridex-Strength-Medicated-Maximum-Count/dp/B000O1KP1O/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2VLASQO6AL63K&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ZwT5w7Gg9tdnB5UZat90YMHqZVwbK2dqCquQ9pLIOlSltxokPs5RC5GEWyDlF1GnvSF6Fz-iaS1MPmZPn4znN0o9w3krUAMAM-wQeV6hNBItYGKafiGM3SiSvsoPELASjiIAAY55DEwKWZLBw6I6xwnvIm0xSoEfRB6bxqPTYdg4eGjzrF-BfkpvD6PhWkUAFuLcUE9GQ6nFVWoHIIEEkOKCrnWDWhw-5lslcM0ov_c9WMrgJIUi9Zu8RzHRADNtpuK-GjTX3hzc_BdL3Mr9Fv4yjQtN3XrfUnLDhNuzWcY.jFqXPKzHJO99h4K02ZVGuo0h-gvw1FynFd1C_1UwFLY&dib_tag=se&keywords=stridex&qid=1723819595&rdc=1&s=beauty&sprefix=stridex%2Cbeauty%2C89&sr=1-1 \n\n* Benzoyl Peroxide: I used acne.org or Malezia brand (which I now prefer). link to Acne.org https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00164FVH6?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details \n* Followed with an FA safe moisturizeer with Urea. At first I used Hado Labo, then again switched to Malezia because it's amazing! Link to Hado Labo: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I4BUBN8?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details \n* After some time doing basics, I added in an exfoliant (perhaps the only FA safe one I know of before the moisturizer). Paula's choice 8% AHA gel: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00949CO66?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details \n\nTHE SUNSCREENS I USE! \n* HADA LABO UV Perfect Gel SPF50+ 90g (I now use this in the AM as my last step to replace moisturizer) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07M9GYH6Y?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details \n* COTZ Face Prime & Protect Tinted Mineral Sunscreen and Facial Primer Broad Spectrum SPF 40  (A bit drying on face, so use under moisturizer. but its great for days where i want extra coverage or don't want to wear makeup) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0073P01RC?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details \n\nMY CURRENT ROUTINE:\nAM- use a stridex pad or 2 to wipe down my face OR wash face with Malezia Hyaloronic Acid Cleanser\nMalezia Benjoyl peroxide\nHado Labo Sunscreen \nthen apply Makeup \nOR I apply malezia urea moisturizer then COTZ sunscreen if I don't plan on wearing makeup\n\nPM-\nCaprylic Acid Cleanser to wash off makeup\nHyaloronic acid cleanser\nAltreno Tretinoin or if my skin needs some treatment i will instead use Paula's Choice AHA gel followed by urea moisturizer (urea is mildly exfoliating so do not use with tret)\n\nI've built myself to this simplified routine, and I will occassionally add in a sulfur face mask or wash with happy cappy zinc to bolster my FA safe routine and treat anything that pops up. \n\nI also triple check all my ingredients using Sezia, Foliculitis Scout & skinsort\n- https://www.sezia.co/\n- https://folliculitisscout.com/ \n- https://skinsort.com/fungal-acne-checker \n\nI have pictures all through out the entire process, before and after my tret, FA, treatment journey... I wonder how i could share those so you all can see how intense it got. Before this, I had one long 2 year bought of bad acne that i treated with acne.org, but now looking back i realize it was totally moderate fungal acne, whereas this was SEVERE. Before starting tret i had bad skin texture and lots of CC's (but were actually fungal acne not CC's). So this is why my skin actually looks way better now. :) \n\n-----\nTLDR again; i believe the terrible purge is a myth (aka not necessary at all if your skin wasn't severe to start with) and is a result of many tret users having fungal acne and using poorly formulated tret. get rid of all fungal acne triggering products including sunscreen and makeup, get your skin right again and then try tret again if you want using a micro-ionized formula. I have linked my routine and products above. \n",

        "body": "Just want to add to this: For like two years, my forehead and temples kept breaking out, no matter what I tried. So I treated it like fungal acne, and that didn’t help.  They were these tiny closed comedones that just would not go away.  But in the morning, they’d be invisible and by evening, they’d show up again.  My derm said just keep using the tret and Aza.  \n\nThen, one day, I went online to repurchase my leave-in conditioner, and I noticed they updated the ingredients to list out ingredients that make up the “fragrance.”  And I realized it had linalool, limonene, citronell, and geraniol, which are phototoxic ingredients and can cause a rash or bumps in uv light.  In 2023, Biden signed a bill that forces cosmetics makers to list those ingredients instead of just lumping them under “fragrance.”  They are common allergens.  \n\nSo I dropped the leave-in, and my forehead and temple bumps started clearing up immediately.  I switched it out for vanicream free and clear conditioner.  Now, they are gone completely for about a year.  So, if you try treating for fungal acne, and that doesn’t work, maybe consider the fragrant ingredients in your hair and skin products.  The breakouts look just like fungal acne.  There is a list of common contact allergens you can check for in your products:  https://www.cosmeticscare.eu/en/new-allergens/\n\nJust wanted to toss that in there for anyone dealing with anything that looks like fungal acne. And these ingredients do NOT just affect people with sensitive skin or allergies.  They can cause a reaction in anyone if these ingredients come into contact with uv light.",

        "body": "Oh my gosh!!  You’re an angel sister!! I had no idea about fungal acne. I had started Tretinoin and successfully went through the ‘purge’ phase or so I thought. Somewhere along the way I developed a really irritated hairline/brows/bridge of nose. And nothing, nothing at all made it go away. Eventually my whole head was always itchy, flakey, irritated, and no amount of anti dandruff shampoo was helping. I stopped every skincare and haurcare product. A friend suggested Nizoral and it helped but only temporarily. I did a deep dive on the internet and through pure chance came across some products which are formulated for malesezzia and finally had some relief. But I never figured out what triggered the reaction in the first place. Reading your post made me realized that it could have been the Tretinoin that started this all. This makes so much sense.

They usually prescribe you different solutions along with tret.\n\nTret is a “if you can’t figure out who is messing up the house, just have someone clear the house daily and put in new furniture” kinda solution. Can’t have cobwebs(acne) if the place gets rapidly cleaned and turned over daily. \n\n\nYour issue has been the same issue I see on here. You watch a ton of vidros thinking you’re educating yourself, especially since a dermatologist is telling you.\n\nYou don’t realise that derm and everyone else is just actively feeding each other the same bull everyone tells each other on here. \n\nYour main culprit was sandwiching method for tret not working. The core reason for your acne aside of course.\n\nLong story short, actually get an understanding how tret works(why does it stop acne, why does it make your skin dry, how can irritation get worse, thus, what would be the ways to stop it, etc), \n\nthen review how sandwiching is supposed to work(if my skin gets dry because of X[hint, tret isn’t drying your skin the moment it is in contact with it], then can moisturizing it at the same time work? What about the fact that the cream had to pass clinical trials for them to be able to sell it, those trials proving the drug gets into your skin at the right rate, how does the moisturizer affect this, especially since you’re likely just using a random one they never tested it with, especially when you aren’t even measuring the moisturizer, etc)\n\n\nAnother hint? Many of the derms that speak about sandwiching and tret DO NOT HAVE ACNE PROBLEMS. They use tret for anti-aging. You can get those results long term on any strength of tretinoin. So what they say works for them? Doesn’t necessarily work for you. You need your skin to rapidly catch up to the right turn over rate so it is pretty much unable to make acne. You are trying to achieve this while getting used to tretinoin so you don’t get way too irritated.\n\nThey? They can go as slow as they want with increasing their turn over rate.",

The purge can be tough but so many people have gotten through it - you can too!\n- Second: **no one can predict whether or not you will purge!** If you don't currently have active acne, it's less likely but still possible.\n- Third: If your purge lasts for longer than 12 weeks or seems really extreme, talk to your dermatologist! NO PURGE SHOULD LAST LONGER THAN 3 MONTHS - if you're still purging after 3 months, talk to your doctor or ask us for help!\n- Lastly: We have a very [helpful wiki!](https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vRQmcAj-x5A8JIQygtW2Rg89uPsJPR5JLH_dLxLNCW4eazWW4i49bsrF0e2YYx10wx00ctaUnyvHfyD/pub) It contains lots of tips about starting out, including specific routine recommendations.

    "body": "1. DermaCo C-cinamide radiance sunscreen aqua gel SPF 50 & PA++++:\nThis one’s a flop. Not even photostable, super comedogenic, and leaves an oily mess behind. Protection? Meh. A disappointing 4/10.\n\n2, 3, 4. Dot & Key Sunscreens (all three, except watermelon):\nSame formulation, same issue—zero protection. Loaded with ethyl hexyl palmitate & isopropyl myristate, (they're highly comedogenic; their comedogenicity rating is 5/5) aka potential acne triggers. Plus, not even photostable. Waste of money. 2/10. The watermelon one is\nSlightly better because of the mild cooling effect, but still doesn’t protect well. Comedogenic gang again. 3/10.\n\n5.  Dot & Key tinted Sunscreen:\nNot gonna lie, this works more like a BB cream than a sunscreen. Does something, but I wouldn’t trust it entirely for sun protection. 6/10.\n\n6.  THE BEST ONE (so far) Concious chemist sundrink sunscreen:\nBalanced zinc oxide + titanium dioxide. \nSuper photostable, offers actual protection, and doesn’t even clog my pores. 8/10.\n\n7. Dr. Sheth’s haldi + hyaluronic acid sunscreen:\nIt’s okay-ish tbh. \nfewer comedogenic ingredients than Dot & Key, but still not the best for protection. Texture is decent, but what’s the point if it doesn’t do its job? 5.5/10.\n\n8. Sunscoop sunscreen:\nI really wanted to love this because I trust chemist at play, but this one? not it. Feels so greasy and heavy, takes forever to blend, my skin feels suffocating after applying it; offers mild protection. 6/10.\n\n9 and 10. Conscious chemist Berry Bright Sunscreen – MY HOLY GRAIL:\nY’all, I finally found the one, after using 'n' number of sunscreens lmfao (happy tears) personally I loved the smell as well, (smells like blueberry yogurt), blends like a dream, and actually protects—super photostable with near to no comedogenic ingredients. Formulation team deserves a raise. Only flaw? empties too fast. A solid 9.9/10\n\n11. DermaCo pore minimizing sunscree:\nA disaster. Heavy white cast, takes ages to blend, and feels suffocating on the skin. Barely protects. 3/10.",

    "body": "So, I wanted to write a newbie guide about Perfume Basics From the POV of a Consumer.  I am a consumer myself and there are a lot of perfumista superstitions that get passed around as perfume lore (like that coffee bean thing), so please let me know if I have unknowingly included something contentious, just plain inaccurate, or needs citations.\n\nThis one covers: notes, notes lists, types of carriers, skin chemistry, and longevity.\n\n**Defining perfume**\n\nTalking about perfumes can get a little confusing.  There are only a finite number of times you can use the terms perfume and fragrance before it starts getting imprecise or repetitive.  For the purposes of this guide, I'm defining the vocabulary thus:\n\n* Perfume or fragrance: Except in cases where I am talking about aroma, I usually use it to mean either products or a specific blend.  Something that is *more* than the sum of its parts.  What we, as consumers, purchase in various forms.\n\n* Perfume compound or concentrate: The actual perfume, a blend composed of many components, before it is further diluted and divided for sale.  Different concentrations of this compound affect performance and price.\n\n* Perfume oil: A type of perfume product based on oil carriers that consumers buy.\n\n* Fragrance oil: A pre-made oil mixed from several components (sometimes a mix of natural and synthetic; sometimes entirely synthetic) to evoke an aroma.  Not always meant to replicate a natural, some of them can be abstract (Amazon rain).  Generally, it's lesser quality as a perfume ingredient than natural extractions or aroma chemicals, but much cheaper to acquire and, for some, an ethical alternative, such as using sandalwood/beeswax FO rather than real beeswax/sandalwood (see: Key Notes of next section).\n\n* Stock fragrance: A pre-made perfume, concentrate or oil sold by a distributor for personal use or retail purposes.  Sometimes stock fragrances dupe (or replicate) mainstream fragrances, but not always; they can also be simple or a popular original composition.  Not all brands will disclose whether the fragrance was purchased from a stock fragrance distributor rather than created in-house.\n\nElsewhere, you might see concentrate described as perfume oil or fragrance oil or simply perfume, or fragrance oil meaning stock fragrance, or any mixture of substitutions.  When talking about perfume with others, make sure you're on the same page with definitions.\n\n**What are notes?**\n\nIn perfumery, we see \"notes\" as the equivalent to a painter's palette or a composer's orchestra, made from various components.  In some cases, components are straight botanical extractions (essential oils, enfleurage, infusions, tincturing, etc.), such as lavender and cinnamon, or synthetic replications (aroma chemicals, many fragrance oils), like ethyl maltol (candyfloss/caramel-esque).  In others, a \"note\" might actually be comprised of several or numerous materials (both synthetic and natural), such as for amber, or modified from other notes to concoct a new variation or create a fantasy concept.  A lot of these notes can have multiple sources, such as vanilla, which can be natural (a home-made tincture or EO), synthetic (vanillin), or simulated using other notes (Peruvian basalm or tonka).  When components react together to deliberately produce something new, that's called an accord, which is also sometimes simply called a \"note.\"  There's more to it, including counter-examples, but that's a general overview.  Basically, \"notes\" are more abstract than literal.\n\nPerfumers either purchase their components from suppliers (who are either producers or, more commonly, middle-men who can leverage buying in bulk in order to sell to makers) or extract their own botanicals.   If a supplier disappears or no longer stocks a certain component, it is not as simple as getting one from somewhere else to replace it.  Sometimes, the source for the components makes them smell distinct from similar ones, so exact reformulation is not always successful.\n\nFragrances can be all natural (no synthetic components) or mixed media (both synthetic and natural).  Usually, perfumes that are all-natural will be marked as such and some perfumers specialize in creating them; everything else is generally a mixture.  Due to a variety of factors, such as labor and production scale, many naturally-extracted materials are much more expensive to acquire than their aroma chemical or fragrance oil replacements, which is why all-natural perfumes are frequently priced higher than mixed media.\n\nKey Notes:\n\n1. Perfumers have multiple sources for their components, which consumers sometimes view as notes, although please keep in mind that \"notes\" are conceptual and for consumer benefit or marketing purposes only.  Though it is very probable that some perfumers have suppliers in common, we can't assume it's the same specific note.  It also means that, unless specified, Blends A, B, and C don't necessarily share the same \"note\" you like or dislike because the brand likely has more than one source of any note.\n\n2.  Natural perfumes are usually more expensive than mixed-media perfumes due to cost of components.  Keep that in mind when evaluating whether the asking price is worth it!\n\n3. Natural sources for materials can sometimes represent an ethical decision for us as consumers, even if perfumers cannot help the limitations or obfuscation of their suppliers.  For example: [civet farms](http://www.tropentag.de/2009/abstracts/full/101.pdf) [[use according to perfumery](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/style/tmagazine/21chanel.html)], [fading tradition of rose oil farming](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/02/turkey-roses-idUSL5N0ZF35L20150702) and [farming roses and orange blossoms instead of opium](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91118514), [illegal export of sandalwood](http://www1.american.edu/ted/SANDALWD.HTM) that [leads to violence](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/07/indian-police-kill-20-suspected-sandalwood-smugglers), [unsustainably harvested oud/agarwood](http://www.bgci.org/resources/article/0576/) [[an example of an alleged sustainable oudh plantation](http://www.fragrantica.com/news/OUD-SERIES-Fragrance-Du-Bois-Agarwood-Plantation-5631.html)], half the world's vetiver [comes from Haiti](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/24/us-haiti-perfume-idUSBREA3N24O20140424), etc.  Basically, globalization is a complex monster, and technological advances and attempted solutions complicate it even more.  It's up to you to decide how comfortable you are with these possibilities.  Additionally, if you are vegan, the presence of honey, beeswax or \"beach-found\"/vintage ambergris (from sperm whales) is also notable.\n\n4.  Some essential oils are only safe at certain dilutions, so part of buying perfume is trusting a perfumer's knowledge of their craft.  In my experience, perfumers usually disclose if their blend includes a common irritant such as spices like cinnamon, but honestly, *anything* can be an irritant.  We never really know everything in the formula, so always be careful and *patch test*.  Even if you're usually not sensitive to fragrances, a slight increase in potency (even at a safe dilution) might mean an adverse reaction.  Because humans are amazing, sometimes we find natural materials more tolerable than synthetics, and the reverse is also true, where aroma chemicals are safer than the natural they've replaced.\n\n**What about notes lists?**\n\nNotes are sometimes classified according to the order we detect them: top or head, middle or heart, and base. The top notes are ones you smell first due to their molecular volatility, which makes them evaporate quickest; some aromas are famous for this, such as citruses.  The transition from top to mid/base is often more obvious than the progression from middle to base.  Base notes linger the longest, and often have fixative properties for other notes.  Regardless, these are not strict divisions (some notes are more like top/heart or heart/base etc.) because the entire composition interacts during development.   Taking into consideration the molecular behavior of aromas means a perfumer is a cross between an artist and a chemist.\n\nSome perfumers choose to include notes in their perfume description for the benefit of the consumer, either as a list or organized into a top/middle/base pyramid.  Sometimes there's a rationale for the list arrangement, such as listing them according to prominence or quantity, but not always.  Although common, a notes list is only one method for the perfumer to describe the perfume to consumers.  Sometimes perfumes are sold just with a text description that can be simple (floral oriental based on roses and vanilla versus floral chypre based on roses and vanilla) or evocative.  Or it uses a mixture of both approaches. There is no best way to really communicate what the perfume will smell like since they all have advantages and disadvantages, and in general smells are difficult to describe.  Two perfumes can list the same notes, yet smell completely different from each other.\n\nReading notes lists sometimes requires decoding.  A lot of materials can have alternate names, or appear to be synonymous when in fact it's completely different.  Some examples: bourbon vanilla is another name for Madagascar vanilla, but it is not boozy unless specified; opoponax is sometimes called sweet myrrh, but it does not smell like myrrh (sometimes distinguished as bitter myrrh); rock roses produce cistus (rock rose) and labdanum, which smell different from each other but neither are rosy; lily of the valley and muguet are the same thing; oudh can be aloeswood, agarwood, and eagleswood; cassis is blackcurrant; although tiare is also known as Tahitian gardenia, it does not smell like gardenia; neroli and orange blossom are made from the same part of the bitter orange tree (which also produces petitgrain and bitter orange/brigarade; a hybrid cross produces bergamot), but different extraction processes change their smells.  At times perfumers exchange the words as if they're interchangeable, and as you can see, sometimes they are.  But not always.  Reasons for *why* they do this varies (new supplies, differentiating between extraction methods or harvests, their supplier added to the confusion such as selling \"neroli/orange blossom,\" ignorance, perceived elegance, etc), but it means it's possible that a note you (dis)like lurks within the description.  This is especially important if you are allergic to something!\n\nHowever, notes lists are not ingredients lists.  If a perfumer lists 5 notes in their description, it does not mean they utilized only 5 materials in their formula; it's possible there are 20 or more components in the perfume.  Some of it is due to industry secrecy and mystique, but some of it is for practicality: reading a list of dozens of materials is unnecessarily overwhelming rather than informative.  Some of their formulation includes materials that are meant to affect other notes in some way, such as tempering or strengthening the performance of something else, or smoothing out (harmonizing) the blend; sometimes they're in such minuscule amounts that ideally we shouldn't smell them distinctly or they're odorless fixatives.  Or, as I mentioned above, those \"notes\" are actually summaries of a lot of different components to produce something new.  It also means that, sometimes, you're not meant to smell *everything* in the notes list.  Some people are lucky: either anosmic (unable to smell) or sensitive to the material anyway, such as [being unable to smell certain synthetic musks](http://perfumeshrine.blogspot.com/2009/12/musk-series-2-natural-and-everything.html) or finding Iso-E Super (a woody odor) overwhelming in any amount. \n\nImportant Takeaways:\n\n1. By paying attention to what kind of notes are given in the description, we can estimate its expected performance - at least to some degree. If it only names mostly light top/heart notes, it will probably have fleeting performance; a perfume that lists only heavy resins should, in theory, last several hours, so if it fails to do so then something is amiss.  However, the interactions between components can affect performance in ways unexpected to us.\n\n2.  Pay attention for potential alternate names and be aware of simplification.  For example, if the key notes say \"rose,\" that could mean any number of things if they don't specify.  Turkish roses are different from Bulgarian, which are different from Moroccan, and none of them are tea roses or pink roses or white roses; the aroma chemical isolates are not quite the same as the natural materials that vary between harvests, and neither smell like rose fragrance oils.  This can also explain why a note might not smell like you expect.\n\n**What is a carrier, and how does that affect perfume?**\n\nA carrier is whatever chosen solvent that diluted the components.  As consumers, the important part is the medium of the final product: oil, alcohol, or solid.  Each of these have their pros and cons.  What's pro for one consumer is a con to another: a feature rather than a bug.  I classified some as \"it depends\" because whether it's an advantage or disadvantage is personal or situational.\n\n* *OILS*\n>Examples: Fractionated coconut oil, jojoba (technically a wax that's liquid at room temperature), sweet almond, rice bran, grapeseed, etc.  Sometimes a blend can list more than one carrier oil.\n>\n>Pros: Oils ship anywhere so perfume oils are very accessible.  Moisturizes skin to some degree.\n>\n>Cons: Varying shelf lives of each oil means sometimes the perfume can go unexpectedly rancid.  Stains very easily.  Sometimes brands don't completely disclose all the carriers.\n>\n>Depends: Lower sillage due to slower evaporation.  More responsive to skin chem than alcohol.  Changes the performance of the fragrance, which some find flattening or linear, but others find ideal for certain notes, such as heavy bases.  Usually sold in smaller amounts than alcohol-based.  Since some materials do not fully dissolve in oil, there can be a lava lamp-like separation or the oil will look cloudy.\n\n* *ALCOHOL*\n>Examples: Denatured 95% ethanol, sometimes called perfumer's alcohol (denatured means it's rendered undrinkable through an agent), from grape (usually in organic/all natural perfumes), cane sugar, or grain. Non-alcohol alternatives to retain spray-ability are usually IPM (Isopropyl Myristate) and Cyclomethicone (\"dry oil\" sprays).\n>\n>Pros:  Easier to spritz and go (assuming it comes in an atomiser; some are splashers).  More familiarity with application.  Fragrance is more stable in some ways, less prone to changing.\n>\n>Cons: Shipment of alcohol-based anything is extremely regulated or even forbidden, so some brands refuse to ship internationally, thus access is often limited.  Adds to the weight of packages.  Sometimes the denaturing agent is detectable, or the alcohol smell is too detectable because they used a lower-proof liquid or you're sensitive to alcohol.  Some find alcohol-based perfumes more of a migraine trigger, or very drying for their skin. The cost of acquiring alcohol is often passed along to consumers.\n>\n>Depends: Larger sillage due to faster evaporation.  Less responsive to skin chem compared to oils.  Changes the performance of the fragrance, such as more prominent fresh top notes, but base notes may not seem to go as deep.\n\n* *SOLID*\n>Examples: Beeswax, candelilla wax, or soy wax mixed with various butters and sometimes additional oils.  Lots of alternatives for all of these parts, including other waxes, can change this from a balm to a cream.\n>\n>Pros: Portability, especially if you're traveling by plane, and easy reapplication.  No spills.  Some people find solids the least triggering for headaches.  Moisturizes skin to some degree.\n>\n>Cons: Potential to melt.  Beeswax is fragrant and often detectable unless it's been filtered and bleached.  Formulation can make it too soft or too hard to easily apply.  Sometimes the fragrance can dry out.\n>\n>Depends: Generally, lower sillage.  You might have an issue with texture (greasy, gummy, etc) and perceived sanitation due to its application.  The compacts, tins or tubes can be a nice visual change.  The format can affect top notes in particular, or come across as more linear.\n\nObviously, this is not a full list of potential carriers or their advantages/disadvantages.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n1. The bases of oils and balms are not as regulated as alcohol and can be shipped anywhere, so they are the most accessible to us as consumers and, generally speaking, more public-friendly.\n\n2.  If the brand offers multiple formats, one cannot assume that they all smell the same.  Because often the perfumer has to alter the blend in some way to suit the medium (at the very least, in concentration, but sometimes partial or total reformulation is involved), usually each one will be a different experience from the other and you might prefer perfume in one form over another.  Then again, sometimes they smell exactly the same across formats.\n\n3.  If you have a perfume oil, pay attention to the carrier(s) a perfumer lists: they have different shelf lives.  Stored properly, fractionated coconut oil has a near-indefinite shelf life, with jojoba second; others, such as grapeseed, are estimated to last around 6 months.  A blend of carriers generally extends the shelf life somewhat, but not always.  However, this assumes the carriers were fresh for your perfume.  If it is important to you to keep the perfume around for a while, please keep in mind the potential shelf lives of the carriers.  I recommend periodically checking your collection to make sure your perfumes still smell okay.\n\n**What about longevity?**\n\nIn many guides, perfume oils will be listed as longer-lasting than sprays, with solids usually having the shortest longevity.  This is based on two assumptions: higher concentrations often result in increased longevity and each form has a consistent range of concentration.  While the first assumption is not wrong, the second one is not so straight forward.\n\nAccording to this theory, perfume sprays would work something like this: eau de toilettes (EDT) should last longer than eau de colognes (EDC), eau de parfums (EDP) last longer than EDTs, and extraits/parfums beat EDPs.  [In mainstreams, sometimes EDT and EDP are actually *different formulations* rather than different concentrations, but that's another issue.]  There are several other terms, but those are the common ones in my experience.  Depending on who you ask, perfume oil is supposed to be somewhere in the range between EDP and extrait, with solids in the EDT range.\n\n* First, it assumes every category follows a consistent range of concentration.  In reality, no standardized definitions exist and acceptable ranges are actually pretty wide, so there is a lot of overlap.  For example, various sources claim EDP concentration is: 8%-15% [[source](http://www.nstperfume.com/perfume-faq/)], 10%-15% [[source](https://www.fragrancex.com/customerservice/fragrancefaqs.html)], 10%-20% [[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfume#Concentration)], or 10%-30% [[source](http://theperfumedcourt.com/perfume_info.aspx)].  Their definitions for EDT and extraits are similarly all over the place.  If perfume oil is supposed to be roughly around EDP strength or a bit higher, then that is a huge range.  Additionally, perfumers will adjust concentration levels to suit their intended effect or acceptable price point.\n\n* Second, formulations are incredibly important.  If the carrier uses oils that absorb too quickly or don't hold scent well for long, that will affect longevity.  A poorly-structured oil (lacking proper fixatives) might perform like an EDC; EDTs that are unusually concentrated or better-formulated can outlast EDPs.  Then there's simple science: a resin-based perfume will hang around longer than a citrus-based one no matter the concentration levels due to their different molecular weights.  All-natural perfumes have a reputation of being relatively short-lived too.\n\n* Third, heat makes a difference in performance.  This includes both skin and weather/season - mostly the latter.  Sweating and humidity both affect how perfume blooms, particularly longevity.  This is also why some perfumes seem to smell different depending on the weather.\n\nSo although different types of perfume have the reputation of certain concentration ranges, in reality it's not so simple.  Rather than assuming that the format of the perfume means we can expect an average performance, variables like the above are important considerations for assessing whether longevity is too short, adequate, or impressive.\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Mainstream brands are notoriously tight-lipped about concentrations.  Niches and indies too, but sometimes they will openly list how concentrated perfumes are somewhere on their page.  Paying attention to that can help explain why the oil outlasted the spray, or why the solid outlasted both, although it won't conclusively explain longevity issues..\n\n2.  As for reasonable expectations of longevity, that's up to you to decide.  There are estimates both from experts and perfumers themselves, generally in the 3 to 6 hour range for oils/EDPs (sometimes as high as 8), but perfume is individualized both in its behavior on skin as well as the consumer's purpose, such as whether you're comfortable reapplying, whether you want to have the option to change perfumes (eg: between something work appropriate vs something for sleep), or if you expected more/less for the price.\n\n**How does skin chemistry factor into all this?**\n\nOur unique skin chemistry affects most perfumes regardless of format, changing the way a blend blooms on skin.  Sometimes this difference is minor or undetectable, but other times it can be disastrous, transmogrifying beauty into grossness or amplifying some nuances over others.  On one hand, this can personalize the sensory experience of perfume, so juice that smells terrible in the bottle will blossom wonderfully on your skin in a way that it doesn't on anybody else's.  But on the other, it means it's possible that the perfumer did everything right and the blend can *still* go horribly, inexplicably wrong or evaporate more quickly when it touches your skin.  Oil perfumes have a reputation of being more susceptible to skin chemistry because of how close it sits on skin and gets absorbed into it.\n\nThere's good and bad news about skin chemistry: it changes.  The most common examples for sudden changes are menstrual cycles and pregnancy, thanks to hormonal fluxes.  But it also potentially includes growing older, changes in medication (including birth control), health, diet, smoking habits, etc.  Perfumes you once hated can suddenly smell amazing, and beloved comfort fragrances can become sickening.  This change can be temporary or permanent.\n\nThis affects perception too; the blend doesn't even have to touch skin for it to seem different to your nose and brain.  Some of it is, of course, possibly how tastes in perfume can evolve or developing a keener sense of smell.  For example, some find that their sense of smell changes during pregnancy, becoming more or less sensitive.\n\nIn short:\n\n1. Testing on skin is integral to deciding whether or not the perfume works for you.\n\n2.  What works for skin last year or even last month might not work the same way tomorrow or next year.  This is not necessarily due to changes in body or sense of smell, since factors such as aging oils and weather are also in effect.\n\n**Can a consumer extend the longevity of perfume?**\n\nIn some ways, this is like asking if there's anything we, as house owners, can do to reinforce the structural integrity of a house someone else built.  Yes, there are things we can do that help, but we don't accomplish as much as an architect who can tweak the blueprint before the concrete is poured.\n\nIt depends on *why* the perfume isn't lasting very long and what aspects you want to alter.  If it is short-lived due to formulation, such as whether the perfumer properly integrated fixatives or their carrier mix, then it is more difficult to compensate for that.  If you're trying to make top notes stick around, that's something neither you nor the perfumer can help much because by nature top notes dissipate quickly.  As mentioned before, weather can also affect perfume and that can't be helped unless you are a wizard.\n\nAlthough your success rate will vary, even between perfumes, here are some ideas to try:\n\n* *Pick a different place for application, or multiple places*. This might seem like a DUH! kind of solution, but if you're applying perfume somewhere that is rubbed or scrubbed often, you might be removing the perfume rather than experiencing disappointing longevity.  If you're using or washing your hands a lot, try your upper arms or elsewhere, although clothing might obstruct it.  It might also be a problem with a decreased sillage, or scent projection, rather than longevity.  You might not be able to smell it from your wrists, but maybe you can from your shoulders, chest or neck.  Please note that some locations on the body are more sensitive, so be cautious - just because your chest or wrist can handle perfume doesn't mean your neck won't get a rash.\n\n* *Layer products with the same fragrance*. If a perfume comes in a body product, try layering them together.  Same if it comes in different concentrations.\n\n* *Moisturize*!  Dry skin will absorb perfume faster.  The best is probably one that already shares the same fragrance, but if that's not available, try an unscented body cream or even body oil.\n\n*  *Apply perfume to fabric or hair.*  Please be careful when putting perfume on clothing or accessories since sometimes it can stain or retain scent far longer than you anticipated, even through repeated washes.  You can also add some perfume to a fabric scrap or cotton ball and hide that somewhere on your person, such as in a locket or pocket.\n\n* *A perfume primer might help*.  A couple places sell perfume stickers, which promise to extend the wear time of perfume applied on top of the barrier.  I have never personally tried one so I cannot do more than point out that the option exists.\n\n* *Wear it in a different season*.  Some perfumes just perform better in different weather.\n\n* *Let it age*.  This is usually only for oil perfumes.  Some perfumers blend to order, or maybe coincidentally you ordered right when a new batch was finished, but a fresh batch smells and performs differently than one that's aged for a bit.  If you can, set it aside for at least a couple weeks, preferably months, then try it again.\n\nSome also apply *more* fragrance.  In my experience, this usually results in larger sillage, not necessarily better longevity, but as always YMMV.\n\nIt's also possible that your nose has become desensitized to its presence, a sort of temporary specific anosmia.  The fragrance might still be detectable to others even if it seems to have disappeared to you.\n\nBasics:\n\n1. If you plan on aging or keeping the perfume, the best storage is away from direct light/heat and at a consistent dry temperature with a tight cap.   This is especially important if the containers are clear rather than opaque or if you live somewhere humid with frequent extreme changes in temperature.  Regardless, even with proper storage, some perfumes deteriorate anyway while others seem to last forever.  This can be either due to the carrier or nature of the notes (top notes are usually the first to go) as the fragrance breaks down, leaving you with a container that just smells like the carrier or \"off\".\n\n2. There are some ways to affect longevity, but between formulation and skin chem, sometimes there isn't much you can do except reapply or find other ways to use the perfume, such as in an oil burner or as a linen spray.  If the original bottle is too awkward to carry with you, you can decant into rollerballs or smaller bottles/sprays.  But I don't know anything about how to do this except that teensy 1ml rollerballs exist and they are so cute I could die.",

It took me a lot of reading and researching to figure out what made up the perfume experience. Ageing was a new concept for me. So was throw and sillage.\n\nThis is definitely sidebar material for Beginners methinks. * *saves* *\n\nEdit - thank you for raising the point on the effects of globalisation. Cruelty-free is all well and truly good, but there are definitely other environmental or social factors that might contribute in ways owners or even suppliers might not know, simply because of how the supply chain is managed (or mismanaged).",

    "body": "So ngayong hapon, nag-iiscroll scroll ako sa Tiktok ng mga shop na nagtitinda ng skincare products. Nasaktuhan na nakita kong naka-live yung sa Dermorepubliq kaya napagpasyahan kong tingnan ang kanilang mga product. May isang product na nakatawag pansin sa akin: ang kanilang 1% Retinol Serum. \n\nNapukaw ng product na ito ang aking pansin dahil sa taas ng retinol na nilalaman nito. Mataas ang 1% retinol para sa isang leave-on product, ang rekomendasyon nga lang nito sa E.U. ay nasa 0.3% lang (https://health.ec.europa.eu/publications/revision-scientific-opinion-sccs157616-vitamin-retinol-retinyl-acetate-retinyl-palmitate_en). \n\nKaya sinilip o naman sa listing ng Dermorepubliq 1% Retinol Serum, una kong hinanap ang ingredient list nito. Pero laking gulat ko nung makita ko ang ingredient list nito:\n\nAqua, Isopropyl Myristate, Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Niacinamide, Retinyl Palmitate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Tocopherol, Allantoin\n\nWalang Retinol, imbes, Retinyl Palmitate ang nakalagay. Malinaw na mislabeled ang produktong ito. Hindi ko tuloy maintindihan kung papaano nakalusot sa FDA ito noong nag-apply ito ng cosmetic product notification. 🤦‍♂️\n\nKaya para sa lahat: laging maging mapanuri sa inyong binibiling produkto.

    "body": "Hey guys!\n\n Soo thanks to /u/the_acid_queen and /u/holysnails I was inspired a few months ago to take the leap and stop just reading about DIY and just DO IT. Two massive orders from Lotioncrafter later (as well as various smaller ones from GoW and Amazon), I can definitely say I'm hooked. **But I really want to emphasize that despite countless hours spent on /u/DIYbeauty, Chel and Alli's blog, Susan Barclay's blog Point of Interest, and many other resources as well as practice I am very much a beginner. It takes a long long time to really master DIY skincare because when it comes down to it, it really is a science. If you're not fully prepared to do your research, buy the right equipment and supplies, and proceed with the utmost caution then don't bother. There are countless amazimg ready made products out there for you. If you are prepared though, AWESOME. Let's get started.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPhew. Now that that's out of the way, I just wanted to say that I never even thought to post about this until now because (1 I didn't think anyone would be interested and 2) what could I possibly have to teach someone? All the interest in the recent post on DIY made me realize that this is a topic you guys want to hear about and I started to think that maybe my perspective as a beginner could be valuable. So I'll be posting some easy peasy beginner recipes below which are a great starting point.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Supplies and getting started**\n\nI highly recommend [this post](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/02/16/fun-with-diy-beginners-recipe-shopping-list/) from Alli at her blog The Acid Queen, it lists all the measuring and mixing supplies you'll need, some info on preparing your work area, and a great beginner's essence recipe. She wrote this after I'd already gotten started with DIY but I had picked her brain via email on stuff to get so I can testify that she's spot on with her list. If you don't have a kitchen mixer and don't want to spend the money on one, you can get a stick blender for under $10 which Susan from POI recommends. I got the Mini Mixer from Lotioncrafter for $20. You can even buy those little miniature kitchen whisks off Amazon if you're making something without an oil phase but you'll definitely want an electrical mixer once you move onto to formulations where you're combining water and oil phases. Also, I use [this scale] (http://www.amazon.com/American-Weigh-0-01g-Digital-Scale/dp/B0012LOQUQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1461054126&sr=8-1&keywords=American+Weigh+100g+x+0.01g+Digital+Scale+by+American+Weigh) which Chel recommended on her blog. It's under $10 and it's great, just get the 100g calibration weight.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs for as actual ingredients, I highly recommend Lotioncrafter. They have excellent customer service and fair prices. While you might be able to shop around and get better prices on some things, the quality might not be there. I feel comfortable vouching for Lotioncrafter because I know their ingredients are good qualify. Other places you can check out are Bulk Actives, Ingredients to Die For, and Skin Actives. I use GoW for oils but they also have other ingredients. In the past Chel has linked the Taiwanese site Skin Essential Actives on her blog but just a heads up, I've heard lots of reports of really poor service recently.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs for as WHICH ingredients, that's going to depend on you and what you want to make. I would browse Point of Interest to get an idea of which ingredients you'll need for which kinds of recipes. Off the top of my head my first order I believe I got... distilled water, aloe vera juice, hydrosols, glycerin, propylene or butylene glycol, hylauronic acid, MAP, niacinamide, NAG, various extracts, oils, emulsifying wax, a preservative and a few others. Basically you need your water phase (distilled water is totally fine but I like to use aloe and hydrosols too), your oil phase (oils and then an emulsifier if you're combining oil and water), some goodies for your skin (humectants, extracts, niacinamide, Vitamin C, etc), and preservative. **Preservatives are NOT optional**. The only time you don't need one is of your product contains only oils and no water. It's okay to get cheap stuff like aloe juice, sodium lactate or PCA, hydrosols, glycerin, etc. You can stick them in everything and still get good results. Oh and get a complete emulsifier, like BTMS-50, Lotionpro, Ecomulse, or E Wax so you don't have to mess with the HLB system. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Beginner Recipes**\n\nOkay, if you got through all that we can finally get started lol. These are all super easy recipes that I've made before. I'm going to stick to stuff relevant to AB but if there's interest I'd be happy to post some more complex stuff I've made as well as other beginner friendly recipes as well. The first three don't container water so there's no preservative needed and you can just heat till melted through. The cleansing water though requires a preservative and you need to heat and hold for 20 minutes (see Alli's blog for more info on that).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDIY CLEANSING BALM WITH VASELINE\n\n*50% Vaseline (petroleum jelly)*\n\n*24% light oil (I used grape seed)*\n\n*15% Cromollient SCE*\n\n*10% IPM*\n\n*1% Vitamin E (optional, extends the shelf life of oils)*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWeigh out ingredients, combine, and heat. Melt and stir until melted through. Allow to cool then whip and transfer to jar. You can fancy it up by adding .5% of an essential oil or using a mix of oils for the 24% oils. Castor oil is a great oil to use in any cleansing oil or balm due to it's cleansing products. You don't want to use expensive oils because they're just getting washed off so you want to select affordable oils that have some slip so they work well when you're massaging your face. I chose light oils to lighten up the Vaseline and the IPM (Isopropyl Myristate, it's an ester) really reduces that greasy feeling.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDIY CLEANSING BALM WITH E WAX\n\n*96.5% heavier oils (I used rice brand, apricot kernel, and avocado)*\n\n*2.5% emulsifying wax*\n\n*1% Vitamin E (optional, extends the shelf life of oils)*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWeight out ingredients, combine, and heat. Again, stir until melted through and allow to cool. Whip until smooth and scrape into jar. So again feel free to do a mix of oils if you want to make it more complex. Some tea tree oil would make it a little astringent or you can use something nourishing like carrot seed essential oil.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBTW, [here](http://m.imgur.com/a/nIUN2) are some pictures of how they turned out when I made both versions the other day just for fun. I made these two just because that's what I had on hand to create a cleansing oil that was a balm consistency. I'll be ordering some more stuff soon and making a cleansing balm with more of the same ingredients as many AB balms and will update then.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDIY CLEANSING OIL RECIPE\n\n*84-89% oils (whatever you prefer)\n\n*10-15% Cromollient SCE*\n\n*1% Vitamin E (optional, extends the shelf life of oils)*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWeigh out ingredients into bottle and then shake. Done. This isn't even really a recipe, it's common knowledge but I think I'd include it for anyone who didn't know. If you want it to wash off cleanly, use 15% Cromollient. If you want some moisterizing effects use 10% Cromollient. Then adjust the oils to make sure your total is 100%. Just use this as a base and tweak it to suit your needs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDIY CLEANSING WATER\n\n*74% water (I used a mix of aloe vera juice and distilled water)\n\n*15% Cromollient SCE*\n\n*10% glycerin*\n\n*1% germaben (or other preservative of your choice at suggested amount)*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCombine ingredients, heat at 70C for 20 minutes, then bottle. The preservative gets added once it's cooling down and if you used any extracts or heat sensitive ingredients you'd add them then too. I ran out of my Simple Micellar Water and figured I'd just make my own instead of paying $10 at CVS for another bottle. This is really easy to modify too. Because you're using a cotton pad with it and it's staying on your skin, it's not a waste to add extracts and other fun stuff. You can use a hydrosol instead or in addition to the aloe vera juice. I'm almost done with my first tester batch and I'll be adding niacinamide and chamomile extract to the next one to make it more like the Simple one. If you add anything just subtract it from the water so you still total 100%. I would keep some distilled water in there to keep it from feeling sticky.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm going to end it here because this is already insanely long. Let me know in the comments if you'd like me to do another post on how I make my body oil, facial oil, PH adjusting toner mist, and brightening essence. I've made some serums but I used Shark Sauce as a base so I don't feel comfortable posting them but I'm working on a serum with MAP that I can share once I'm done tweaking it. And this week I'll be playing around with facial milks and sleeping packs so I can post those too. I just typed this all up super quick and on the spot so sorry if it's all crazy, might have to edit some.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading!\n",

I’m excited to try it as a hydrating toner. \n\nMulti-Quench feels great on the skin, I’m a sucker for glycerin and it has a nice texture. \n\nMilk Peel has a nice light texture, and is very mildly hydrating. \n\nI will update you all once I finish the bottles. \n\n____________\nMulti Acid Milk Peel: \n\n-Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Olivate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, C13-14 Isoalkane, C11-12 Isoalkane, Phytic Acid, Malic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Lactic Acid, Lipase, Protease, Squalane, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, C15-23 Alkane, Hydroxyacetophenone, Phenoxyethanol, Tricaprylin, Glyceryl Oleate, Ethylhexyl Polyhydroxystearate, Tetradecane, C13-14 Alkane, Decyl Glucoside, Maltodextrin, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sclerotium Gum, Polyglyceryl-4 Oleate, Carrageenan, Silica.\n\nHalf & Half Fluid Moisturizer: \n\n-Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Propanediol, Isopropyl Myristate, Ethylhexyl Olivate, Squalane, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Ceramide NP, Ceramide AS, Ceramide NS, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide AP, Hexapeptide-11, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Triolein, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Glyceryl Oleate, Undecane, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glyceryl Dioleate, Caprylyl Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Tridecane, Betaine, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Citric Acid, Sodium Phytate, Sodium PCA, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Lactate, PCA, Sodium Benzoate, Serine, Alanine, Palmitic Acid, Glycine, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Butylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glutamic Acid, Lysine HCl, Threonine, Arginine, Proline, Tocopherol, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20.\n\nMulti Quench Plumping Hydration Serum:\n\n-Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Polyglutamic Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ectoin, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Fruit Extract, Erythritol, Phenoxyethanol, Propanediol, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tocopherol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide.\n\n\n",

I don’t know what it is, but I just vibe with that brand so much (except their sunscreens, which fall a bit short for me personally). I say this all the time, too, because I know people get so suspicious of comments on Reddit and people being paid plants or something, but I’m absolutely not affiliated with them at all! LOL Shit, I wish they supplied me with products! \n\nAnyway, Half & Half is my new favorite thing!! I’m really loving it. I do run oily, so I can use it alone during the day and be good. Or, I layer it under a heavier moisturizer at night just to amp up hydration and moisture. \n\nThe Multi Acid Milk Peel is interesting as well. I haven’t used it as frequently yet, since I just finished a procedure, so I’ve been pretty gentle and boring lately. But I do like it for a nice exfoliator. \n\nMulti-Quench I’ve been using for awhile and it’s great as well. But I think I love Half & Half better! I’m finding that I absolutely love milky toners now.",

I bought a bottle of it cuz I was out of my Ordinary Glycolic Acid that I use on my body and also my Dr Dennis Gross Peel Pads for my face (was waiting for their sale to restock my big box. Been using these for a couple years). Now I’ve been using the Prequel on my face and body since January and plan on sticking with it. My skin looks and feels incredible. More hydrating than the DDG pads but still leaves that beautiful glow, pores are looking good, and my skin just looks nice and bouncy. AND it hasn’t irritated my rosacea (I also use Tret every other night). And for my body- no reappearance of KP on my legs or backs of arms, no booty acne, no ingrown hairs on my bikini line or underarms, knees and elbows are super soft, all of my skin texture in general is smooth af. And as long as it’s not crazy hot out, I can skip deodorant as long as I pat a bit of it under my arms. It’s light years better than the Ordinary acid\n\nAnd I was thinking about picking up these other two products. The Half and Half in particular seems like would be perfect as a daytime moisturizer in my ridiculously hot and swampy weather\n\nTheir Gleanser, Vit C, and Urea moisturizer are already at HG status for me",

This Recipe makes 200ML of gel. \n\nhopefully this is easy enough to follow and if anyone has any info they’d like to share or advice where i could improve that would be nice! :)\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n- 10 ml Isopropyl Myristate  \n- 130 ml Denatured Alcohol (94% or higher)  \n- 0.8 g Carbopol 940  \n- A few drops of Triethanolamine (TEA)  \n- 60 ml Distilled Water  \n- 2 g Estrogen Powder  \n- Dye of your choice  \n\n**Equipment:**\n\n- 2 flasks (sized to hold at least 200 ml)  \n- Dropper for measuring liquids  \n- Magnetic stirrer for liquids  \n- Stirring tool for gel  \n- Milligram scale  \n- Airless pump bottle  \n\n---\n\n**Recipe:**\n\n1. **Prepare Carbopol Mixture:**  \n   - Combine the distilled water and Carbopol 940 in one flask. Stir until well combined. Set aside.\n\n2. **Dissolve Estrogen Mixture:**  \n   - In a separate flask, combine the denatured alcohol, Isopropyl Myristate, and estrogen powder. Stir until the estrogen is fully dissolved.\n\n3. **Mix Both Solutions:**  \n   - Gradually add the Carbopol mixture to the estrogen-alcohol solution. Stir continuously until the liquids are fully combined. The mixture should appear slightly cloudy.\n\n4. **Turn Liquid into Gel:**  \n   - Add your chosen dye to the mixture for color.  \n   - Slowly add a drop of Triethanolamine (TEA) at a time, mixing thoroughly between each addition, until the desired gel consistency is achieved. The dye can serve as an indicator that the mixture is fully incorporated.\n\n5. **Final Step:**  \n   - Once you’ve reached the desired consistency and the mixture is uniform, transfer the gel into the airless pump bottle for storage and use! \n\noverall this has been working very well for me and i hope it does for you if you try. total cost was around £80 when including buying supplies like stirrers and such. cost to make more in future will be significantly lower.\n",

        "body": "Update for those looking to make this: \n\nI've made my own batch, following the guide as is. I used beakers instead of flasks, which I think Aspen (SharkFrot) meant to say in the first place.\n\nI've got enough to fill FOUR 50mL airless pump bottles almost exactly. At my current dose of 6mg E per day (I normally take pills) I've got about \\~8 -11 months worth of gel here. I'd love to link the bottles I've used but they're really inconsistent in their pumps and they don't handle thicker solutions well, which lead me to making this more of the consistency of Hand Sanitizer rather than a thicker gel. \n\n  \nThe 1st Mixture - With Carbopol and Distilled Water. You will need some sort of automatic stirring for this, be it the stir plate or a coffee frother, something. The Carbopol took about 10 minutes to dissolve, with some of the bigger chunks still left undissolved. Do your best to add the Carbopol little by little rather than dumping it in. This solution will become very \"gel\" like. You **will** know when it's done when you see it hit that right consistency.\n\n  \nThe 2nd Mixture - I used 190-Proof Denatured Alcohol, which, I believe equates to 95%. Aspen called for 94% or higher, so that's what I got. I was too afraid to get anything higher than that because the labeling starting talking about pain thinner and what not and that scared me. So 95% it is. This step was easy, everything mixed well, and the solution ended up mostly clear. This part was also the hardest because it meant dumping my E powder (the most expensive part) into alcohol and watching it immediately dissolve. I left the stir bar in this solution and added the E powder gradually.\n\n  \nThe 3rd Mixture - I fished out any of the larger chunks of Carbopol still in the 1st mixture with my stirring stick (I used generic wooden popsicle sticks). They all floated to the top so it wasn't difficult, just a little time consuming. I was worried they wouldn't dissolve so I didn't want to risk them in the final product. I GRADUALLY added the 1st Mixture into the 2nd Mixture while it was stirring. I went a lot slower than I probably had to but I didn't want to mess up. It took a few minutes to pour it all in. I let it stir for about 5 minutes, once it was done it was cloudy like Aspen mentioned. I didn't see any clumps or anything so I did the last step. \n\n  \nThe TEA - I did NOT use a dye. I was insanely anxious about all of the ingredients that I got, so I didn't want to get the wrong kind of dye or something and stain myself. Stupid fear but I just personally didn't use one. YOU ONLY NEED A FEW DROPS OF TEA. I put 1 drop of TEA in and I could visibly see the vortex from my magnetic stir bar disappear as the bottom got thicker and the top wasn't as thick. In the end I stirred manually with a popsicle stick, and I only used 2 DROPS of TEA. I would have probably opted for 3, but again my bottles don't handle thick liquid well so I stayed with 2. \n\n  \nTransferring was easy. Get yourself a funnel to make it easier, I made a bit of a mess and ended up taking probably a double dose of E today just from not wanting to waste the mess LOL. Get a funnel. Also the solution smells like Isopropyl Alcohol, but once it absorbs into the skin, which only takes a minute or so, it's actually totally scentless.\n\n  \nThanks for posting the recipe <3 And answering my DMs on Twitter c: Good luck y'all.",

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

Well a couple actually:\n\n1. Ethyl oleate, an ester (like isopropyl myristate) was used as an effective penetration enhancer in an old paper. She reverse engineered that, creating a truly novel DHT gel, with a penetration enhancer I seriously have never heard of\n\n2. She uses food colouring in the gel. Yes. Food colouring. At first I just chalked it up to Darth's dramatic flair. But on second thought, that's actually genius. It's the perfect way to ensure the gel is properly mixed. If improperly mixed, you'd end up with a streaky gel. But if the gel *looks* homogenous (colour-wise) you can be sure it's been properly mixed.\n\nBloody genius. I never even considered something like that (it goes without saying I've reintroduced her recipe to the wiki)",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

SPF 50 PA++++ sunscreen**  \n\n\n**2. 0.025% Tretinoin**   \n\n\n**3. 15-20% L-ascorbic acid vitamin C serum**   \n\n\n**4. Peptides, particularly 8% matrixyl 3000 and 2% matrixyl synthe'6, and glycolic acid.**  \n\n\nWith this said, even if we never, ever saw the light of day our entire lives, we'd still develop the signs of aging over time due. Aging is divided into intrinsic and extrinsic aging. Intrinsic aging is also known as chronological aging and it's our bodies' natural decline as the years go by.   \n\n\nExtrinsic aging is photoaging, which is aging due to sun exposure, but also includes this process called glycation. Eating sugar at least in the form of glucose and fructose causes aging because these compounds bind to collagen and inhibit the repair and replacement of both collagen and elastin. So avoiding high glycemic index foods is a good idea if you really want to avoid aging at all costs, and perhaps even carbohydrates as a whole.  \n\n\n**Sunscreen:**  \n\n\nMaking sure you're using a sunscreen that's rated PA++++ or discloses its PPD rating as 16 or higher is very important. To put it simply, UVA rays cause tanning, then sunspot hyperpigmentation, and then wrinkles. UVB rays cause sunburn. Both can cause skin cancer. The issue with using a sunscreen that is only rated for SPF is that SPF only tells you how much UVB protection the product has. It doesn't mean jack shit for how much UVA protection the product is giving you. So if you see people complaining they tanned or got freckles despite using SPF 100 or some other nice sounding high number, that's why. SPF is for UVB protection, not UVA.   \n\n\nThis is where the PA system comes in. The PA system rates a product's UVA protection, specifically its PPD. So now you're thinking what's PPD??? And we can explain this pretty easily. Let's say your bare skin starts tanning (the first sign of UVA skin damage) in 10 minutes. Now if you applied a sunscreen with a PPD of 16, your skin would then only start tanning in 160 minutes. PPD is a multiplier for your skin's UVA damage resistance. The highest PA rating is PA++++ which means a product has a PPD of 16 or more. There's no real way to tell the exact PPD in a PA++++ sunscreen, but at worst, it's PPD 16. Some sunscreens disclose their actual PPD, usually European sunscreens. But generally, finding a PA++++ sunscreen and committing to it will go a long way.   \n\n\nIf you're overwhelmed, you can consider looking into the sunscreen I personally use: Rohto Skin Aqua Super Moisture Gel Sunscreen SPF 50+ PA++++. It's stupid cheap at $11 USD for a big 140g bottle that lasts at least three months with liberal daily use. It also has an exciting photostable UV filter called tinosorb S, but even though this UV filter doesn't really degrade in UV light, it's not entirely composed of tinosorb, so don't lull yourself into thinking you can slap this on your skin and you're fine and dandy all day long in the sun. For general daily use though, it'll serve you very well. Do be aware it contains alcohol which has been shown to age the skin pretty badly, though, so you might want to take it upon yourself to research a PA++++ sunscreen without alcohol if you find that problematic.  \n\n\n On the topic of UV filters, PPD doesn't well assess the UVA1 protection of a product, as opposed to its reliability for rating UVA2 protection. Our best bet for protecting ourselves against UVA1 is by looking at the filters in sunscreen. Zinc oxide, tinosorb S, tinosorb M, Mexoryl SX, Uvinul A Plus, and avobenzone all help block UVA1 rays.  \n\n\n**Tretinoin (Retin-A):**  \n\n\nNext we have tretinoin. The mother of wrinkle prevention and reversal of present wrinkles. Tretinoin 0.025% has the same anti aging effect as tretinoin 0.1%. So don't jump the gun and assume you need the highest concentration for best results. Tretinoin does a bunch of things like increase collagen production (in fact, the only retinoid proven to do so), increase skin cell turnover from the inside out, and thicken the dermis. Basically, tretinoin cream is generally easier to use than tretinoin gel. The gel has alcohol and a difficult to spread texture. The cream is more emollient and spreads easier. However, the cream often has a fatty alcohol, stearyl alcohol, and isopropyl myristate, a full 5/5 acne trigger.   \n\n\nSo if you are worried about acne consider using tretinoin microsphere, also known as Retin-A Micro or Supatret by brand name. Microsphere is a gel format with no acne triggers and it's said to be gentler to use since it releases tretinoin into the skin over a period of time. I searched high and low for anti aging research on the microsphere version, but I came up with nothing.  Even though it's the same active ingredient, the vehicle, or inactive ingredient combination, that delivers the active ingredient can still affect results. So if you can use tretinoin cream, great, do that! If not, tretinoin microsphere is a solid option. Microsphere comes in 0.04%, 0.08%, and 0.1% formulations.   \n\n\nWhen using tretinoin, expect a three month transition period which is what we call retinization. Dehydration, dryness, flaking, peeling skin, irritation, even burning are common. This side effects tend to be most common in people who make one or more of the following mistakes: not applying tretinoin 20 minutes after applying moisturizer, not applying petrolatum like Vaseline immediately after applying tretinoin, and/or using tretinoin way too frequently too soon. To be super safe, I recommend for people to use tretinoin once a week for two weeks, twice a week for two weeks, three times a week for two weeks, and so on. If you experience intolerable side effects, go down one step and try again.  \n\n\n**Vitamin C:**  \n\n\nVitamin C serums are great for skin brightening, addressing PIH, but also increasing collagen production over a long period of time. I can only confirm that the latter effect occurs with 15-20% L-ascorbic acid vitamin C. And from here on out, when I talk about vitamin C, I'm talking about L-ascorbic acid.   \n\n\nThe problem is that L-ascorbic acid oxidizes and becomes useless with continued exposure to air and light. I keep my own serum in my fridge. Some people decant their vitamin C serums into multiple bottles so portions of the product are sealed off from the air for weeks or months, extending the longevity of the product. If your vitamin C serum is yellow, orange, or brown, it's time to get a new vitamin C serum. The issue is that vitamin C serums need a pH of 3.5 or lower to be effective. Vitamin C is a pH dependent active so it needs a 20 minute wait time after application before applying any other skincare products. Ideally, the vitamin C serum is formulated with vitamin E and ferulic acid. These two additives both help stabilize the vitamin C and even make it more effective.   \n\n\nVitamin C is an antioxidant and it has photoprotective effects. By no means does it replace sunscreen, but it's a sunscreen booster in a sense. That's why it's generally recommended to apply vitamin C during the day. You might not want to apply vitamin C daily though; vitamin C has a half life of roughly four days in the skin, so applying it daily might be overkill. I still apply it daily for peace of mind though. Oh and I use and recommend Timeless 20% Vitamin C + E and Ferulic Acid Serum, the formulation by all accounts is correct. They even have a permanent $5 off coupon (HF5OFF) and free shipping in the US, no minimum order. The great thing is that their vitamin C is made to order, so you get as fresh of a product as possible.   \n\n\nDon't buy vitamin C from third party retailers. The product you receive already has had its timer ticking for who knows how long on a retailer's warehouse shelf. For vitamin C, order from the manufacturer for best product longevity.  \n\n\n**Peptides:**  \n\n\nThere's so many peptides out there. I'm most knowledgeable about the matrixyl family. Matrixyl 3000 is basically matrixyl but with additives to help prevent glycation aging. Matrixyl syntheis a different peptide known more for collagen production. You're not missing out on anything by not having a product with the original matrixyl since it's already in matrixyl 3000. Peptide research isn't that robust, but the matrixyl studies I've gone over are really promising.   \n\n\nFull disclaimer that those studies have been sponsored by parties with a financial stake in matrixyl, but conflict of interest does not necessarily mean bad science. Anyway, 8% matrixyl Peptides only work if they get to living skin cells in the dermis. I'm personally discouraged by the efficacy of incorporating peptide products in a routine. Microneedling creates channels to the dermis, but that sort of needle length is used infrequently, around a monthly basis. Applying peptide products would be effective after microneedling, peptides on their own do not produce actual results if they only interact with the living skin cells on a monthly basis. Regardless, for people who microneedle, applying peptide products afterwards wouldn't hurt. I again recommend Timeless' matrixyl serums, despite their lack of delivery system technology in their formulation.  \n\n\n**Glycolic Acid:**  \n\n\nAnd now we have glycolic acid. 20% has shown itself to increase collagen production, but higher strength peels have been used and can be found on Makeup Artist's Choice's website.  Don't use chemical peels for at least 72 hours since last applying tretinoin and don't apply tretinoin for at least  72 hours after the chemical peel. Waiting longer is never a bad idea. I'm not sure about the anti aging effects for long term lower glycolic acid use, but I don't use this ingredient personally.   \n\n\n**Skincare Surgeries:**  \n\n\nThere's also dermatologist procedures you can consider like using Botox to prevent dynamic wrinkles, such as crow's feet and forehead lines. Microneedling stimulates collagen production and is also known as collagen induction therapy. Injectables like collagen and Sculptra stimulate the body to produce collagen, but I'm not sure how effective those are. Chemical peels treat fine lines and increase collagen production as well, at least glycolic acid in a concentration of or higher than 20%. I generally recommend against spending so much money on professional treatments, as they are mostly temporary but I'm just including these things to be comprehensive.",

I mean, I could google every single ingredient in the list, but they don't separate out which are the active ingredients, and I don't have time to look each one up. Do you happen to know from prior research? Does it contain any of the more troublesome ingredients like oxybenzone or octinoxate? It's definitely chemical-based...I'm not totally opposed to that, but it entirely depends on which chemicals they are. Also, it appears to contain parabens...just FYI. \n\nStill on the hunt for my HG sunscreen...for face OR body...I know that they really have to have zinc to be protective enough, but it's so hard to not look like Casper if it has zinc. :/",

I'm desperate, so here goes.\n  \nSo here's the deal- I've had a rash for 5 years now. When it started it was just a tiny patch (about the size of a quarter on left hip, right where your jeans hit the front of your hip bone.) Then about 3 months pass, it's now on my right hip. Then the two slowly join. This lasts for oh, idk, another 2 years? **I went to a dermatologist and he cut a slice off and it came back with no growth.** Then I moved and lost health insurance. Spent the next 2 years with it slowly growing. July of last year (2014) it started to get REALLY BAD^bad^bad. It was on both boobs, side boob, hips, tops of buttcheeks. (It has only ever been in those places, plus my arms and back. No legs, hands, feet, etc ever) I had to 100% stop wearing bras, jeans, pants, shorts, tank tops. I barely could wear anything. I wore pajamas whenever I was home and could barely go to work anymore.  \n  \n[PICS](http://imgur.com/a/yUEr5) Probably NSFW, tho I did cover my nipples  \n  \nI moved again in fall 2014, stopped working because I couldn't put on clothes, got health insurance (thanks, Obama- seriously), and saw another dermatologist for 6 months. He was convinced it was **scabies**. (It wasn't.) Then he was convinced if we **froze the sores** it would kill them and I'd be free. *That shit hurts.* He finally gave up and sent me to an allergist.  \n  \nThis is about February or maybe March 2015 now. First visit she gives me steroids and the prick test on my back for trees, molds, animals, etc. I come up with **34 positive allergies.** Then, **she tells me I have a pressure allergy** and if I avoid all pressure inducing clothing, I should be ok. She also gives me allergy meds, sinus spray, and has me start allergy immunotherapy shots.  So no bras, underwear, tank tops, pajama bottoms with elastic, no jeans, no tennis shoes. Nothing. Loose, formless dresses and sandals.  \n  \nSince I'm still typing you can guess that didn't work. Still continued to break out all over. Saw a different, more experienced allergist. He still has no idea. Tells me there is no way it is pressure allergy, so good luck and that some patients can't find their cause for 5-10 years. I told him it's already been 5 and I am out of ideas. I see him 3 more times (each time having the same conversation- and he wouldn't even LOOK at my rash because it's on my boobs and hips and I can't wear bras/underwear without making the rash worse. I BEG him to please do a fabric patch test on my back to see if I am allergic to fabric. Every time I put on a polyester dress, I would break out like crazy. (I only wear 100% cotton now, but I'm still breaking out)   \n  \nHe finally does it and it was the worst weekend of my life. 80 samples were applied to my back and I broke out everywhere with one of the worst rashes I've ever had- but I couldn't apply steroids, take any steroids or  allergy meds... nothing. I sat there naked and drunk in front of the air conditioner and played WoW the whole weekend.   \n  \n**5 days later and I have 33 positive allergies, which grand totals 67 known allergies so far** Chemicals, medicine, metals, natural substances. I try asking what they are and they give me [data sheets](http://www.chemotechnique.se/products/national-series/north-american-80-comprehensive-series/) from the company that provides the allergen samples and tells me to Google it. I have Googled it.  \n\nI THINK it is propylene glycol, triethanolamine, and nickel. But I'm allergic to 30 more things and these 3 are damn near impossible to cut out of your life to test if it even is one or more of them that is causing the rash.  \n  \nBut the kicker? **I DON'T BREAK OUT AT THE SITE OF CONTACT.** During the patch test, within 2 hours my entire torso was covered again. I thought for sure when they took the patch off I would be scarred for life from all the hives under it, but there were just minor (level 1 and level 2) reactions to the allergens. Nothing else was different about that weekend with the patch test except the patches themselves.  \n  \nMy doctor refuses to do a patch a week to see when my rash flares up, so my question is: How to I pick which of the 33 chemicals to start with? A ton of them are in \"families\" so would I cut that whole family out at once? They are unable to answer basic questions about the chemicals themselves and just tell me to Google it.  \n  \n**My current state: I take Hydroxyzine every night, use steroid cream every day, shower 2x day using Yardley's sensitive skin soap, only wear 100% cotton dresses. No bra, no underwear, no socks. I don't work. I can't work out in public, or even in clothes. I have not had any 100% clear days for over 3 years. They itch like crazy, bleed, and go from nothing to scab without me even touching it.

        "body": "So, I've had some crazy allergy/immune system problems and what I've learned is that an allergist will find allergies, a dermatologist will find skin problems, an immunologist will find immune problems, and so on. Your allergist isn't the best person to have look for immune problems. An infectious disease specialist isn't looking for neurological problems. Get my meaning? \n\nI'm a perfect world, they'd communicate and work together, but that rarely happens. You kind of have to be your own health care coordinator. I think, if the allergist isn't helping (and it doesn't sound like they're providing a whole heap of help in general), then you should consider seeing another specialist. You rash may have nothing to do with your allergies. You might have to see a gp first in order to get referred to a specialist, for insurance reasons, but you'll need to check your policy to know for sure. \n\n\nA few things that jump out at me, though. You might want to check out dermatitis herpetiformis (which is a skin rash peopleomes in all kinds of different flavours) that is associated with celiac disease. Its important to note you need a *very* particular biopsy to diagnose this. You may or may not test positive for celiac through blood tests and intestinal biopsies may be negative. The reason I think DH is worth investigating is because you always get the rash on the same area, it's not affected by steroids or typical rash treatments, and it's incredibly itchy. The biopsy is tricky - they need to biopsy right beside an active lesion, not the lesion themselves. Good news, totally treatable with gluten free diet and, in extreme cases, leprosy meds which relieve symptoms quickly.  One way you can kind of see if this might be your problem is to either eat a lot of iodine or cut out iodine for a short period and see if it affects the rash. While exposed to gluten, a lot of people with DH have flares when they consume iodine. Weirdly enough, iodine stops being a problem when they're gluten free. \n\nBut it could totally be an allergy (of you can, find a new doc willing to explain how to avoid those allergens and answer your questions).  You should actually cut out *all* of your supposed allergies, and then work backwards. So, assume cutting everything cures your rash after a month. Then, you can slowly expose yourself to a new allergen, one at a time, and wait a while. The cause will trigger a rash, and you'll know what you have to avoid (we can test positive as allergic to things that don't cause noticeable symptoms, or aren't bothersome. Just because you tested positive doesn't mean you need to avoid it for life). You also want to Google everything you're allergic to and look for cross-reactive allergens. This is when you're allergic to something, say tree pollen, but also react to something unrelated, like a fruit, because both of the allergens are similar. These are a problem for a lot of people, and they go unnoticed because you may be tested for a common tree but not an uncommon fruit you happen to eat all the time.\n\n\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that an autoimmune disease or something else screwy can totally mess up your allergy test. The fact that your body is constantly breaking out could lead to false positives, for example. Or even false negatives. \n\n\nSo, tldr: go see another doctor (not necessarily another allergist), and let them approach the issue from their expertise. You might want to see your gp, an immunologist, a dermatologist, etc. Just because you have allergies doesn't mean the rash is caused by allergies, but your allergist won't look for anything else.",

If you take benadryl for a few days and it helps, then you probably have an allergy. Cut glutton for a week, cut wheat for a week (check your booze of choice for those too) then just cycle through other things in your diet (dairy, legumes, sea food). Keeping a food diary is a good idea. Other random  tips I have, I really like aveeno, both the lotion and the body wash, it has oatmeal which is very calming for your skin. Also make sure your moisturizing enough. With as many showers as your taking your skin might be more sensitive without the protective layer of oil. You might also have your water tested to see if you have hard water. Think about other things that changed when you first started breaking out. Did you end up crappy ac and your sweating all the time now? Did you get a new mattress/sheets? How often do you change your sheets? You might have your bed checked for mites/bed bugs. I had a friend who got terrible rashes from dust mites. That's enough ranting for now I think, but let me know if you have any questions, I'll answer what I can, and good luck.",

The photo of my hair was my hair today (before I washed it) I was on day 5 of my wash & go using all of the top row products. That hair had seen a lot of sweat, humidity, & was in a bun & still looked great (with the exception of wonky stretched bits).\n\nEverything shown here has no PROVEN Malassezia triggers but obviously experiences vary on an individual basis. Some ingredients may still not work for you even though they’re not technically feeding the malassezia. I’ve had great experiences with all of these which is why I’m including them! I didn’t include the Redken Exteme Conditioner because it has an Ester (Isopropyl myristate) but, I’m willing to let it slide for myself since I’m mostly in remission & it is a rinse out product. I didn’t want to lead you guys astray though so I left it out! \n\nI only use my ketoconazole shampoo about once a month because I’m mostly clear now after a year. When I was first diagnosed I washed with medicated shampoo every 3 days for 3 months. I still wash my hair anywhere from every 4 days to every week though. When I use the medicated shampoo now I mix half of my regular shampoo into it so it’s not as drying!\n\nI also would not recommend the dark blue Redken Extreme bottle shown here if your hair is not high porosity, it does have a lot of protein. I love them but my hair also loves protein. The Redken Extreme Length SHAMPOO (not shampoo) has less protein & is also safe but I’ve never used it so I don’t feel comfortable including it.\n\nI also exclusively dry my hair with a hooded dryer or a hand dryer—we are NOT letting our hair air dry if we have seb. derm. I promise you’ll see a huge difference even if that’s the only thing you change in your routine.",

I may or may not have been keeping a weather eye on upcoming SPF releases ever since Director Ahn In-Sook mentioned in passing in a video that many cosmeceutical brands have either put a stopper on releasing new sunscreens or postponed the release of those awaiting completion to better the formula and ensure they're up to snuff, thus there will be a slew of SPF releases come March. ~~Heaven forfend we suffer the wrath of deadly solar lasers cuz finding The One is nothing short of a bluidy struggle.~~\n\nWhat I've noted in these new releases was a combination of robust formulas and new filters. *Exciting!* I've already translated the INCI lists and entered them into Incidecoder & Cosdna.

The About Me Be Clean seems to be alcohol and fragrance-free (non sure if rosemary leaf oil is an essential oil and fragrant??). I would probably go with the Innifree though because I prefer alcohol in my sunscreen, otherwise they are too too dewy and greasy looking, and the ingredient list is rather simple. If only it didn't have fragrance, but I can compromise with that. The Dr. G has too many unnecessary ingredients and many comedogenic ingredients like myristic acid, so I would stay away from it.",

Check out the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/csfm1l/guide_ceramides_in_skin_care_a_scam_ceramide/) from AsianBeauty sub, and the [other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/cst06i/guide_ceramides_in_skin_care_a_scam_ceramide/) from scacjdiscussion sub for other people's knowledge-bombs in the comment sections!\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHi again, AB!! So I came across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/) talking about how most companies that claim to have ceramides actually use 2 ceramide \"soups\" basically, of the purpoted \"ideal\" ratio of ceramides/fatty acids, of which contain actually very, very little ceramides. Basically, it's for marketing and such a low % won't really do much. But the research for actually using an efficient amount of ceramides is apparently ***very*** good for barrier repair.\n\nSO I was severely disappoinT in my beloved CeraVe and other things. HOWEVER, I came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/celc5y/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu3j2mw/?context=3) conversation between the OP of that post and someone else:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Yes, the technology behind Atopalm is the same behind Zerafite, which Dr. Baumann believes in and sells through her practice. The research and invention originally came out of Korea, so I am not surprised Korean brands are using it.**  \n>  \n>\\-  [u/nocloudstoday](https://www.reddit.com/user/nocloudstoday/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhaaat???? Ceramides for skincare was **invented in Korea**?? Idk, should I be surprised ?\n\nAnd:\n\n>**Neopharm & Amorepacific have their own patented, lab-made ceramides that have been heavily researched.**  \n>  \n>\\- u/[royalsincognito](https://www.reddit.com/user/royalsincognito/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInteresting! I'm able to read some Korean so I looked into this on Korean sites + Korean reviews.\n\nSo it looks like [**Neopharm**](http://www.neopharm.co.kr/en/brand/brand_atopalm.do) owns these brands: **Atopalm, RealBarrier, Zeroid, Derma:B.** And [**Amore Pacific** owns many brands](https://www.apgroup.com/int/en/brands.html), but I have only seen \"ceramide\" products so far in these brands: **Illiyoon, Aestura & Mamonde.**\n\nI was like, why does this sound familiar? Then I realized that I've seen them ranked very high on Hwahae (Korean beauty review & ranking app) many times before!\n\nNeopharm's ceramide technology is called **\"MLE\"** and Amore Pacific's is **Ceramide PC-102 and PC-104.**\n\nPersonally, I like the look of ZEROID & AESTURA, because their products don't seem to contain fragrance. *(Fragrance can be a trigger for very, very sensitive skin types, but it seems the majority of people tolerate it pretty well in their skincare? However, I have seen derms say it can become problematic the longer you use it. YMMV. For what it's worth, I read many reviews from sensitive-skinned folks saying the fragranced ones never bothered their skin & they love it. Many posted pictures of putting the creams on their babies.)* But they're super hard to find online as of now!\n\nFrom all the reviews I'm reading, these brands and Illiyoon ato products are what is recommended by Korean dermatologists and skin care clinics. I read that some derms recommend these specifically for the ceramides. (In Korea, products for people with skin conditions like eczema and such are called \"ato\" products, assuming short for \"atopic\".)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(eBay links are from my trusted eBay sellers/ones I bought from before)\n\nAll of these have really good ratings due to being in the TOP 100 for their respective categories. They all use the patented ceramides.\n\n* [**RealBarrier's Extreme Cream**](http://www.atopalmglobal.com/product/proDetail.asp?brand=3&cate=332&Pcate=217&Mcate=) \\#3 Top Creams (4.11/5 out of 6,153 Reviews) **fragranced**  [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/REAL-BARRIER-Extreme-Cream-50ml-BEST-Korea-Cosmetic/312419244657?epid=1740451843&hash=item48bda35a71:g:Kp4AAOSwoEFcM~bo)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Aestura Ato Barrier Cream**](https://www.aestura.com/web/product/view.do?prdSeq=1004)  \\#6 Top Creams (4.23/5 out of 2,524 Reviews)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Mamonde's Moisture Ceramide Intense Cream**](https://www.mamonde.com/int/en/product/ceramide-intense-cream.html) \\#15 Top Creams (3.94/5 out of 2,840 Reviews) **fragranced**    [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/MAMONDE-Ceramide-Intense-Cream-50ml/392296451084?epid=8032468017&hash=item5b56b0cc0c%3Ag%3A9wMAAOSwMMNc2mEr&LH_BIN=1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Zeroid's Intensive Cream**](http://www.zeroid.com/main/contents.asp?step1=0&step2=0&Pcate=280&Mcate=281) (4.21/5 out of 1,539 Reviews)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Zeroid's Soothing Cream** (4.12/5 out of 1,768 Reviews)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Zeroid's Richenic Cream Urea 5%**](http://www.zeroid.com/main/contents.asp?step1=0&step2=0&Pcate=280&Mcate=284) **-** not many reviews as this is new, but FANTASTIC ingredients.

Some wondered if it's the ceramide encapsulation technology. A few people were bothered by the \"scrubby bits\" when using it on their face. Cream is apparently slightly heavier than lotion, but still great absorbency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Derma:B Daily Moisture Body Lotion**](http://www.dermab.com/main/contents.asp?Mcate=188&Pcate=12) (4.27/5 out of 2,075 Reviews)  **fragranced**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the Body section, both [Illiyoon](http://www.apgroup.com/int/en/brands/illiyoon.html) and [B:Derma](http://www.dermab.com/main/) are in the Top 10.\n\nWhile Illiyoon's ceramide ato lotion & cream are regarded as **body moisturizers**, lots of people commented that they use it on their **face** also. So, good choice for those of us whose budgets may not allow the more pricier options.\n\nOilier/combo skin types did not like to use it on their face, while the dry & sensitive-skinned folks loved them. No mention of the lotion not working under makeup. I came across 1 review though saying that they experienced pilling when they used the cream under makeup.\n\nMany people emphasized that they like how light and non-greasy these feel, yet very moisturizing. Some oily types said it felt too heavy. Some said during the summer, they felt it doesn't absorb as well (keep in mind that Korea is EXTREMELY humid during the summer though. Like, you would be drenched in sweat as soon as you stepped out of the shower -\\_- and you'd just be all sweaty and nasty alllllllllllllllll summer it was dISCUSTING) but they still agreed with other reviewers saying it absorbed well during colder months (it gets really cold & snowy in Korea during winter).\n\nRave reviews up & down from dry skinned folks. Some drier skinned folks said it's not enough for winter, however. Illiyoon often goes on sale in Korea and people like that they get can it for like, half off. 1 or 2 reviews saying they had some sort of an allergic reaction. As always, YMMV.\n\nI hope this helps some of you!\n\nYou don't have to read the below info, but I thought it may be helpful for those of you with damaged skin barriers. My skin used to be severely damaged too so I feel your struggle. T-T\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**MORE ON FRAGRANCE** [**FROM LAB MUFFIN BEAUTY SCIENCE**](https://labmuffin.com/mythbusting-vitamin-c-serums-bad/)**:**\n\n>On the flip side to the little rant I had above: **if you aren’t sensitive to fragrance, there’s no compelling reason to avoid it**. There’s a lot in the dermatological literature on fragrance, but that’s because people who go to the trouble of seeing a dermatologist are those who have serious skin issues. It’s estimated that less than 5% of the population will have allergic reactions to fragrance on their skin. It’s great that there are more fragrance-free products available for people with sensitive skin, but for the rest of us, fragrance isn’t an issue (damage from [“invisible inflammation” from fragrance](http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/sensitive-skin/_/why-fragrance-free-products-are-best-for-everyone) isn’t supported by any convincing evidence).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BARRIER REPAIR SUPERSTAR? UREA:**\n\nI'm particularly impressed by Zeroid's new [5% urea cream](http://www.zeroid.com/main/contents.asp?step1=0&step2=0&Pcate=280&Mcate=284). It also has panthenol, centella, madecassoside, allantoin, bisabolol and physosterols.\n\nNow, there's SO much mumbo jumbo about efficient skincare, but so much of it is marketing bullshit and there are actually **very few** ingredients (compared to everything else out there) that are scientifically proven to REALLY WORK on our skin. As OP mentions in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu354ub/?context=3) thread, urea is a severely underrated ingredient:\n\n>The one thing that comes to mind, actually, is **urea**. **Of all of the ingredients researched for barrier repair, urea probably has the most consistent and longest track record for repairing the barrier.** You see it a lot in pharmacies in Europe. It's not sexy, but it's often very effective - for very impaired skin suffering from everything from eczema and psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. I'd recommend trying a 5% cream and seeing how that works for you. The bad news is that there are not a lot of options on the US market (which is not bad news if you happen to be somewhere else!).\n\nUrea is a natural moisturizing factor (NMF) that exist naturally on our skin, it's a mild exfoliator in high concentrations, and it's also a penetration enhancer, meaning that it's also used to deliver actives into the skin better. Now, there are a lot of other penetration enhancers, used both in medicine and the beauty industry, such as dimethyl isosorbide (DMI),  isopropyl myristate, propylene glycols/ethoxydiglycol, emu oil/MCTs (fractionated coconut oil or caprylic/capric triglyceride)/other oils, oleic acid (a component in many oils), etc.\n\nBut AFAIK, the reason a lot of them work is because they disrupt the skin barrier long enough to deliver the actives (except perhaps, some oils? Oleic acid has been shown to be disruptive tho. Apparently there are studies that show [emu oil](https://gardenofwisdom.com/products/emu-oil) is able to penetrate very deeply into the skin bc of the tiny-ness of the molecules or some shit. Which is why it's used with herbs/medicine a lot). I'm not a derm or a chemist, but from what I've been reading from the [chemistscorner.com](https://chemistscorner.com) forum, **this isn't always a good thing**. But I have not come across anything that says urea may be damaging. Quite the opposite.\n\n(Mineral oil is also another penetration enhancer, and a wonderful, stable moisturizer that will not go rancid like plant oils do **-** [**squalene on your skin oxidizing leads to acne**](https://simpleskincarescience.com/squalene-squalane-oil-review-acne/)**,** also [confirmed by Lab Muffin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKjKDj9plaI) \\- coming in close to petrolatum for reducing Trans Epidermal Water Loss. And petrolatum is pretty much irrefutably, scientifically proven to be the #1ingredient in reducing TEWL. Mineral oil feels quite heavy, but it's used a lot as it doesn't have too many other chemicals in it to cause skin reactions.)\n\nFor people with eczema who use colloidal oatmeal creams to soothe skin, make sure the active concentration is 1% or higher, not just claimed \"so and so lotion with natural oatmeal to reduce itching!\", because\n\n>[in order to be listed as an active ingredient, it must be included in a formula at a minimum 0.007 percent concentration, or 0.003 percent minimum concentration if combined with mineral oil.](https://www.mydadthechemist.com/reviews/best-oatmeal-eczema-lotions/)\n\n\\^I'm not 100% sure what this means, but I just know that this is probably bc mineral oil's ability to help things penetrate.\n\n**Don't confuse** urea with diazolidinyl urea and imidazolidinyl urea btw, which are preservatives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Some moisturizers with urea:**\n\n(I will list 10% ones here, but I personally don't go above 5% because of the exfoliating effects of urea for my face. It may be mild at 10% & below, but I still don't want to risk it as I use a lot of other actives and have problematic skin. But for those who WANT exfoliation and don't get along with AHAs, it may be another option.)\n\nI know Hadalabo Premium lotion is mentioned a lot, but 3% urea is not going to perform as well as concentrations above that (chemistscorner forums). I'm not entirely sure the difference between [Hydroxyethyl Urea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethyl-urea) and regular urea is, but some say it's the same thing just different name and some say it functions more as a humectant rather than being skin-identical. Idk. But if you count it, then there are more options, like [Gold Bond Men's Essentials](https://www.target.com/p/gold-bond-men-s-essentials-hand-face-and-body-lotions-14-5oz/-/A-14507966), or the [Strength & Resilience Lotion](https://www.target.com/p/gold-bond-strength-and-resilienc-hand-and-body-lotions-13oz/-/A-16453690) and [Unscented Diabetic Lotion](https://www.target.com/p/unscented-gold-bond-diabetic-hand-and-body-lotions-13oz/-/A-15025375) (EDIT: AND [Cetaphil Daily Hydrating Lotion for face](https://www.target.com/p/cetaphil-moisturizing-lotion-unscented-16oz/-/A-10300852)) for fragrance-free options.\n\n[Triderma Eczema Fast Healing Face % Body Cream](https://www.walmart.com/ip/TriDerma-MD-Eczema-Fast-Healing-Face-and-Body-Lotion-with-Bonus-Tube-4-2-oz/21656991)\\- not sure %, but it looks pretty high.

I never really had peeling or any irritation for that matter. \n\nI read up on this and found some people in this sub who switched and found success. From someone who is not a professional, I believe the isopropyl myristate in tretinoin cream contributes to the clogging that causes breakouts. \n\nI bought 0.1% gel online about 2 months ago, and I’ve been using it for about a month and a half. I definitely peel a LOT (new territory I’m having to learn now), and I’m still in that beginning period of it, but man. My skin has never been so clear. I get little bumps around the mouth area, as it’s more delicate and frankly is the most stubborn for me, but they go away quickly and haven’t been leaving PIEs, which all my acne used to do. An important detail that helps me realize it’s purging is that these bumps have not been bright red. My old acne always looked mean, but these bumps are just lil guys who don’t even get red. \n\nI’m still dealing with some scarring from before, and some of the few remaining PIEs are nearly gone. \n\nThis feels so freeing. Gel can be more irritating for sure, and the application process itself does feel not very fun lol. Like my skin feels so dry and tight when I put it on, as I don’t like to buffer. But it’s worth it and it gets moisturized after a bit anyway\n\n——————\n\nSomething important I will note, though, is that this is not a 100% fix to my problems. It’s so easy to think your insecurities will go away when your skin clears up. I do feel better about my appearance, but I still have off days and I still cling to other parts I don’t like about myself. So make the switch if you still get breakouts, but don’t fall for the idea that your problems will go away once you FINALLY achieve clear skin",

    "body": "I got bored so I wrote everything I've learned since I was ever interested in perfumery, since the moment I asked myself \"I wonder if I could make my own perfume!\" This is based off the order of questions I've asked or asked myself when I started pursuing. This might (keyword, might) prevent some of the repetitive questions asked on here and it might save some people some time. What Im about to write sure would've saved me some time. If you are experienced, please read the very bottom of this before stomping me please xD\n\n*This is for people who are thinking about the simple notion of perfumery and for those who are a  bit into it already, the stage before studying and experimenting.*\n\n**Essential Oils and Fragrance Oils**\n\nIf you just bought some roll on perfumes and are asking yourself \"Maybe I could learn to make something like this!\", read this.\n\n* Essential oils- Unless you're looking for natural perfumes and aromatherapy, don't buy an essential oil kit. Especially not from amazon. 100% pure essential oil does not mean it's real essential oils. Besides, essential oils are probably not what you're looking for if you got an oil based roll on from Etsy or an indie perfume house. They are probably synthetic, mixes of aroma chemicals and maybe there's an EO or two in there. Or it could be made with fragrance oils. Keep reading, I'll get to that. There are certainly reasons to make essential oil perfumes, but not if you want anything complex. Besides, mixing too many essential oils will become \"mud\". There are too many scent molecules that make an EO to hope that they will just work together and smell good with other EO's. There are ways to mix essential oils and there are natural perfumery courses. If this is what you want, seek trusted essential oil sellers like doTerra and such.\n   * If you simply looked up \"how to make your own perfume\" you will probably end up with articles about essential oil blends, telling you to mix 20 drops of bergamot with 10 drops of lavender, etc etc. Stop there, please. Don't use drops to measure. All perfumery is done with weight measurements and a scale. These blends aren't truly perfumery as you may think or will lead you to the objective you have in mind. Besides, this method is probably unsafe for the skin, especially if you're trying to use cinnamon.\n* Fragrance oils- Also probably not your objective. Fragrance oils are synthetic blends meant mostly for soap, candles, etc, but not really for perfumery. Mixing fragrance oils will likely turn up more muddy or just as muddy as mixing essential oils. Some people use fragrance oils to make \"perfumes\" but it does not really encourage your own creativity, nor does it really allow for your creativity. I don't encourage this, but I will share the answers I've obtained about fragrance oils in terms of \"perfumery\". It's easy and cheap to make, but kinda soulless and definitely not as good as real perfume. First of all, buy fragrance oils from sites that give you an IFRA safety doc on the shop page of that specific fragrance oils. Please make sure it has one to avoid risks on your skin. Then, look for category 4 of IFRA safety. That is the safe % of fragrance oil you can put in a finished product with \"perfume\" intentions. If it says 33% and you're making a 10g (10ml bottle, but use grams) roll-on, put 3.3g of fragrance oil and 6.7g of fractionated coconut oil (or other carrier).\n\n**Truly Starting**\n\nOk.... I wanna do more authentic/complex perfumes, so where do I actually start? I will try to give you my best advice that was given to me from others. Firstly, ask yourself if you are willing to learn. It's not something you can pick up and create something amazing in a week. It's going to take time, experimentation, and some failures. Oh, and there is some math (not too hard, trust me. Plus we have everyone on this subreddit to help out). Secondly, are you willing to spend... uhh... moderately... for this hobby? Surely people may not spend as much as I did/am depending on how they start out, and I encourage people who have experience to share how they started out and learned, but I've spent about $900 dollars already... Granted about $550 was for a learning course. The rest was between a materials kit, solvents, pipettes, a scale, bottles, and scent strips.\n\n* Seek kits/materials from Perfumer's Apprentice/creatingperfumes if you're from NA. For UK, the only one I know about is Pellwall. I'm sure replies here or in other posts of this reddit will give you more good sources. Personally, I bought the Scenthusiasm materials kit from Perfumer's Apprentice.\n* You could start with a great range of materials, just a few, or start from a certain fragrance category. Whatever you do, it might be best to get and learn the most common materials and also try to focus on one fragrance category, even if you get an extensive kit so you don't spread your knowledge out too thin. Better to master one, then some than try all at once as far as everyone's told me about perfumery.\n* You're gonna need some bottles, pipettes, blotters/scent test strips, and a scale. Look for amber  boston rounds. I personally use 15mL boston rounds with polycone liner caps. As for atomizers for spray perfumes and roll on bottles/smaller boston round bottles for oil based perfumes, that depends on the size of your final products and preferences. Use plastic pipettes, not glass. You can get pipettes and blotters rather cheap in bulk. Bottles are a bit more expensive in bulk. I found a 144pc, 15ml pack for $60 which isnt too bad. As for a scale, that also depends on your budget, but get one that's 0.001 (3 decimal spaces, not just 2). I have a 100g capacity 0.001 scale and it does its job. If you're worried about accuracy, you'll have to pay more. Pocket scales like mine are around $20-30. Also, get some small labels. Gotta know what's in your bottles. I got all this stuff from amazon\n   * I use a software called Evernote (free for one device) to note all my dilutions in a -very- organized fashion. I also record everything there, up to and including the weight of my bottles for each material that's in them. Idk if that's too intensive but Imma continue doing it just in case I miss something. Anyway, a note app is good for recording what you think about every material's scent, ideas, dilutions, etc.\n* Seek information/learning from reliable/decent sources. [Basenotes.com](https://Basenotes.com) and this subreddit has helped me tremendously, but I don't know a lot of sources tbh, and if the comments could help out with that, that would be great. As for youtubers, BK Scents and Sam Macer are good as well as Sarah McCartney. I could also use help extending this list.\n* Learning by yourself probably isn't easy, but there are some organized courses. A lot of them are expensive. Scenthusiasm's (400-620GBP) is pretty tame compared to some others which are upward of 2,000 euros... I completely understand going the route of being self taught but I don't have any tips for that. If someone does, please feel free to share.\n\n**Oil based perfumes vs Alcohol Based Perfumes**\n\nI am likely to still struggle with this eventually, but I will tell you what I know. Short answer: Alcohol based perfumes is such an easier route. You will have so much fewer questions and more people to answer them, as per my experience. Let me tell you what I know about them though. If I'm wrong, you disagree, or I'm missing details, feel free to add.\n\n* Oil based perfumes- This stuff you don't spray. This usually comes in the format of roll-on bottles or amber bottles where you gotta find something to dip in it and apply to your skin.\n   * If you're interested in this, you will likely be working mostly with IPM. IPM (Isopropyl Myristate) is a solvent/diluent. It is mostly used in oil based perfumes. It holds the scent down and it makes the perfume more intimate. You likely won't be leaving a trail as you walk by someone and mostly only you can smell it. You could also mix IPM and other fixed oils, such as fractionated coconut oil. Pros: more intimate, doesn't dry skin and aren't (as? at all?) photosensitive like alcohol perfumes, and IPM is cheaper to get. Cons: more intimate, not as volatile, may last generally longer, IPM might not dissolve some things as easily as DPG or Alcohol. (I need someone to let me know if IPM and DPG can be mixed and if IPM and alcohol can be mixed \\*\\*.)\n      * Another con?: It's hard to find certain materials, especially on perfumer's apprentice, that aren't prediluted in alcohol. I'm not sure if this can be used in oil based perfumes or not, with IPM involved. Certainly not with fractionated coconut oil.\n      * \\*\\*Edit: IPM and DPG are miscible. TEC can also be used for oil based perfumes. All three of those are miscible with alcohol. However, only TEC and IPM of these three can mix with fixed oils, such as fractionated coconut oil. Turns out, you can make a fragrance raw and dilute it to desired concentration with IPM, DPG, or TEC and just leave it as is, counting as an 'oil based perfume'. You do not need to cap it off with fractionated coconut oil. This allows for what I'm about to say next: it is not particularly practiced from what I've read and heard, but your end result is still an \"oil based\" perfume if you must use a material pre-diluted in alcohol in your blend. Just make it a huge point to remember and specify for yourself and others that there is some alcohol content in it. \n* Alcohol based perfumes- The stuff you spray. Can be pretty much be used with all solvents/diluents besides those that are fixed oils. Most things dissolve in alcohol. Alcohol based perfumes are more volatile and you will likely smell it if a wearer passes by you. I think you can pursue alcohol based perfumes with a bit more confidence, as answers are much more easily accessible. Pros: high volatility, easier to use/make, less problems in more senses than one. Cons: alcohol is more expensive, some countries you need a permit/license, detectable to others (and that's bad if you don't want any attention)\n\n**Math and Dilutions**\n\nFirst of all, it's not recommended to predilute anything really unless it's super strong or if you need to use a lot less of a material in a formula. However, my scenthusiasm course and the perfumer's apprentice kit for scenthusiasm requires me to pre-dilute a lot of my stuff for the sake of learning. Therefore I will explain some math that I was about to ask in this subreddit but figured out once I thought about it when it wasn't 3AM in the morning after a long day at work. Here's some examples of what you may cross.\n\n* I have an undiluted material that I want to be at 10%. Easyyy. First, come up with how much of a solution you want. My kit came with 4mL bottles of material. I have 15mL boston rounds. So I decided 6g is a good start... I guess. So 10% of 6 grams is 0.6g (0.1x6=0.6). A ratio of 1:9. One part material, 9 parts alcohol= 10 parts total. Take out your scale, calibrate it, put your bottle with the lid off on it, tare it, and pump 5.4g of alcohol (or other diluent/solvent) into it with a plastic pipette. Record how close you got on a notes app or on paper. Tare it to 0 again. Grab another plastic pipette and pump 0.6g of the material into it. Record that as well. Keep these notes. Voilà, 6g of material at 10%. Label the bottle. I put a round label with the name of the material and the %, then I put another round label on the bottom with the total grams in it and the % with the solvent used. for example the top sticker would say \"Pyralone 10% Alc\" and the bottom \"10% Alc 6g\". Then I put a rectangle label saying the same as the top one. I'm taking no chances for a label to blur or peel off itself.\n   * I record my empty bottle weight too, for each bottle I use. I record the weight of the cap, the weight of the bottle, and the weight of the bottle with the cap. I do this to be thorough and this could allow me to know how much is exactly left later on after using some. That may be intensive, but I'm not taking chances :P\n* I have a pre-diluted material at 50% alcohol already, but I need it at 10% :( This one was hard to wrap my head around at first, but here ya go. I also decided to do this at 6g because it seemed like I would still have plenty of the material left over for later. So, for this, we need 1 part material (at 50% already) and 4 parts alcohol. Think, 1:4. That's 5 parts total, ok? So just 1 part would be 20%. 20% x 6g= 1.2g. So you need 1.2g of the material and 4.8g of the alcohol to make a total of 6g. Measure that all out and record it for each measurement. You should now have 10% from what was 50%.\n* I have a prediluted material at 10% and it needs to be 5% :( Easier to wrap your head around than the last one. You need a ratio of 1:1 to split the 10% in half. So for example, you want 4g of a solution at 5% from a 10% material, simply put 2g of the material in and 2g of alcohol in. Donneeee\n\nAaaaand I'm still learning, so... Again, let me know your thoughts/experiences/add other tips. If I'm brutally wrong about something, correct me and I will edit my post. I truly help this helps some people looking to start. If not tips, send some encouragement for starters. I may have made it look very complicated and unappealing. This was mostly meant to answer the questions I had to ask or had trouble finding, rather than explain everything thoroughly or define anything. I also hope to provide a shortcut over the bad part of buying bad, fake EO's and thinking fragrance oils could make the cut.  \n\n\nSome updates to come",

    "body": "*For those with sensitive, reactive and troubled skin:*\n\n**THE BACKGROUND**\n\nWhere to begin? Six years ago whilst going through a pretty awful breakup and I caught mono (lucky me). It was a little after recovering that I started getting these strange pimples which never came to head in my cheeks, but were very red and inflamed. The derm diagnosed me with seborrheic dermatitis (which I do have in my scalp), she then printed an information sheet written in all caps and prescribed me some antibiotics that didn’t work.\n\nA month or two later, dermatologist number two prescribed accutane and tetracyclines together and a bunch of other topical products that dried my skin horribly. A doctor friend read the prescription, and urged me to go to dermatologist number three, who then diagnosed me with hormonal acne and gave me doxy.\n\nDoxy worked for a while, but then I started breaking out in 2017 again. In late 2018 I was prescribed again a bunch of different things, dermatologist number three insisted it was hormonal, but dermatologist number four thought it was seb derm even though I have never flaked on my face.\n\nDermatologist number five in March 2019 took a long look at my skin and declared “You have acneiform dermatitis” He said that given the situation in that moment he couldn’t tell if it was only seb derm, or demodex, or yeast. By this time I had just found SSC, the week before or something like that, I asked if it could be folliculitis. My derm said it was a little of everything, and prescribed me 20mg of accutane, and gave me soolantra for the itch. Two months and I was beautiful, I saw my doctor again and forgot to ask more things in detail, I left and one week later (lucky me again) he was dead. Unluckier him ofc.\n\nI found dermatologist number six just to prescribe me accutane for a year, I don’t think he cared very much about anything. I stopped taking accutane sometime around April last year because I was mostly fine, and accutane made me feel mostly awful, and I was also scared of catching covid and being incredibly sore, even though my dermatologist assured me that was stupid.\n\nSo anyway, I was kind of okay after accutane. Except it gave me hiperhydrosis… It wasn’t even so much the lockdown or the imminent end of the world as we knew it, but last year I rescued 21 puppies in batches of four, I took them to the vet (paid all the bills) socialized them, nursed them, and lastly bottle fed them in between two hurricanes which was a horrendous weekend in which I didn’t sleep, had cheetos for breakfast and obviously didn’t cleanse my face. Naturally, my skin exploded.\n\nDermatologist number seven (lol) prescribed me a week of 20 mg daily of accutane, and a mild steroid to bring down the inflammation faster. Behold a curse and a miracle in one, because this bad boy made me explode like nothing before.. One week later, and I met my dr again to buy the accutane, I took my face mask off and I said “It’s satanic isn’t it?” and she said “Yes, satanic”. Bless you dermalive, because it was here when she saw my skin and said “It kinda seems like, what you have is perioral dermatitis”. She squeezed the infected pustules, applied salicylic acid, and I went home in peace. For one week I took 20mg of accutane, and after that one pill every three days:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[only thing on my face is salicylic acid \\(yellow thingy\\) and my mustache](https://preview.redd.it/7lzk2ndx4or61.jpg?width=1240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8899571c82c641f0be0656ed049f34010d222bbd)\n\nBy the end of last year, and the beginning of this until literally a week ago, my routine consisted of vanicream gentle cleanser the end. And again on accutane my skin was perfect.\n\nBut late January, I started breaking out in my forehead again after rescuing 5 more pups lol, and on the sides of my nose, not as bad as in October, but still sore and annoying. My skin was oily but dry, and because Malezia was coming out so soon I decided to wait instead of buying again Hada Labo which is the moisturizer I used before.\n\n**THE SKIN TYPE: seb derm, perioral dermatitis, fungal acne/malassezia folliculitis**\n\nMy skin type leans towards oily but is extremely dehydrated.\n\nI live in a hot humid place so I can survive without moisturizer, but the moment the temperature drops a bit, or the humidity in the environment decreases, I have a confused skin barrier, angry sides of the nose, and mountain-covered forehead, which if left unattended, then spreads to the rest of my face.\n\n**THINGS THAT I HAVE TRIED THAT KINDA WORK BUT NOT ENOUGH**\n\nMy pigeons I have tried everything within my reach:\n\n* Presteme/Soolantra: *Ivermectin (this sometimes works in my PD sore patches to reduce inflammation)\\* And also worked great for the big cheek pimples because either I had demodex, or because ivermectin action to reduce inflammation.*\n* Adapalene *(tried on february for my forehead)*\n* Tacrolimus ointment\n* Metrocream/Rozex: *This is metronidazole, pretty much the same as Metrogel but instead of delivering it in a gel vehicle is in a cream form, I looked for this alternative because the gel sting my face. (tried on february for my PD flare, was quite soothing and it helped)*\n* The zero therapy: *ceasing the use of cosmeceutical products and any skincare treatments for a couple of weeks.*\n* Cutting out dairy\n* Exercising (pilates and yoga)\n* Going to therapy to manage my stress\n* Only using products vetted by SimpleSkincareScience com and Sezia co. *Mostly a purist about avoiding esters at all costs, specially isopropyl palmitate & isopropyl myristate, which I bet aid to my first flareup, every time they are on a product I'll break out 100%, which sucks because for whatever twisted reason they come in most of seb derm products.*\n* Sulfur soap *specifically one I found by grisi.*\n* Dandruff shampoo on face. *Specifically one with ketoconazole 2%.*\n* Every cream my dermatologists have sent me.\n* Hay fever pills, *early march I was dying of hay fever and I took loratadine, I noticed a great reduction of my forehead rash after that. I probably took it two or three times both to test this (lol) and for hay fever. It doesn't take it away, but there's a significant reduction in inflammation.*\n\n**THINGS THAT WORKED OUT ENOUGH**\n\n[Accutane (my one year review)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/gbt82l/a_year_into_accutane/)\n\n**THE MALEZIA APPLICATION**\n\n[Malezia from the same guy who made Simple Skincare Science, a urea 5&#37; moisturizer and a 2.5&#37; benzoyl peroxide](https://preview.redd.it/icgmtnsfmnr61.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bad7b59a241320f76488ae8f35fd894f8850a8ae)\n\nThis is how my skin has been looking lately prior to Malezia:\n\n[Routine before Malezia is literally just vanicream gentle cleanser and eltamd uv clear for spf. Pictures on the left are before starting the regimen, which i began on March 30.](https://preview.redd.it/3np42fyo2nr61.jpg?width=1837&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=095ace337d62b7910e66de1be335f120b5c6d739)\n\nI purchased both the BP ($11.5usd) and the moisturizer ($22.00usd), which I have only used at night given that I don’t see the necessity of using them in my morning routine.\n\n1. When I’m ready to let go of the day, I cleanse with the Vanicream gentle cleanser, I pat dry with a towel and apply half a finger phalanx of the 5% urea moisturizer all over my face. I think this is IMPORTANT and I haven’t seen it enough out there, so I’m gonna say it. *If your skin is sensitive as f\\*ck and it is the first time you are using urea, space out the applications. This is not the first time I’m using it, but when I first started with the Hada Labo plumping cream that has the same percentage, I did find I had to use it every other day before using it all the time.*\n\nIntroducing Urea 5% to a virgin skin for some people might make skin feel itchy, redder, and overall angrier. This happens only during the first few days, and once the skin gets used to it, it turns into your bf. In my experience and in my case. Take it with a grain of salt.\n\n1. The first time I used the BP, once the moisturizer had been absorbed I put a little less of the same amount all over my forehead, the top of my nose and one pimple I had on the cheek.\n\nOn the third day I think, I noticed some tiny little bumps close to my nasolabial folds.. kind of below where I had applied the BP for that single pimple, and some pimples on my chin. I tried to photograph them but it didn’t show on the camera. After this, I started applying the BP on my chin, and on that specific area, and yesterday I applied it on the sides of my nose, but a tiny little bit just to see how it felt. It felt fine.\n\nDuring the morning I just cleanse with the vanicream gentle cleanser and apply elta md uv clear for spf.\n\n**THE RESULTS: MY RESULTS ARE FROM USING MALEZIA SINCE MARCH 30TH 2021**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[both pictures taken today, I'm a bit sunburnt from standing under the mexican sun a bit too long yesterday](https://preview.redd.it/xji6a0sa5nr61.jpg?width=4379&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89d94dfeb69a25d60e30f281903bb9d5d2e8a083)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[I apologize for this horribly light conditions, I couldn't wait to take a proper before photo and somehow I thought my bedroom lighting wouldn't be so bad. Tonight's picture is just as ugly completely on purpose. \\(literally censoring because i have crazy eyes\\). As you can see whilst my my bumpies aren't erradicated, they are almost gone, and my nose looks cleaner.](https://preview.redd.it/3hoj06bdunr61.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e23069e903a2fdf25b263b73651723f3855d3955)\n\nIt’s literally been one week. From experience if something doesn’t work for me, I break out right away, or around the first week mark.\n\nI notice the overall texture of my skin being nicer. There’s some glow coming up that I hadn’t seen since accutane. MY SKIN FEELS SOFT.\n\nIt also feels a tad more reactive, i.e I have cats and dogs, and usually it isn’t rare that if they are dirty their fur might make me itchy (this has always happened), I find that my skin is a bit less tolerant and gets redder faster, I attribute this to it still getting used to the urea.\n\nI found that the first two or three days I used the BP, my skin felt a bit hot but nothing too annoying to remove the product.\n\nI’m a bit red in the very last pictures because yesterday I got a bit of a sunburnt from standing under the mexican sun without enough spf lol.\n\n**WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS & WILL I REPURCHASE????**\n\nHell yes.\n\nAs I said I have tried everything. And even though my forehead isn’t 100% clear of little bumpies, this is the fastest time something has consistently worked out.\n\nI don’t want to say that this is the only thing that has ever worked out for me because that isn’t true, topically I can get OTC differin+metrocream+soolantra and tacrolimus all those options reduce the inflammation, and are alternatives that while they are a bit more expensive, they are at my reach in every drugstore in the middle of the night if I decide to get them. But in my experience none of them work *enough*, while they are great at reducing the inflammation they don’t do much to stop the spread of the pimples, nor do they aid to remove the existing ones, they just kinda flatten them and they remain there eternally, you only need one by bad night of sleep, a strong fulfilled craving for quesadillas, or a bad PMS and there they are stronger than ever as if I hadn’t applied anything.\n\nThe biggest difference I notice which is why I recommend this, is that the overall appearance of my skin has improved. It’s glowy in a nice in an accutane kind of way, and I haven’t experienced any of the awful side effects that come with the topical OTC creams which is extremely sensitized and reactive skin, or accutane that for me brought extremely painful periods, broken lips and being exhausted all the time. Not to mention that none of the options that have worked the best for me (topically: Metrocream+Tacrolimus+Soolantra+Adapalene/*\\*Note, I don’t use these at the same time, and I use them as instructed by my derm*) and orally: accutane, can’t be used for long periods of time. I have already taken two accutane doses, I don’t want to keep turning to it every time my skin explodes.\n\n*Disclaimer: While I do have perioral dermatitis, and I did have a forehead breakout (of whatever condition we might want to label it) I wasn’t experiencing the usual eczema-like perioral patches of sore red angry skin I usually get on the sides of my nose. I’m not a dermatologist, but I would not recommend putting anything on that except maybe Metrocream, or water soaked oats. For when I’m having those patches as opposed to pustules, what always works best for me is the zero therapy.*\n\nI will be repurchasing this when I run out not only because of the results, but because it also the brand chore values in regards to sustainability.\n\n**EDIT 03 MAY 22: YOU CAN NOW GET 10% OFF FROM YOUR ENTIRE MALEZIA ORDER BY USING THE CODE RENE, is a one time use per customer so use it wisely <3**\n\n**EDIT 07-04-2022: Now if you wish to help a soul, you can purchase these products through my affiliate link:** [**collabs.shop/zurvyy**](https://collabs.shop/zurvyy) \\*\\*I do get a commission if you use my link <3 but obviously you can also not use it and purchase it if you want to still try this goodness.\\*\\**EDIT: I realized some of you might have no idea of what product i'm talking about so I added a product shot and some missing links.*\n\n*EDIT 2 I added some horrid pictures from my front facing camera that show a bit better the texture of my forehead situation.

I'm breaking in places I've never had acne before. I'm only using the cream because I have access to BP which works well for me. \n\nI actually came back to this sub to look for other who may have tried these products out, see if others have had the same reaction and found your review. It looks to me that urea or something else in the product doesn't agree with my skin. In other products I use (La Roche-Posay Toleriane Sensitive Fluide Moisturiser, EltaMD UV Clear, SebaMed Clear Gel & Squalane oil) there's either similar (silicone) or the same ingredients. The only ingredients I've found in the Malezia products that could be problematic is the Urea or the various silicones used. I honestly can't figure it out. I'm kinda heartbroken tbh.   \n\n\nYou mention your skin was irritated at first. Did you find you 'purged' in the first few days? I'd been using the product for about 10+ days, then I started breaking out -- I waited it out and it's only gotten worse. I've since stopped using the product. Were you using BP prior? I've been using BP for a long while, light contact method. \n\nLike I said, it's great that you had such a wonderful response to these products. You look awesome! I hope this continues to heal your skin and grow your confidence.",

Check out the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/csfm1l/guide_ceramides_in_skin_care_a_scam_ceramide/) from AsianBeauty sub for other people's knowledge-bombs in the comment sections!\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHi again, AB!! So I came across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/) talking about how most companies that claim to have ceramides actually use 2 ceramide \"soups\" basically, of the purpoted \"ideal\" ratio of ceramides/fatty acids, of which contain actually very, very little ceramides. Basically, it's for marketing and such a low % won't really do much. But the research for actually using an efficient amount of ceramides is apparently ***very*** good for barrier repair.\n\nSO I was severely disappoinT in my beloved CeraVe and other things. HOWEVER, I came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/celc5y/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu3j2mw/?context=3) conversation between the OP of that post and someone else:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Yes, the technology behind Atopalm is the same behind Zerafite, which Dr. Baumann believes in and sells through her practice. The research and invention originally came out of Korea, so I am not surprised Korean brands are using it.**  \n>  \n>\\-  [u/nocloudstoday](https://www.reddit.com/user/nocloudstoday/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhaaat???? Ceramides for skincare was **invented in Korea**?? Idk, should I be surprised ?\n\nAnd:\n\n>**Neopharm & Amorepacific have their own patented, lab-made ceramides that have been heavily researched.**  \n>  \n>\\- u/[royalsincognito](https://www.reddit.com/user/royalsincognito/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInteresting! I'm able to read some Korean so I looked into this on Korean sites + Korean reviews.\n\nSo it looks like [**Neopharm**](http://www.neopharm.co.kr/en/brand/brand_atopalm.do) owns these brands: **Atopalm, RealBarrier, Zeroid, Derma:B.** And [**Amore Pacific** owns many brands](https://www.apgroup.com/int/en/brands.html), but I have only seen \"ceramide\" products so far in these brands: **Illiyoon, Aestura & Mamonde.**\n\nI was like, why does this sound familiar? Then I realized that I've seen them ranked very high on Hwahae (Korean beauty review & ranking app) many times before!\n\nNeopharm's ceramide technology is called **\"MLE\"** and Amore Pacific's is **Ceramide PC-102 and PC-104.**\n\nPersonally, I like the look of ZEROID & AESTURA, because their products don't seem to contain fragrance. *(Fragrance can be a trigger for very, very sensitive skin types, but it seems the majority of people tolerate it pretty well in their skincare? However, I have seen derms say it can become problematic the longer you use it. YMMV. For what it's worth, I read many reviews from sensitive-skinned folks saying the fragranced ones never bothered their skin & they love it. Many posted pictures of putting the creams on their babies.)* But they're super hard to find online as of now!\n\nFrom all the reviews I'm reading, these brands and Illiyoon ato products are what is recommended by Korean dermatologists and skin care clinics. I read that some derms recommend these specifically for the ceramides. (In Korea, products for people with skin conditions like eczema and such are called \"ato\" products, assuming short for \"atopic\".)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(eBay links are from my trusted eBay sellers/ones I bought from before)\n\nAll of these have really good ratings due to being in the TOP 100 for their respective categories. They all use the patented ceramides.\n\n* [**RealBarrier's Extreme Cream**](http://www.atopalmglobal.com/product/proDetail.asp?brand=3&cate=332&Pcate=217&Mcate=) \\#3 Top Creams (4.11/5 out of 6,153 Reviews) **fragranced**  [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/REAL-BARRIER-Extreme-Cream-50ml-BEST-Korea-Cosmetic/312419244657?epid=1740451843&hash=item48bda35a71:g:Kp4AAOSwoEFcM~bo)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Aestura Ato Barrier Cream**](https://www.aestura.com/web/product/view.do?prdSeq=1004)  \\#6 Top Creams (4.23/5 out of 2,524 Reviews)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Mamonde's Moisture Ceramide Intense Cream**](https://www.mamonde.com/int/en/product/ceramide-intense-cream.html) \\#15 Top Creams (3.94/5 out of 2,840 Reviews) **fragranced**    [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/MAMONDE-Ceramide-Intense-Cream-50ml/392296451084?epid=8032468017&hash=item5b56b0cc0c%3Ag%3A9wMAAOSwMMNc2mEr&LH_BIN=1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Zeroid's Intensive Cream**](http://www.zeroid.com/main/contents.asp?step1=0&step2=0&Pcate=280&Mcate=281) (4.21/5 out of 1,539 Reviews)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Zeroid's Soothing Cream** (4.12/5 out of 1,768 Reviews)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Zeroid's Richenic Cream Urea 5%**](http://www.zeroid.com/main/contents.asp?step1=0&step2=0&Pcate=280&Mcate=284) **-** not many reviews as this is new, but FANTASTIC ingredients.

It doesn't bother her skin, and really helps calm her skin & works well under makeup. She also highly recommends the soothing gel for summer & concentrate cream.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream** (4.20/5 out of 3,162 Reviews)\n\n[Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/ILLIYOON-Ceramide-Ato-Concentrate-Cream-200ml/132526755796)\n\n[Apmall](http://global.amorepacificmall.com/en/shop/pr/illiyoon/P000006418/shop_product_view.do?i_sProductcd=P000006418)\n\n[Mini-review by Dr. Dray @ 13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1X4RmFTJQ8&t=877s)\n\nThis cream has little beads in it that break up when you apply, according to reviewers. Some wondered if it's the ceramide encapsulation technology. A few people were bothered by the \"scrubby bits\" when using it on their face. Cream is apparently slightly heavier than lotion, but still great absorbency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Derma:B Daily Moisture Body Lotion**](http://www.dermab.com/main/contents.asp?Mcate=188&Pcate=12) (4.27/5 out of 2,075 Reviews)  **fragranced**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the Body section, both [Illiyoon](http://www.apgroup.com/int/en/brands/illiyoon.html) and [B:Derma](http://www.dermab.com/main/) are in the Top 10.\n\nWhile Illiyoon's ceramide ato lotion & cream are regarded as **body moisturizers**, lots of people commented that they use it on their **face** also. So, good choice for those of us whose budgets may not allow the more pricier options.\n\nOilier/combo skin types did not like to use it on their face, while the dry & sensitive-skinned folks loved them. No mention of the lotion not working under makeup. I came across 1 review though saying that they experienced pilling when they used the cream under makeup.\n\nMany people emphasized that they like how light and non-greasy these feel, yet very moisturizing. Some oily types said it felt too heavy. Some said during the summer, they felt it doesn't absorb as well (keep in mind that Korea is EXTREMELY humid during the summer though. Like, you would be drenched in sweat as soon as you stepped out of the shower -\\_- and you'd just be all sweaty and nasty alllllllllllllllll summer it was dISCUSTING) but they still agreed with other reviewers saying it absorbed well during colder months (it gets really cold & snowy in Korea during winter).\n\nRave reviews up & down from dry skinned folks. Some drier skinned folks said it's not enough for winter, however. Illiyoon often goes on sale in Korea and people like that they get can it for like, half off. 1 or 2 reviews saying they had some sort of an allergic reaction. As always, YMMV.\n\nI hope this helps some of you!\n\nYou don't have to read the below info, but I thought it may be helpful for those of you with damaged skin barriers. My skin used to be severely damaged too so I feel your struggle. T-T\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**MORE ON FRAGRANCE** [**FROM LAB MUFFIN BEAUTY SCIENCE**](https://labmuffin.com/mythbusting-vitamin-c-serums-bad/)**:**\n\n>On the flip side to the little rant I had above: **if you aren’t sensitive to fragrance, there’s no compelling reason to avoid it**. There’s a lot in the dermatological literature on fragrance, but that’s because people who go to the trouble of seeing a dermatologist are those who have serious skin issues. It’s estimated that less than 5% of the population will have allergic reactions to fragrance on their skin. It’s great that there are more fragrance-free products available for people with sensitive skin, but for the rest of us, fragrance isn’t an issue (damage from [“invisible inflammation” from fragrance](http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/sensitive-skin/_/why-fragrance-free-products-are-best-for-everyone) isn’t supported by any convincing evidence).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BARRIER REPAIR SUPERSTAR? UREA:**\n\nI'm particularly impressed by Zeroid's new [5% urea cream](http://www.zeroid.com/main/contents.asp?step1=0&step2=0&Pcate=280&Mcate=284). It also has panthenol, centella, madecassoside, allantoin, bisabolol and physosterols.\n\nNow, there's SO much mumbo jumbo about efficient skincare, but so much of it is marketing bullshit and there are actually **very few** ingredients (compared to everything else out there) that are scientifically proven to REALLY WORK on our skin. As OP mentions in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu354ub/?context=3) thread, urea is a severely underrated ingredient:\n\n>The one thing that comes to mind, actually, is **urea**. **Of all of the ingredients researched for barrier repair, urea probably has the most consistent and longest track record for repairing the barrier.** You see it a lot in pharmacies in Europe. It's not sexy, but it's often very effective - for very impaired skin suffering from everything from eczema and psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. I'd recommend trying a 5% cream and seeing how that works for you. The bad news is that there are not a lot of options on the US market (which is not bad news if you happen to be somewhere else!).\n\nUrea is a natural moisturizing factor (NMF) that exist naturally on our skin, it's a mild exfoliator in high concentrations, and it's also a penetration enhancer, meaning that it's also used to deliver actives into the skin better. Now, there are a lot of other penetration enhancers, used both in medicine and the beauty industry, such as dimethyl isosorbide (DMI),  isopropyl myristate, propylene glycols/ethoxydiglycol, emu oil/MCTs (fractionated coconut oil or caprylic/capric triglyceride)/other oils, oleic acid (a component in many oils), etc.\n\nBut AFAIK, the reason a lot of them work is because they disrupt the skin barrier long enough to deliver the actives (except perhaps, some oils? Oleic acid has been shown to be disruptive tho. Apparently there are studies that show [emu oil](https://gardenofwisdom.com/products/emu-oil) is able to penetrate very deeply into the skin bc of the tiny-ness of the molecules or some shit. Which is why it's used with herbs/medicine a lot). I'm not a derm or a chemist, but from what I've been reading from the [chemistscorner.com](https://chemistscorner.com) forum, **this isn't always a good thing**. But I have not come across anything that says urea may be damaging. Quite the opposite.\n\n(Mineral oil is also another penetration enhancer, and a wonderful, stable moisturizer that will not go rancid like plant oils do **-** [**squalene on your skin oxidizing leads to acne**](https://simpleskincarescience.com/squalene-squalane-oil-review-acne/)**,** also [confirmed by Lab Muffin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKjKDj9plaI) \\- coming in close to petrolatum for reducing Trans Epidermal Water Loss. And petrolatum is pretty much irrefutably, scientifically proven to be the #1ingredient in reducing TEWL. Mineral oil feels quite heavy, but it's used a lot as it doesn't have too many other chemicals in it to cause skin reactions.)\n\nFor people with eczema who use colloidal oatmeal creams to soothe skin, make sure the active concentration is 1% or higher, not just claimed \"so and so lotion with natural oatmeal to reduce itching!\", because\n\n>[in order to be listed as an active ingredient, it must be included in a formula at a minimum 0.007 percent concentration, or 0.003 percent minimum concentration if combined with mineral oil.](https://www.mydadthechemist.com/reviews/best-oatmeal-eczema-lotions/)\n\n\\^I'm not 100% sure what this means, but I just know that this is probably bc mineral oil's ability to help things penetrate.\n\n**Don't confuse** urea with diazolidinyl urea and imidazolidinyl urea btw, which are preservatives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Some moisturizers with urea:**\n\n(I will list 10% ones here, but I personally don't go above 5% because of the exfoliating effects of urea for my face. It may be mild at 10% & below, but I still don't want to risk it as I use a lot of other actives and have problematic skin. But for those who WANT exfoliation and don't get along with AHAs, it may be another option.)\n\nI know Hadalabo Premium lotion is mentioned a lot, but 3% urea is not going to perform as well as concentrations above that (chemistscorner forums). I'm not entirely sure the difference between [Hydroxyethyl Urea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethyl-urea) and regular urea is, but some say it's the same thing just different name and some say it functions more as a humectant rather than being skin-identical. Idk. But if you count it, then there are more options, like [Gold Bond Men's Essentials](https://www.target.com/p/gold-bond-men-s-essentials-hand-face-and-body-lotions-14-5oz/-/A-14507966), or the [Strength & Resilience Lotion](https://www.target.com/p/gold-bond-strength-and-resilienc-hand-and-body-lotions-13oz/-/A-16453690) and [Unscented Diabetic Lotion](https://www.target.com/p/unscented-gold-bond-diabetic-hand-and-body-lotions-13oz/-/A-15025375) (EDIT: AND [Cetaphil Daily Hydrating Lotion for face](https://www.target.com/p/cetaphil-moisturizing-lotion-unscented-16oz/-/A-10300852)) for fragrance-free options.\n\n[Triderma Eczema Fast Healing Face % Body Cream](https://www.walmart.com/ip/TriDerma-MD-Eczema-Fast-Healing-Face-and-Body-Lotion-with-Bonus-Tube-4-2-oz/21656991)\\- not sure %, but it looks pretty high. I actually have the old version of this, before they reformulated. It used to have 3% colloidal oatmeal!!!!!!!!! Which is higher than any I've seen at the time. It's really thick and is really tacky on my face. It doesn't have a \\~nice sillicone-y feel\\~. It absorbs all the way by morning tho when I slug life with it.

They used to have one at like $8\\~11!! It was pretty heavy though if I remember correctly when I used it yeeears back.

    "body": "Hello everyone! I have developed another 15 scents to add to our general collection! They will all launch on Friday, May 27th, 2022 at around 2pm UK Time. They will be all be available at once, rather than in a staggered pattern like the last few. They will also be available in three pre-chosen Discovery Sample Flights but also are eligible to be added to our Choose Your Own Flight, so you can mix and match with our older scents to make up sample sets of five that most appeal to you.\n\nEach one is made to thematically match one of our makeup collection themes, because that was a fun creative challenge for me.  I hope they're as evocative of their inspiration to you as they are to me!\n\nI have also revamped our Master Scent List/Scent Catalogue to have more tools that will hopefully help you browse the collection more easily. I've added note filters to help find scents that include a note you like, so that you don't have to scroll through the entire list hunting for something in particular. You can also add scents to your site wishlist to save them for later, quickly check at a glance if a particular scent is currently available, temporarily out of stock, launching soon or rotating back in later, which should make it easier to pare down a list at any given time.\n\nI've also added the aggregated star ratings - if there are any customer reviews left for the scents, the average review score will show up on the master scent list, too. The detailed reviews can then be read on the product pages.\n\n[Check out the new Master Scent List page here!](https://crowandpebble.com/collections/fragrance)\n\nOtherwise, here are the upcoming scent descriptions for you:\n\n**Desert Mouse:** Spice coffee on a desert planet. Sandalwood, vanilla, black storax, cinnamon, nutmeg, coffee, almond and white sage.\n\n**Secrets of the Earth:** Hemlock spruce, earl grey tea, belladonna, bay laurel, sacred resins, black musk and patchouli.\n\n**Light that Endures:** Apple, ginger, orange blossom, sparkling accord, birch wood and suede.\n\n**Dawn Bringer:** White chocolate covered strawberries, marshmallow, pink pepper and clementine.\n\n**Little Thousand:** Soft rabbit fur hidden beneath earthy patchouli, fields of sweet clover, violets, strawberries, lavender and thyme.\n\n**Cause for Caroling:** Sweet baking spices, boughs of spruce and fir, clove-studded pomanders, a small fire in the hearth and vanilla snowdrifts.\n\n**There All Alone:** Climbing roses, blooming oleander, pink pepper and cinnamon leaf conceal a dark base of oakmoss, patchouli and antique lace.\n\n**Figures of Delight:** Blood red roses, orris, nutmeg, a cup of spiced cherry cordial, golden amber, benzoin and orange blossom water.\n\n**Names Myriad:** Ancient leatherbound tomes, wooden desks, black ink, white grapefruit, lemon verbena and tarragon.\n\n**Silent Soul:** Gossamer silk flowers, pale grey musk, pink and black pepper, clary sage and thyme.\n\n**Sea of Stars:** Driftwood, patchouli, vetiver, fathomless black ocean water, star anise, tobacco and delicate white petals.\n\n**Alice:** Bakewell tarts and black tea, white roses painted red, a distant whiff of black pepper and orange marmalade.\n\n**Potentiality:** Smoking church incense, tea roses, daffodil, red apple and bergamot.\n\n**Abstraction:** Silver amber, elemi resin, campfire smoke, orris root, bitter orange, black pepper and clove.\n\n**Big Damn Hero:** Leather, skin musk, warm woods, geranium, black pepper, lavender and red mandarin.\n\nThe pre-made Discovery Flights will be put together based on the various bases, so there will be a vanilla based set, a woody based set and a resinous based set, broadly! All of the scents are vegan (where an animalic note is listed, it is a synthetic accord, not an animal product) and the carrier we use is Isopropyl Myristate. :) Full sizes are 5ml Frosted White Glass bottles with Steel Roller balls and samples are 1g of perfume oil (just over 1ml) in a half dram amber glass bottle with a reducer insert. \n\nThanks so much for your support, interest and time as always! I will try to answer any questions or comments you have as frequently as I can!",

    "body": "Basically, I've been on the hunt for affordable, daily wear sunscreens. In my dream world these would come in a big bottle, not these ant-sized 40 or 50ml bottles, but we can't have everything :(\n\nControversial I know, but I quite like alcohol in sunscreens for that quick drying effect and easy wear. All of the sunscreens I'm reviewing here are more indoorsy/low-exposure - I wear the Ambre Solaire Super UV Face Fluid for walks and light outdoors seeing as the UV index isn't super high nor is it very sunny at the moment. Neither are waterproof though so not suitable for long outdoors wear.\n\nAlso, because I'm a massive cheapskate I wear an ultra-cheap/failed sunscreen on my neck so these are for face only.\n\n**MY SKIN:** sensitive to fragrance, dry, acne-prone, kinda starting to get a Differin glow after 2 weeks on Differin so idk what's going on there, but it does make the sunscreens look a bit glowier than usual.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**GARNIER AMBRE SOLAIRE SUPER UV FACE FLUID**\n\n**Price + purchasing:** I bought this at Boots (drugstore in the UK) so obviously very convenient. It cost £8 for 40ml or £0.2 per use.\n\n**Packaging:** IMO the texture of this is a bit too fluid for the nozzle tip, so it has a tendency to run out too much if you're not careful. Also, why is this so small???\n\n**Ingredients:**  Aqua / Water, Alcohol Denat. Diisopropyl Sebacate, Silica, Isopropyl Myristate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Glycerin, C12-22 Alkyl Acrylate/Hydroxyethylacrylate Copolymer, Propanediol, Drometrizole Trisiloxane, Perlite, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Tocopherol, Hydroxyacetophenone Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Hyaluronate, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Phenoxyethanol, Triethanolamine, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Caprylyl Glycol, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Potassium Sorbate\n\n6 UV filters - octisalate, uvinul T150, tinosorb S, avobenzone, mexoryl XL, mexoryl SX\n\nSome tocopherol as an antixoxidant as well.\n\nThis is a dupe of the LRP Shaka Fluid/Invisible Fluid, which is waterproof and has a PPD of 46.6. If the filter concentrations are the same here, then we have 5% octinoxate, 4.5% uvinul T150, 4% tinosorb S, 3.5% avobenzone, 2% mexoryl XL, 0.495% mexoryl SX, total filter concentration 19.495%.\n\nThis isn't marketed as waterproof but the LRP version is, so idk? Maybe they just cheaped out and didn't want to do waterproof testing.\n\n**Feel + finish:** as you apply this it feels very liquid. Dries down quickly and easily (no surprise thanks to the alcohol), with no sticky residue on the skin. This is shinier than the Anti-Age but definitely still quite natural on my skin, more of a slightly glowy finish. No pilling, clumping or settling around the nose bridge of my glasses.\n\n**Overall thoughts:** this is pretty good I have to admit. I feel pretty secure in the protection of this when I'm out and about for shorter periods of time, but again I'm not sure I would wear this to the beach/outdoorsy holidays because it's not confirmed as water-resistant. The finish is so much better than I expected, but it isn't as good as the one below. **4.5/5**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**GARNIER AMBRE SOLAIRE SUPER UV ANTI-AGE FACE PROTECTION CREAM**\n\n**Price + purchasing:** I bought this at Boots (drugstore in the UK) so obviously very convenient. It cost £10 for 50ml or £0.2 per use.\n\n**Packaging:** a very sleek and convenient tube. Apparently it uses 49% less plastic than a conventional Garnier tube and it's got a very slim cap which is space-saving. Only 50ml though :(\n\n**Ingredients:**  Aqua / Water, C12-15alkyl Benzoate, Glycerin, Octocrylene, Niacinamide, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Dimethicone, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Silica, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Vinyldimethicone / Methicone Silsesquioxanecrosspolymer, Terephthalate Tricolicilicolylene Triphetylsilicolylene Stearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Tocopherol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Phenylethylresorcinol, Triethanolamine, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Poloxamer 338, Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, 2 Caprylic Acid\n\n3 UV filters - octocrylene, avobenzone, uvinul T150. This is a fragrance-free dupe of LRP Age-Correct SPF50, which has a PPD of 20. IMO this is plenty for indoorsy, everyday wear so I'm pretty happy with that.\n\nThis also has niacinamide and tocopherol + phenylethyl resorcinol as antioxidants.\n\n**Feel + finish:** this is a medium-weight cream which is definitely moisturising enough to wear without a moisturiser for me in summer, probably perfect for combo-oily skin all year round as well. No white cast and it absorbs very quickly and easily. It leaves a non-sticky, satin finish on my skin, which is very elegant and reminiscent of Purito (which I hated because that didn't absorb well at all, but even more elegant in terms of appearance - this is less glowy for me). No pilling or clumping around the nose bridge. Honestly such a pleasant experience from a fragrance and alcohol free Euro sunscreen - I was shocked.\n\n**Overall thoughts:** ok I'm in love with this as a daily sunscreen. So easy to wear, so pretty on the skin and non-drying! The only con is the small bottle, although it's accessible and I don't have to spend money on shipping which is a major plus. **4.9/5 (every-day HG)**\n\nIf you got to the end of this thanks for reading - please correct me on anything if I'm wrong!",

    "body": "I was already skeptical when I bought it as an add-on, but I figured for $3 bucks it didn't hurt... Now I'm wondering if I should even put it on my face. \n\n\n1. There are basically no reviews anywhere outside of the official website. There's reviews on Nordstrom's, but they're all *reposted from the company's site*. The positive reviews didn't mention anything specific--\"Really pleasant serum and effects on the skin to suit.\" the few reviews seem fake as FUCK in my opinion. I found one more site that has reviews, but still, few reviews and a little generic. \n\n\n2. Packaging says it's **made in China**. Sorry, what the fuck?? A purportedly $350 cream is *made in China*? A company with very little info, very few reviews, making stuff in China? Alarm bells going off here, esp with regulation of ingredients. Not that China automatically means bad quality, but it's not a great sign for a no-name company. \n\n\n3. The **ingredients don't match the official site**. What the what?!\n\nHere's what the back of my sample said:\n\n\nWater, Sorbitol, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Bis - PEG - 18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Diazolidinyl Urea, Sodium PCA, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Hyaluronate, Disodium EDTA, Niacinimide, Panthenol, Carrageenan Extract, Propylene Glycol, Acrylic Acid Copolymer, PVM/MA Copolymer, Beta-Glucan, Chlorphenesin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Maltodextrin, BHT, Aesculus Hippocastanum Seed Extract, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Atecyl Cysteine, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Soybean Oil, Citric Acid, Calendula Officinalis Extract, Tocopherol, Fragrance. \n\nAnd here's the ingredients list from the official site:\n\n\nGLYCERIN, AQUA / WATER / EAU, SORBITOL, ISOPROPYL MYRISTATE, ALOE BARBADENSIS (ALOE VERA) EXTRACT, CALENDULA OFFICINALIS EXTRACT, ALCOHOL, CARBOMER, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, AESCULUS HIPPOCASTANUM (HORSE CHESTNUT / MARRON) SEED EXTRACT, SODIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE, ACETYL CYSTEINE, PANTHENOL, NIACINAMIDE, THIAMINE, RIBOFLAVIN, PYRIDOXINE, CYANOCOBALAMIN, DISODIUM EDTA, FRAGRANCE / PARFUM.\n\n\nCan anyone explain to me why the ingredients themselves would be different, and in the wrong order?? A lot of the ingredients not officially listed, like BHT and Diazolidinyl Urea, don't have great results on CosDNA.... And overall, I don't see any special ingredients beyond a few basic moisturizers, a bunch of preservatives, etc. Like, nothing that would make this worth $$$. \n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nHas anyone tried it? What are your results so far? I guess I'll still give it a try, but the fact that it's made in China (definitely potential ingredient contamination) and the ingredients aren't listed correctly makes me very skeptical... What's your take?\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/niANANe.jpg",

        "body": "This sounds like it might be a private label product, made by whoever in China and repackaged by a company that specifically sells/vends to beauty boxes. That there is no other information on this product online, it’s only appearance is in this beauty box, indicates a PLM product. Beauty box companies routinely pair with companies who private label their (inexpensively sourced) products and put a high price tag on it to make it seem like an amazing deal. \n\nSome people on this sub HATE any talk of private labeling in beauty boxes, they don’t want their bubble burst of how “great a deal!” their boxes and the products in them seem to be. Some brands seem to only exist in beauty boxes (Doucce, Laritzy, Starlooks, Micabeauty, The Beauty Crop, Be A Bombshell, Mirabella, etc). There are tons more, I’ve only subbed to Play and Allure lately so I’m a little behind. I suspect most or all of the brands I listed are private label. \n\nYou can usually tell because the brand’s presence is entirely online (outside of boxes) and the actual website will be a little “off.” A bit of a DIY template look. Real brands that manufacture their own products will usually sell in retail stores and have a custom website. Private label brands won’t because that shit costs money and they’re all about repackaging inexpensively-sourced products that another company made. \n\nIt’s a huge thing in the beauty industry right now. I’m not against private labeling, I just think a lot of people are being misled about “box values” with these inflated prices. Things are ultimately worth what you pay for them I guess but when someone posts how their “$20 box has a $300 value!” I roll my eyes a bit every time lol.\n\nSephora Play has had the fewest amount of PLM products in their boxes, which is why the samples are smaller and less varied-seeming. They seem to only have items in their boxes that they sell in their stores. Ipsy used to have a TON but they seem to send more higher-quality brands lately. Allure seems to be going down that road (Juvia’s Place, LASplash, etc). Most of the eye palettes in Boxycharm are from private label manufacturers, for example. Brands that just pop up out of nowhere in a beauty box, then just keep showing up in beauty boxes only. \n\nThis isn’t just true for beauty boxes though, it’s the case all across the entire beauty industry. I read somewhere that up to 80% or department store products are made by private label manufacturers. It’s just more obvious in beauty boxes because the same brands repeat over and over. When really, a good chunk of the products are made by the same larger companies and factories overseas, regardless of what brand name it says on the packaging. And the websites of beauty box brands seem more homemade and template-y.",

    "body": "This is my first ever review so I hope it’s alright! I can be a bit rambly but I’ve tried to keep it relatively concise (by my standards, at least). I’m also not super experienced with perfumes so I don’t have the most sophisticated nose yet.\n\nI had zero issues with the website and ordering process. Their website looks great and is easy to use. They even have a fun little quiz to offer recommendations if you’re unsure what you want to try. I did it and was recommended a perfume that ended up being my favourite from my order, so it seems like it works pretty well.\n\nThey offer free international shipping over $35, which is amazing. I live in the UK and I loved being able to shop without worrying about how much shipping would be. It shipped out within TAT, arrived fairly quickly, and was packaged well. It also came with the cutest tiny glass bottle with a benzoin sample inside, which I thought was really fun. I also love that none of their scents are limited edition - there's always anxiety as an international buyer about buying samples in time before seasonal scents are phased out because of long shipping times, and having everything be GC eliminates this worry entirely.\n\n**About my tastes:** I’m still figuring it out but so far I tend to gravitate towards gourmands or gourmand-ish scents - warm with at least a little bit of sweetness to them. Right now my current favourites are Kyse Oui Plus & Macarons, Solstice Scents Snowmint Mallow, and Pulp Fragrance’s Bewitching Amber. My non-indie favourite is Amouage Interlude Woman.\n\nMost of these reviews come with a major caveat: they did not last very well on me. I have super dry skin that tends to eat oils pretty quickly and I don’t expect a huge amount of throw for oil-based perfumes, but so far these are some of the worst I’ve had. I did end up buying a couple of the scents I liked in EDP form (isopropyl myristate/IPM rather than alcohol because I’m international) and they definitely do last longer and have better throw. If your skin eats oils, I would go straight for the EDPs.\n\nOnto the actual perfume reviews! My flatmate was around when I was testing some of these, so I’ve put his opinions in when he offered them.\n\n&#x200B; &nbsp;\n\n* **Dantalion**\n\n*Creamy chai tea, obscuring mists, sandalwood, a plaster mask, clarifying ginger, carnations, dandelions, & a melted beeswax candle.*\n\nStarting off with my favourite! This is spicier, darker, deeper, woodier than a typical creamy chai latte type scent for sure but still retains a sweetness and creaminess. I mainly get a strong, smooth chai heavy on the cardamom, with sandalwood, ginger, and a hint of bright, spicy carnation. The ginger adds a shimmer of heat that I like, hovering around the edges with sort of a fuzzy, crackling sharpness. When I inhale, it almost feels hot. There’s a hazy quality to all the notes that I imagine is meant to be the obscuring mists. I don’t get dandelions or beeswax, and tbh I have no idea what plaster smells like so I couldn’t tell you either way for that. This is a fun scent, I really enjoy that it’s a gourmand but a little atmospheric too. It’s very unique in my collection.\n\nFlatmate’s thoughts: “This smells like curry. Wait no, the little green things you get in curry. I don’t share your enthusiasm for this perfume.” (He meant cardamom)\n\nOverall: a nice spicy chai with depth and heat, if you find chai scents a bit insipid usually then this might be a good bet. I might full size this at some point, in EDP form.\n\n&#x200B; &nbsp;\n\n* **Kensington**\n\n*Earl Grey tea, cashmere, dark vanilla bean, smooth cedar, dried rose petals, mandarin zest, pink peppercorn, and a burst of fresh bergamot.*\n\nNot going to mince words, I hate this. It’s aggressively soapy on me. It’s weird because I can smell the Earl Grey sort of flickering around underneath the soap/merging with the soap. A few times I was like, “Wait, does Earl grey actually just smell soapy and I never noticed?” Then I went to my kitchen cupboard to smell my Earl Grey tea as comparison. But no, it is just a soapy scent on me. I’ve rested it for a couple months and it’s the same, so I think it just doesn’t work with my skin. If I leave it on for longer than a minute or two I start to get a headache. I was probably most excited for this one too :( I love Earl Grey tea and have been hoping to find a perfume that captures it.\n\nFlatmate opinion: “Fancy soap?” (In the perfume’s defence, he has also said this about a lot of perfumes that smell nothing like soap.)\n\nOverall: soap, soap, and more soap. I scrubbed it off and I hate it, but based on other reviews this is probably more of a skin chemistry issue. Destashing.\n\n&#x200B; &nbsp;\n\n* **Morozko**\n\n*Smooth peppermint, cracking birch, nutmeg, biting winter wind, cold vanilla, black pepper.*\n\nThis is a peppery, earthy mint-vanilla. Initially, the mint is quite strong (though not very sharp, just bold) and I get a sense of a cold wind rustling through trees. After it dries down, the vanilla emerges and it becomes more of a vanilla-mint + wood fragrance, still with that edge of pepper and that earthy undertone stopping it from being gourmand. The nutmeg also becomes more prominent once the mint recedes, though more of a background note to add texture to the vanilla.\n\nIt feels like being in a snowy forest but the snow is...vanilla & mint flavoured, and you can smell the earth underneath it. That’s a terrible description and I apologise. Comparing it to something like Solstice Scents **Snowshoe Pass**, that one is a lot sweeter, cleaner, and purer. If Snowshoe Pass is a pristine snowy vanilla morning, Morozko is a snowy vanilla mountain, trees and dirt and all. I kind of prefer Morozko, tbh.\n\nOverall: a more atmospheric vanilla-mint fragrance grounded by a earthiness/a touch of spice. If you’re looking for a vanilla-mint fragrance but you’re not into gourmands, this might be a winner for you. I’m keeping the sample because I find it interesting, but not likely to FS as it’s just not the kind of thing I’d often wear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **Ectoplasm**\n\n*Spooky, goopy marshmallow over bone-chilling white musk, sweet amber, a gossamer sugar glaze, dark myrrh, and creeping greenery.*\n\nThis is interesting because it’s definitely marshmallow, but sort of a cold, sugary marshmallow with a green undertone. Not frozen, just chilled and vaguely threatening. It’s sweet but not cuddly and fluffy - it’s got the texture of like..marble, if that makes sense. Smooth and cold, with vines wrapped around it to add the chilly greenness. I’m finding it difficult to pick out individual notes, which is why this review is terrible/vague/more about the impressions I get than the notes I can smell.\n\nHonestly, I’m not super into this. I like the marshmallow but the green undertone just isn’t doing it for me. I don’t hate it and I think it’s a cool perfume, but I doubt I’ll ever reach for it. I enjoy the concept more than the reality - I like that they’ve done a dark take on marshmallow, using something more associated with innocent, happy scents and making it spooky.\n\nFlatmate opinion: \"No, go away. Don't get it on me.\" I feel like I should really emphasise that he tends to hate perfume - Ectoplasm is not something most people would find offensively bad, imo. \n\nOverall: kind of a horror movie gourmand! Like an ice-cold marshmallow stalking you through a garden at night as if you were prey, emotionless and unrelenting. It’s a nice scent but not for me, destashed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **Astaroth** (my free sample)\n\n*Ripe peaches, pumpkin flesh over a bed of red musk, honey cakes drizzled with white chocolate, & roasted pistachios*\n\nInitially it’s syrupy and almost almond-y, though I’m not sure why as none of the notes are almond-related. Unless that’s the pistachios? Or the nutmeg? As it dries down, the almond vibe recedes and it becomes more of a peach & pumpkin scent. These aren’t fresh peaches and pumpkins though, there’s an overripe vibe to the way they smell and a musky undertone. They’ve been left too long in the fruit bowl and then smothered in syrup to disguise their over-ripeness. I don’t get the white chocolate as a distinct note but I think it’s adding a subtle creaminess to the blend. I almost like this but I also don’t like it at all.\n\nThis one lasted longer than the others - 5 hours later there was still a syrupy sweetness left on my skin. Throw was again not great.\n\nOverall: also like a horror movie gourmand? I don’t know, it’s almost a creepy scent with its intense sweetness and over-ripeness. Like a peach with a role in a body horror movie. If that makes any sense. Also destashing this one.\n\n\\--\n\nI've been sitting on this review for so long that I don't own half the scents anymore - I’m destashing/have destashed most of these but that’s not at all a reflection on the quality of the scents! I tend to either FS or destash things and don’t usually keep samples around. Mostly because I hate using the little wandcap vials and don't want to decant scents I'm meh about into rollerballs.  I’m also fairly picky, I won’t FS something unless I really like it and can see myself wearing it a lot. Not that that stops me from blind buying way too often.\n\nOverall, I was very impressed with Fantome. They have such a diverse range of well-blended, unusual scents. The ones I picked were wildly different to one another in interesting ways - I don’t mind if scents don’t work on me as long as I’m not bored by them! **Dantalion** and **Olwyn** in particular were standouts (Olwyn will be in the next batch of reviews because otherwise this post would be way too long, along with The Fox Sisters, Kinmokusei, and Finist the Falcon).",

    "body": "I purchased travel sizes of the Reconstructing Hair Mask and the Moisture Sealing Lotion as well as the rose/rice thing (without the ritual bottle) which I haven't used yet. 65 bucks total, not bad when the travel sizes are 2 and 1/2 oz each. The rose rice pack also included half an ounce of the oil, So I thought that was a good deal. I've used the reconstructing hair mask and moisture styling lotion just now, today. For the first time.\n\nMy current products and ones that I've used for a while are Innersense Organics I create Curl Memory for wet washday styling and Inner Peace Hair Creme as a dry refresher along with I Create Shine; and a hydrating hair mask periodically. I aso use Briogeo for their avocado hair mask which is amazing; use as just a regular conditioner, on, detangle, rinse.\n\nThe Cecred reconstructing mask is very good. Just a little, detangled with a Leatherwood brush and then threw on a plastic cap for about 15 minutes while I did stuff. However, I'm using some really great products already so it was on a par with them. I found I did not have to add any castor oil to the Cecred mask since they incorporate some really good oils in their conditioners. I usually add a little castor oil to my other conditioners and hair masks.\n\nAfter conditioning, I washed out most of it, but I always leave a little in. On dripping wet hair, applied a little Inner Peace Texturizer as a leave-in, then the Moisture Sealing Lotion. My hair is short but I still apply it section by section using clips. And after I apply it I run that Leatherwood brush through the section once or twice because that forms the curls and then I can just separate them with my fingers. \n\nMy impression — I am very impressed with the Moisture Sealing Lotion. It easily clumped the curls on my dripping wet hair — and keep in mind this is a lightweight lotion cream. My hair felt sooo soft. And it retained that softness when dried. It also retained the curl. Only thing was I put clips on the top of my hair to increase volume and taking out the clips did create a little frizz. But I'm super impressed. \n\nMy other wet styler, I Create Curl Memory, will keep me going for 5 or 6 days without refreshing or maybe just refreshing my sideburns and neck. But it's sugar-based and so the hold is hard. I don't mind because it's just so long lasting. \n\nI don't expect to get 5 or 6 days with Moisture Sealing Lotion. I'll see what I get but I'm expecting maybe three before I have to spot refresh. \n\nThe scent is described as Temple Oud. Well I'm 71 and in my childhood they used hot combs on me, the old school stuff. And they used a bergamot scented pomade. The Cecred scent is very reminiscent of that and it wasn't really pleasing because I just remember my scalp being burned. But when dry it's much better. It fades and is not intrusive at all.\n\nI've tried and used a lot of curl stylers. My current lineup includes Davines, Briogeo, and Innersense. The best washday one is Innersense I Create Curl Memory. The others I use as spot refreshers for my hairline, sideburns and the bottom of my hair by the neck as needed.\n\nLastly, Cecred ingredients are what got me to try the line. They're pretty stellar. And it's clear that they're not using a commercial base to create the products. I think that's why we're looking at a higher price point. All the products I use are like this and they're priced accordingly. But they are so concentrated that I only need to buy them like twice a year. Cecred products are really clean, no silicones, or stuff like that. My only beef is they use isopropyl myristate in the oil which I think is a cheap shortcut to lighten a heavier weight oil. Use the right lightweight oil to begin with. Then you won't have to lighten it up.\n\nDried hair after wet styling with Moisture Sealing Lotion](https://i.imgur.com/eET6BjG.jpeg)\n",

This is what I found: Butyloctyl Salicylate causes allergic reactions in sensitive skin. Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate is relatively safe but can cause skin irritation. Stearalkonium Hectorite can cause irritation and allergic reactions and aggravate skin diseases. 1,2-Hexanediol causes allergies and skin irritation. This agent is very common in lots of cosmetic serums, creams, and more. Hydroxyacetophenone can cause allergic reactions in some people.  Finally, Isopropyl myristate is pore-clogging and can potentially lead to breakouts, especially in those with oily or acne-prone skin. But because I am mixed and no acne-prone skin. I believe I am safe with this ingredient. After checking all the remaining ingredients were okay, I decided to try it and see for myself how great it is. It'd be great if it had SPF 50+.  If you want to check whether the ingredients are safe for you, check these links [https://acneclinicnyc.com/pore-clogging-ingredients/](https://acneclinicnyc.com/pore-clogging-ingredients/) (pore-clogging checker) and [https://ecogolik.com/](https://ecogolik.com/) (carcinogen checker).",

    "body": "Hi all!  \n\n\nI am back with another skin conditions post. This one is on perioral dermatitis.   \n\n\nAdmittedly, when I began researching this, I knew zilch about PD except that it was acne-like breakouts around the mouth,  and as I began to research it, it seems that there isn't a whole lot that is known about it. Fortunately, it is a highly treatable condition that seems to overlap to a degree with rosacea (earning it the earlier name  of \"steroid rosacea\") and even seborrheic dermatitis.  \n\n\n**As always, please feel free to correct or inform me of anything wrong, and also feel free to post/discuss what helps your PD.**\n\n# What is Perioral Dermatitis\n\nPerioral dermatitis (PD) is a chronic, recurrant inflammatory disease that most commonly occurs in the perioral region of the face (the area around the mouth). It can also affect the area around the nose, and in roughly 20&#37; of cases, it can manifest around the eyes (though it goes by another name if around the eyes: peri-orificial dermatitis).   \n\n\nIt afflicts around 1&#37; of the population of the United States, particularly those with fair skin, and predominately occurs in women between 18-45, with 20s and 30s having peak incidence.   \n\n\nIt presents as small, red, tender, sometimes itchy bumps that can flake and burn. While commonly mistaken for acne, it is distinct from acne in that it only presents in specific locations, spares the small area around the lips, and lacks pustules (whiteheads).\n\n# Causes of Perioral Dermatitis\n\nThe causes of perioral dermatitis are unclear. It is a relatively \"young\" disease that was only first described as a distinct condition in 1964. It is first and foremost an inflammatory condition, and is aggravated by ingredients and habits that can create inflammation either in the skin or in the body. \n\nWhile I was researching PD, the one constant that showed up again and again is that it is aggravated by corticosteroid use -- both topical and inhaled. To specify, that means not just creams like kenalog, triamcinolone, and over-the-counter hydrocortisone, but also asthma inhalers (including Advair, Flovent, and ProAir aka Albuterol) and nasal allergy mists like Beconase, Flonase, Nasonex, Omnaris, and Veramyst. \n\nLess commonly, but still a factor to consider are hormones, where monthly shifts can put the condition into overdrive. More frustrating is that oral contraceptives can worsen PD in some. \n\nOther causes can be fluoridated toothpaste, high SPF value sunscreens¹, sunscreens with the filters zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, the ingredient \"isopropyl myristate,\" improperly removing makeup or sleeping in makeup, occlusive ointments (Vaseline, Aquaphor, and oils, for example), heavy creams with occlusive ingredients, and cold creams (wipe-off cleansing creams that leave a residue, like Pond's). In one case, a woman's favorite lip balm (containing the ingredient propyl gallate) caused her PD.⁶\n\n# Treatment\n\nPD can look like many other conditions, such as acne, angular cheilitis, rosacea, or seborrheic dermatitis, and requires treatment of a professional due to the inflammatory nature of the condition. \n\nThe most important thing for anyone suffering from PD is to discontinue steroid use - whether cold-turkey or weened off with the management of a healthcare professional. While topical steroids can seem to improve the condition, they frequently create a rebound effect, which can make the condition worse. \n\nOnce steroids are removed, the skin will get worse before getting better. This is the toughest part of PD for most people. Topical antibiotics or topical immunosuppresants (such as Pimecrolimus or Elidel) are frequently prescribed due to their tremendously  helpful anti-inflammatory effects on PD, and azelaic acid can prove useful in some cases. In very severe cases, oral antibiotics can be prescribed in addition to topicals. \n\nWhile healing from PD, the skin should not be cleansed with any cleanser, and makeup and skincare products should be avoided completely until the condition resolves. And no matter how tempting, PD should never be scrubbed, as this worsens the inflammation. \n\nOnce treated, it is encouraged to use liquid or gel sunscreens as well as soap-free cleansers that do not dry out the skin, as TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) is significant in people who suffer from PD.\n\n# Long-Term Care\n\nSome people have PD once in their lives, while others may combat it on and off for several years. If you fall into the latter, it is important to try to avoid triggers that can cause the condition to reoccur (particularly steroid use). That means cleansing your skin each day with gentle cleansers, always removing makeup (removing it with a wipe does *NOT* count - you need to cleanse it away thoroughly with an oil cleanser that rinses cleanly), and using light products, particularly around the areas typically affected. \n\nPrescriptions like azelaic acid and over-the-counter .1&#37; adapalene (Differin)² may  also help to manage the condition in the long-term. \n\nI've put together a list below of some cleansers and moisturizers that are recommended for people suffering from PD. Again, like with my rosacea list, this is not a be-all-end-all list. None of the products listed contain isopropyl myristate or heavy occlusive ingredients.\n\n## Recommended Products\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser** \n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Stearyl Alcohol and Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate​,​ Polysorbate 60​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Panthenol​,​ T-Butyl Alcohol,​ Tocopherol​.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Wate/Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryl Glycol/Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**Avene Extremely Gentle Cleanser Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (avene Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Serine, Cetrimonium Bromide, Coco-Glucoside, Dipotassium Phosphate, Disodium Edta, Disodium Phosphate, O-Phenylphenol, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Water (Aqua).*\n\n**Spectro Jel Cleanser for Blemish-Prone Skin - Fragrance Free**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Hydroxypropyl Methocellulose, Polysorbate 20, Cetyl Alcohol (moisturizer), Hydrated Silica, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Diazolidinyl Urea, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Sorbitan Oleate.*\n\n## Foaming Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Terastearate, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric, Glycerides, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Sodium Chloride, Phytosphingosine, Citric Acid, Edetate Disodium, Dihydrate, Sodium, Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Olay Foaming Face Wash Sensitive**\n\n>*Ingredients: Water/Eau, Glycerin, Sodium Myristoyl Sarcosinate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Polyquaternium-10, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Laureth-10, Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, DMDM Hydantoin.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate​,​ PEG-120 Methyl Glucoside Dioleate,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Hydroxide​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Capryloyl Glycine​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Citric Acid​,​ Acrylates Copolymer​.*\n\n## Makeup Removers\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm**\n\n>*Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Polyethylene, PEG-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Water / Aqua / Eau, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol.*\n\n**Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Mineral Oil, PEG-8 Glyceryl Isostearate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclomethicone, Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Isostearic Acid, Glycerin, Phenoexyethanol.*\n\n## Moisturizers\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Ceteareth-20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Phosphate, Potassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben.*\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3-Diisosterate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide 1, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium phosphate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 20, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Active - Dimethicone, 1\\%.

        "body": "I’ve been diagnosed with Peri-orbital Dermatitis by my dermatologist. I’ve had it for at least 10 years. Peri-orbital means it presents around my eyes, nose and mouth. My worst flare ups cover all three areas, my most frequent flare ups present just around my nostrils. \n\nYes, you’re correct that causes are basically unknown. Successful treatments can vary wildly. \n\n(personally, I’m convinced it has a fungal element, specially related to candida imbalance. That’s just my opinion. I have used OTC topicalS and been prescribed anti-fungal topicals and pills, none of that worked. I believe it is related to gut microbiome health. Our skin is a direct reflection of what’s going on intrinsically in our bodies) \n\nI want chime in here about Zinc Oxide. You mention it as a possible cause. I want others out here to know that high concentration Zinc Oxide Cream is the ONLY thing that stops my flare ups. So if you have PD, I recommend patch testing a high ZO cream on one or two of the papules and see if it helps you. Incidentally, I’ve found recently that micronized ZO particles actually work faster for my than larger particles. So I stopped using Desitin Max strength and started using Neutrogena Sheer Zinc for face with 22% ZO. It stops my flare ups completely in a matter of a day or so, versus 4+ days with the Desitin. \n\nI’ll list below everything I’ve tried in case it’s helpful. The other product I find helpful is daily probiotic pills containing Lactobacillus Acidophilus. I get less flare ups when I take daily probiotics. \n\nDIDN’T WORK: \nAntibacterial Rx creams, I believe I had both Erythromycin and Dapsone. OTC antifungal creams, clotrimazole, miconazole and terbinafine. I also had an oral Rx for Lamisil, it was generic and I can’t recall the generic name. OTC topical steroids, hydrocortisone. Violet extract. Cutting out SLS from from my toothpaste and hair products. (I never cleansed with SLS, always either soap or oil) Changing my diet to an acne safe diet. Getting sun. Staying out of sun. Sulphur washes. Leaving it alone.",

I had no idea what perioral dermatitis was and assumed all this redness was broken capillaries from a Clarisonic. \n\nIt wasn’t until I went to a dermatologist and asked her about it that she said it looked like perioral dermatitis. I was prescribed Finacea and in one month the results have been astounding. Redness has significantly reduced and no closed comedones or inflamed pimples anywhere. Again mine wasn’t severe but for anyone who has it I think azelaic acid is a great choice. \n\nI should point out I never use steroids, I’m 30F and I think this was due to over moisturizing after over exfoliating. I also think the occlusive nature of aquaphor made it much worse. My routine now consists of nothing but cleanser, moisturizer and Finacea. Drastic change from what I was doing before. \n\nThank you for taking the time to post this very informative breakdown of perioral dermatitis.",

    "body": "Hi everyone, another wall of text announcement :)\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* 20% off sale!\n* New things! (and a small reformulation)\n* No more Galaxolide!\n* Website Updates!\n* Slowly switching to isopropyl myristate instead of fractionated coconut oil!\n\n​\n\n*All items are 20% from today until midnight on Monday, March 14!*\n\n​\n\n# Thief & Witch\n\nApple cider, buttery and rich, opens the top notes. Clove and papyrus (aka nagarmotha or cypriol) paired together give a background of aromatic spiciness without overwhelming the cider. The cypriol adds traces of cedar and patchouli or perhaps myrrh and vetiver depending on how you interpret it. The beeswax and musk reinforce the richness of the cider accord, adding an amber tone with slightly animalic sweetness and elegant depth. The patchouli gives accent to the sweetness of the beeswax….(read more [here](https://www.stoneandwit.com/products/thief-witch-perfume))\n\n# Lychee #17\n\nBright and acidic lychee tingles the back of your mouth, just like eating a real lychee. The creamy coconut helps give depth and sweetness to lychee. The coconut carries on well into the dry down, where the vanilla and white musk takes over. This vanilla isn’t gourmand, it isn’t edible…it’s a refreshing vanilla spiked with traces of cool apples and vetiver…(read more [here](https://www.stoneandwit.com/products/lychee-17-perfume))\n\n# Blackberry Heartwood\n\nBlackberry and sandalwood. A deceptively simple description for what I’ve been chasing with this perfume. This isn’t the odor of fresh blackberries, it’s the juicy and tart and citrus tingle of eating them. It's the background presence of a sunlit forest, warm green leaves, and wood. Sandalwood adds its richness to the sun-warmed woods and amyris gives an earthy body and depth to the entire composition….(read more [here](https://www.stoneandwit.com/products/blackberry-heartwood-perfume))\n\n# 1899\n\n1899 has been **reformulated** to remove the galaxolide, and the webpage has been updated to show this, as well as the switch to isopropyl myristate. The overall effect of the reformulation is a slightly more fruity aspect to the dry down.\n\n# No More Galaxolide\n\nAfter weeks of reading studies and meta studies, I've decided that Galaxolide will no longer be used in my formulations. Available evidence points to Galaxolide being a bio-accumulative pollutant, as  well as slowly but surely rising levels in fresh and salt water. Phasing  out of Galaxolide has already started with the new releases and  several reformulations are on their way (starting with 1899). Luckily, I only have a handful  of fragrances that have used it. As the replacement I have been and will be using newer generation musks that do not have the  environmental persistence nor the the potential of harming sea life that Galaxolide does.\n\n# Website Updates:\n\nScreen reader compatibility is so close to being finished. There are two sections of the website that have become my major sticking points – the checkout page and the buttons. I haven’t mentioned this lately, but I have been working on it.\n\nSeasonal Suggestion Catalogs are still in progress, I’ve been waiting for this release to start implementing them. You should see them magically appear tomorrow.\n\n# The Switch to Isopropyl Myristate (IPM)\n\nI’ve been considering this switch for a while, and I felt the best time to start phasing in isopropyl myristate would be during a new release, since these posts and announcements reach the most people at once. Overall, data suggests that IPM has a longer shelf life and is more environmentally friendly than fractionated coconut oil (when farming and transportation is considered). I’ll have more about this in a future Instagram post.",

    "body": "**Review (Long Term Usage; 1+ years)** I have been using a few CeraVe products for more than an year. Putting down all the reviews at one place.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/21mqpuxa4p7c1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6152cd7496bcfdc6354819d50cab1872dd769b28\n\n**About me**: 25 F; I have combination skin with an oily T zone in summers and dry cheeks and nose in winters. I don't like strong fragrance in products, and I stay away from DIYs\n\n**Skin concerns**: Cystic acne; scars, hyperpigmentation *and* *crying* from the cystic acne\n\nAccording to the brand, All CeraVe products are formulated to be fragrance-free.\n\n*Category 1: Cleansers*\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cream-to-Foam Cleanser**\n\nTexture: Just like its described. It’s a creamy lotion texture out of the bottle. When you add water to it, it foams up and washes off like any other foaming cleanser. No noticeable fragrance.\n\nApplication: I use it two ways. First, if I want to take off any light makeup I rub it all over my dry face and it melts makeup off, then I add water it it and cleanse. Second way, I use it as a regular cleanser taking a pump in palm adding water to it and rubbing it all over my face, washing it off with water\n\n**10/10. Excellent. No notes. HG**. Already on 6th bottle. **WRP Forever**.\n\nIngredients AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, SODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE, COCO-BETAINE, SODIUM COCOYL ISETHIONATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, PCA, PPG-5-CETETH-20, PEG-100 STEARATE, PEG-150 PENTAERYTHRITYL TETRASTEARATE, PEG-6 CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC GLYCERIDES, PEG-30 DIPOLYHYDROXYSTEARATE, CI 77891 / TITANIUM DIOXIDE, ASPARTIC ACID, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, CARBOMER, GLYCOL DISTEARATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, GLYCERYL OLEATE, GLYCINE, TRIDECETH-6, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, THREONINE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, SALICYLIC ACID, SODIUM PCA, SODIUM LACTATE, ARGININE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SERINE, SODIUM BENZOATE, VALINE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, PROLINE, ISOLEUCINE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, ALANINE, PHENYLALANINE, COCONUT ACID, COCO-GLUCOSIDE, CHLORPHENESIN, DISODIUM EDTA, HYDROXYETHYL UREA, CITRIC ACID, HYDROXYETHYL ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, HISTIDINE, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, POLYQUATERNIUM-53, POLYQUATERNIUM-39, POLYSORBATE 60, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZOIC ACID\n\n**CeraVe** **Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser (4% Benzyl Peroxide)**\n\nTexture: Translucent lotion-y texture, It’s runnier than the Cream to foam cleanser. Foams up well on wet face.\n\nApplication: It’s a wash off BP product. I use it 2x a week. I apply on face, neck and underarms. I leave it on for 5min and wash it off with water. I think it works better this way. If I leave it on for too long it does dry out my skin.\n\nI use it as a body wash too. It helped me with active acne on my face and back. I find it Better than other BP bodywashes and facewashes I tried. It doesn’t strip my skin. I do use a thick moisturiser after this.\n\n**9/10**. I cut one point for the packaging; It leaked on a flight once. **WRP**\n\nIngredients BENZOYL PEROXIDE 4%\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENTS: WATER, GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, COCAMIDOPROPYL HYDROXYSULTAINE, SODIUM C14-16 OLEFIN SULFONATE, XANTHAN GUM, POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, NIACINAMIDE, GLYCOLIC ACID, SODIUM CHLORIDE, SODIUM CITRATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, PROPANEDIOL, CITRIC ACID, TETRASODIUM EDTA, DIETHYLHEXYL SODIUM SULFOSUCCINATE, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZOIC ACID\n\n*Category 2: Serum*\n\n**CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum**\n\nTexture: Off-white runny lotion texture. Spreads easily. Not sticky, layers well under other products in my routine. No added fragrance.\n\nApplication: I started with using it twice a week and built up to every day. I use the sandwich method and layer between essence and a moisturizer. I don’t like it. It didn’t do anything for me. I noticed no difference in my skin except a slight smoothing effect. I find it to be a non-offensive beginner retinol.\n\n**5/10**. Excellent packaging. All Retinol products should come in a pump like this. **WNRP**\n\nIngredients: AQUA/WATER/EAU, PROPANEDIOL, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), CETEARYL ETHYLHEXANOATE, NIACINAMIDE, AMMONIUM POLYACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE, DIPOTASSIUM GLYCYRRHIZATE, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, DIMETHICONOL, LECITHIN, SODIUM CITRATE, RETINOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, ALCOHOL, ISOPROPYL MYRISTATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, CITRIC ACID, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\n*Category 3: Moisturizers*\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturising Lotion**\n\nTexture: Super light gel cream texture. Applies like a dream on my skin. No noticeable fragrance.\n\nApplication: I apply it after Hada Labo lotion. Used it throughout summer, great stand alone moisturizer. It was the only niacinamide product I was using at the time. I don’t like it for colder weather as my skin becomes drier. Excellent in hot weather at night. Helps oil control and the usual niacinamide things. It might feel heavy if you have super oily skin.\n\n**10/10.** No Nonsense night moisturizer in a pump bottle!!! **WRP**.\n\nIngredients : AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, NIACINAMIDE, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), CETEARETH-20, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, POLYGLYCERYL-3 DIISOSTEARATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\n**CeraVe Moisturizing Cream (White Tub)**\n\nTexture: Thick and gooey. The only CeraVe product that has a strange plastic/fevicol smell. The brand says there is no added fragrance so maybe it's just me. \n\nApplication: Applies smooth. Feels super super heavy on my face. I could just feel it sitting heavy on my skin. It didn’t give me any CCs. I used the rest of the tub as a body moisturizer. Great as a body moisturizer.\n\n**4/10.** The tub packaging too is disappointing. **WNRP.**\n\nIngredients: AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, CETEARETH-20, [PETROLATUM](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/petrolatum), POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, TOCOPHEROL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\nSorry for any mistakes. Let me know if I've missed any points. I'm new to reviews and English is hard.\n\nIf you have any questions about the products, please do ask.",

Feeling nako, mura ni sila’g ga-annual renewal sa ilang pagkamananambal—license to heal, gamit ang tig-tres nga kandila.\n\nAmong silingan, mag-solo glamping sa simbahan sugod Biyernes Santo hangtod Sabado Santo. Dili lang ni basta simba—magdala siyag banig, moskitero, ug thermos. Magsugod alas tres sa kadlawon, mahuman alas tres pud sa sunod nga kadlawon. Walay day-off.\n\nAko ra ning nadunggan, pero ang uban daw mokulob sa kwarto. Magdagkot og kandila, magsige og yawyaw og orasyon nga murag tongue twister: “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.”\n\nNaa puy uban moadto sa lasang pagkabuntag sa Lunes Santo. Mangolekta og ingredients aron himuon og lana: sesamum indicum seed oil, PEG-40 sorbitan peroleate, propylparaben, BHT, Isopropyl myristate. Di pud ko sure kung mao ba gyud ni. Gi-kopya ra nako ni sa likod sa akong Neutrogena Body Oil.\n\nPero naa koy nakita gyud. Gihilantan akong manghud, pero giingnan lang sa mananambal nga “Giinitan ra na. Hilanat nis sulod.” Kuyaw. Gilawayan lang og krus sa tiyan ug gi-orasyonan. Nakatawa ko ato. Pero naayo siya pagka-ugma. Ang resita? Ambot mga dahon-dahon man to nga gilapwa. \n\nUsa sa akong pinakadugay nga pangutana: nganong Holy Week man gyud ni ginabuhat? Ngano dili Pasko? Kung ang pagkatawo ni Kristo mao ang sinugdanan sa paglaum, ngano man sa iyang kamatayon magsugod ang spiritual journey sa mga mananambal?\n\n“Kay kung patay si Kristo, abri ang langit,” tubag sa akong lola.\n\nAmbot unsay meaning ani. Vague. Basin metaphysical. Basin instinct lang, sama sa pila ka kutsara nga asukar ang ibutang sa binignit inig Biyernes Santo.\n\nGi-explain pud niya: kung bugto ang tulay sa langit ug yuta, mao’y pinakasayon nga panahon makigsabot sa espiritu. Murag off-duty ang Ginoo. Maka-walk-in ang uban. No queue. No judgment.\n\nAng Kwaresma sa amoa kaniadto, dili lang kabanhawan ni Kristo. Kabanhawan pud sa tambal, mga tinuohan, ug mga katingalahan nga, tuohan man nato o dili, mopadayon lang gihapon. Ang mga orasyon, bisag wala ni follow sa Elements of Style nila Strunk ug White, makaayo gihapon sa ubo, sip-on, hilanat, ug heartbreak.\n\nKaron, halos tanan naay Bluetooth, QR code, ug wellness vlogger. Wa na koy nadungog nga mananambal nga nag-ampo sa lasang. Murag napulihan na.\n\nAng maong lana sa una, giluto sa kalaha, gi-ampoan, gihalad. Karon, makapalit na sa Shopee. Free shipping pa kung P499 and up. Sa una, ang espiritu gitawag pinaagi sa kandila ug kamot nga gipatong sa agtang. Karon, guided meditation with ambient sound. Ad-free pa kung naka-premium.\n\nAng atong henerasyon—Millennials ug Gen Zs—ni-shift og interest: from orasyon to astrology, from lana to skincare routine.\n\nNi-evolve ba ta, o ni-backslide?\n\nWala koy tubag. Pero kabalo ko, wala nay naulian sa sip-on tungod sa orasyon. Paracetamol na ron.\n\nAyaw lang gyud mo pasamad ron. Kay di na ra ba na maulian. \n\nOrasyon di kipot, halaba halipot.",

    "body": "Winters means chilly winter winds, low humidity, dry indoor heat, lowered thirst, reduced perspiration, hot showers, friction from itchy - thick clothes and perpetual dryness. Winters means dryness & cracked lips for me.\n\n[LIPPSSSSS](https://preview.redd.it/5phvc72etx661.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8a379572e84286d26fce0b36539b61233412ec8)\n\nThe prime way to fix dry lips is to increase your water intake. Lips are an extension of the throat and if you tend to often lick your lips subconsciously, it is your body's indication that it needs more water. Take my advice, I don't listen to it anyway. It is not easy to increase your water intake overnight. I struggle with drinking an adequate amount of water. A good lip product is my saviour from Sahara lips.\n\nI am ranking these lip products in order of preference.\n\n***1. Bakson's Sunny Lip Balm - ₹40***\n\nThank you @ for introducing me to this small wonder.\n\nDon't be misguided by the packaging. This lip balm is much more than your basic vaseline; It's the vaseline killer. This inexpensive lip balm provides the ideal balance of moisturisation, emollience and occlusiveness. The ingredient list is stellar. This lip balm does not just sit on my lips and lock moisture, but it also conditions my lips. It glides on my lips in a thin layer and you can immediately feel it emollize my lips. It keeps my lips hydrated for longer. I definitely need to reapply during the day but it provides immediate comfort to dry and cracked lips. Within 2-3 days of religious use, my lips are completely healed. This is the perfect lip balm to throw - in your bathroom, car, pocket, bag, and at your *'Sun yaar lip balm denaa?'* friends.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Petrolatum, Lanolin Anhydrous, Shea Butter, Souabran Glycerides, Bees Wax, Almond Oil, Vitamin E, Distillates of Aloe vera & Calendula, B.H.T., Sorbic Acid, Perfume.*\n\nAdditional tip: Lanolin makes for a great nipple balm. It is prescribed to pregnant & lactating mothers. If you suffer from dry nipples, you can use this lip balm to perk 'em up to life.\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WRP**\n\n***2. Unpa Bubi Bubi Lip Ampule - $6***\n\nIt would be on the top of my list had its competitor not been 1/10th of its price. Its name can certainly raise eyebrows, but this one packs a punch. I was pleasantly surprised by this random buy. The texture is like honey, but it is not at all sticky or goopy. It is very comfortable to apply during the day or at night. It goes on in a thin layer and adheres well to your lips. It does not just stay put and form an occlusive barrier, but a part of it descends into my lips and makes my lips moisturised & naturally plump. It helps deeply condition my lips, repairing flaky and dry skin. I had recently cut my lip, and this one helped to repair my lips overnight. I feel I do not need to reapply during the day, and it keeps my lips hydrated through the night as well. Love the tube packaging. A little goes a long way with this one, and it truly gives me baby lips. I want to repurchase this again.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Diisostearyl Malate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Castor Oil Isostearate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Microcrystalline Wax, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Dehydroacetic Acid, Ceramide NP, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Water, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hyaluronic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter*\n\n**Rating: 4.5/5, WRP**\n\n***3.  Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula - with SPF 15 - Dark Chocolate & Mint ₹130***\n\nThis lip balm has the perfect shape for a lip balm in a stick & the texture is like that of a stick of butter. It does not have the typically waxy feeling. It is highly emollient and moisturising. SPF is an added benefit as lips also need sun protection to protect from ageing, especially if you are heading outside in the sun. Perfect for throwing in your purse. The smell and flavour are surprisingly nice. Ideal for all mint chocolate lovers out there. Even though it has some chemical filters, it doesn't have an unpleasant smell or aftertaste. I feel the need to reapply during the day, but it is an enjoyable feeling due to flavour and scent. Overall I quite enjoyed this lip balm. I will repurchase.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Dimethicone 1.5%, Octinoxate 7.5%, Oxybenzone 4.5%. Inactive ingredients: mineral oil (paraffinum liquidum), microcrystalline wax (cera microcristallina ), copernicia cerifera (carnauba) wax, theobroma cacao (cocoa) seed butter, fragrance (parfum), tocopherol, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, isopropyl myristate, beta carotenex0003(CI 40800), zea mays (corn) oil, benzyl alcohol.*\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WRP**\n\n***4. The Body Shop Strawberry Lip Balm ₹250***\n\nThis used to be one of my favourite lip balms before I tried the ones above it. There is a theme here. This lip balm too adds emollience to your lips. The artificial strawberry flavour and the smell are intense and quite enjoyable in my 15-year-old brain. This lip balm has been intended for your partner to enjoy. I'm not too fond of the pot packaging, but there is enough product here to last you months. The flavours are interesting and mood uplifting. Overall it is a nice lip balm but I won't be repurchasing it because I can get something similar in a better packaging for 1/5th the price.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax, Lanolin, Parfum, Cera Alba, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Silica \\[NANO\\], Tocopheryl Acetate, Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Ammonium Glycyrrhizate, Aroma, Fragaria Vesca Fruit Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Benzoate, BHT, CI 15850, CI 15850.*\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WNRP**\n\n***5. Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask - Choco Mint ₹1150***\n\nThis popular pick used to be my holy grail lip mask two years ago. This innovative product was one of the first of its descent and ahead of its time. Its thick and goopy texture catches eyeballs. This is my second tub of this product, and if you have tried one of these you know, this lasts a lifetime. Sadly, this queen has been dethroned by Bubi Bubi Lip Ampule. I do not find myself reaching for it anymore. My relationship with this product was like a young romance. I went in starry-eyed and fell fast for the bling, but now I find myself looking for more material suitors. The texture of this is very thick & goopy, but my issue with the product is that it never truly sinks in. It stays sticky, thick and wet on your lips and once you remove it (because it won't sink in), your lips won't feel much different than when you first put it on. The feeling on your lips is not particularly pleasant. This is why you cannot use it in the day. It is a good sleeping mask for the night if you put something underneath it as works well for locking in moisture. If you are curious to try this, I recommend getting a smaller sample size as that would last you 6 months and be more pocket friendly. The mint flavour quite nice and not overpowering. The tingle is not intense. I will not be repurchasing this.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Diisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl/Isostearyl/Cetyl/Stearyl/Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax/Cera Microcristallina/Cire Microcristalline, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Synthetic Wax, Ethylene/Propylene/Styrene Copolymer, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Mica, Butylene/Ethylene/Styrene Copolymer, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax/Candelilla Cera Hydrocarbons/Cire De Candelilla, Candelilla Wax Esters, Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax/Copernicia Cerifera Cera/Cire De Carnauba, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Blue 1 Lake (Ci 42090), Limonene, Yellow 10 Lake (Ci 47005), Water/Aqua/Eau, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Linalool, Potassium Alginate, Glycerin, Propanediol, BHT, Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus Seed Extract, Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Disodium Edta, Ascorbyl Glucoside*\n\n***Rating: 3/5, WNRP***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***RiRe Bubble Bubble Mask: - Bubbling mask that does nothing. DO NOT wish to review even. Total Gimmick. I fell for it. Waste of money. STAY AWAY.***",

This was my first sunscreen I bought after leaning about photoaging! My first baby! And we were off to a good start. It’s a white watery gel-like texture, light weight, invisible, but quite shiny (some might call this a dewy finish, but I prefer a skin-like finish). A good poster child for the typical Asian sunscreen, I guess. It is not water resistant, and you'll notice this as you sweat throughout the day: It’s like your sweat becomes heavier since it mixes with the sunscreen (you can’t see this of course, but it sure feels like it). I was also worried about touching my face throughout the day, because I felt I might rub the sunscreen off. I can’t remember it ever stinging my eyes, but I’m not entirely sure. The biggest drawback for me was the prize and how inaccessible it is in my country. At this point in time, I also hadn’t learnt about the proper amount of sunscreen you have to use, so I was probably underapplying, and the sunscreen can therefore have appeared lighter-textured in my memory. It contains a lot of fragrance and many ingredients, in general, so that could be irritating. A little bit of science: If you look at the UV filters, there are several UVB filters; many UVB (290-320 wavelength/nm) filters also “bleed into” and filter some UVA II (320-340) as well. The Uvinul A plus filters both UVA II and I (340-400), but it’s also the only UVA filter in this sunscreen, and it’s also the last ranking UV filter on the ingredient list, even though I’ve read that the upper limit for Uvinul A plus is 10% (of the total product). So, is there enough UVA protection? I don’t know, but it’s probably okay since the Pa is four pluses, so I wouldn’t worry too much about it. Packaging is nice and it has a pump, and you get 75 ml, not only the standard 50 ml.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Avène Hydrance OPTIMALE UV RICHE Rich hydrating cream**\n\n* \\- **SPF 20, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **40 ml/1.35 Fl.OZ**\n* \\- **Probably suitable for darker skin tones**\n* \\- **France**\n* \\- **Ingredients:** AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA).

It does not have high enough UV protection, and it is not designed to be used as a sunscreen, and therefore you will end up underapplying. I bought it because I was looking for a day cream at the time. I wanted something for my dry skin and this day cream worked in that regard. But never did I ever apply close to the amount of sunscreen you have to apply to get the labelled SPF and UVA protection. It is on the heavier side, so applying a quarter teaspoon to your face would not feel nice. Trust me. And even then, you’d only get SPF 20. I would not recommend anyone to use this product as a daily SPF product. It also contains fragrance even though it says it’s suitable for sensitive skin.\n* \\- **Score:** 2/5\n\n**NIVEA SUN UV FACE ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS SPF 30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I must have gone though three of these. It has a lot in common with the MAKE P:REM one, and it also shares some of the same problems. It has a similar texture: white watery-gel, which turns translucent on top of the skin. It’s like a glycerine-rich moisturiser. I think it’s less shiny as well – more skin-like finish. The problem arises when you sweat: your sweat starts feeling even heavier than normal. I think I experienced some eye stinging with this sunscreen (nothing major), largely caused by it not being water resistant. It’s important to note that the reason it is so cosmetically elegant is also why it’s not water resistant. I was also scared to touch my face and accidently rub it off while wearing this one, too. It’s smells like sunscreen. If you’ve ever purchased a NIVEA sunscreen, you’ll know what I mean. And the fragrance doesn’t go away immediately either. My biggest problem at the time, was also that I wanted to find a SPF 50 sunscreen, and this one is only SPF 30. I think I’ve recently seen a SPF 50 version of this since, so if you live in Europe, I guess it’s worth giving it a shot. Looking at the ingredient list now, I see that it contains a lot of avobenzone. Avobenzone has a bad rep, but you cannot deny how effectively it protects against UVA when photostable. Avobenzone on its own is not photostable and will start degrading (and be used up) when exposed to the sun or UV light. In this sunscreen, however, (and most non-American sunscreens) it has been stabilised by another UV filter: In this case by Tinosorb S. I think this sunscreen might have much higher UVA protection than the EU requirement, which makes sense since it’s advertised as “ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS”.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Piz Buin Ultra Light Dry Touch Face Fluid SPF 30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Sweat and water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

This sunscreen survived me walking all around Madrid for a week in the middle of summer. Boom. What a trooper. The texture is a thick liquid, not a cream, so the opening is narrow so you can pour some into your hand or tilt your head backwards and pour it directly on your face. It dries to an almost powdery finish – it truly is dry touch. If you have dry skin, you should probably moisturise beforehand. It was also easy enough to reapply when I was out and about in Madrid; So, layering it wasn’t a chore. If you don’t apply it evenly it might dry down with some flakes even – that’s how dry it is. But I didn’t feel like it dried out my skin in the process, but that is of course a very personal observation. I would have been perfect if it was SPF 50, a little less expensive, and fragrance free. If you’ve ever tried a Piz Buin sunscreen, you’ll recognise their trademark fragrance at once: masculine and sunscreen-like. It does bring back good memories of summer and beaches for me personally, though.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**THE BODY SHOP Vitamin E Day Lotion SPF30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I have very pale skin (and am therefore really scared of “universal tints”), but it blended perfectly into my skin tone, perhaps with the slightest bit of coverage. Since it’s a mineral sunscreen, I’m sceptical if it’ll blend into darker skin, even with the tint, so that’s something to keep in mind. It might also have photo flashback, you have been warned. Even though it is silicone based, I wouldn’t describe it as “silicone-y”, if you know what I mean; it has a skin like finish. However, I don’t think I ever applied enough of it to truly know what its finish is like… First and foremost: the packaging. When I bought it, they still used a dropper – I repeat a dropper. This did not work, as the product would spill over, clump up at the inner edges of the bottle’s mouth, etc. And since it clumped up at the sides, I honestly don’t know if I’ve lost some of the UV protection of the product, since it’s no longer a completely homogenous liquid. They later changed the dropper to a pump, but it’s still embarrassing that they ever sold it with a dropper. What were they thinking? You also spend quite a bit of time applying it evenly on your skin, due to its consistency and tint. You kind of have to apply it like a foundation. Since it’s only 30 ml, it means that you should be finishing one of these in less than a month – and only if you’re just applying it to your face. At least it doesn’t have any fragrance! It does have an iffy smell to it, which goes away. Taking into consideration the cost, the packaging (even though it has improved) the fact that it’s not a SPF 50, PA++++ product, you’re left with a very mediocre sunscreen. It could however serve as a daily serum on top of your sunscreen, if you’re very extra.\n* \\- **Score:** 3/5\n\n**Altruist Dermatologist Sunscreen SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I had really high expectations for Altruist, same as many others, and I was let down. It isn’t that bad of a sunscreen, but it’s also not that good. At this point in my quest for the Holy grail sunscreen, I realised I had to up my UV game. SPF 30 wasn’t enough, and I wanted as high of an UVA protection as possible. With the EU’s regulation of UVA protection (in a nutshell the UVA protection has to be 1/3 of the SPF), you could, in theory, end up with SPF 30 sunscreens that had higher UVA protection than your SPF 50 sunscreen. And as a consumer, you simply wouldn’t know the difference. Anyway, Altruist SPF 50, has perfect UV protection, and no fragrance and such. In theory it’s the perfect sunscreen. I mean, look at all those filters (seriously why are there so many, did the chemists make a bet or something?) But in practice? Not so much. First and foremost, if you have darker skin, this might leave a white cast due to the titanium dioxide. Some people have mentioned this in their reviews and some people have also mentioned it stinging their eyes (I can’t remember noticing this). Secondly, the reason I didn’t like it, is because of the texture. It’s the same sort of texture as the MAKE P:REM and NIVEA mentioned above, just less cosmetically elegant. I thought it would dry down or sink into my face, but it never did. I would wait for 20 minutes, and I would still be sticky and a little bit shiny. What worked was putting a lot of translucent powder on top, then I would finally achieve a more skin like finish. Pro tip: Translucent powder can actually make most sunscreens bearable. Since it didn’t dry down, I felt as I would rub it off if my face touched anything. Maybe this sunscreen would work for people with dry skin? Since applying this sunscreen, waiting, applying powder, would take such a long time, I ended up just using a different sunscreen. And I guess that says it all. It also has a “chemical” smell to it, but that didn’t bother me. It might not have worked for my face, but it’s still a good sunscreen for the rest of the body.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Skinnies Sungel SPF30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, broad spectrum, PA++++ (PPD 16+)**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

This sunscreen utilises a new technology called Organogel™. It contains no water, and thus it doesn’t have to dry down, and you only need 1/5 the amount of a normal sunscreen. You heard that right: 1/5! So, you only need a pea-sized amount for your entire face! But I used a little bit more than that, because real peas are actually very small, so when people say pea-sized, they usually mean 2-3 real peas. A photo from their website illustrating what they meant by pea-sized confirmed my suspicion. But it’s still a very small amount! The texture is that of a see-through slightly orange-y gel. It’s oily, but it doesn’t move on your skin (also when you sweat). And it’s completely see-though so I can with confidence say it’ll suit every skin tone. It doesn’t completely dry down, though, but it does seem to sink into your skin a little bit, if you wait a couple of minutes. You can feel the gel on your skin when you touch it, but you wouldn’t notice you had anything on otherwise. Since it isn’t water based it also feels sturdier than the others I’ve tried, so I wasn’t as scared of it rubbing off when touching my skin. I think it might work very well as a primer. It has a slight “chemical” smell, it also doesn’t contain any perfume or any nonsense like that. It’s on the pricier side, but one 100ml bottle is actually the equivalent of 500ml of normal sunscreen, when you think about it, so I think the prize is justifiable. This was the sunscreen I kept on using when the Altruist one wasn’t working for me, by the way. It’s definitely the quickest sunscreen to apply of all the sunscreens I’ve ever used. A con is that is a little bit difficult to gauge if you are using enough, and that you’ve applied it evenly. Turns out there are two versions of this sunscreen: An American one and a New Zealand one. I somehow ended up with the American one, and it has worked just fine for me. The NZ version uses non-FDA approved filters, but it still has the same UVB and UVA protection listed, but I would still recommend you buy the NZ version, since there must be a reason why they chose to not just use the same formulation as the American one, right? Since I bought my bottle, they have also released many new products, like an SPF 50+. If the SPF 50+ behaves the same way as this one, I think I might have given it a score of 5/5. But keep in mind that it does not have a dry-touch finish (more of an immovable oily finish), but at least it has a sturdy one.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**The Balm BALMSHELTER TINTED MOISTURIZER (Shade: Lighter Than Light)**\n\n* \\- **SPF 18, broad spectrum**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **64 ml/ 2.15 Fl.

It’s really is a pale shade (it appears darker before you spread it over your skin), and it blends perfectly into my skin: I’ve never seen a tinted moisturiser or BB cream this fair before. However, it is so sheer, that the tint almost doesn’t matter. A little goes a long way, and that’s why you shouldn’t really use BB creams, tinted moisturisers and foundation as UV shields. I intended on using this on top of my sunscreen, but since it has next to none coverage, I never find myself reaching for it. If you’re pale as I am, and you want to experience the novelty of owning a tinted moisturiser, this is a good pick.

This sunscreen was bought in Europe. America/Canada/Australia/Asia might have a different version of this sunscreen, because of the country’s different restrictions on UV filters and sunscreen criteria (especially American sunscreens). These versions are not always equal, both in UV protection and cosmetic elegance. It also turns out that I have bought two versions of this sunscreen: A new and an older version. I actually bought the newest version first – and I loved it. I couldn’t understand how people hated it (the skincare community is very split when it comes to the Shaka fluid). Of course, everyone’s skin is difference and can have a lot to say on how a sunscreen feels and behaves on the skin. It’s a fluid, so you have to shake it thoroughly. It takes a little bit longer to apply, since it’s a fluid. It dries down matte, and you can’t see that you’re wearing anything. Easy peasy. Its biggest downfall is the prize (I bought it on sale) and that it only comes in a tiny 50ml, so you can’t buy it in bulk, so to speak. But this was the newest version (as of this year)… and then I ended up accidently buying the older version online (which might still be in production?), and oh boy, was that a different experience! Not dry-touch, but oily! They looked so similar, but I instantly felt the difference on my face, because it didn’t dry down. Absolutely horrible in comparison, I felt so gross. You can tell the new version from the old from the packaging: The newest version has “ANTI-OXYDANT” written underneath the “UVB + UVA” text. It has a similar texture as the Piz Buin mentioned above, but I personally think the Piz Buin is superior in texture: even more dry-touch. But the shaka outshines almost all sunscreens in terms of UVB and UVA protection, and it doesn’t have any irritating fragrance to boot. I thought this would be my final HG sunscreen, because it couldn’t get any better in terms of UV protection and cosmetic elegance.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5 (new “ANTI-OXYDANT” version, 2019) (old version: 4/5, because it still has great UV protection, okay?)\n\n**EVY TECHNOLOGY SUNSCREEN MOUSSE SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I found it. Perfect texture, high UV protection, and relatively affordable. It also comes in a 100 ml bottle, not a 50 ml, which I appreciate. According to EVY, their sunscreens work differently than other sunscreens, because they don’t lay on top of your skin and form a film, but instead they sink into the skin (stratum corneum, I presume). Because of this, they’re very water resistant and sturdy. You shake the bottle, turn it upside down, and squeeze out a golf ball-sized blob of mousse. (This mousse holds its shape pretty well and you can play with it.) Then I just rub the mousse into my face: first it turns into a light-weight white cream… and then it disappears into the skin. After a couple of minutes, there is no trace of it, but if I’ve applied to much there might be some stickiness. It certainly feels like it sinks into the skin, because it’s very hydrating. The other sunscreens I’ve liked, I’ve liked for their dry-touch finish, but with EVY I don’t need to worry about it, because I can’t feel it on my face when I touch (well, technically my face feels like it’s been hydrated) and it doesn’t do anything when I sweat. A Youtuber reviewed EVY and said that the Boots star system is only marketing – it’s not. While we have a universal measurement of UVB: SPF, we’ve later realised that UVA also causes skin damage and cancer, but we still haven’t been able to agree on one universal measurement or requirement. The Boots Star Rating system with a maximum of 5 stars requires much higher UVA protection than the European Recommendation, where the UVA protection only needs to be 1/3 of the SPF. Gothamista, however, really liked EVY. It has no fragrance, but a light aerosol smell that goes away. Because of the packaging, no preservatives are needed. It also contains some antioxidants. I’m already on my third bottle of EVY, and I will continue to purchase it in the future.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5\n\nSome sunscreens I’ve heard good things about and might want to try one day: Anessa sunscreens, Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50 PA ++++, Ultrasun sunscreens, Bioderma Photoderm Max Cream SPF50+.",

    "body": "Fyrinnae just released their [Spring 2020 collection](http://fyrinnae.com/spring-2020/) which includes 1 new gloss shade, 5 new perfumes, and 7 new eyeshadows (3 also available pressed).\n\n**Molten Gloss**\n\n* Hyakinthos - *soft plum filled with vivid lime green shimmer which turns the gloss lighter bright pink at an angle or closer to light*\n\n**Perfumes**\n\n* Narcissus' Reflection - *brilliant daffodils and fragrant carnations in organic soil brighten up a warm, rainy day*\n* Hyakinthos - *sweet hyacinth dominates gentle notes of patchouli, resins, Himalayan and Atlas cedarwoods, oud, and amber*\n* Killiney Hill - *cold, salty air off Dublin Harbour, with green shrubs, clover, and early wildflowers dotting the rough hillsides*\n* Wicklow Wildflowers - *various blooms such as wild orchids, thyme, and clover, easily found among fields of greenery throughout spring*\n* Dianthus - *the spicy-sweet scent of carnations (a species of dianthus), with soft hints of freesia, black tea, and honey*\n\n**Eyeshadows**\n\n* Narcissus' Reflection (loose + pressed) - *vivid coral-orange is topped with gleaming golden shimmer*\n* Killiney Hill (loose) - *shimmering gold and warm green over a darker olive background.*\n* Wicklow Wildflowers (loose) - *shimmering lilac-purple. Leans warm, but not too pink*\n* Dianthus (loose + pressed) - *bright pink with a high shimmer finish*\n* Tulip Crimson (loose) - *bright cool red with a satiny finish*\n* Snowdrops (loose + pressed) - *medium leafy green with a softly shimmering finish*\n* St. Stephen's Green (loose) - *light, shimmery sage green is filled with subtle red sparkle*\n\n---\n\nThey've also re-released their [Ancient Rome](http://fyrinnae.com/perfumes/ancient-rome/) collection from 2017. From the website:\n\n*Centering around Campania prior to 62CE, this collection is based on actual ancient Roman perfumes and fragrant flora, with a few slight variations added in. Some ingredients which were often used as skin scents, such as basil and labdanum, are in several blends, and we chose mostly plants native to the region, even though they did have imported botanicals, resins, and other fragrant ingredients once trade was established with distant lands (or they went over and conquered...). While these fragrances do contain a carrier of isopropyl myristate, none of the fragrance ingredients are synthetic.This does mean a heightened chance for skin sensitivity, and we recommend spot testing prior to wearing. Oils containing citrus (bergamot, lime, orange, etc) should not be worn on skin directly exposed to sunlight*\n\nI actually have tried all of these from the previous release, so here's some quick reviews along with the descriptions:\n\n**Ancient Rome**\n\n* Via dell'Abbondanza  - *fresh basil atop labdanum with an air of warmer herbs and roots, and just the slightest hint of lime* \n>The tulsi is bright and herbal on top and sticks around for a good while! Underneath this is very labdanum-heavy, spicy and woody and warm. I get zero lime, instead I feel like there might be a touch of clove and/or ginger? Reminds me very strongly of an apothecary full of interesting roots and herbs.\n\n* Salacia's Silken Stolla - *thyme honey, a rich herbal and sweet-wood aroma reminiscent of honey made from the thyme flowers bees love (which is still produced in Sicily and Greece)*\n>This reads very in-your-face-thyme to me at the beginning, and I really have to huff it to get any sweetness. That fades pretty quickly though and the honey shows up to make it more of a \"thyme honey\" scent rather than \"HERE'S A BUNCH OF THYME and the honey's over there somewhere.\" You have to like both notes, but it's absolutely lovely if you do!\n\n* Nymphaeum - *slightly sweet citrus peels, a hint of relaxing chamomile, honey-sweetness, and a sprig of holy basil*\n>Bright citrus at the top (my best guess is mandarin orange + lemon). That fades pretty quickly and the scent ends up as chamomile/honey/tulsi basil (definitely tulsi and not true basil as in House of the Vettii). Reminds me a lot of an herbal tea with honey, very warm and comforting. A good going-to-sleep scent that for once doesn't feature lavender.\n\n* The Grace Of Abundantia - *honey drizzled on oranges, sage from Hispania, with gentle touches of coriander, saffron, and sweet resin*\n> I love Fyrinnae's honey note and this is no exception, it's lightly sweet and resiny but not cloying. Not getting much orange, but lots of sage over peppery coriander and a hint of saffron in the base. Mostly herbal, not too sweet!\n\n* House Of The Vettii - *a summer evening outdoors, sharing an oak barrel of wine from Gaul with guests donning sweet basil perfumes. Slightly musky, earthy scents of sun-warmed tiles and stone become apparent as the air cools*\n>A very true basil note right off the bat, and underneath there's some nutty oak. The wine comes through more round-and-fruity and almost balsamic than super boozy. As it wears longer I get more of a dry earthy note that is probably supposed to be the stone/tile? Not sure what it is, it's pretty subtle. You have to really like basil for this one.\n\n* Sylvanus - *geranium and thyme make a slightly spicy, warm woodsy-floral aroma, with sharpness softened by sweet resins and labdanum*\n>Sharp and bright geranium and herbal thyme (though not as thyme-y as Salacia's Silken Stola). The base is very resinous and woody. I'm not really sure what to say about this one, as I find the description to be very accurate, what-you-see-is-what-you get. This is probably my favorite in the collection, and I'm so glad it's back!\n\n* Temple Of Vesta - *geranium and bitter orange topped with marjoram and other garden herbs resting on a sweet resinous base* \n>Not as sharp a geranium as in Sylvanus, but it blends very nicely with the (juicy) bitter orange! There's a sort of crisp mint-but-not-mint scent that's probably the marjoram and is making it go a little medicinal. It's rare that I find a scent that's too herbal for me, but something about this blend is turning me off.\n\n* Gardens Of Herculaneum - *blooming herbs in the gardens including basil and helichrysum, an early summer breeze carrying the scent of evergreens and a touch of soil, all softened by a hint of roses*\n>Starts with a ~classic italian seasoning~ sharp rosemary/thyme/basil sort of scent, and maybe coriander?  I'm definitely getting more juniper berries than juniper leaves, and just a wisp of damp roses in the background. Smells like a fancy spice aisle next to the fancy florist in a fancy supermarket!\n\nIn general, you really have to like herbs/citrus/honey for most of these scents - there's a lot of overlap in notes and they definitely all smell related, if each a little different. You probably don't need them all unless you're like me and aspire to smell like an herb garden in summer at all times!",

Many of us use KT tape, adhesive bandages, etc, etc. All of which can tug and tear skin when you pull it off. \n\nThis is where I can help a bit with my experience as a special effects makeup artist. When you spend your time supergluing stuff to people's faces, you learn how to remove said superglue without harming the face underneath. \n\nThe product we use for removal is called Isopropyl myristate or oily 99. It is a ester of isopropyl alcohol, and will disolve pretty much any adhesive you throw at it, and won't dry out your skin, and is unlikely to cause a reaction. The tape will fall off your skin as if it were never stuck on in the first place. Just use a cheap art brush from Walmart to gently get the liquid under the edge of the tape and the isopropyl myristate will do the rest, no tugging or pulling necessary. \n\nI hope this can help some people.",

    "body": "# Why now?\n\nIn the midst of the covid-19 pandemic, supply channels are disrupted worldwide. It is hard to receive shipments. Some people lost their jobs and are without health insurance. Also, drugs are way overpriced.\n\n# Why brew?\n\nEven outside a pandemic, why give your hard earned money to some doctor just so they can write a piece of paper for you to take to a pharmacy? Do you enjoy some clown in a white jacket lecturing you on what you should do with your body and your money? Do you appreciate that pharmacies refuse to sell you drugs you've been taking for years if you don't have the magical piece of paper of if it's expired? Do you like this system created by big pharma under the pretense of \"your safety\" while it's just to profit from you? We don't.\n\n# Why say \"brewing\" instead of making?\n\nBecause it evokes DIY like making beer or cooking drugs at home. This means it may or may not be illegal where you live. Not our problem.\n\n# Why brew a gel instead of pills?\n\nBecause when swallowed, pills are subject to a first pass in the liver. Besides being bad for the liver, this makes estrone, which can give blood clots. Letting pills dissolve sublingually is a poor workaround, as you'll always swallow some.\n\n# Why brew a gel instead of an injectable?\n\nBecause of safety first. It is almost impossible to create safely an injectable at home. Sterilization requires many specialized tools like autoclaves, UV lights, aspiration - a pressure cooker in your kitchen is not enough. Even professionals get bacteria or fungal contamination in their batches sometimes. Even if you managed to reduce the risks to some level you find acceptable, what do you know about the contamination of the active substance you acquired? It is very easy for say a virus to sneak in. Contamination during the industrial manufacturing process is also impossible to control without lab tests you can't afford. Also, not everybody is comfortable injecting, and it can be hard to buy syringes in some places, even if insulin syringes can often be found OTC at places like walmart.\n\n# Why brew a gel at all given these risks?\n\nWith a transdermal gel, you bypass the liver. You put nothing in your mouth or your veins. Your skin is nature best defense against various infections. It is not perfect, but far less risky than the alternatives. Also, the alcohol in the formula will prevent bacterial and fungal contamination\n\n# What is the goal?\n\nThe composition will be based on https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=762ac371-bb8b-47e7-b48f-e80d452c9dd4 \n\n# So is it a generic (a copy) of the commercial drug?\n\nNo. Given than most people need more than one dose from the usual estrogel 0.06%, the recipes will aim to make 0.12% estrogel instead.\n\n# Is it dangerous? Will I get in trouble with the DEA?\n\nMaybe? The nih.gov website says \"unscheduled\", so it's not a controlled substance. But we're not doctors or lawyers. Did nobody warn you about following advice from random people on the internet? For us, your body, your rules. Don't do something if you're not comfortable with the risks you are taking.\n\n# What to buy\n\nAccessibility is the #1 goal. The recipe and material required should be as cheap and simple as possible for all the readers not in rich countries, or on a fixed income.\n\nBefore wasting 99% pure hormone, you may want to buy the 98% pure version made for animal use, to test your instruments, your skills, and the lack of precipitates in the final version.\n\nPreliminary research suggest a $3.99 milk frothier from Ikea will be required if you can't afford a  magnetic stirrer going at 2000 rpm, which according to /u/HiddenStill would be the ideal tool to mix cf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_stirrer\n\nA precision scale would be handy for excipients measured in tenth of grams ; if you can't get that, dilute in water and use divisions with a measuring glass like what is used for cooking : if you have 2g of something and want 1.5g, dissolve in 10 ml of water, then keep 10*1.5/2 = 7.5 ml. \n\nTo avoid oxydation of estradiol into estrone, the final gel will have to be protected from air. As recommended by /u/caissonposting, get a few airless cosmetic dispensers for storage. The way they're built is like a syringe with a pump on top, so the reservoir shrinks as the contents are used, keeping air out instead letting it in to fill up the extra space. The metered pump also makes for consistent dosing. Can be bought on amazon or similar sites.\n\n# A: No recipe\n\nIt should be possible to just add some estradiol and maybe a penetration enhancer in a base of Purell, however the use of denaturing agent could be a problem. More research is needed to see if it precipitates. This is plan A.\n\n# B: Riskier recipe\n\nWe are trying to understand a patent that use an acid/ester mix to drive the hormones into the dermis, with more ester allowing for a longer half life, meaning a longer release, with a smaller volume, meaning it would be faster and easier to apply. This is HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL, we haven't mixed anything yet, we are just trying to understand how it works. Please help us if you can. This is plan B.\n\n# C: Simpler recipe\n\nIt should be possible to just mix hormones and alcohol to create a spray, as was used in Eastern Europe before. This is plan C.\n\n# YOLO, gimme the default recipe!\n\nIt is a work in progress, but better than any of the alternative plans as we will just make a generic of what is know to be safe and to work. Depending on your finance and your tolerance for risks, it will cost you between $8 and $60 in raw ingredients for a 2 year supply.\n\nFor 100g at 0.12% based on line 171 and page 39 of\nhttps://patents.google.com/patent/US20070154533A1/en which will also be similar to the US Estreva 0.1% and from line 261 from US20190160077A1 which will also be similar to the UK Estrogel 0.06% (so we double up the estradiol)\n\nDissolve in order, making sure you have the correct weight first :\n\n- 17 beta estradiol (active principle) : 0.12 g\n\n- ethanol (lower alcohol, could also be isopropanol) : 59 ml  (or 40%?)\n\n- add purified water to reach 100 ml total\n\n- carbomer 980 (thickener or gelling agent, could also be carboxymethylcellulose or  another polyacrylic acid like 934P or maybe even sepimax zen, with some adaptation of the recipe) : 1g\n\n- triethanolamine (neutralizing agent for the carbomer) : 1.35g  cf  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triethanolamine\n\nWe are looking at 3 alternative plans called plan A, B, C as indicated above: respectively for more simplicity, more concentration, and a spray.\n\n# X, Z: What about guys?\n\nftm can substitute testosterone or DHT for estradiol in the formula, but they need to add a penetration enhancer: Isopropyl myristate 0.50g  \n\nPlease also check https://patents.google.com/patent/EP1317921B1 if you need more details about how andractim is made, be sure to read from line 47 explaining how to make a 70kg batch and adjust depending on how much you want to make!\n\nWe are looking at 2 alternative plans called plan Z and Y for more concentration and for a spray\n\n# I found an error in the recipe!\n\nPlease immediately make a reply explaining what and how, this way nobody else will risk making the same error. Then please make a post to call our attention to the error, so we can try to fix it.",

        "body": "Super glad to find this sub. I've been diving into patents and journal articles to better understand the current state of the art, initially aiming to make a divigel equivalent with propylene glycol as the cosolvent/permeation enhancer. Still haven't nailed down the formula though. Everything concrete I've found so far either has other additives or only uses one or the other. \n\n[This study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/016836599500062D) \nshows that propylene glycol also has the benefit of allowing the creation of supersaturated solution of estradiol, which is probably why estrogel (ethanol only) is 0.06% while divigel (+ PEG) is 0.1%. The supersaturation and increased permeation seem to be correlated, so the same effect is also likely true with other permeation enhancers.\n\nThe trick with supersaturated solutions is that they may be unstable and precipitate. 60%w/w was the highest PEG:water they could get without that, though they also used some stabilizing additives.\n\nMost of the formulas I have seen seem to use ~5-10%w/w propylene glycol, ~45%w/w ethanol, ~40%w/w water, ~1.5%w/w carbomer. \n\nI'm looking at getting a magnetic stirrer instead of a frother, also. The supersaturation study stirred their pre-carbomer mixture for 3 days at 32°C, which is probably overkill, but ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯",

        "body": "For the simplest, immediate-release formula, why not use a vegetable oil as a carrier? Steroid hormones are highly soluble in fatty acids so solubility is no issue. You can dilute as needed and put the solution in a pump that dispenses 1mL at a time. [This paper](https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addr.2012.09.032) specifically mentions that fatty acids have been used as penetration enhancers for progesterone and estradiol. [This site](https://www.biosrx.com/collections/all/products/topi-dispenser-pump?variant=18705008451) sells pharmaceutical grade topical dose dispensers for those looking for a source.\n\nI haven't tried this, but I've also thought about a method for extracting a hormone from pills intended for oral consumption. This could in theory be used as a method to stretch out a prescription of oral estrogen if you run out due to a shortage or other reason, or (again in theory) it could be used to create a dose and concentration of your choice. The dilution calculations are dead simple.\n\nPour hot water over, say, ten pills, and let it digest for twenty-four hours or so. Then add a measured quantity of any vegetable oil and shake it all up. Steroid hormones are nearly insoluble in water, so all the hormones will be dissolved in the oil layer, and all the water soluble or insoluble components of the pill will fall to the bottom or dissolve in the aqueous layer. Then you let it settle. You fraction off the oil layer, then discard the aqueous layer. Then you can either use it as-is, or as a standard solution that you can dilute to your needs.\n\nAnother benefit of this is that the solution is anhydrous, and if you store it properly, nothing is going to be able to grow in it.\n\nGood call on avoiding DMSO. DMSO is most useful for topical application of drugs that otherwise might have a real hard time getting past the lipid layer of the skin. But steroid hormones are quite lipophilic and penetrate the skin fairly easily, so there's no need to get too fancy with your choice of penetration enhancers.",

    "body": "Hair Type: Thin, 2B/C Curl Patterns, Oily scalp, prone to hairfall\n\nSome hair background:\nSo I switched to using silicone and sulphate free haircare on a whim back in 2017. To my surprise, this changed my previously mostly straight hair to pretty curly. I learnt about CGM afterwards but since that seemed like a lot of effort, I just stuck to using CG friendly products and was happy with what my hair looked like. Cut to 3 months ago, when I moved to a new place with a really humid climate and my hair fall became like 10 fold. I tried going back to products that had worked for me in the past but nothing helped. Eventually, I thought, that the increased frizziness caused by humidity was the cause of the hair fall and since no product seemed to make my hair soft and silky like before, I decided to go back to silicones. A combination that helped my hair fall to some extent was Bblunt Intense Moisture Shampoo (the blue one) and Loreal Professional Serie Quinoa Protein Hair Mask (used this as conditioner after every wash). But this combination also did make my hair straighter than it had been in recent years. Decided to give the BBlunt Curly Hair range a try (the pink color one). This range does contain Silicones, so it is not strictly CG friendly but it has worked for me. I do not use any leave-in products to style my hair, but I don't mind some frizz. The curls I get from just these 3 products are pretty impressive, as good as any other CG friendly shampoo/conditioners I have used in the past. And my hair fall though still not as less as it was 6 months ago, is definitely better. Details below.\n\n1) Bblunt Curly Hair Prepoo (Pink and white tub packaging)\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aloe Vera Extract, Cocos (Coconut)Water, Aayla mido propyltrimonium Chloride/Acrylamide Copolymer, Citric Acid, PEG-90M, Parfum (Perfume)\n\nThoughts: Definitely my favourite of the 3. I have been looking for a  pre-shampoo product to add to my routine. Oiling and Aloeing have not worked for me. I have previously used some hair masks that said they can be used before shower but they were thick and creamy and impossible to spread properly on semi-wet or dry hair. THIS product is everything I wanted. It is a gel-like consistency, spreads super easily. I usually brush out my hair before showering and this is when I lose the most hair. Since this product claims at helping in detangling I decided to use this before I brush my hair and the hair I lost was significantly less! During and post-shower, my hair maintains great slip!  This has the potential to be HG for me. It has a pleasant coconutty smell, but the fragrances in these products do not last too long, which is nice (The loreal mask makes my hair smell like a salon even 2 days later).\n\nRepurchase Status: WRP Definitely!\n\n2) Bblunt Curly Hair Shampoo (Pink Tube)\n\nIngredients: Aqua (Water), Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Cocamidopropyl Retain, Decyl Glucoside, Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Glycol Distearate, Glycerin, Acrylates Copolymer, Cocamide MEA, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipropylene Glycol, PEG-150 Distearate, Polysilicone-29, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-7, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Menthol, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panthenol, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cocoyl Sarcosine,TriticumVulgare (Wheat) Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Polysorbate-20, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Polysorbate-80, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Parfum (Perfume).\n\nThoughts: It is a shampoo that does its job. It cleans my oily scalp well without stripping it too much. It does not lather and spread as well as the blue BBlunt shampoo but that is to be expected as this one does not have SLS. One thing I have to mention is that near my roots this is the only product from the 3 that I used, and I noticed that the hair in that area did have some curls (usually hair close to my roots does not curl up), so this shampoo is definitely doing something right. Smells pretty fresh (like a cactus? or something softer than that lol) cant describe it. But again the smell does not linger post-shower.\n\nRepurchase Status: Maybe (I have a bunch of other shampoos lying around that I have to finish up first post-monsoon. If using any of those increases my hair fall again, will return to this)\n\n3) Bblunt Curly Hair Conditioner (Pink Tube)\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Amodimethicone, Behentrimonium, Methosulfate, Isopropyl Myristate, Dimethicone, Almond Oil, Polyquaternium-10, Silicone Quaternium, Polyquaternium-7, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cococoyl Satosire, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Polysorbate-20, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Panthenol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, MAgnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Trideceth-12, Laureth-23, Laureth-4, Polyglyceryl-3 Caprate, Dipropylene Glycol, Perfume\n\nThoughts: When I first used it I felt like it was super light and would not do much conditioning, but to my surprise when I rinsed it out, my hair had great slip, and detangled very easily. Some of that I will say must be because of the prepoo, but this conditioner also must be contributing. I guess since I was using the super thick loreal mask as conditioner previously, that's why this conditioner feels very light to me, but if it's doing its job, then it's ok of course. This smells like something sweet... white chocolate or marzipan. Overall I like it, and in combination with the prepoo, my hair is a lot softer than the loreal mask. \n\nRepurchase Status: Probably (again have a bunch of conditioners, i wish to use up first)\n\nI am a bit confused that even with silicones, how do these products work so well in giving me curls. Maybe I just don't know enough about how silicones work. But if with continued use I feel like silicone buildup is weighing my hair down, I can use my Fix My Curls Cleansing Shampoo once in a while, I guess.",

But if with continued use I feel like silicone buildup is weighing my hair down\n\nThat's because silicones are not the devil that cg hair community paints them out to be... Silicones are nothing but emollients just like natural oils that cg community likes to sing praises about... Except silicones are better than natural oils at their job of calming down the frizz and are lighter. And about weighing down, would your hair feel weighed down if you continuously apply oil without washing it off? Yes, yes you will. And what are oils again? Emollients same as a silicones. You see the similarity and the comparison. It took me a while to get out of the influencer-fed info that SILICONES WILL ABSOLUTELY DESTROY CURLY HAIR... Because I use sulphate free shampoo (wow shampoo at that) and silicone conditioner and feel no difference.\n\nSome people cannot tolerate silicones because that's how their *individual* hair is... Just like some people can't tolerate hyaluronic acid or a niacinamide serum. But this fear of silicones and this blanket statement that silicones are bad for curly hair comes from lack of education and knowledge about them. And if you have any doubt, feel free to ask.",

I know that The Morbid the Merrier (Sugar and Spite's previous incarnation) used sweet almond oil as their carrier oil, and my bottles from them went rancid within a couple of years.

I'm not entirely sure what this entails, but I've never had a BPAL go bad on me (gradually lose top notes, yes). They also have good throw/longevity for me. Does anyone know what NAVA uses?

The primary objective of this project is to facilitate low-cost, readily accessible HRT options for transgender individuals.\n\nDuring the project design phase, we established the following objectives:\n\n* Develop a gel formulation with characteristics similar to commercial Estreva 0.1%, noted for its excellent dermal absorption\n* Increase the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) content per gram to reduce the amount of gel required, thereby enhancing convenience for transgender individuals who typically apply larger quantities compared to AFAB menopausal users\n* Ensure rapid cutaneous absorption to minimize user discomfort\n* Minimize skin irritation and dryness to the greatest extent possible\n\n# Final recipe (percentage in W/W)\n\n**APIs**:\n\n* 0.3 % Estradiol anhydrous (50-28-2) or Estradiol hemihydrate (CAS 35380-71-3)\n\n**Solvents and penetration enhancer**:\n\n* 45% Ethanol >= 96% (CAS 64-17-5), primary solvent\n* 6% Propylene glycol (CAS 57-55-6), helps maintain the skin’s moisture balance and aids in dissolving the active ingredient. It also improves transdermal absorption\n* 5% Diethylene Glycol Monoethyl Ether/Transcutol® P (CAS 111-90-0), enhances drug solubility and skin permeation, thereby facilitating the delivery of estradiol through the skin\n* 2% Isopropyl myristate (CAS 110-27-0), improves the skin absorption of the active ingredient by altering stratum corneum lipid structure\n\n**Gelling and neutralizing agents**:\n\n* 1.4% Carbopol® 974P (CAS 9003-01-4), it is a pharmaceutical grade gelling and thickener agent. It can be replaced, taking care with viscosity and PH, with Carbopol 980 or 940\n* \\~0.35% Triethanolamine (CAS 102-71-6), raises the pH of the formulation, converting the acidic carbomer into its salt form, which leads to the development of the gel and the appropriate viscosity.\n\n**Chelating and antioxidant agents**:\n\n* 0.1% Disodium EDTA (CAS 6381-92-6), binds metal ions that can catalyze degradation reactions. Improves the overall chemical stability and shelf life of the product.\n* 0.1% DL-alpha-Tocopherol/Vitamin E (CAS 10191-41-0), an antioxidant that protects both the active ingredient and excipients from oxidative degradation. Also offers additional skin-conditioning benefits.\n\n**Dyes**:\n\n* Brilliant blue FCF/E133 (CAS 3844-45-9), It is a safe blue colorant and it is used to ensure the correct homogeneity of the final gel.\n\nAdd approximately 40.2% distilled water until you reach 100% of the desired amount to produce.\n\n# Production instructions\n\nBelow is a detailed procedure for preparing 100 g of a transdermal gel with the specified composition.  It is advisable to perform quality control tests (e.g., pH, appearance, content uniformity) and validate process conditions where appropriate.\n\nThe production requires two distinct phases (aqueous phase and alcoholic phase) which must be prepared in separate beakers and then combined.\n\n**Preparation of the aqueous phase**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 30g of distilled water\n* 0.1g of Disodium EDTA\n* 1.4g of Carbopol® 974P\n* 0.005g of FD&C Blue No. 1\n\n1. Weigh and dissolve Disodium EDTA\n   * In a clean beaker, accurately weigh 0.1 g of Disodium EDTA\n   * Add approximately 30g of distilled water (out of the total 40.2 g)\n   * Stir using a magnetic or mechanical stirrer at moderate speed until the EDTA is fully dissolved\n2. Incorporate the FD&C Blue No. 1\n   * Add 0.005g of FD&C Blue to the solution under continuous stirring\n   * Ensure the dye disperses homogeneously\n3. Disperse the Carbopol 974P\n   * Gradually add 1.4g of Carbopol to the aqueous solution (EDTA + dye) while stirring to avoid clumping\n   * Stir for at least 30 minutes to allow complete hydration of the Carbopol polymer\n   * Make sure there are no visible dry particles or agglomerates before proceeding\n\n**Preparation of the alcoholic phase**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 45g of Ethanol 96%\n* 6g of Propylene Glycol\n* 5g of Transcutol P\n* 2g of Isopropyl Myristate\n* 0.3g of Estradiol\n* 0.1g of Tocopherol (Vitamin E)\n\n1. Solubilize Estradiol\n   * Weigh 0.30 g of Estradiol\n   * In a separate beaker, measure out the required amount of 96% ethyl alcohol (45.00 g)\n   * It is best to make sure the ethanol is at least 25°, consider heating it up to 25/35° if it is colder\n   * Gradually add the Estradiol to the ethanol under moderate stirring.\n   * Stir until the Estradiol is completely dissolved before proceeding (\\~30 minutes)\n2. Add penetration enhancer/co-solvents\n   * After the Estradiol has fully dissolved in ethanol, add: Propylene glycol (6g), Transcutol P (5g) and Isopropyl Myristate (2g)\n   * Mix thoroughly to ensure proper dispersion and miscibility of all components\n3. Add Tocopherol (Vitamin E)\n   * Weigh 0.10 g of Vitamin E\n   * Add to the alcoholic/co-solvent mixture, continuing to stir until fully homogenized\n\n**Combining the phases**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* \\~10g of distilled water\n* \\~0.35g of Triethanolamine\n\n1. Incorporate the alcoholic phase into the Carbopol aqueous phase\n   * With the stirrer running at moderate speed, slowly pour the alcoholic mixture (containing Estradiol, penetration enhancer/co-solvents, and Vitamin E) into the Carbopol aqueous phase\n   * Maintain a consistent stirring speed to avoid excessive foaming or lump formation\n   * Ensure the mixture becomes homogeneous, controlling it thanks to the dye\n2. Neutralize with Triethanolamine\n   * Weigh around 0.35 g of Triethanolamine.\n   * Add it dropwise to the combined mixture, monitoring pH and viscosity as you proceed.\n   * The viscosity will gradually increase as the Carbopol is neutralized.\n   * Continue stirring with a glass stirring rod until a smooth, uniform gel is formed and the desired consistency is achieved.\n   * It is not necessary to add all 0.35gr of Triethanolamine, the ideal is to add as much as needed to obtain a PH around 6.5 (5.5-7.0 max). Always check the viscosity of the gel, it must not be too liquid but not too thick either.\n3. Add remaining water and adjust the final weight\n   * Add the remaining distilled water gradually (you initially used about 30g, so approximately 9.8g remain to reach 100g), until the total weight reaches 100g\n   * Stir with a glass stirring rod for a few more minutes to ensure complete homogenization\n\n**Final checks and packaging**\n\n* Measure the PH of the gel. If necessary, adjust by adding small amounts of Triethanolamine (to raise pH), aiming for the desired range (commonly around pH 5.5–7.0, preferably 6.5)\n* Verify the gel is free from visible particles, has a uniform color, and no phase separation.\n* Transfer the finished gel into suitable containers (e.g. airless pumps). We use an airless bottle that delivers 0.2g per pump so 0.6mg of estradiol per pump, which is a great dose to allow you to choose precisely how many mg you want.\n\n# Mini amateur research study about our gel\n\nWe conducted a study on ourselves (3 people) to evaluate at a preliminary level the effectiveness of our product compared to commercial gels.\n\nAll study participants are AMAB, without particular health problems, with regularly functioning testicles and did not use antiandrogens, progestins, other forms of estrogen, or any other compounds that may affect the endocrine system for at least 6 months.\n\nEach study participant used the tested gel continuously once a day for seven days before performing the tests. The tests were performed with blood tests 24 hours after application (minimum measurement).\n\nAll study candidates applied the gel to their skin trying to cover as little area as possible to increase absorption.\n\nThe following transdermal gels were tested:\n\n* Commerical Sandrena 0.1%\n* Commercial Estreva 0.1%\n* Our gel 0.5% (same composition as above, just rebalanced water)\n* Our gel 0.3%\n\n|Candidates|Daily dose (mg/day)|Estradiol level after 24h (pg/mL)|Testosterone level after 24h (ng/dL)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C1, Sandrena 0.1%|3mg, scrotal application|189|63|\n|C1, Estreva 0.1%|3mg, scrotal application|234|46|\n|C1, our gel 0.5%|3mg, scrotal application|201|43|\n|C1, our gel 0.3%|3mg, scrotal application|267|45|\n|C2, Sandrena 0.1%|4mg, inner thigh  application|155|78|\n|C2, Estreva 0.1%|4mg, inner thigh  application|180|55|\n|C2, our gel 0.5%|4mg, inner thigh  application|139|84|\n|C2, our gel 0.3%|4mg, inner thigh  application|178|57|\n|C3, Sandrena 0.1%|4mg, inner thigh  application|196|56|\n|C3, Estreva 0.1%|4mg, armpits application|203|41|\n|C3, our gel 0.5%|4mg, armpits application|184|61|\n|C3, our gel 0.3%|4mg, armpits application|208|40|\n\n**Findings:**\n\n* The commercial gel Sandrena 0.1% was found, in all candidates, to have a worse bioavailability than the commercial gel Estreva 0.1%. This is easily explained by the lack of highly effective penetration enhancer in Sandrena\n* Our 0.3% gel has been shown, in our small candidate pool, to be comparable to the commercial Estreva 0.1% gel in terms of estradiol bioavailability/absorption\n* Our 0.5% gel was shown to have lower absorption (compared to our 0.3% version) of the active ingredient in all study candidates, we hypothesize that the skin area was oversaturated. Further studies increasing Isopropyl Myristate could be interesting\n* No gel in the study caused any problematic skin reactions, no significant dryness of the skin was observed\n\nWe are now analyzing the long term stability of our 0.3% gel, although there should be no problems and the shelf life is expected to be guaranteed for at least 1/2 years if produced in an adequately clean environment and stored in normal conditions inside an airless bottle, temperature not exceeding 35°C and humidity not above 60%.\n\n**Our gel recipe, preparation instructions and research study are NOT intended to be medical advice. We are not responsible for any problems caused by using the gel or its preparation.**",

The brand began in 2017 and is owned by Courtney Brooks and Stephen Joiner. Joiner, is also the owner of the artisan brush company, Dogwood Handcrafts (https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/). Samhain is SWs fall 2019 offering and will release on September 24, 2019. Southern Witchcrafts focus is on providing high quality vegan shaving products with scents that are interesting and unique. In addition to ordering direct, Southern Witchcrafts can be purchased at Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/) and Top of the Chain (https://topofthechain.ca/).\n\nSamhain is a blend of; bourbon, tobacco, pumpkin, sandalwood, nutmeg, oud, incense, amber, vanilla, hazelnut, charred wood, musk. The fragrances is inspired by the “Gaelic festival marking the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter”. This scent is a perfect autumn scent that open with smells of pumpkin, vanilla and bourbon, before the slight spice of nutmeg rolls through. From there, the scent is enveloped in a nutty, resinous blanket. The entire presentation is grounded by a woodiness. Mrs. Ruds likes this scent, likely because of her affinity for New England falls and pumpkin spice offerings. Strength of scent is mid-strong out of the container and remains this way for the shaves duration. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends  Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements Atomic Pumpkin as a comparable scent profile.\n\nSouthern Witchcrafts uses a soap base of the vegan variety. The bases ingredients are listed as: Water, stearic acid, shea butter, castor oil, potassium hydroxide, glycerine, coconut oil, sodium lactate, sodium hydroxide, jojoba oil, aloe powder, liquid aloe, isopropyl myristate, kaolin clay and fragrance. The soap is soft to mid on the firmness spectrum. The soap base loads easily and lathers with very little effort. It is of normal thirst and whips into a lather that will have the consistency of cool whip. The slickness of this soap is excellent in both the visible slickness area as well as a secondary slickness. Post shave, like slickness is excellent as well. The oils and butters provide a luxurious feeling on the skin post shave. Given my experience with this soap base, it receives a ShaveScore of 92. Soap bases with similar performance are: Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements (CK-6) and Wholly Kaw (vegan). \n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Southern Witchcrafts Samhain (purchased)\n* Brush - Wolf Whiskers “Scorpion” (purchased)\n* Razor - Jerry Stark #502 (gift)\n* Post - Southern Witchcrafts Samhain (purchased)",

    "body": "Hey all! I'm back with review #2 in my series of lesser-discussed product reviews. I hope the one for the [Benton TT Mist] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/7trt3u/review_benton_honest_tt_mist/) was useful, as I'm new to writing reviews. If you were/weren't a fan, feel free to leave a comment letting me know what you thought! On to today's review!\n\n**Tosowoong Natural Pure Apricot Seed Cleansing Oil**\n\nI need to confess right off the bat that Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Oil is my forever and always HG first cleanser, and I will never find a product I like more. That being said, at $30 for a 6oz (170ml) bottle on Amazon, it's not a product my bank account will allow me to put on my face every day. And that's where Tosowoong comes in...it's a good, basic cleansing oil that helps me stretch my precious Sulwhasoo a bit further. I know the Propolis Sparkle Ampoule is the Tosowoong product that gets all the buzz around here, but the cleanser is seriously under-hyped, in my humble opinion. \n\n**Packaging:** The cleanser comes in a 120ml clear plastic bottle with an orangey label and a brown pump top. It's certainly simple, but the little apricot drawing on the front is cute, and more importantly, the packaging is practical. The clear bottle means that you can see when you're running out, and the pump top came with a detachable/re-attachable plastic piece that keeps the pump from being pushed down when the product's not in use. It held up great in my checked back through two flights recently, so that's a plus. The one downside is that the plastic top does feel a bit flimsy...it hasn't broken on me yet, but I'm always a bit worried that it might when I'm traveling. \n\n**Ingredients:** This was a bit tricky, as the ingredients aren't listed in English on the packaging. But thanks to [this] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3c7vij/has_anyone_tried_the_tosowoong_apricot_seed/) post from u/riceprincesspt back in 2015, I was able to find the full ingredients list. As far as I know, it has not been reformulated since then, and the ingredients list remains the same. Oil cleansers are always a bit tricky, as oils seem to be a bit polarizing in terms of which ones break different people out. Unsurprisingly, apricot seed oil is the first ingredient listed, present in a concentration of 40%. While I haven't heard of many people irritated by apricot seed oil, some of the other ingredients may keep some folks away. CosDNA lists Isopropyl Myristate (a derivative of coconut oil) as a 5 on their acne trigger scale, while olive oil and jojoba oil both score a 2. \nThe product also contains mineral oil and fragrance, which some people are sensitive to. \n\nHere is the full ingredients list:\n\nApricot Seed oil (40%), Mineral Oil, PEG-20, Glyceryl Triiso, Stearate, Jojoba Seed Oil (5%), Isopropyl Myristate, PEG-8 Isostearate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Macadamia Seed Oil, Olive Oil, Argan Spinosa Kernel Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Papaya Fruit Extract, Saponaria Officinalis Leaf/Root Extract, Lemon Extract, Apple Extract, Fragrance\n\n**Price:** I got mine for $14 on Jolse, which works out to about 12 cents per ml\n\n**Use and Performance:** I've used the Tosowoong Natural Pure Apricot Seed Cleansing Oil for  more than two months now. Like any other oil cleanser, this one should be applied to a dry face. Simply apply the oil cleanser, rub it in for a bit of an oil massage if you'd like, then apply water to emulsify and rinse. It has a relatively strong smell compared to other cleansers I've tried. I know logically that it smells like apricot pits, but to me, it smells like pumpkin. Not in a pumpkin spice way, but in a carving pumpkins for Halloween while its seeds are roasting in the oven way. \n\nI've found that 3 pumps is the magic number for me with this cleanser. It's a fairly thin consistency, which is both good and bad...it gives it plenty of slip for a nice oil massage, but also means that I tend to lose more product than I'd like. I've consistently been able to get grits while massaging with this product. And this cleanser emulsifies like a dream. All it takes is a bit of water and hardly any effort to turn it into a white foamy consistency that washes off cleanly. I'm seriously impressed by its emulsifying power and the fact that it doesn't leave any residue or dryness. I still like to follow up with a water-based cleanser, but not because of anything this cleansing oil leaves behind.\n\n Using an oil cleanser in general has been really great for my acne. That being said, I don't think that the Tosowoong apricot seed cleanser is as effective as my Sulwhasoo cleanser in unclogging my pores and thus preventing acne. It's a *very* subtle difference, but if I use this one too often, it starts to add up, and my breakouts get a little worse. I don't think it's a case of the cleanser itself breaking me out, because as I said, it washes off cleanly, and as far as I know none of its ingredients break me out. However, I just don't think it cleanses as deeply and effectively as my other oil cleanser by just a very slight margin. As I don't use it every day, it's not a big detractor for me, but I may consider trying something different in the future. \n\n**Final Thoughts:** This cleansing oil gets major points for its emulsifying and rinsing off abilities. There's no film, and no weird sensation left over. I think that this cleanser would work really well as an introduction to oil cleansing due to the ease of use and the fact that it's pretty effective without being expensive. However, the oils it uses can be acne triggers for many, which kind of limits the number of people who can use it. Also, if you're acne prone and find that oil cleansing helps with your acne, this might not have enough oomph for you. However, if your skin isn't particularly sensitive and you're looking for a no-frills cleansing oil with a modest price tag, this might be a good option for you.\n\n**My Rating: 4/5**\n\nAs always, feel free to leave feedback or questions!

[It's now finally up on the website](https://www.superdrug.com/search?text=calm+skin), meaning I can post about it without having to type out all the ingredients by hand ;)\n\nThe range has a night mask, a facial oil, a cleanser, a 'rescue gel', a hydrating spray and a 2-in-1 serum/moisturiser. They're all £2.99, and they're all on buy 1 get 1 half price. I bought 4 products - the mask, the rescue gel, the spray and the serum/moisturiser. I skipped on the cleanser, as it has SLS, and I couldn't be bothered with the oil at the time, especially since I wanted even numbers because of the offer. \n\nI also emailed Superdrug's customer support to enquire about the % of niacinamide, as I was worried it would be insufficient. After some back-and-forth, the customer service rep contacted the new product team and got this response:\n\n\"I cannot give out specific information regarding our formulations but I can confirm that the percentage of niacinamide is >5% in all of the below.\"\n\nThe below being the four products I was asking about, I imagine. (The oil doesn't have niacinamide, btw - it's only soluble in water)\n\nAnyway, nice!\n\nAfter a month or so of testing on and off, here's my mini reviews of the ones that I got:\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin De-Stress Refreshing Facial Spritz 100ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-De-Stress-Refreshing-Facial-Spritz-100ml/p/741142)**\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, Glycerin, Niacinamide, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Trideceth-9, Betaine, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum, Potassium Sorbate, Bisabolol, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Citric Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid), Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Moisturising spray? It's kind of weird. There's a slight oiliness to it, and a definite stickiness which is probably the large amount of glycerin. \n\n**Scent:** Definitely floral, vaguely chamomile-y\n\n**Overall Experience:** So, this is... a bit weird? I've mostly been using it as a hydrating toner. The difficulty is that it plays nice with some serums/moisturisers, but with others it seems to lead to bobbling. But I am rather bobble-prone, so it might just be me. Anyway, if I can get it to go on okay it definitely makes me feel more hydrated, particularly when I'm in the dry-aired office I keep complaining about. One day I was feeling kinda bored so I tried out the '7 skin' method by spraying it on every few minutes until it wouldn't absorb any more. I think I got to about six? It definitely hydrated my skin! And probably calmed it down as well. Is it a bad idea to put so much niacinamide on your skin? I don't know, but it's unlikely I'm going to be doing this on a regular basis.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Well, it's a very cheap, very hydrating toner, so probably.\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Hydrating 2in1 Serum & Moisturiser 50ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Face-Cream/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Hydrating-2in1-Serum-%26-Moisturiser-50ml/p/741125)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Isopropyl Myristate, Niacinamide, ‭Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Polyacrylamide, Butylene Glycol, ‭Phenoxyethanol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethiconol, Parfum, Betaine, Laureth-7, ‭Bisabolol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Alcohol, ‭Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid), Cimicifuga Racemosa ‭Root Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower ‭Extract, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, ‭Sodium Benzoate, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** So siliconey it's vaguely unnerving\n\n**Scent:** Heady floral, not unpleasant but kinda odd to find in this context. It's not at all chamomile-like? More of a tuberose, kinda luxe-y but definitely not one for people who don't like heavy scent\n\n**Overall Experience:** So, I think the reason it's described as a 2-in-1 is that there's SO MUCH SILICONE you really can't use much else with it or it will turn into a peeling gel, which is what it did to me several times. I think it might be a good thing for me in the summer when I need something very light, but right now I want to use a heavier, more wintery moisturiser and to layer stuff and this isn't meant for that at allll\n\n**Will I repurchase?** I don't know, let me try it out in the summer and see if I can find a sunscreen that'll play nice with it.\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Rescue Gel 15ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Rescue-Gel-15ml/p/741146)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Alcohol Denat., Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Glycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Salicylic Acid, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Trideceth-9, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum, Bisabolol, Potassium Sorbate, Allantoin, Alcohol, Propylene Glycol, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile)Flower Extract, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Gel\n\n**Scent:** Alcohol\n\n**Overall Experience:** Okay, so in the cold light of day I should have looked at that ingredient list and run screaming. Why are they trying to combine salicylic acid (works best at pH <3.5) and niacinamide (becomes irritating at pH<4.5)? Why is the fourth ingredient citric acid? Did putting on an alcohol gel ever help a single spot?\nI did actually try this a couple of times and it did nothing much, which honestly is better than I should have expected, by rights it should have made my face fall off.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Nope\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Overnight Face Mask 100ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Overnight-Face-Mask-100ml/p/741143)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, ‭Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, Prunus ‭Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, ‭Phenoxyethanol, Polyacrylamide, Parfum, Sodium ‭Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Betaine, ‭Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Isohexadecane, C13-14 ‭Isoparaffin, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 80, Bisabolol, ‭Ethylhexylglycerin, Alcohol, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate ‭(Hyaluronic Acid), Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Sorbitan ‭Oleate, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, ‭Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium ‭Benzoate, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Gloop. Sinks in pretty quickly.\n\n**Scent:** Light floral\n\n**Overall Experience:** Help, I really like this. It goes on nicely even over other stuff (eg Scinic Honey AIO), is nice and occlusive, smells okay and - the kicker - actually leaves my skin looking better in the morning, with red marks noticeably diminished. My only complaint is that it's tiny, considering you'll want to use a hefty glop of the stuff.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Almost certainly",

Why are they trying to combine salicylic acid (works best at pH <3.5) and niacinamide (becomes irritating at pH<4.5)? Why is the fourth ingredient citric acid? Did putting on an alcohol gel ever help a single spot? \n\nSalicylic acid isn't just a chemical exfoliant, it's also anti-inflammatory, which would make it calming on inflammation. Niacinamide isn't necessarily irritating in higher pH products, otherwise the vast majority of skincare products with niacinamide would be irritating, since most products aren't formulated at <pH 4.5. Alcohol denat. is a penetration enhancer and many people don't have issues with alcohol in skincare, particularly if their skin is in good condition to begin with and/or if they don't have alcohol in every single product. Citric acid is a pH adjuster. It's almost impossible just by looking at an ingredient list to be able to talk at length about the overall formula, and none of these ingredients in a normal product are 'face falling off' level of concern.

Tbh, before buying i saw some bad reviews of the sunscreen on this sub but the ingredient list sucked me in along with the boot star rating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI first tested a little bit on my hand and guys, let me tell you the texture is AMAZING. Its soooooo fucking light and sinks in the skin beautifully, it also feels a little cold when i apply it. After that hand application I moved onto my face and it pilled so badly, i was very, very, very disappointed. But I had already spent my money though and I was determined to make it work. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI tried a few different methods of application and one application technique worked!!!! I was estatic to say the least. The sunscreen is very lightweight, has NO whitecast, looks beautiful under makeup and looks amazing on the skin. It does look dewy on the skin but doesn't make me feel like a greaseball like the Neutrogena one. Dries fairly okayish so need to set with powder in order for hair to not stick. Although, sometimes i don't follow the technique and it pills in certain areas but the makeup covers the mishaps if the pilling is minute.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Application technique*\n\n • Face needs to be clean with no product on it. I dont apply any moisturizer or serum before suncreen so idk how it layers on other skincare products.\n\n • Take 2 finger worth of sunscreen, and dot it all over the face\n\n • Rub only one area of the face at a time until blends in\n\n • If you want to apply makeup, give it a few minutes to settle down\n\n • ONLY pat your foundation/concealer or any cream product to blend or else it will pill. \n\n*Texture shots*- http://imgur.com/gallery/iSWWJ6e\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know the sunscreen seems like a pain in the ass but it really isn't after getting used to the application. I WRP because of the ingredient list and the boot star rating.",

    "body": "Happy Friday! :D \n\nThis has been a long time in the works, but I'm super excited to announce that we've launched EDP (Parfum, alcohol-based sprays) today! I've started with 8 popular fragrances, but will be adding more. EdPs are available in three sizes from 15ml to 50ml, and you can find them [right here](http://sixteen92.com/collections/eau-de-parfum). These are heavily concentrated parfum/extrait strength and use a premium, low-odor 200 proof perfumer's alcohol. I CAN ship these Internationally, but EdPs going outside North America will use IPM (isopropyl myristate) in place of the perfumer's alcohol. This allows them to be safely and legally shipped overseas without the huge price increase of surface mail. IPM has no odor, and although it is slightly thicker than perfumer's alcohol it offers a great alternative and is fully sprayable, just like alcohol :) \n\nI've also added a new scent to the general catalogue, [La Llorona](http://sixteen92.com/collections/general-catalogue/products/la-llorona). This one is a bold and slightly spicy vintage floral with some lovely rose absolutes blended with cashmere woods, wisteria, woody amber and a touch of citrus and pink and white pepper. \n\nI always feel weird posting about my own releases :O Happy to answer any questions! :) ",

Can't say the same for this sunscreen. \n\nIt's not sweat proof or water proof, and can burn your eyes if you accidentally rub them before the product seeps into your skin. I wouldn't recommend it for oily skin too, as it feels greasy.\n\nThe product does its job of protecting against sun, but I haven't been out for longer hours after applying it. Plus, reapplying it while being out under the sun might lead to pilling. The positives are that it has no white cast, is affordable and might work for dry skin.\n\n**Repurchase:** No\n\n\n",

So after my skin was very irritated from the new products I wanted to start from the beginning, so I just use an oil cleanser and vaseline right now. \n\nThe oil cleanser is from a german drugstore brand. Here are the ingredients: \nHelianthus Annuus Hybrid Oil, Isopropyl Palmitate, Isopropyl Myristate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Tri-Isostearate, Ethylhexyl Stearate, Tocopherol, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil \n\nAnd after cleansing I put some vaseline on the dump skin.\n\nSo now my skin isn't dry anymore but I got a lot of closed comedones. Especially on the cheeks, under my eyes and on the forehead. It also itches on my cheeks. \n\nI know vaseline isn't actually comedogenic, but I don't know where else they could come from. They're more on the left side, so I thought maybe they're from my pillow or something but actually I'm sleeping more on my right side or on the back.\n\nI'm so frustrated right now because my skin was better when I did nothing and now I got a lot of great products and stuff and my skin is looking awful.\n\nPs: It's my first thread/post/whatever on reddit, so hi :)",

I’ve only used it for a week both am and pm and I have noticed my skin feels softer but no drastic changes yet. \n\nThe tirtir ampule has a really weird texture- it goes from a silky oil to a thick un spreadable one? Did anyone else experience this. I’m so surprised it has isopropyl myristate (2nd ingredient!) and coconut oil which both have ever high comedogenic ratings. \n\nI have dry dehydrated skin and both have given me temporary hydration but I’m not sure about the long term effects. They also pile up massively on top of Hada Labo’s gold bottle lotion. It’s a shame cuz they were so pricy and I’m not pleased so far with their efficacy. It does leave a glass skin effect on the skin and the packaging of the bottle feels luxury and high end. ",

The brand began in 2017 and is owned by Courtney Brooks and Stephen Joiner. Joiner, is also the owner of the artisan brush company, Dogwood Handcrafts ([https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/](https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/)). Anthropophagy is a Spring seasonal release from SW. Southern Witchcrafts focus is on providing high quality vegan shaving products with scents that are interesting and unique. In addition to ordering directly, Southern Witchcrafts can be purchased at Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/) and Top of the Chain (https://topofthechain.ca/).\n\nAnthropophagy pays homage to Thomas Harris, the creator of Hannibal Lecter, the protagonist in the all time great film, Silence of the lambs. The fragrance is modeled after a hand cream that is said to have been used by Lecter, and present on the letters he sent to Clarice Starling in the film. Scent notes feature: Tonka bean, musk, lavender, cotton, amyris wood and hedione. True to form, the fragrance is a soft, clean smelling accord highlighted by lavender and cotton. Mrs. Ruds is neutral on this one. She finds it somewhat pleasant but not something she gravitates to me wearing. Strength of scent is mid-strong once lathered. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Soap Commander Devotion as a comparable scent profile. \n\nSouthern Witchcrafts uses a soap base of the vegan variety. The bases ingredients are listed as: Water, stearic acid, shea butter, castor oil, potassium hydroxide, glycerine, coconut oil, sodium lactate, sodium hydroxide, jojoba oil, aloe powder, liquid aloe, isopropyl myristate, kaolin clay and fragrance. The soap is soft to mid on the firmness spectrum. The soap base loads easily and lathers with very little effort. It is of normal thirst and whips into a lather that will have the consistency of cool whip. The slickness of this soap is excellent in both the visible slickness area as well as a secondary slickness. Post shave, like slickness is excellent as well. The oils and butters provide a luxurious feeling on the skin post shave. Given my experience with this soap base, it receives a ShaveScore of 92. Soap bases with similar performance are: Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements (CK-6) and Wholly Kaw (vegan). \n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Southern Witchcrafts Anthropophagy (promotional gift)\n* Brush -​ Dogwood Handcrafts “Darkness” (purchased)\n* Razor - HomeLikeShaving Safe Start 1.18 (loaner)\n* Post - Catie’s Bubbles Ménage a Lavande (purchased)",

Their goal is to help bring to market affordable vegan shave products, as well as interesting scents.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#Scent\n*A tribute to the druid celebration of the Winter Solstice or “Yule”, Druantia is woodsy and spicy scent perfect for crisp Winter days.*\n\n\nSo Druantia smells similar to that of a snicker-doodle followed up by some earthiness. Its an interesting combination and one I haven't smelled in the wetshaving game. I would rank the scent strength probably mid-strong to mid. I paired Druantia with Santal Auster due to sandalwood within both and I felt like they worked very well together. I defeinetly enjoy this scent and will be picking up the EdP and possibly the matching aftershave.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#Performance\n**Ingredients:** *Water, stearic acid, shea butter, castor oil, potassium hydroxide, glycerine, coconut oil, sodium lactate, sodium hydroxide, jojoba oil, aloe powder, liquid aloe, isopropyl myristate, kaolin clay, fragrance*\n\n\nSo as I stated above, Southern Witchcrafts is a vegan base. The current base is their 2nd iteration, which I feel is a real step up from their previous version. Personally, I prefer tallow over vegan but this base really stood out to. Lathering up from the soap puck was effortless, as this is a medium to soft soap and this boar brush was going to take no for an answer. I **swirled** the Thater for maybe 30 or so seconds and the lather was already starting, so straight to the face I went. I normally load heavy so I needed to add water a few times to really get it going, but once I did, the lather became very voluptuous, dense and slick. Normally, I do two passes but I am growing the beard back out so I only cleaned up the cheeks and neck. I always go XTG on my neck, as that is really the only way I can get a close shave without irritation and WTG/XTG/ATG on my cheeks. Soap helped glide the razor across my skin with no issues. Results were stellar. No weepers, creepers, nicks, cuts, butts or coconuts. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n#Overall\n\nI highly recommend checking out Southern Witchcrafts offerings. They have quite different scent offerings compared to other artisans. Their V2 base is quite stellar and I look forward to the next offerings from Southern Witchcrafts. If you're looking for some recommendations, I highly recommend Autumn Ash and Necromantic.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#Disclaimer\nI purchased this soap with my own money, leave me alone /u/Hyvasuomi79. Thater Boar was received as a PIF from u/dendj55.\n",

They're not like DMSO or anything. They are objectively safe for transdermal medicine. You should still see a doctor about your heart issues. While HRT can mess with your heart (in freak, freak accidents), it's not really something you'll feel. If HRT ever does cause you harm (when used improperly), this harm generally doesn't manifest as actual sensations. I am 99.9% sure the heart pains are unrelated to HRT. I'd reccomend against telling your doctor you're even on HRT, lest you be diagnosed with trans broken arm syndrome. But of course, use your own discretion and best judgement. You'll know what's safe to share, far better than any of us would.",

The brand began in 2017 and is owned by Courtney Brooks and Stephen Joiner. Joiner, is also the owner of the artisan brush company, Dogwood Handcrafts ([https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/](https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/)). Southern Witchcrafts focus is on providing high quality vegan shaving products with scents that are interesting and unique. In addition to ordering direct, Southern Witchcrafts can be purchased at Maggard Razors ([http://www.maggardrazors.com/](http://www.maggardrazors.com/)) and Top of the Chain ([https://topofthechain.ca/](https://topofthechain.ca/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDruantia was introduced as the 2018 winter/holiday seasonal scent. This warm, spicy scent serves as an homage to the druid celebration of the Winter Solstice. The fragrance features notes of: Cedar, Oakmoss, Rosewood, Moss, Cypress, Tobacco, Mushroom, Sandalwood, Myrrh, Amber, Ginger, Orange. This accord is balance with an opening of earth tones, a heart of tobacco and mushroom and a finish of orange and spice. This is indeed a warm scent with a hint of spiciness. I like this scent quite a bit, although Mrs. Ruds is not a fan because of the earthy depth. Strength of scent is mid-strong off the container and remains that way once lathered. Scents with similarities from the wet shaving world are: LASSCo Bespoke #1 and Wholly Kaw King of Oud. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSouthern Witchcrafts uses a soap base of the vegan variety. The bases ingredients are listed as: Water, stearic acid, shea butter, castor oil, potassium hydroxide, glycerine, coconut oil, sodium lactate, sodium hydroxide, jojoba oil, aloe powder, liquid aloe, isopropyl myristate, kaolin clay and fragrance. The soap is soft to mid on the firmness spectrum. The soap base loads easily and lathers with very little effort. It is of normal thirst and whips into a lather that will have the consistency of cool whip. The slickness of this soap is excellent in both the visible slickness area as well as a secondary slickness. Post shave, like slickness is excellent as well. The oils and butters provide a luxurious feeling on the skin post shave. Given my experience with this soap base, it receives a ShaveScore of 92. Soap bases with similar performance are: Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements (CK-6) and Wholly Kaw (vegan). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Southern Witchcrafts Druantia (loaner)\n* Brush - Lutin Brushworks (gift)\n* Razor - Nate’s Straights (loaner)\n* Post - Southern Witchcrafts Druantia (loaner)",

Significantly high PIH and lots of closed comedones on both cheeks, jawline and near sideburns and blackheads on nose and cheeks.\n\n\nCURRENT CLIMATIC CONDITIONS 🌡️: Hot and Very Dry\n\n\nCURRENT AM ROUTINE ☀️🧴: Joy 5.5pH Face Wash→Chemist at Play Hydrating Toner/Klairs Unscented Toner→Vitamin C / Benzoyl Peroxide 2.5% gel spot treatment (BP on days when I'm not using Vit C)→Mecca Cosmetica To Save Face Superscreen/Nivea SPF 50 Sunscreen→Lakme Lip Balm \n\n\nCURRENT PM ROUTINE 🌙🧴: Dear Klairs Gentle Black Deep Cleansing Oil→Himalaya Neem Foaming Face Wash→CosRX Snail Mucin→Adapalene 0.1% gel/The DermaCo Kojic Acid Serum→The Dermaco 4% Cica Ceramide Cream/Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume→Boroline as lip sleeping mask\n\n\nAGE: 24 years \n\n\nUSAGE TIMELINE ⏳: 1 week\n\n\nINGREDIENT LIST (from the official website) 📜: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Isopropyl Myristate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Polysorbate 20, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant) Seed Oil , Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Isopropyl Palmitate, Glycine Max (Soybean) Oil, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Carapa Guaianensis Seed Oil, Tocopherol\n\n\n\nREVIEW 📝: \nI initiated the double cleansing step a month back as I was looking up on lots of skincare forums and videos and they all claimed that it was helpful for blackheads and clearing out pores so I started out by using Bioré Cleansing oil and Plum Cleansing Balm before but THIS Klairs cleansing oil...just WOAH! Especially in regards to both spreadability and skin softening efficacy. The oil texture is light and easily spreadable so a little goes a long way. It is so easy to massage across my face and feels so nice on my skin despite having two active and painful acne and lots of texture on my skin. I spend like 3 minutes massaging because of how it feels on my skin 🥲. I wear like 3 layers of sunscreen everyday with no makeup on so I can't judge the makeup removal aspect of this oil.\n\nComing to the only disadvantage of this oil is that it definitely does take time to emulsify and come off so I would suggest anyone going to try this to not rinse under running water but rather take water in a mug or bowl and rinse multiple times in the same water to avoid the water wastage and then when you feel it is considerably off you can splash your face with some running water or just go straight to your regular cleanser or face wash step which takes off everything.\n\nMy final result was that all of my sunscreen (both water resistant and non resistant type) easily comes off and significant smoothness was felt on areas that I had extreme texture on like my cheeks and jawline plus my nose felt less congested than it ever did all my life. I keep touching my face after oil cleansing because I am amazed at how smooth and soft my face feels. I did not face any eye or skin irritation plus no additional breakouts from this oil.\n\n\n\nSTATUS: Will Purchase for sure! Watching out for good sales price for this product 🤩",

    "body": "Hi! Welcome back to the series where my friend and I compare our impressions of the same indie perfumes and frequently find ourselves surprised. Today’s post features brands that aren’t talked about quite as often on this subreddit, but whose catalogs speak to either of us enough that we decided to take the plunge. We ordered from Deep Midnight and Fyrinnae directly, and our Olympic Orchids selection is a combination of a small direct order and some destash purchases that made my friend want to do the direct order in the first place. In addition, there are a few miscellaneous destashes from houses that have a similar status to these two.\n\n---\n\n- My preferences: I like most herbs and spices, floral lavender (vs herbal lavender), vanilla, light florals, and woods. I dislike rose, “sweater” notes, some teas, smoke, and pepper (most of which I also amp), and my hit rates with fruit and (sadly) honey have been poor. I especially can’t stand coffee, soil, patchouli, mint, or anything soapy or powdery.\n- Friend’s preferences: Sandalwood is the best way to sell him on a notes list. He also likes lilac, floral lavender, chocolate, vanilla, bakery and boozy gourmands, woods of all kinds, and some darker notes like smoke and leather. He dislikes anything soapy or astringent, predictably prefers most florals and notably sweet scents when they’re on other people (i.e. me), and avoids cherry and berry notes as they tend to either vanish or smell like acetone to him.\n\n---\n\n**Deconstructing Eden Night Blooming** *(Dragonfruit and blooms, delicate wisteria, cereus blooms, rain lilies, honeysuckle, and sweet rocket.)*\n\n* What I smell: This is wildly conventional perfume. It’s the smell of a perfume booth at Macy’s.\n* What he smells: “Yeah, alcohol-based conventional perfume. Maybe a little citrus.” (Dragonfruit tang.)\n* Author’s note: Dragonfruit flowers? Cactus blooms? Rain lilies? Sweet rocket? This is my first time trying this house and the majority of these notes, so I’m disappointed that the result is so… ordinary.\n\n**Deep Midnight Alicindra** *(French lavender, fall flowers, acorns, oakwood, apples, and light spices.)* This was my requested free sample with the Deep Midnight order.\n\n* What I smell: Apples and oak/acorn tannins. Unfortunately that reads as “apple core” without the florals and spices to sweeten the deal.\n* What he smells: “Why does everything you get smell like lavender and vanilla?” (Way to call me out!) “Yeah, I get lavender, something floral, and some fruit. … Oh, that explains it. It’s like spiced apples, or spiced cider.”\n* Author’s note: Someone warned me that some Deep Midnight scents could smell like licorice upon arrival. This one sure did! I was advised to let the whole order rest for three weeks, after which the licorice turned into apples. Anyway, I’m so mad that my friend can smell absolutely all of this and I can’t.\n\n**Deep Midnight Dome of Stars (Elrond)** *(Sandalwood, orris root, lavender, myrrh, amber, soft evergreen, light cinnamon and citron.)*\n\n* What I smell: Wood and citron.\n* What he smells: “Not getting much out of this, but what I do smell is woody.” On second pass: “Oh, yeah, sandalwood and a bunch of other stuff.” On his skin, my initial impression is a mix of sandalwood, resins/ambers, evergreen, and cinnamon; he mostly gets evergreen and resins, with the cinnamon coming in later.\n\n**Deep Midnight Evening Star (Arwen)** *(Night-blooming jasmine, lily of the valley, moss, ferns, soft musk, subtle herbs.)*\n\n* What I smell: All jasmine, and I don’t really love this jasmine note.\n* What he smells: “I’m getting soap.” (after explaining notes) “Yeah, scented hand soap.”\n* Author’s note: I am happy to report that the Deep Midnight scents that didn’t work for me found a new home easily. My friend’s wife is a huge Tolkien nerd, so her interest was piqued immediately!\n\n**Deep Midnight Forest Daughter (Tauriel)** *(Tulip, jasmine, ylang-ylang, sandalwood, black currant, vetiver, background notes of patchouli and dark cocoa.)*\n\n* What I smell: An initial burst of artificial florals, that calms down after a few minutes of wear time into some combo of the darker notes. Intriguing, but not for me.\n* What he smells: “I like this. It’s sweet, but also woody.” (after explaining notes) “Yeah, okay, that explains why I like it.”\n\n**Deep Midnight Lady of Light (Galadriel)** *(Orange blossom, vetiver, oakmoss, honey, azalea, woods.)*\n\n* What I smell: Soap. God dammit. \n* What he smells: “This is much fainter than the others so far, but what I am getting is kind of like the one that smelled like floral foam.” (That was BPAL Chanukkiyah, which had nothing in common with this.)\n\n**Deep Midnight Silvan King (Thranduil)** *(Amber, vetiver, hickory wood, coriander, saffron, pepper, wood honey, dark vanilla, sandalwood, very light notes of mandarin and jasmine.)*\n\n* What I smell: Uh, this is a lot. Honey, jasmine, sandalwood, and pepper? On his skin, I think it’s hickory, sandalwood, and pepper.\n* What he smells: “Huh. I’m not sure what I’m smelling.” He sniffs again, then snaps his fingers, and sniffs a third time to confirm. “I know what I’m getting. Orange sherbet!” On his skin: “Okay, I don’t get sherbet anymore.” He now agrees with what I’m smelling, but it’s easy to tell where he was getting the sherbet.\n\n**Deep Midnight Silvan Prince (Legolas)** *(Tall majestic ancient forests, tendrils of ivy, galbanum, coriander, Indian sandalwood.)*\n\n* What I smell: Wood, with perhaps a touch of… citrus? Oh, okay, that’s the galbanum. It blossoms on his skin into a very green forest. \n* What he smells: “Wow, yeah, this is complex but mostly buried in wood.” On his skin: “Oh wow, that’s really the smell of a pine forest!”\n\n**Fyrinnae Chocolatine** *(Also known as Pain au Chocolat, these flaky croissant-like pastries are filled with pieces of dark or semi-sweet chocolate. This is not a very sweet fragrance.)*\n\n* What I smell: “WOW, that is the most realistic chocolate I’ve smelled. Dead-on chocolate pastry.” It’s pretty intense in the vial.\n* What he smells: “Mmm! Chocolate!”\n* Worth some note: Fyrinnae’s scents are made with an isopropyl myristate base rather than oil, so they don’t require much or any rest time, are stronger than oil bases, and will last longer on people (like me) whose skin absorbs oil bases. However, my friend was the one to pick out all these scents because Fyrinnae doesn’t really have a lot that appeals to me.\n\n**Fyrinnae Danse Macabre** *(Slightly sweet sandalwood, amber, labdanum, and a hint of vanilla mingle with billowing woodsmoke and smoldering logs. Named for the 1874 composition by Camille Saint-Saëns.)*\n\n* What I smell: Slightly sweet sandalwood and a hint of vanilla indeed. There might be some amber in my impression but I wouldn’t know. To friend: “Definitely your thing!” On his skin, I think I’m getting all the notes.\n* What he smells: “There’s a lot of wood in here!” Sandalwood, smoky background notes, “kind of a tang to it that I can’t describe.” After reading the notes: “Oh, that’s it, it’s a fireplace!” On his skin: “I get a lot more firewood, but it might change over time.”\n* Author’s note: Classical music references make us happy.\n\n**Fyrinnae Fiend Slayer** *(The smell of a new leather jerkin, well-worn gloves, sandalwood, and a few wisps of smoke from a conjured fire.)*\n\n* What I smell: Fresh leather. Smells like my new belt. It’s not overpoweringly leathery in the vial, but on skin, whew!\n* What he smells: “Something metallic about it that almost makes me think of a DnD character with a sword. Almost like you’re tasting pennies. This could just be me being suggestible from the name, but it’s like there’s something sulfurous too.” (likely the smoke.) “Reminds me a little of turning the heat on for the first time in months.” (After describing the notes) “Yeah, it’s new leather belt or jacket smell, but with something metallic to it as well. I wonder if that’ll change when I put it on.” On skin, it is *seriously* just fresh leather, with quite impressive throw, so we’re destashing this one because it’s a bit much.\n\n**Fyrinnae Focaccia Toscana** *(Olive oil and a scattering of herbs including thyme and oregano top this popular flatbread.)*\n\n* What I smell: Well damn, that’s realistic focaccia!\n* What he smells: The same. “Yeah, that’s dead-on flatbread with thyme and oregano.” On his skin, “It was acting up for the first few minutes, like I was only smelling one of the herbs, but then it settled down afterward.”\n\n**Fyrinnae Mochi Bread** *(Basic buttery bread of rice & wheat flours, baked with black sesame seeds throughout. No sweetness.)*\n\n* What I smell: Bread! Yum!\n* What he smells: “Mmm! It’s bread but it reminds me a little of saltine crackers. I want to drink this now.”\n\n**Olympic Orchids Olympic Amber** *(labdanum, vanilla, benzoin, incense, resins, cypress, patchouli, and woods.)* Free sample with order – we wouldn’t have picked this one out.\n\n* What I smell: “This is the first time I can only smell alcohol. The hell?”\n* What he smells: “Yeah, it doesn’t smell like much else to me either.”\n\n**Olympic Orchids Olympic Rainforest** *(Cedar leaves, green sword ferns, rhododendron, forest mushrooms, beebalm, myrtle, wildflowers, oakmoss, black spruce, balsam fir, Port Orford Cedar, earthy accord.)* \n\n* What I smell: A medicinal first impression settles down into being able to smell some trees. Likely takes a bit to develop well, but all I really got on a Post-It was medicine so clearly my friend’s skin does this some more favors.\n* What he smells: Medicinal while wet, but dries down into something much better. I mentioned that this has beebalm in it and he realized, “oh, it smells like Blistex!” His first impression after a few minutes was that it’s “a very resin-y pine scent” – resin in the literal sense of This Smells Like Tree, of course. He’d had it on his skin for a few hours by the time he got here, and at that point there was more dirt in the mix.\n\n**Olympic Orchids Sakura** *(Cherry blossom, airy notes, light musk.)*\n\n* What I smell: Hmph. I think the musk is taking over, because while I... think?... the description on the product page is accurate, I am also getting a very conventionally perfumey and/or soap-scent-y vibe out of this and I do not like it. Absolutely not what I expected out of cherry blossoms.\n* What he smells: “Kinda like freshly cut grass. Something sweet and floral in the background.” He agrees with my conventional perfume impression.\n\n**Olympic Orchids Seattle Chocolate** *(Dark cacao, black Bourbon vanilla, sweet poplar bud, evergreen wood, oakmoss, gourmand musk, silver fir, and fir balsam absolute.)*\n\n* What I smell: Very dark chocolate and oakmoss, both in the vial and on friend’s skin.\n* What he smells: “Whoa! That’s strong. I think whatever harshness I’m smelling will go away on my skin, but – yeah, dark chocolate.” He happened to have put on NAVA Elephant on a Penny Farthing that day, which is more or less a chocolate donut, so comparing the two was a lot of fun. In his ensuing order from Olympic Orchids, he upsized this scent.\n\n**Olympic Orchids Woodcut** *(Fractional distillations of pine and cedar, oakwood absolute, tolu balsam, olibanum, caramel, burnt sugar, vanilla.)*\n\n* What I smell: Wow, I expected “tree!” and got “room full of sawdust!” instead. I notice the individual sweet notes too, but they all play into the impression, which is pretty incredible! I’d say others’ Home Depot description is correct, though it’ll probably be more powerful in spray format. Unfortunately, however, this is mildly irritating my hand – that is a first.\n* What he smells: “Wow. This is less of a scent and more of a very nonspecific memory. This is what it would smell like to go into a room at your grandma’s house, and find an old dusty book of photos.” (He is specifically referring to my grandma who has, shall we say, a lot of stuff scattered across multiple properties.) After describing the Home Depot effect: “Yeah. Okay. But there’s something more to it, so my mind went some other places than “lumberyard.”” Smelling a bit on my finger: “Wow. That’s not just wood, it’s wood that’s been cut with a power tool, like a circular saw. Hot wood.” (Yeah, we’re taking “hot wood” out of context.)\n* Author’s note: Since I had a reaction to something in this scent, I let my friend take it. He likes the novelty of it but decided not to upsize.\n\n**Siren Song Elixirs Triss Merigold Spice** *(Honeycrisp apples, apple blossoms, caramel, fall spices, honey.)*\n\n- What I smell: In the vial, apples and spices – mmm! On my skin… oh no, the apple blossoms are like Nui Cobalt’s and that means they smell like soap.\n- What he smells: “Okay, definitely a fruit in the front and something more conventionally perfume-y behind it.” The apple/honey/caramel combo, and/or the sweetness of the apple, made him think of a tropical fruit first. It is a *very* sweet apple.\n- Author’s note: Y’all, I really just wanted Rosh Hashanah in a perfume. I’m so sad. I think this seals the deal for me and SSE - it's been terrible skin chemistry interactions every time.",

The brand began in 2017 and is owned by Courtney Brooks and Stephen Joiner. Joiner, is also the owner of the artisan brush company, Dogwood Handcrafts ([https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/](https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/)). This offering was released on May 11, 2019 and is part of a series created for the subreddit, r/wetshaving and is based on the American novel, The Great Gatsby. Southern Witchcrafts focus is on providing high quality vegan shaving products with scents that are interesting and unique. In addition to ordering direct, Southern Witchcrafts can be purchased at Maggard Razors ([http://www.maggardrazors.com/](http://www.maggardrazors.com/)) and Top of the Chain ([https://topofthechain.ca/](https://topofthechain.ca/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nValley of Ashes is a complex fragrance built with scent notes of:  Coal, Tar, Bourbon, Tobacco, Bitter Citrus, Smoke, Leather, Motor Oil, Burning Rubber, Diesel, Clove, Birch Tar and Bergamot. This scent intends to represent it’s namesake from the novel, where industrial factories emmite ashes from their coal fuel and the entire area is ripe with a gloomy, desperate overtone. The fragrance accomplishes this and opens with a sweet, metallic motor oil note that is quickly met by tar, coal and burnt rubber. The fragrance is rounded out by hints of citrus and clove, which lends to more palatability. While the scent is not my jam, I appreciate it for the complexity and the very real picture it creates. Mrs. Ruds does not approve of this scent and if I am to use it, I will find myself on the couch. This is a mid-strong scented fragrance and similar offerings from wet shaving are: Chiseled Face Groomatorium Midnight Stag and Talbot Shaving Double Trouble.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSouthern Witchcrafts uses a soap base of the vegan variety. The bases ingredients are listed as: Water, stearic acid, shea butter, castor oil, potassium hydroxide, glycerine, coconut oil, sodium lactate, sodium hydroxide, jojoba oil, aloe powder, liquid aloe, isopropyl myristate, kaolin clay and fragrance. The soap is soft to mid on the firmness spectrum. The soap base loads easily and lathers with very little effort. It is of normal thirst and whips into a lather that will have the consistency of cool whip. The slickness of this soap is excellent in both the visible slickness area as well as a secondary slickness. Post shave, like slickness is excellent as well. The oils and butters provide a luxurious feeling on the skin post shave. Given my experience with this soap base, it receives a ShaveScore of 92. Soap bases with similar performance are: Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements (CK-6) and Wholly Kaw (vegan). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Southern Witchcrafts Valley of Ashes (PIF)\n* Brush - Mozingo Brushworks “Dark Side” (purchased)\n* Razor - Rockwell 6S (purchased)\n* Post - The Club Signature (purchased)",

    "body": "TL;DR -- Is making estrogel worth it, or should I buy it pre-made? How do I get estradiol powder in Australia? Where can I get it pre-made?  \n  \nHallo, I'm considering using DIY. I would like to be able to make my own estrogel, but I'm willing to purchase pre-made from reliable sources. I read the wiki and I feel that if I were to make my own, I'd use this recipe, because I have sensitive skin;\n\n>u/ Juno\\_the\\_Camel's Adapted Recipe - Enhanced, Creamier Consistency:\n\n>\\- 10g active-pharmaceutical-agent (estradiol, testosterone, etc)\n\n>\\- 200mL vegetable oil\n\n>\\- 300mL isopropyl myristate\n\n>\\- 500mL (or 180g) of shea butter\n\n>This yields 1L of a more elegant HRT cream, with a creamier consistency, and an active-pharmaceutical-agent content of 10mg/mL. Note from u/ Juno\\_the\\_Camel: You will want to gently heat the mixture, as to melt the shea butter - in order to make a homogenous cream.\n\nI want to use extra virgin olive oil as my vegetable oil. As such, I've made this method and equipment list. Are these appropriate? I don't have much money, too. Am I making unnecessary purchases by adding all this equipment? Is there better equipment I could choose?\n\nEquipment:\n\n* Precision digital scale (miligram accuracy) \\*\n* Magnetic stirrer (or milk foamer)\n* Foil weighing boats (optional, can just subtract weight of beaker)\n* Nitrile gloves \\*\n* Lab spatula (or small teaspoon/butter knife)\n* Small Plastic funnel\n* 1L Glass beaker (or glass measuring cup, 100mL capacity lines)\n* 250mL Glass beaker (or glass measuring cup, 100mL capacity lines)\n* 250mL Glass conical flask (or glass measuring cup, 100mL capacity lines)\n* 10mL Glass measuring cylinder (mililitre notches)\n* Hot plate (or stovetop)\n* 10x 100mL Airless pump (this is the highest capacity I could find)\n* 10g estradiol powder \\*\n* 200mL extra virgin olive oil\n* 500mL shea butter\n* 300mL isopropyl myristate\n\n( \\* - Necessary; do not replace with alternatives.)\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Stir 10g estradiol powder into 200mL extra virgin olive oil (may take several minutes to completely dissolve).\n2. Combine isopropyl myristate into solution.\n3. Heat 500mL shea butter until liquid. Combine with solution.\n4. Stir mixture until homogeneous.\n5. Use small filter funnel to contain mixture within airless pumps.\n6. Store within a cool, temperature-controlled, dark space.\n\nI'm wondering where to source each of these products in Australia. Especially estradiol... Additionally, I wanted to know if I were able to purchase estrogel pre-made, and if it would it be a better alternative than making my own? It would likely be much much easier, but it might not be as... 'personified'?  \nHow do I verify the purity and quality of the products that I use?\n\nLastly, I would like information about progesterone. I feel it would be very helpful for me, despite how 'early' I am in my transition...\n\nP.S. I've been looking at Panacea Pharmacy. They only have two products listed; \n\n* Estradiol Enanthate\n* Estradiol Undecylate\n\nWhat do each of these do? What's the difference between these? I don't understand... ",

        "body": "Alright, lets get started. A few pointers:\n\n\\- I highly doubt you could make 10g of estradiol dissolve in just 200mL of extra virgin olive oil. As a general rule, you can assume estradiol is soluble up to 20mg/mL. I usually go with 10mg/mL for safety. In theory I think you can get up to around 30mg/mL. 50mg/mL though? I don't think that's possible\n\n\\- I'd suggest homogenising your extra virgin olive oil, isopropyl myristate, *and* shea butter together before adding the estradiol powder. The order you do things doesn't affect the final product, it's just the estradiol will never fully dissolve if added to too small a volume of oil\n\n\\- As for equipment. The equipment listed is more the ideal equipment. Realistically you could make this cream in a steel bowl in a saucepan filled with water on a very low heat. Or even by simply microwaving the shea butter in a pinch (never microwave estradiol). Milligram sensitive scales are only really important if you don't plan on using all the estradiol you've purchased previously. Someone's gone to the effort to precisely measure out a set quantity of estradiol, why waste that effort? That's what I did, I just dunked my whole 10g in, meaning I never needed a set of scientific scales\n\nAside from these 3 nitpicks, you're got a solid plan.\n\nAs for Panacea's estradiol enanthate and undecylate. These are esterified forms of estradiol, wherein the estradiol molecules have joined up with fatty acid molecules (enanthic and undecylic acid) (see estradiol valerate below as an example):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9jbwpx327k2e1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=de95b7208af95ff6518c1ffc5838d633dc8430ac\n\nEstradiol esters are more lipophillic than plain estradiol. Estradiol esters (when injected) linger around muscle fibres/fat deposits for weeks/months, gradually leaching into the blood stream, where they're metabolised into plain estradiol continuously. This yields very smooth estradiol levels in the blood. Estradiol esters also way bigger molecules, as such they kinda suck at penetrating the skin. 5.6mg of estradiol enanthate will penetrate the skin about as well as 1mg of plain estradiol (according to u/Estrgl's experiences), and estradiol undecylate has even poorer skin penetration. Don't buy these, they are not useful for you.\n\nIf you want to buy estradiol in Australia, Water Lily Pharmaceuticals ships internationally (if you don't mind their prices), if you're not happy with them, I'll dm you a reputable biotech company you could purchase from. Purplepanda labs and Dragonordnance also sell estradiol iirc.\n\nThe beauty of estradiol creams is that they contain antioxidants. These antioxidants are great at stabilising the estradiol, prolonging it's shelf-life, even when in contact with air. Airless pumps aren't as important as they are with alcohol-based gels (even with alcoholic gels, airless pumps might be overkill, more info is needed for me to be sure). Nevertheless, airless pumps are a convenient way to dispense fixed doses of cream.\n\nIf you're interested in buying an estrogel, see here: [https://diyhrt.market/](https://diyhrt.market/) It's more convenient, but much pricier this way. If you can afford it, it's your choice. I'd trust every vendor listed on this directory. It's a renowned, reputable directory of trusted sellers. Contact the folks who run it if you'd like to learn more about their criteria.\n\nHope this helps, lmk if you have any further questions, and please let us know how the cream goes. I'm eager to hear about it in practise.",

This discount does not apply to sample packs at this time.\n\n\nIn other news, we have been investigating more sustainable materials and carrier oils for our perfumes.  As of right now, we will continue to use fractionated coconut oil and almond oil, but this will be changing at a future date. Our first choice for alternatives is bran oil and possibly isopropyl myristate.\n\n\nWe have also made the decision to stop using natural sandalwood oils. This was not an easy decision, as sandalwood is an extremely important part of several of our formulations, and ubiquitous to perfumery in general. Unfortunately the ever growing demand has been slowly increasing the price as well as apparently increasing illegal activities, including illegally harvesting wild population and theft.\n\n\nWe are currently working on an accord using sustainable naturals and safe synthetics to replace sandalwood. The end result for our customers will be a similar product with less environmental and ethical concerns.\n\n\nUnfortunately, a replacement will change the scent of the end product, but we think the new ones will be just as good.\n\n\nDue to this change, we have added stock quantities to the affected products. Once this stock runs out, these products will be unavailable until the replacement formulations have been completed and appropriately aged.\n\nYou can find us at:\n\n [stone and wit](https://stoneandwit.com)\n\n[instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stone.wit/)\n\n[facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stoneandwit/)\n\nThank you!\n- S&W",

Joiner, is also the owner of the artisan brush company, Dogwood Handcrafts ([https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/](https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/)). Carpathia and Carmilla are winter seasonal releases from SW. Southern Witchcrafts focus is on providing high quality vegan shaving products with scents that are interesting and unique. In addition to ordering direct, Southern Witchcrafts can be purchased at Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/) and Top of the Chain (https://topofthechain.ca/).\n\nCarpathia is a tribute to Bram Stoker's Dracula. The fragrance is a blend of balsam, wet stone, exotic musk and black tea. The scent opens with a wonderful dark black tea smell. The musk notes and wet stone compliment the earthy dark tea so nicely. The balsam adds depth and continues the earth-centric vibe. While billed as a winter seasonal, I can see this fragrance being used year round. Mrs. Ruds enjoys this scent for casual wearing. Strength of scent is mid-strong once lathered. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements Tea Party 508 as a comparable scent profile. \n\nSouthern Witchcrafts uses a soap base of the vegan variety. The bases ingredients are listed as: Water, stearic acid, shea butter, castor oil, potassium hydroxide, glycerine, coconut oil, sodium lactate, sodium hydroxide, jojoba oil, aloe powder, liquid aloe, isopropyl myristate, kaolin clay and fragrance. The soap is soft to mid on the firmness spectrum. The soap base loads easily and lathers with very little effort. It is of normal thirst and whips into a lather that will have the consistency of cool whip. The slickness of this soap is excellent in both the visible slickness area as well as a secondary slickness. Post shave, like slickness is excellent as well. The oils and butters provide a luxurious feeling on the skin post shave. Given my experience with this soap base, it receives a ShaveScore of 92. Soap bases with similar performance are: Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements (CK-6) and Wholly Kaw (vegan). \n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Southern Witchcrafts Carpathia (promotional gift)\n* Brush - Dogwood Handcrafts Milkglass (purchased)\n* Razor - Jerry Stark #502 (gift)\n* Post - Catie’s Bubbles Eau De Thé (purchased)",

Their take on this genre includes scent notes of: sandalwood, musk, oakmoss, citrus, lavender, vanilla, oud, burnt white sage, burnt palo santo and gardenia. In typical Southern Witchcrafts fashion, this is a bold and unique take on the scent genre. The scent begins in a rather traditional manner that you’d expect from a classic powdery barbershop. As it develops and unfolds, Southern Witchcraft’s unique take shows it self. Oud, burnt white sage and burnt Pali santo bring this accord into the darkness in a very nice way. While not traditionally a fan of barbershops scents, I really enjoy this presentation. If you’ve read/watched enough reviews, you’ve probably already guess that this one doesn’t make the Mrs. Ruds approved list. Strength of scent on this offering is strong out of the container and remains this way once lathered.

    "body": "So, firstly I really need to slightly rave about my customer service experience. I emailed J from [**The Strange South**](https://www.strange-south.com/) asking for a little help on which scents I should try out in the new EdP format. I had missed the spring and summer collection completely, same as the layering notes and there were several I was interested in the newer fall and winter collection as well. \n\nI emailed a list of my favorites and J send me back a list of perfumes I might enjoy the most based on those and also offered to sell me samples in the EdP format, just in those same vials the oil based ones come in (I think there was a plan to offer the EdP format in spray bottle samples at some point). I jumped on the offer and made the order on the 29th of September. I paid $3 per sample and got the discount that was offered at the time of -40%. The order shipped on the 16th of October. I also asked if I could possibly try out the soda accord in the EdP format for a custom idea I have and J just promtly promised to send it as a freebie (I also got a freebie oil sample of Caught’Ye and a lollipop my SO claimed). Everything was neatly and securely packaged as always. I was real happy with the experience to say the least. My order also shipped well within the promised TAT, so maybe that side is also being improved on.\n\nI’ve had a good experience with the EdP format. I can’t really fairly comment on the throw as much, because I have the swipe sample vials and obviously the perfumes would be best used as sprays. To me they aren’t too strong at all and best of all, because I’m an international orderer, there’s no alcohol smell there (they’re made with isopropyl myristate instead of perfumer’s alcohol). A couple of swipes will get you a nice, slightly radiating scent cloud in my experience. I’d say the longevity will be better in the oil format, these ‘burn away’ a lot quicker and disappear completely at some point, whereas the oils stay as skin scents for much longer. However, I noticed far less of notes going wonky on my skin in the EdP format and I’ll note in the reviews when I noticed (or suspected more like) this being the case. The EdP samples seemed to also stabilize really quickly, so no long rest times needed for those in my experience.\n\nA note about me as a perfume user; I love weird things and atmospherics the most and don’t care for too sweet perfumes or being ‘smelled across the room’. I write about what I sniffed (in a long and rambly way) and some mental impressions that might have followed. This is another long one, maybe take a coffee break at the mid point.\n\n**Spring & Summer ‘19**\n\n**Mother Wild** (*Green tea, red wine, orchid, dew, and deadfall.*) (EdP)\n\nSo, as the name suggests, this smells wild. Like wild, old woods. Almost slightly mulchy. Which to me was actually quite surprising given the notes, not what I expected for some reason. The woods are dewy and green tea and red wine swirl around those woody notes. I think the combination of green tea and red wine sounded so intriguing, so I’m sort of disappointed they don’t get more of a spotlight. The orchid becomes apparent later and the floral note is pretty prominent. All in all, this is very pretty and quite simple. I like it in the EdP format, it’s not too sophistecated, but still approriate to a little more formal situations. The deadfall makes it atmospheric enough for me, and takes it away from being ‘just a floral’ perfume. This is however one of the safer options, if you want to try out The Strange South and are afraid of the more ‘out there’ atmospherics.\n\n**Thornback** (*Black locust, white tea, guaiacwood, and amber.*) (EdP)\n\nRoasty or toasty are the adjectives that come to mind when I first sniff this. The tea note is a marvel; teensy bit floral but has the same quality as roasted, puffed rice. It is definitely a cup of high quality tea, smells expensive. The tea also comes with a touch of milky vanilla, slightly sweet, reminds me of marshmallow cream notes in some perfumes. Behind them sneaks the guiacwood, like a stick of burning palo santo wood, but milder on the anise and lemony notes. This stuff is so mellow. There’s a touch of ashy notes there when inhaling deep and I marvel how this to me is slightly similar in a way to Sixteen92 Redrum (which I really enjoy). This one isn’t nearly as spiky, but vanillaed, milky tea combined with ash, there’s definitely common ground there. I really like this, even though it definitely is a little on the sweeter side. Apparently black locust tree flowers smell like musky honey, and hearing that, I can find a touch of musk and perhaps some of the sweetness or creaminess is coming from that accord as well. I don’t really sniff out anything too honey-like though, which I’m totally okay with. The amber doesn’t really register as an invidual note, so maybe it is just a smoothing agent.\n\n**Caught’Ye** (*Plum blossom, fig, burnt sage, heather, clover, catnip, and ruffled hair.*) (Oil)\n\nSo strong, this is knock your socks off volume on me. I get the minty catnip, a burning sage smudge stick and the plum blossom the strongest. I have a few other perfumes with plum blossom which I really enjoy, but here it is a little jarring with its power. The whole perfume calms down fast though and the combo of the burning sage and fig is really, really nice. If I inhale deep I can sense the heather in the background and though I’m not sure about this, but I think the fur note is also softening the whole composition. I’m not really getting anything hugely green, so the clover is lost on me I suppose. This might need more resting than the others, being an oil based sample. At this time Black Cat Oil is the winner of these two kitty themed offerings from TSS in my opinion.\n\n**Layering Notes**\n\n**Dagon** (*“I felt myself on the edge of the world, peering over the rim into a fathomless chaos of eternal night.”*) (EdP)\n\nSeaweed and ambergris and sort of watery green notes (not necessarily aquatic or florist shop styled though) and a composition that actually smells like face cream to me. I feel like there’s a smooth, pressed powder quality on the bottom of the more atmospheric notes. I do think there’s a clay or a mud note too, not very strong but a part of the accord. The perfume also fits the lovecraftian reference in that this one has that slithering feel to it. Dragon scales and snake skin and quite possibly tentacles. I’d wear this on its own while reading a fantasy book to set the mood, but also just for relaxing or for comfort because of that face cream quality I get from it. I’d like to layer this with a skin musk scent or anything that has cloth notes in them. This might just be the surprise favorite of the layering notes (well, I do love the Blood accord too). Use this to earthy up another perfume or to bring a slithering quality to them. The drydown has ozone I think, it’s almost silvery in quality. This just gets better and better.\n\n**Blackout** (*“How much more black could this be? The answer is none. None more black.”*) (EdP)\n\nOkay, I feel like I might be getting tricked by my skin chemistry here big time, but the first thing I get is chocolate. Dark chocolate. Not bitter per say, but definitely not sweet either. But then there’s also patchouli and aged patchouli gets real chocolatey on my skin quite often, so yeah (I see this still happens despite the EdP format). I also get something that reminds me of graphite or ash or maybe both? Like those rocks that are black but glint in different light in different colors, this has that quality. Shiny rocks with a hint of dust. So I’d try using this to darken a scent or to add a stony quality and/or a shiny, dark metallic vibe. Least favorite from the layering notes, but still a very wearable one.\n\n**Space Dust** (*The smoldering remains of comet trails, moon rock, and cosmic debris.*) (EdP)\n\nGreen metallic; platinum, rusted metals and copper. I’m guessing many noses will sniff this and only get a rooty green scent of galbanum or perhaps a kind of vetiver, but to me this is deliciously metallic in quality. The best metallic in my book is this particular one (it is in fact so metallic to me it feels weird in my teeth when I sniff this). I also sense a citrus looming there in the midst of that dark, rooty green. And almost a tea scent, tannic in a way. A touch of electrical fire smoke (that would probably be cade) and wires criscrossing, zapping with elecricity.  A super deep inhale will give me a little of that dusty rock accord, but that is not the main focus here. This is one of those veeery complex layering notes, that I feel would totally stand on their own as a perfume and so it almost feels a waste to layer with these. I’d maybe try layering this with a full on winter atmospheric (to imitate the starry skies you witness when the temperature really drops) or maybe something with vanilla musk (weirdly specific, but I have a feeling it would fit)? Layer this to go completely scifi. This will most definitely be my Outer Worlds perfume and would probably fit a Death Stranding playthrough as well!\n\nBonus:\n\n**Blood** (*Single note.*) (Oil)\n\nI just love this and have raved about it in several occasions, this is an aged bottle I asked for a long time ago (I doubt there’s been any reformulations though and seeing as I have it, I thought I might add it to the list of layering note reviews). It is just realistic enough (very realistic but doesn’t get yucky for a lack of a better word). On the scale this is somewhere between berried and floral versions of blood as a perfume note (veering more berried to my nose. There’s no unnecassary sweetness though and it is blended in a way, at least I can’t tell what berry scents might be involved. It’s more of an impression than anything), I don’t really get much in the way of incense notes. This has more than a touch of metallics too, copper definitely but maybe also a little iron. I think this is more of a slightly dried blood scent than freshly spilled, especially in the drydown. This is pretty strong and stands up to most other perfumes when layering. Perfect for any time you want to feel like a real life vampire or just primal up any scent really. I use this a lot as is.\n\n**Soda (Cola) Accord** (*Single note.*) (EdP)\n\nI don’t know why I expected less, but yet again an unique as f outlook on an often used and universally known scent. It has that cinnamon all cola notes have, but it’s almost like this one is build on a jammy fir note? It definitely has that sweetness and bubbliness of cola, so no winter or holiday candles here, but  definitely smells like there’s a tree note there. And maybe orange or other citrus? I don’t honestly enjoy it as much as I wanted to, maybe it works out better as an oil?\n\n**Fall and Winter ‘19**\n\n**Come Play With Us** (*Bourbon, waxed wood, stale water, red musk, and blood orange.*) (EdP)\n\nYummy, I don’t know what it is, but I love wax notes in perfumes. This is heavily waxy to start with, and smells like you’d have waxed wood surfaces against moisture with something slightly similar to candle wax, but not as sweet. Kind of reminds me of the stuff you put on skies to make them clide better. The blood orange and the red musk rise next and then it does get a little sweeter, but never heavy or cloying. I enjoy the way the blood orange works on me, it has a cristalline and popping feel to it. The waxed wood note makes way for the bourbon, which is more smooth than super alcoholic to my nose. Perhaps because it does sort of mix in with the water note, making the perfume a little aquatic in nature. The water note is really nice, no cologne or unnecessary cleanliness, but it doesn’t smell dirty either. It is like a glass of water you’ve filled at night and that’s been left untouched ‘till morning. I didn’t know there’s a scent for that, but the description of stale water just makes so much sense when you smell this. These uncanny and witty notes are the reason I enjoy TSS so much. I think this one is just super wearable and a nicely not that obvious nod to the reference material as well.\n\n**Gatlin** (*A cornfield burning against a night sky.*⁣) (EdP)\n\nWhat I would imagine is a dried out corn husk scent; a mixture of sweetness, a hint of salt and dryness that is not quite straw or hay (more familiar sniffs for me), but is sort of close. And then the other obvious part is the burning notes of smoke and ash. They’re pretty obviously there, but never overpower the husk scent, so it doesn’t turn into a ‘I was sitting in a bonfire’ type deal. I imagine this would probably be the strongest one if sprayed on still, the notes of the perfume seem super tenacious. This seems simple at a glance (or a sniff), but I do feel there’s a lot there to sort of set the mood, the atmospherics behind the two core elements. I can sense at least a dirt note, perhaps the same one as in Baby Shoes, and an element of cold air. To me this doesn’t necessarily read night time per say, but there’s a coldness there that suggest late autumn or early winter time. I want a custom some day of a Finnish equvalent to this, with the fabolous mud note of TSS and hay and straw and dried leaves and frost and maybe a touch of wool warmed by skin musk and a curl of smoke in the frosty air. I do enjoy this one, but the husk note did take some time getting used to, I thought it was overall weirdly sweet at first. Now though, I don’t know… I sort of keep sniffing it. There’s something comforting there, a sort of familiarity long gone now.\n\n**God of The Lost** (*Birch, mud, honey (vegan), pelting rain, and the hulking, faceless creature trailing your scent.*⁣) (EdP)\n\nStrong birch note, still reminds me strongly of root beer (which I’m really partial to), maybe slightly more herbal/medicinal here than just sweet/fizzy. Almost as strong is the mud note, that is just gorgeous, just that thick riverbed mud scent of the smoothest grey or like the most luxurious mud mask. The honey comes in third, it’s the same honey note The Strange South often uses, I can recognize it from Blood on The Moon for example. It is thick, slightly dusty (but not really powdery at all) and a little sweet. I can sense the rain more than just plainly sniff it out, I can imagine droplets hitting a ditch filled with water and hitting the sides of that riverbed of grey mud. I perhaps amp that honey note a little, because at times it seems a little oppressive even. The base to my nose is build on a shadowy musk, maybe like a mix between a breathy musk and a dark musk? Overall, not my favorite of the bunch (just too sweet with the honey and the birch), but I really appreciate the artistry of mixing these notes into something that works in unison. Also, I would like to bathe in this mud note.\n\n**Tall Paul** (*Splintered wood, chipped paint, the melange of sweets and musk from a bewildered crowd, and a memory of smoke.⁣*) (EdP)\n\nA melange of sweets is wildly accurate, I recognize a chocolate one out of the bat, but there’s definitely gummy candies in there too. And then the paint note sort of sneaks up on you and all of a sudden you’re really standing in a crowd. There’s a scent of smoke in the air, sort of a carny feel, with the sweets mingling there. And musk, sort of uncanny how it actually smells like standing close to a mass of people. A slightly sweaty scent, but not unpleasant in the slightest. I get fried foods now and cinnamon buns or perhaps that slightly spiced smell is the wood planks scent trailing behind. This is an atmospheric through and through and ya bet I’m going to layer this with Sixteen92 Loser’s Club. I still think that Pennywise very probably smells like TSS Abe Lincoln, Ancient Astronaut Expert, so maybe I’ll add that one too.\n\n**Commala** (*Mugs of spiced cider, tanned suede, prairie grass, rice, rain clouds, and dust kicked up from a heeled boot.*) (EdP)\n\nNngh, such a warming scent (as in this actually smells warmed)! There’s the suede note from Screamer (soft, fuzzy with a slight leathery/animalic edge) and a touch of cherry maybe? There’s also a warmed up note of cider, like the mulled wine we drink around Christmas, but with apples. The spices are super subtle and simmered. These two are the main features here but again, there’s an atmospheric backdrop to them. I can sense a dryness which I suspect is the prairie grass, but nothing reads green (this is all fuzzy browns). The rice brings an extra layer of cozy to me (it is similar to sniffing a bag of basmati rice if I really search for it), but doesn’t read hugely as an individual scent note. The atmoshere comes from the dust clouds mixing with the scent of petrichor rising from the dust as the rain is falling super gently. The drydown is quite dusty in that particular way sand dust smells (a very familiar scent from summer festivals and making sand soup as a kid, so comfort level here is through the roof for me). I can’t decide if this is more of a winter or a summer scent for me though, maybe this is versatile enough to wear during both.\n\n**Longer Than You Think!** (*The fuzzy, slowly decaying remnants of a mind gone mad. Gardenia, walnut, galactic resins, dust, and darkness.⁣*) (EdP)\n\nOkay, so, I’ve not had the best of luck with all of TSS’s florals. Especially the so called white florals have gone wonky to say the least. But here comes the EdP format to save the day it seems (I couldn’t pass by this one because it had such interesting notes, despite fearing I’d get something along the lines of baby wipes from it)! The gardenia is sooo buttery and rich!! I’m sure the walnut brings a touch of that as well (like a fatty note, if that makes sense) and almost an oaky woodyness. Plus I sense there’s a touch of spice there too. It’s actually really nice, no cat pee or poopoo or wet wipes, none of that. The backing is definitely resiny and a little dusty, I feel like myrrh and perhaps frankincense too are very possible culprits, but there’s a very real chance also pine or other softer conifer resin makes an appearance. The resins are a little spiky and super strong, at first the perfume was unapologetically floral but it does change into a resin festival once they get going. This one is so multilayered and complex and yeah, dark (I actually think there might even be a little aged patchouli in there to darken the composition). The perfume kind of demands a statement piece of clothing and a special occasion to accompany it. Not in my comfort zone, but an impressive perfume nonetheless.\n\n**Baby Shoes** (*Upturned dirt, gasoline, powdered skin, smashed apricots, cream, and white musk.*⁣) (EdP)\n\nOMG a gasoline scent from TSS that works on me?! I’d be lying if I wouldn’t be ultra tempted to try out the other two that failed miserably to work out with my chemistry in the oil format as EdPs. But anyway, Baby Shoes. I get all the notes and the effect is weird for sure, but not as weird as you’d maybe think. The white musk is the leading note, this is more of a clean laundry white musk than a perfumey one. Then I get a mix of the dirt, powdered skin and gasoline, the overall effect is softly powdery and slightly oily from the gasoline. The gasoline isn’t aggressive or the main feature here, but definitely still noticeable. The combo of notes reminds me of gasoline puddles more than say sniffing the air at a gas station or standing in an old garage. The dirt accompanies the gasoline, but is somewhat losing to the powdered skin note. The dirt is also the dry, slightly powdered version, not like a deep forest dirt, but more of a top soil or something you’d have in your flower pots type of deal. There’s a wet feel to it. The powdered skin combines with the laundryesque white musk and really makes me think of baby clothes. Super soft materials warmed by powdered, soft skin. The cream and the apricots are noticeable too throughout the scent life, though maybe not as such main features. The apricots don’t go pee-like or candied at all and the cream note doesn’t curdle or do any other weird tricks. EdP format truly works here. This is a super soft comfort scent, that still has a noticeable throw.\n\nOverall, a pretty good success rate this time around. And even when some of them weren’t for me, the perfumes managed to wow me with the artistry behind them nonetheless as per usual when it comes to my experiences with The Strange South.",

I was on the 0.05 cream for the first half of this period, and then the 0.1%.  As for Spiro, I started on 75mg and moved up to 100mg.  I used Tret and took Spiro till early January. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTretinoin cream gave me the worst closed comedones of my life--it didn't treat them.  I started for persistent, mild acne, and ended up with skin texture, especially on the right side of my face, that was horrendous.  After I finally accepted the fact that Tret could actually be making my skin worse, and not better, I did some research, and was horrified by the pore clogging ingredients. Isopropyl myristate? Not for me--no thanks.  It of course, also made my skin really dry.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe spirolactone made me tired.  Like, really tired.  And stole my libido.  And made me lose six pounds.  Which might work for some, but I'm 5'6, 120 pounds normally and a frequent gym goer, and I looked awful.  So many people in my life asked me why I was losing weight, or if I was trying to. My mom told me straight up that I looked terrible.  (Mothers, I know, I know.) And, best of all, it did absolutely NOTHING positive for my skin.  Zip, zero, nada.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I got a big jawline cyst the first week of January after almost six full months of this combo, I'd had it.  I ditched both.  I feel SO much better.  I've gained my weight back, my libido is normal again, I feel stronger.  I'm working on my skincare routine to target my concerns, and figuring out what I like--watching a lot of Dr. Dray youtube videos and she rocks.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just wanted to post this because if I had been wiling to trust my gut earlier I would have saved myself months of awfulness, but I was so so sure the combo was fool proof from all the wonderful posts on here that I persevered.  Trust yourself people!! Some things that are incredible for some of us are terrible for others!! \n\nLots of love.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Tret gave me terrible skin texture and Spiro sapped my energy, libido, and strength.  Trust your gut when it comes to how you feel!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

Tret is making sure everything that is under ( closed comedones, bumps and all that ) comes to surface . You need to have patience with tretinoin and you will only stop purging when your skin texture seems even so it can get worse before it gets better maybe that's why you had the impression of your skin getting worse. Also you need a lot of moisture, hydration and sunscreen always to avoid scars .\n\n Around month 4 - 6 is when you normally see fine lines disappearing , your skin will be smooth , acne gone, hyperpigmentation healing etc ...

The brand began in 2017 and is owned by Courtney Brooks and Stephen Joiner. Joiner, is also the owner of the artisan brush company, Dogwood Handcrafts ([https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/](https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/)). Southern Witchcrafts focus is on providing high quality vegan shaving products with scents that are interesting and unique. Their next offering, Tres Matres, will be released on March 20, 2019 and is a spring seasonal scent. Samples of this release are available now for ordering if you care to check it out ahead of the full release. In addition to ordering direct, Southern Witchcrafts can be purchased at Maggard Razors ([http://www.maggardrazors.com/](http://www.maggardrazors.com/)) and Top of the Chain ([https://topofthechain.ca/](https://topofthechain.ca/)).\n\nTres Matres is a tribute to Suspiria, a classic horror film. Scent notes are listed as: Amber, Oakmoss, Terrasol, Rosewood, Lavender, Almond, Calla Lily, Cotton, Octanal, Grapefruit, Cherry, Ginger, Salt. Ambergris, Ozone and Peach. The accord is billed as a floral petrichor scent by the artisan. To my nose, the scent opens with a sharp blast of terrasol and ambergris, which is complimented by the bitter grapefruit. Floral tones are subtle and lend themselves to the thought of a decaying flower garden where the soil is damp and ripe. The scent is quite balanced and complex. I would consider this scent a casual wear because of the earthy petrichor forwardness. The scent is multi-seasonal because of its balance and complexity. The strength of this scent is mid-strong out of the container and remains this way for the duration of the shave. \n\nSouthern Witchcrafts uses a soap base of the vegan variety. The bases ingredients are listed as: Water, stearic acid, shea butter, castor oil, potassium hydroxide, glycerine, coconut oil, sodium lactate, sodium hydroxide, jojoba oil, aloe powder, liquid aloe, isopropyl myristate, kaolin clay and fragrance. The soap is soft to mid on the firmness spectrum. The soap base loads easily and lathers with very little effort. It is of normal thirst and whips into a lather that will have the consistency of cool whip. The slickness of this soap is excellent in both the visible slickness area as well as a secondary slickness. Post shave, like slickness is excellent as well. The oils and butters provide a luxurious feeling on the skin post shave. Given my experience with this soap base, it receives a ShaveScore of 92. Soap bases with similar performance are: Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements (CK-6) and Wholly Kaw (vegan). \n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Southern Witchcrafts Tres Matres (promotional gift)\n* Brush - Turn-N-Shave “Tusk”  (purchased)\n* Razor - Wellington (purchased)\n* Post - Arianna & Evans Spartacus (purchased) ",

    "body": "I’m going to be honest; I never quite used sunscreen on my lips until a month ago. At the beginning of last year, I learned to religiously apply sunscreen in the morning and reapply after two hours in the sun. I gently smoothed it over my face, and rubbed it on my arms, legs, and the back of my hands. I was the subject of judgmental stares during swim season as I would be the only dude who applied sunscreen on his whole body, rather than just his face and shoulders. I made sure every part of my body that would see UV light was coated in a liberal layer of protection. Every part except my lips.\n\nGranted, my lips were always on the dry side, so I applied some SPF 15 Chapstick every now and then. But it was not broad spectrum. \n\nDo not neglect your lips! Skin cancer on the lips is not impossible (http://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/lip-cancer-not-uncommon). Furthermore, UV rays will certainly thin the skin on the lips and accelerate aging. And, worst of all, while 94% of 299 beachgoers were cognizant of the risks of UV damage, only 69% demonstrated an awareness of the risk of lip cancer.\n\nThe best part about protecting lips is that it’s so fast, easy, and cheap. A few glides of a $3 balm, a quick smushing of the lips, and they’re protected. However, *reapplication should be much more frequent*, because the sunscreen can be rubbed off when eating and drinking.  \n\nHere are some recommendations to get started. These are some of my favorites, but there are certainly many more options:\n\n* **Banana Boat Sport SPF 50 Sunscreen Lip Balm** [I recommend buying from Target for ~$3 a stick]: It has a pretty standard, Chapstick-esque texture, but I find it’s more moisturizing. The lip balm’s also water-resistant for 80 minutes, which is pretty freaking awesome. Broad-spectrum protection is assured from avobenzone stabilized with octocrylene. There’s also the added benefit of the antioxidants vitamins E, C, and A (in the forms of tocopherol acetate, ascorbic acid, and retinyl palmitate). It’s entirely fragrance free, and it’s slightly sweetened for all you compulsive lip-lickers (though one probably shouldn’t bite chunks off the balm!) \n\n\t*Ingredients*: Active: Avobenzone (2%), Octocrylene (10%), Oxybenzone (6%), Other: Petrolatum, Polyethylene, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Trimethylsiloxyphenyl Dimethicone, Microcrystalline Wax, Isopropyl Myristate, Cocoa Seed Butter, PEG-8, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ascorbic Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Silica, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Saccharin, Propylparaben, Butylparaben\n\n* **NIVEA a Kiss of Smoothness Hydrating Lip Care SPF 15** [I recommend buying from Target for $2.99 a stick]: This is much more emollient than Banana Boat’s balm, and definitely feels very rich on the lips. UVA protection is assured from avobenzone stabilized with octocrylene. Antioxidant properties make only a small presence from a sprinkling of shea butter in the formula. The product is ever so lightly fragranced.\n\n\t*Ingredients*: Active: Avobenzone (2.5%), Octinoxate (6.0%), Octocrylene (1.8%) Inactive: Octyldodecanol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Microcrystalline Wax, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Cetyl Palmitate, Myristyl Myristate, Polyglyceryl-3 Dilsostearate, Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Simmondsia Chinenesis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, C20-40 Alkyl Stearate, Beeswax, Fragrance.\n\n* **Shiseido Sun Protection Lip Treatment SPF 35** [$22.00 from Shiseido.com; uncertain how expensive it is at the department store]: $22 is definitely a major splurge for a lip product, especially when other great lip balms are much cheaper, but if one wishes to splurge, this is a good option! This features a combination of octinoxate and titanium dioxide for broad-spectrum protection. It provides a moderate amount of hydration, and leaves a faint (and I do mean faint, but definitely noticeable upon closer inspection) white cast, which can be a good and a bad thing. For those who wish to lighten and brighten their lips a little, this is a quick way to do it while getting sun protection. IMO, it looks particularly good on Asians (which is probably why Shiseido, a Japanese brand, created this!) However, if applied on chapped lips, minerals can collect in flaky parts and create white splotches. I recommend using a lip scrub and applying a thin layer of an emollient lip balm underneath if this is a problem. This product is moderately fragranced with the same scent Shiseido uses in their other sunscreens. This used to be labeled as SPF 36 and PA++, but I'm quite certain the formula didn't change.\n\n\t*Ingredients*: Active: Octinoxate (7.4%), Titanium Dioxide (5%), Other: Trioctanoin, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Triisostearin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Polyethylene, PEG/PPG-36/41 Dimethyl Ether, Microcrystalline Wax, Stearyl Glycyrrhetinate, Glutathione, Zinc Myristate, Thiotaurine, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Diisostearyl Malate, Sodium Magnesium Silicate, Glycerin, BHT, Fragrance\n\n\nAs a final note, I've used lip balms with SPF as a sunscreen stick for other parts of my body (like the back of my hands) in a pinch. It works pretty well, but it feels pretty gross cause it's been all over the mouth haha.\n\n**Good luck and godspeed with all sunscreen-related endeavors!**\n",

The prescription I used was older so I count my official start date from 12/16/24 when I started using a fresh prescription. I also started taking minocycline twice daily at this time. I have been a lurker on this sub and have scoured for purging posts. My cheeks have always been a problem area but never quite this bad, with my temples and forehead having only minor breakouts prior. \n\nSince starting tret, it has been ups and downs between seeing what seemed like progress only to get new pimples. I feel like i’m constantly telling myself that this pimple will be the final purge pimple, only to have new cysts or pustules erupt. I have experienced no stinging and only minor tingling on especially cold, windy days. I have been getting acne in spots where i’d normally get them, and i no longer peel (had some flakiness at the beginning). Does this seem like normal purging? It feels like my acne isn’t sticking around as long but every blemish leaves new PIE/PIH that will take much longer to clear. I have asked my dermatologist to fill a gel prescription as well to see if isopropyl myristate is causing issues. \n\nMy routine hasn’t changed for 6+ months since before starting tret, and no new products have been added save for tret.\n\nAM\n\nCeraVe Hydrating Foaming Oil Cleanser\n\nLa Roche Lipikar Triple Repair Moisturizing Cream\n\nBeauty of Joseon Sunscreen\n\nPM\n\nsoftymo Speedy Cleansing Oil\n\nCeraVe Hydrating Foaming Oil Cleanser\n\nLa Roche Lipikar Triple Repair Moisturizing Cream\n\nwait 15 min\n\nTretinoin 0.05% cream, sandwiched \n\nWhat would you recommend?

It's stayed mostly clear for the last 2 years.\n\nI say that to say, it made me realise how important the moisturising aspect is in clearing your acne. The active ingredient in the cerave retinol was wayyyy weaker but cleared it wayyy quicker, that can only be down to reduced irritation and the amount of ceramides and soothing ingredients in there. \n\nNow I want to try tret again and I'm going to be using this advice I've stuck by for some time, if my skin feels tight after washing, skip tret (or retinol in my case) that night. I have done this with active acne before and it has calmed overnight. \n\nAlso try a hyalauronic acid or niacinamide serum:) it really really helps. good luck",

        "body": "Hi. I was prescribed tretinoin for mild acne and closed comedones. I first used 0.025% cream for about 4 months and then 0.05% cream for about 5 months. It didn’t help me much…acne got better and then worse again. Was v cyclical. Personally, tret wasn’t it for me.\n\nI went to a different dermatologist this year and he prescribed me 0.3% adapalene w benzoyl peroxide (epiduo forte gel). His reasoning was that the cream version of tret was probably making my acne worse. Apparently it is not uncommon. Look it up. Also, gel was not an option as insurance wasn’t gonna cover it. I have been on 0.3% adapalene for 1.5 months and it has been working out great for me. It has cleared my skin so much… tret could not do that for in 9 months. Not saying that switching might he the best option for you, but maybe talk to your dermat about other retinoids? Maybe the ingredients in 0.05% cream are clogging you too.\n\nHave you heard of this website - https://acneclinicnyc.com/pore-clogging-ingredients/. It contains a list of most common pore cloggers and when you copy paste the ingredients of your skincare, it will check for comedogenic ingredients. I ran all my skincare and makeup through this site and am only using products that were given a clear. That also has been helping a lot. The products that you currently use seem to have pore cloggers. \n\nAlso, cream by itself was/is not enough to moisturize and hydrate my skin. I had start using a face oil (TO’s rosehip seed oil) and i see a clear difference. Maybe look into that too? I was pretty skeptical about using face oils since i am acne prone, but it has been helping. So i urge you to do some research and look into it too. \n\nHopefully some info here can help you out!! :)",

What works for my skin may not work for yours so take my review with several grains of salt.\n\nEver since I raved about the *Vprove Optimula Hyaluron Poten Balance Cream*\\(which I've nicknamed Jesus Cream. Why? I'll talk about it later\\) back in February, I've received many requests to review it and other products from the brand. Sorry for not writing a review sooner! I didn't start using the Sebumiss cream until last week and a very very small part of me didn't want to review Jesus Cream at all because, well, it's more difficult to get, stock often runs out, and I don't want to be scalped on Amazon\\(where it often goes for more than $30\\). However, it's important to share good products with everyone here because it may become a HG to someone else. Now, onto the review.\n\n**My skin type:** combination/oily\\(bout to become realllll oily in a few weeks\\), quite acne prone, not sensitive to fatty alcohols, butylene glycol, fragrance, or essential oils. My skin hates isopropyl myristate with a passion. It also doesn't like beeswax too much.\n\n[Here's my collection of Vprove products.](https://imgur.com/5GPovEF) From left to right: Sebumiss Hydra Cream, Jesus Cream, Zinc Oxide Tone Up Cream, and Oil Paper Cream.\n\n**Jesus Cream:**\n\n* *Why do I call it Jesus Cream?* Well. Like Jesus, it performs miracles. It also turns a [mediocre list of ingredients](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_284b290016.html) into something amazing, analogous to how Jesus turned water into wine.\n* [Where I bought my backup and my backup for my backup.](http://bbcosmetic.com/vprove-optimula-hyaluron-poten-balance-cream-50ml/) Also contains description and claims.\n* *Packaging:* I like it. It's very sturdy and has a nice heft to it. It is one of those creams that have the container within a container thing \\- it has the same amount of product as the Sebumiss cream but the container's noticeably larger.\n* *Texture*: Slightly thicker than a typical gel cream. Applies like silk with almost no stickiness. Sinks in within minutes but you can still feel the moisture on your face. Texture\\-wise, this is the best cream I've ever used.\n* *Scent:* a very strong, overpowering floral scent. It's pretty polarizing. I'm completely fine with it but if you're sensitive to fragrance, run far far away.\n* *The good*: it packs a heavy dose of moisture without the discomfort and tackiness of other creams that do the same thing\\(looking at you, Rosette\\). However, it doesn't make me more oily than usual and does a great job at balancing my skin. It has a very nice finish \\- if you have nice skin, this is the only thing you need to get that chok chok. It has a wonderful texture \\- not greasy but cooling and comfortable. It also doesn't aggravate inflamed/irritated skin. Most importantly, it does not break me out and played a big part in repairing my moisture barrier.\n* *The bad:* [SMELLLLLLLLLLLL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj85e_zMyKg).\n* *How I feel*: I love this. More importantly, my skin loves this. It is a heavy moisturizer without being heavy. It does everything it's supposed to do. I did need an occlusive over it when my skin was dehydrated but afterwards, it was the only face cream I used until [I panned it](https://imgur.com/GcHr6or), which took slightly longer than two months with day and night usage.\n* *9.5/10. Docked half a point for the overwhelming fragrance. Will buy and buy forever until I find something even better. Am completely willing to build a shrine for this cream. However, I'll finish using some other creams in my collection before I start using my backup.*\n\n**Sebumiss Hydra Cream:**\n\n* [Ingredients list on Cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_31c8363050.html)\n* [Where I bought mine, along with product description and claims](http://bbcosmetic.com/vprove-sebumiss-hydra-cream-50ml/)\n* *Packaging:* It's pretty nice. Sturdy matte plastic for the container and the cap with teal accents. It has a lid but doesn't come with a spatula. What you see is what you get \\- there's no container within the outside container if that makes sense.\n* *Texture:* It's a gel cream in the container \\- slightly translucent and feels cushiony. You can definitely feel the dimethicone in it, especially once you start applying it on your face. It starts out slightly tackiy but dries down quickly to a semi\\-matte finish.\n* *Scent*: subtle floral scent. Not in your face and I really like it.\n* *The good*: it moisturizes. It has a very nice scent. Feels good on the skin after it dries down.\n* *The bad*: SEBUMISS MY ASS. It offers no oil/sebum regulating properties whatsoever \\- my face still gets oily very quickly. It also does nothing for smoothing out pores. Also, it might be giving me clogged pores \\- I have to test this for another week to be sure.\n* *How I feel about it*: I don't really like it. I don't enjoy the slightly sticky sensation it gives when I first apply it but my skin feels really nice once it dries down. It does moisturize a bit \\- definitely not enough during the winter, but fine as a day and night cream during spring and summer. I don't like applying this at night though due to the dimethicone.\n* *6/10. Will not repurchase but will finish it unless I'm sure that it's giving me skin problems*.\n\n**Zinc Oxide Tone Up Cream:**\n\n* [Very long ingredients list](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_313b363330.html)\n* [Where I bought mine](http://jolse.com/product/vprove-cream-expert-zinc-oxide-tone-up-cream-35ml/10500/?cate_no=529&display_group=1)\n* [Product description and claims](http://kosmeshop.com/product/vprove-cream-expert-zinc-oxide-tone-up-cream-35ml/8178/)\n* *Packaging*: sturdy plastic squeeze tube with thin nozzle. I really wish the cap was bigger.\n* *Texture*: A white cream similar to a thick sunscreen.\n* *Scent:* I see it in the ingredients list but I honestly don't smell anything.\n* *How I feel:* I don't have a lot of opinions on this because I use it on my neck so that it matches my face color \\- my neck is noticeably darker than my face and decolletage. I can't say if it breaks me out or not because I've never used it on my face. However, it's a pretty good tone\\-up cream \\- it brightens the skin without leaving a noticeable white cast.\n* *7/10. Does what it's supposed to do. Not repurchasing because it's probably going to take me a decade to finish this.*\n\n**Oil Paper Cream:**\n\n* [Ingredients list](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_a50d363338.html)\n* [Where I bought mine](http://jolse.com/product/vprove-cream-expert-oil-paper-cream-35ml/10502/?cate_no=529&display_group=1)\n* [Product description and claims](https://www.beautystall.com/en/vprove-cream-expert-oil-paper-cream-35ml.html)\n* *Packaging:* basically the same as the tone up cream but with mint accents.\n* *Texture:* a thick balm with a very 'silicony' texture. Unlike most silicone\\-heavy primers\\(Lancome La Base Pro, Smashbox Photo Finish Primer Original, etc.\\), this one doesn't feel greasy at all.\n* *Scent:* again, it's in the ingredients list but I don't smell anything.\n* *How I feel*: It's... fine. It sucks as a primer: foundation slides right off but it's not what this cream is supposed to do anyways. It's a great blotting cream, though. And it's pretty decent at controlling oil and doesn't break me out. It layers beautifully on some foundations but breaks down others.\n* *7/10*. *I can just use blotting papers lol, the two are basically the same. This bottle will probably last for the rest of my life because it takes the tiniest amount to cover most of my problem areas. Not gonna repurchase.*\n\n**My thoughts of Vprove as a brand:** An OK brand with one standout product. I only bought the Sebumiss and the two tubes because I liked Jesus Cream so much that I wanted to know more about the brand. Honestly, I'll be fine as long as they keep making Jesus Cream \\- it's definitely their bestseller along with the rodiola cream\\(which I haven't tried and don't want to\\).\n\nThanks for reading my long\\-ass review! Hopefully this was an adequate introduction to Vprove and some of its products. I know this brand really doesn't get talked about here but some of their stuff is really worth trying.\n\n[**Bonus shelfie**](https://imgur.com/a/62VefVq) \\- do let me know if you want reviews on anything.\n\n**Current routine:**\n\n* Morning\n   * Clinique pepstart wipes if I wake up early enough to hit the gym\n   * Cosrx Good Morning Cleanser\n   * Active\\(Drunk Elephant C\\-Firma or Stridex\\)\n   * LJH Tea Tree Essence if my skin's in rough shape\n   * Moisturize\\(currently w/ sebumiss\\)\n   * Kumargic eye cream\n   * Sunscreen\\(Canmake Mermaid or Biore Face Milk\\)\n* Night\n   * Banila Clean It Zero\n   * Cosrx Good Morning Cleanser\n   * Etude Soon Jung toner if my face is feeling dry\n      * Repeat as many times as I need\n   * Active\\(Curology or Drunk Elephant TLC\\)\n   * LJH Tea Tree essence if my skin's in rough shape\n   * 1:2 ratio of squalane and rosehip oil\n   * Moisturize\\(currently also using sebumiss because I like testing one product at a time\\)\n   * Kumargic eye cream\n   * Castor oil on lashes\n* Other products\n   * Origins pink mask 2x a week\n   * Drunk Elephant Sukari Babyfacial 1x a week\n   * Etude House Soon Jung Panthensoside Balm on inflamed/irritated areas as needed\n   * Etude House Soon Jung Barrier Cream on dry patches and flakes as needed\n   * Mario Badescu Drying Lotion on unopened whiteheads\n   * Cosrx pimple patches on open ones\n   * LRP Effaclar Duo on cystic and hormonal acne",

I did 40% hemisqualane, and then 20% each cetyl alcohol, isopropyl myristate, and shea butter. It set up into a weird loose gel, which was interesting but not the topic of my question; when I rubbed that on my hands, it left behind... sparkles? Looking closely, it looks like... honestly a bit like VERY tiny, rough-cut clear cellophane confetti, I think it's probably some ingredient that didn't fully melt or combine with the others (I did take the mixture off the heat pretty much the second everything looked melted, stirred it, and popped it in the fridge, so maybe one or both of those was responsible for this weirdness)? It's obviously not confetti, that's just the best way I could think to describe the visual. I don't think I could get a picture of it, I can only really see them when the light hits them just right. I am sitting here rubbing my hands and I can't tell if they eventually melted and rubbed in, or I just wiped them off. So........ what?? Just happened?? What the absolute heck? I wouldn't even know how to google this.",

It worked well in the beginning, but a few months ago I started getting this textured, clogged feeling. I’ve tried using it three times since then, and each time I get those micro-sized bumps all over my face—forehead, cheeks, chin—and they take weeks to clear.\n\nAt first, I thought it was my moisturizer or another product causing the bumps, so I kept stripping my routine and trying to heal my skin. But after these three separate attempts, I’m finally sure the culprit is the tret cream itself—maybe because of the heavy cream base or ingredients like isopropyl myristate, which can clog pores.\n\nI don’t want to give up on retinoids because they help my acne, but I think the cream formula is too heavy for my oily-combo, acne-prone skin.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this and found a better alternative? Would adapalene be a good switch? Or should I try tretinoin gel, Altreno, or micro-formulated versions?",

    "body": "I'm sooo frustrated. Recommendations greatly appreciated. \n\nTLDR I need an SPF 50+ that gives good sun protection, won't break me out or sting my eyes, sits under makeup without pilling or making me look like a panda all day, and doesnt give much white cast... without requiring me to sell the soul of my first child to afford it. So far, nothing. \n\nI'm not really willing to pay more than £15 for 50ml of product (broke student here), so LRP Anthelios is out of the question. I heard good things about the Garnier shaka fluid dupe but it has isopropyl myristate pretty high on the ingredients list which I hear is very comedogenic. I also try to avoid stuff with perfumes but with how hard it is to find a decent spf for this price i'm not too bothered about that. \n\nI'm intrigued by the Bondi Sands fluid dupes... the Hydra UV protect and Fragrance Free fluid both look pretty good if anyone has opinions? \n\nThings I've tried: \n\nSoltan SPF50 Protect & Moisturise with Niacinamide: 6/10 doesnt sting, gives me glass skin and no white cast but is NOT compatible with makeup, also when it rains it turns back into white liquid which is not a good look. Can't apply near my eyes as it stings. \n\nSuperdrug SPF50 Sensitive Face Cream: 6/10 feels nice on the skin, non greasy, not much white cast, but pills even with no makeup on. Doesn't make my mascara run but no makeup can be blended directly on the skin. \n\nGarnier SPF50 senssitive over Makeup Spray: 4/10 I feel like this doesn't really do anything and use it more to top up over makeup. Holy shit it stings my eyes, even when I cover them with my hand while I spray the rest of my face. Leaves a film of white droplets on my skin even when I pat it in. I also think it's breaking me out.\n\nCetaphil SPF50 moisturiser: 7/10 best of the bunch but still not optimal. Thick and uncomfortable to apply, leaves me looking like casper initially, but sinks in okay. Id avoid if youre a poc. Doesn't break me out and tolerates makeup the best, but it still stings my eyes slightly if I don't add powder on top, and my makeup creases. No pilling at least, just crease-y eyelids and after a few hours i get panda eyes. It's also £15, and maybe my expectations are too high but for the top of my budget I would expect something slightly better. \n\nI'm almost caving and buying LRP but I'm so broke that I really don't want to resort to that. I've heard good things about skin aqua but conflicting stories about them not being as rigorously tested as UK brands? I hope that's bull though.",

The [regular version](https://beautykick.com/evy-technology-sunscreen-mousse-spf50-150ml.html) can be found for about £20ish for 100ml most of the time. If you want even more value then the [kids version](https://beautykick.com/evy-technology-sunscreen-mousse-kids-spf50-150ml.html) is also about £20ish for 150ml - I believe the only difference is that the regular version has a form of vitamin c in it. Another way of approaching it is to try the version they do which also would act as a replacement for your moisturiser, so you'd save money that way, [which is this version](https://www.gorgeousshop.com/evy-technology-daily-defense-mousse-spf50-75ml.html).\n\nMy personal preference is to use the regular version as I like my moisturiser and I welcome the extra vitamin c/antioxidants as I don't have much of them elsewhere in my routine, but they really are completely unlike anything else in the market and have even done some of their own clinical trials around things like water resistance too. Top notch stuff.\n\nI personally avoid Asian SPFs as they tend to be designed for very light wear (unless they specify otherwise) and I just want to stick something on in the morning and forget about it.

    "body": "This is the third of what has panned out to be four reviews from my massive haul from the destash threads ([Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/oz8f8z/first_reviews_of_the_haul_scent_battle/) and [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/p1re2k/second_reviews_of_the_haul_a_headoverheels_love/)). This review includes fragrance samples that struggled to make an impression, one that didn't even make the semifinals (as it were), and one... that just might become a signature. On to the scents!\n\n**Solstice Scents**\n\nThornwood Thicket – *sugared blackberries, amber, oud, guaiacwood, oakmoss*\n\nI didn’t mention this during my review of “Blackburn’s Parlor” since that was a sort of battle-focused review, but: Solstice Scents was the first indie / DIY fragrance house I learned about. I started my fragrance journey / hobby on Fragrantica, which is where I discovered a lot of niche labels – but they’re light on the indie stuff. However, Solstice Scents was the first I came across; and I loved the pictures on the fragrances, the diversity of notes… just the overall aura of the house as “New England community enjoys small town life until something sinister happens” (although, surprise! Solstice Scents is based in Florida). After that I came across Alkemia Perfumes, Poesie, Kerosene (maybe niche), Imaginary Authors (maybe niche), Arcana Wildcraft, and finally Debaucherous Bath (which was only added to Fragrantica after the house had become defunct, boo). So when I was finally trying “Blackburn’s Parlor,” I’d really hyped this house up in my mind. And it was a letdown – that scent, anyway. So I proceeded to “Thornwood Thicket” with far more caution, and…\n\nGosh, this one is just *so frickin’ good!* This is what I’d wanted from looking at all those pictures from the brand! For one thing, the opening is blackberry preserves of the absolute highest quality, it’s a very happy and comforting opening. But the drydown is when the fun starts, because the scent that wafts (decent projection) is that of burning candle wicks, like in an occult shop. (Someone on Fragrantica made a hookah / shisha association, and I don’t think they’re far off.) And the best part of this fragrance is the memories it conjures up for me. See, there’s this farm that’s about a forty-five-minute drive from me that markets itself as a “pumpkin patch,” but year-round they sell all kinds of produce and have a quaint country store and other amusements. But their biggest draw, by far, is Halloween, because they go *all out*: confections / fried dough / corn (including corn mazes), costumes, haunted houses, hayrides (included “haunted” ones), etc. I absolutely loved going to this place in October as a child, and I haven’t been there in so long; but on the drydown “Thornwood Thicket” took me back there. As soon as I smelled it I was passing through the candle / incense shop on my way to find a new Halloween costume, and then maybe buy some fudge. Bonus: this perfume lasts upwards of 9 hours.\n\nThere are a lot of fragrances that smell really pretty, or really delicious, or in some other appealing way. But smelling “Thornwood Thicket” actually made me happy.\n\nRating: **5**/5 – new top priority FS, because I will likely wear this year-round\n\n**Nui Cobalt Designs**\n\nShenanigans – *layered yellow cake touched with lemon zest and rum, glazed with apricot, and finished with a cloak of dark chocolate*\n\nThe chocolate was what intrigues me most regarding this, and on that front I wasn’t disappointed. Shenanigans opens with a very boozy chocolate, I could clearly detect the rum. However… while I’m sure, based on the description, that Schichttorte tastes amazing, the way this dried down on my skin was not. It felt like the lemon zest was battling with the chocolate, and the aftereffects were quite similar to the bitterness / iciness I’d experienced with the banana perfumes. Also, as far as boozy chocolates go, I think Vintner’s Reserve “Orange Cream Truffle” (smells like it was made with Grand Marnier) has this beat, sorry.\n\nRating: **2.5**/5 – does not work with my skin, definite destash\n\nHogwash – *simple, delicate, soft-baked butter biscuits (cookies to you American folk) scented with rose water and a scant pinch of lemon zest*\n\nThis was another freebie (only when doing these reviews did I realize how many freebies I was given – thank you, IMAM members!), and one that surprised me. Not because it was a great new love, or anything. No, what I found surprising was that this was in a gourmand collection to begin with. “Hogwash” is clearly the fragrance Nui Cobalt snuck into the April Fools Collection for the people who don’t like gourmands, to let them know, “See, I got something for you, too!” It’s described as a lemon biscuit / cookie scent, but really it’s like a… lightly lemon-scented lotion. No, I mean it, there’s an aspect to the scent profile that reads “lotion,” texture and everything. It’s a skin scent and doesn’t last very long, but I’d recommend “Hogwash” for people with sensitive noses who want subtle refinement.\n\nRating: **3**/5 – definite destash\n\n**Fantôme**\n\nMadame d’Espérance - *Sage underlined with creamy jasmine, sensual red patchouli, frankincense, dusty cedar, a hint of rose, and intoxicating ambrette. As the sage begins to disperse like thick smoke, sweet blood orange and frankincense come to the forefront of this resinous blend.*\n\nAs you can see, Fantôme went all-out with the marketing speech on the notes for this one. But I knew nothing about this going in: the small spray bottle was a freebie with one of my orders, and a very surprising one because it’s an Isopropyl Myristate (https://www.byrdie.com/isopropyl-myristate-4773801) that can be shipped internationally, as the Canadian swapper who I got it from explained it to me. I’d never heard of it before, and was intrigued! But then I remembered my allergic reaction to “Morozko” (which is a shame, because it’s a lovely fragrance). So instead of looking up the notes I decided to spray a tissue first, which is often how I test sprays before applying to the skin (this doesn’t work with oils). I sprayed a couple times, sniffed; and given the title “Madame d’Espérance” I was worried this would be a *boudoir* scent (I hate cosmetic / powder accords), but there was none of that here. What there was, was something *bitter*. I kept trying to place it, but couldn’t. It was so bitter an unpleasant that I rushed to look up the notes.\n\nAnd that’s when I saw it: SAGE. *That* was what was coming off the tissue! Probably the only herb / spice that I don’t like to smell even while cooking. I recognize that I’m rather alone in my intense dislike of sage (lots of people love burning sage – no, I swear I’m not being repelled from your home because I’m a toxic entity, I just really don’t like the smell!), but it can’t be helped. So… yeah, this needs to leave my house.\n\nRating: N/A – never tested on skin, I just have a sage problem  \n\n**Vintner’s Reserve**\n\nWitch, Please – *boozy bourbon barrel-aged cabernet and vanilla cream ale*\n\nMy frustration with this house is palpable. One the one hand: I greatly enjoy the aesthetic (based on family roots in a vineyard) and love so many of the scent descriptions – which often pan out in reality! But on the other hand… VR has a serious problem with staying power. This has been consistent in most samples of their perfume oils that I’ve tried, and “Witch, Please” is no exception. Because while the scent is compelling (the cabernet comes out on the skin right off the bat, eventually morphing into the boozy vanilla), it’s practically gone by the three-hour mark. And I also don’t think I’m the only person with this problem, going by other reviews on IMAM, so I doubt it’s just skin chemistry. Maybe this house should consider doing EdP versions of their scents? In any case, I think I’ll be looking at their other products (lotions, scrubs, etc.) in the future.\n\nRating: **3**/5 – pleasing, but fleeting, scent\n\n**Hexennacht**\n\nCitrine – *mock-orange, neroli, orange blossom, tuberose, white amber*\n\nThis is a house that gets a lot of hype on these boards, so I was excited to try it. I also posted in one of the earlier haul reviews about looking for an indie replacement for Clean “Acqua Neroli” (mainstream). Funnily enough, “Citrine” can almost be considered a dupe in terms of scent profile, the only difference being the addition of tuberose. And when I sniff my arm I can detect that lovely flower – at least, I could in the beginning. The problem with this is that it’s a very faint scent that sort of clings to skin, but it practically gone at the four-hour mark. So I feel like I’m not truly allowed to enjoy the citrus-and-white-flower goodness in this vial. I could’ve potentially done a scent battle between this and Nui Cobalt “Clarity,” and on my skin “Clarity” would’ve crushed this.\n\nRating: **2.5**/5 – I can barely detect it",

I've been using it for probably 5 years consistently now and will keep using it as long as I can (mostly from fear that other products will give me itchy bumps like the kose oil did).

If you're going to double cleanse anyway I don't see the need really for it to emulsify, although you may have some residue. I'd use an emulsifier if you wear a lot of makeup you want to be sure to get off.\n\nCleansing oils are easy to mix yourself so you can adjust ingredients based off of what works by trying different oils, starting with ingredients with low/no comedogenicy. The difference between western OCM and AB double cleanse is that in AB the oils are always emulsifying and you use the second cleanse to get rid of any excess (although I usually just do first cleanse because my skin is dry), whereas OCM you use a towel and warm water to physically remove the oil, and any residue acts as hydration. The ingredients are largely the same, though, so you can use OCM resources to figure out a good oil blend for your skin and then add an emulsifier and use it in your AB routine.",

    "body": "Disclaimer: I’m not a Color Street stylist and I purchased the remover with my own money, although my stylist offered a deal if you bought it.\n\nIngredients: Both CS and MF have three ingredients: methyl acetate, isopropyl myristate, and fragrance. CS lists their fragrance as black bergamot, MF’s is just generic fragrance. The proportions are obviously different between CS and MF, but there’s no pretending CS has invented something new and different. They’re basically copying MF. Winner: **MF**, just for being the original \n\nScent: CS has a sharp acetone smell that made me cough if I got too strong a whiff. The bergamot scent was nice, but it was an undertone to the acetone smell. MF has a slightly odd but not unpleasant fragrance I couldn’t name, but it doesn’t have nearly as strong an acetone smell, which makes **MF** the winner.\n\nHand feel: MF has that oily feel which makes me want to immediately wash my hands. CS had a much silkier hand feel, which makes **CS** the winner here. \n\nEffectiveness: I trialed CS with Capitol Hill, a chunky glitter. Chunky glitters are notoriously hard to remove.  I first tried the “wipe” method advertised on the bottle with the intention of trying wiping on one hand and a warm water baggie soak on the other, but I got so frustrated trying the wipe method on my thumb I gave up and got warm water and a baggie.  As this is how I use MF, I won’t deduct any points from CS.  CS seemed to take longer to remove my polish than MF, and I ended up picking off the last bits of glitter, but as this was a chunky glitter and I rarely wear those, I’ll give CS a pass this time. Winner: **???**\n\nPrice: CS retails for $2/ounce. MF normally retails for $2/ounce but has been marked down to $1.50/ounce.  MF is a slightly better deal, but it’s going to depend on any special deals you get from your stylist. Winner: **MF**, just because you don’t have to wait for a deal. \n\nOverall: At the end of the day, CS’s acetone smell was a dealbreaker for me. If it was a miracle remover, I’d probably overlook it, but it’s not.  I’ll try CS again on regular polish and probably edit this post if there’s interest, but when I’m out of remover, I know what I’m buying again: **Mineral Fusion**.",

The overall  effect of the reformulation is a slightly more fruity aspect to the dry  down.\n\n**No More Galaxolide**\n\nAfter weeks of reading studies and meta studies, I've  \ndecided that Galaxolide will no longer be used in my formulations. Available  \nevidence points to Galaxolide being a bio-accumulative pollutant, as well as  \nslowly but surely rising levels in fresh and salt water. Phasing out of  \nGalaxolide has already started with the new releases and several reformulations  \nare on their way (starting with 1899). Luckily, I only have a handful of  \nfragrances that have used it. As the replacement I have been and will be using newer  \ngeneration musks that do not have the environmental persistence nor the the  \npotential of harming sea life that Galaxolide does.\n\n**Website Updates:**\n\nScreen reader compatibility is so close to being finished.  \nThere  are two sections of the website that have become my major sticking  points – the checkout page and the buttons. I haven’t mentioned this  lately, but I have been working on it.\n\nSeasonal Suggestion Catalogs are still in progress, I’ve  \nbeen waiting for this release to start implementing them. You should see them  \nmagically appear tomorrow.\n\n**The Switch to Isopropyl Myristate (IPM)**\n\nI’ve been considering this switch for a while, and I felt  \nthe best time to start phasing in isopropyl myristate would be during a new  \nrelease, since these posts and announcements reach the most people at once.  \nOverall, data suggests that IPM has a longer shelf life and is more  \nenvironmentally friendly than fractionated coconut oil (when farming and  \ntransportation is considered). I’ll have more about this in a future Instagram  \npost.",

I started avoiding sun, and wearing the spf lip balm whenever exposed to sun and for the night I’d put on the vit A ointment which would first help a bit, but not much anymore. I stopped using the lip peeling as it was only making things worse. i drink a lot of water, have a balanced diet, take vit D daily.

    "body": "hi everybody--after fun with cleansing oils/balms and milks, i've jumped into the pool of cleansing creams. which also, i'm now realizing, might be able to double as wash-off masks, since they literally wash off.\n\nfor myself, since i'm very dry, a cleanser that removes complexion makeup *and* adds a moisturizing, emollient layer to skin (instead of stripping it) is the holy grail. to that end i've tried a few: \n\n**the natural superstar: skylake massage and cleansing cream**\n/u/TheCuriousAmerican turned me onto the magical skylake massage and cleansing cream. this is pricey but absolutely lovely, especially if you're into natural/plant-derived ingredients, and has kind of a barleyish, very grown-up scent. here's a rough google translate of the ingredients TheCuriousAmerican provided us:\n\n*extract of Oriental herbaceous plants (Chrysanthemum morifolium extract, Peppermint leaf extract, Mulberry leaf extract, Cucurbitaceae extract, Licorice extract, Morus alba extract, Extract), cyclopentasiloxane, caprylic / capric triglyceride, Glyceryl polymethacrylate / propylene glycol, doene oil [not sure what that one is...], safflower oil, cetyl hexyl hexanoate, grape seed oil, glycine oil, glyceryl stearate, cetyl alcohol, butylenelic acid, isopropyl myristate, Olive oil, olive oil, extracts of corn oil, extracts of corn oil, extracts of corn oil, almond oil, allantoin, marjoram, olive oil, polyacrylamide / C13-14 isoparaffin / laureth 7, glycerin, jojoba seed oil, bergamot oil, evening primrose oil, collagen, Extracts, Centella asiatica extracts, Methylglucose-20, Betaine, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Marflur HydroSammic acid / Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Panenol, Human Oligopeptide-1*\n\nthis feels so luxurious and wonderful that the *only* reason i didn't shell out $27 for it is that i happen to be sensitive to plant oils.\n\n**the crowd pleaser: face shop herb day cleansing cream**\nthe face shop has a series of very cheap, fun-scented cleansing creams (aloe, green tea, fruit, \"cereal\"). i have the cereal flavor (a little barley-ish, a little floral); ingredients [here](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_7440166393.html) (nb: fatty alcohols and plant extracts). this is lovely, soft, and cheap, but it doesn't leave behind as much emollience as i personally would like. people who enjoy fun scents and want something that rinses cleaner (oily skin folks?) would probably enjoy this quite a bit.\n\n**the extra-emollient multitasker: skinfood black sugar perfect cleansing cream**\nso far, this one is my favorite--it's similar to the skylake but without the plant oils. to me the scent is like lemon meringue pie (if you don't like lemon, you will not like this), and it leaves behind a glorious emollient, sleeping-pack-like layer on my skin--and the fact that it includes ceramide+cholesterol, amino acids, and glutamic acid means it serves as a pretty solid one-step evening routine, if i want. full ingredients [here](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f20e179189.html)--possible irritants for those who are sensitive to them include triethanolamine, a little bit of sodium cetyl sulfate, and fatty alcohols. \n\n\ni'd love to hear anyone else's (perhaps little-discussed) cleansing cream experiences and recs!\n\nmyself, i'm currently awaiting a decant of the fiddy-reviewed [primera smooth cleansing cream](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2015/10/21/review-primera-smooth-cleansing-cream/) (nb: fatty alcohols and plant extracts).\n \nit does seem like folks with fatty alcohol sensitivities are not going to be able to use these--but maybe there's a fatty alcohol-free version somebody's found?",

Zinc Screen 100% Mineral Lotion**\n\nPart two of my journey into all things Supergoop! and we are here with their Zinc Screen 100% Mineral Lotion.\n\nThis sunscreen contains Zinc Oxide as its uv filter along with Titanium Dioxide and Iron Oxides for tint/additional protection. Other ingredients include Coconut Fruit Extract and Blueberry Fruit Extract (although the amounts seem to be really minimal). \n\nI have been on the HUNT for a mineral sunscreen that truly leaves minimal/no white cast or ashy-ness behind. It seems like every brand throws words like “sheer” or “invisible” pretty freely when trying to market their Zinc/Titanium Oxide sunscreens…but non of them have really delivered for me. Even some that have a mix of mineral and chemical filters still give off an odd cast or collect around my neck and eyelids. \n\nWhile I had some high hopes for this product based on reviews I have seen…the Supergoop! Zinc Screen sadly performed just like so many others (on my skin). It only took a few days of consistent use before I was ready to throw in the towel.\n\nThe creamy and relatively lightweight of this sunscreen feels really nice going on…but it never really seems to dry down or “set” onto my skin. Using a TINY amount…I was able to blend things out pretty well. But, using the proper amount of sunscreen needed for protection left my skin with streaky/off colored sections that didn’t really ever blend. My face felt/looked like an ever changing sand sculpture of various browns/tans LOL! Not a good look.\n\nUsing a pouf or Beauty Blender did help to even things out…but as soon as I got it evened out the Supergoop! Zinc Screen tended to gather and crease around my eyes and neck. Once again not the greatest look/result.\n\nI loved that there is no essential oils in the formula and it did seem to have some hydrating benefit…but outside or that the Supergoop! Zinc Screen was pretty much unwearable for me (at least anywhere outside of the house LOL).\n\nIn the end…I swatched this product on my roommate (who has much fairer skin than me) and it looked MUCH better.

The most important things for me when it comes to sunscreen are:\n\n- no pilling\n\n- no highly comedogenic ingredients (like isopropyl myristate and myristyl myristate for example, those always break me out)\n\n- preferably chemical filters because mineral ones dry my face\n\nThat's about it, I don't mind a slight whitecast and I don't mind greasy finishes. I also don't mind if it has alcohol or fragrance. It's also okay if it's a body sunscreen as long as it works well on the face. \n\nSide note, it would be great if it's available in the balkan region (DM or pharmacies) :)",

I did a search on ScA and I didn't get any hits so I thought maybe it hasn't been talked about before!\n\nIt's called \"Udderly Smooth Udder Cream.\" It's basically a water-based moisturizer (or occlusive? I don't really know the difference...) I never use it but it's actually quite a nice feeling cream. It's kind of feels like a combo between the very thick nivea cream and a thinner cream like cerave (if you can actually called cerave \"thin\"). It seems to absorb into my skin really well. I used it underneath my makeup today and it worked really well! My skin has felt moisturized all day and my makeup hasn't looked too flaky today - not more than usual anyway. \n\nAnd the best part is it's fatty alcohol free! Here's the whole ingredient list (I hope the rest of the ingredients are ok?!):\n\nDeionized water, stearic acid, Peg-2 Stearate, propylene glycol, isopropyl myristate, dimethicone, lanolin oil, mineral oil, triethanolamine, allantoin, methylparaben, propylparaben, fragrance\n\nIt also does come in a fragrance free version!\n\nI've listed the website below if you'd like to check it out. I have seen it in places like Shopper's Drug Mart in Canada. Not sure where else you can find it :)\n\nhttp://www.udderlysmooth.com/dry-skin-udderly-smooth-udder-cream.shtml",

    "body": "[Video](https://youtu.be/bLClR0kYfeU)\n\nSouthern Witchcrafts ([https://southernwitchcrafts.com/](https://southernwitchcrafts.com/)) is an artisan soap and aftershave maker based in Georgia. The brand began in 2017 and is owned by Courtney Brooks and Stephen Joiner. Joiner, is also the owner of the artisan brush company, Dogwood Handcrafts ([https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/](https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/)). Carmilla and Carpathia are winter seasonal releases from SW. Southern Witchcrafts focus is on providing high quality vegan shaving products with scents that are interesting and unique. In addition to ordering direct, Southern Witchcrafts can be purchased at Maggard Razors ([http://www.maggardrazors.com/](http://www.maggardrazors.com/)) ~~and Top of the Chain (~~[~~https://topofthechain.ca/~~](https://topofthechain.ca/)~~).~~\n\nCarmilla is a tribute to the first ever vampire legend. The fragrance notes are; Amber, Frankincense, Sandalwood and Nag Champa. The use of classic scents combine to deliver a very deep and seductive scent. This is a warm and very masculine fragrance, and while it’s not my cup of tea, the beauty and mystique behind the scent notes is not lost on me. This scent is ideally suited for the cold months of winter. Mrs. Ruds does not approve of this fragrance, as I suspected she would not. Strength of scent is strong off the container and remains this way once lathered. Try That Soap ([https://trythatsoap.com/](https://trythatsoap.com/)) recommends Siliski Soaps Masculine Musk as a similar scent profile.\n\nSouthern Witchcrafts uses a soap base of the vegan variety. The bases ingredients are listed as: Water, stearic acid, shea butter, castor oil, potassium hydroxide, glycerine, coconut oil, sodium lactate, sodium hydroxide, jojoba oil, aloe powder, liquid aloe, isopropyl myristate, kaolin clay and fragrance. The soap is soft to mid on the firmness spectrum. The soap base loads easily and lathers with very little effort. It is of normal thirst and whips into a lather that will have the consistency of cool whip. The slickness of this soap is excellent in both the visible slickness area as well as a secondary slickness. Post shave, like slickness is excellent as well. The oils and butters provide a luxurious feeling on the skin post shave. Given my experience with this soap base, it receives a ShaveScore of 92. Soap bases with similar performance are: Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements (CK-6) and Wholly Kaw (vegan).\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Southern Witchcrafts Carmilla (promotional gift)\n* Brush - Lutin Brushworks (loaner)\n* Razor - Razo Rock Lupo SS (purchased)\n* Post - Declaration Grooming Darkfall (loaner)",

    "body": "So last year when I visited Japan, my sister asked me to buy her a Japanese hair treatment product that doesn't have any obvious English writing to suggest it's a hair product because it's written in Japanese.\n\nFast forward to a few weeks ago - my sister starts accusing me of using her hair treatment as each time she would take a shower, the bottle would mysteriously end up next to the bathroom sink. I explained to her that I had never used it before and that it was not me.\n\nNow today, as I prepared to leave for a holiday in South Korea this morning - my mother asked me to buy another bottle of the hair treatment (without realising it was hair treatment). My sister saw and exclaimed \"so it was you using it!\". My mother explained that she had been using it for some time on her face and that it made it really nice - both me and my sister screamed internally and we had to explain to her that it was hair treatment.\n\nSo what I'm wondering at this point is - would be there be any harms in her using the hair treatment as a face wash? The ingredients are written in Japanese but I pulled the listing from Amazon Japan and have transcribed/translated them below:\n\n> water, isopentyl diol, behentrimonium chloride, glycerin, stearyl alcohol, dimethicone, behenyl alcohol, cetanol, DPG, maltitol, aminopropyl dimethicone, steartrimonium chloride, camellia seed oil, lactic acid, lemon extract, rose water , Royal jelly extract, soybean seed extract, isopropanol, isopropyl myristate, PEG-2 laurate, amodimethicone, SODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE , salicylic acid, PPG-2-deces-12, EDTA-2Na, cetrimonium chloride, BG, tocopherol, Sodium benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Flavor, Red 227, Yellow 4    \n\nI punched them into CosDNA and can't see anything particularly of concern but I'm not an expert by any means but I was hoping to get input from people with more knowledge.",

    "body": "Hello all!\n\nHere's my review of Disguise Cosmetic's Sorbet after using it for more than 2 weeks. I have tried to cover it in as great a detail as possible but for any query, do post it in the comments! I'll also be copy-pasting the review in the Moisturiser mega thread.\n\n* **Product Name:** Diguise Cosmetic's C+C Sorbet\n* **Review Type:** Rave, sort of.\n* **Price (range):** Rs 400 for 50 g\n* **Availability in India:** Online, easily available at Disguise, Nykaa, Sublime and many other online platforms\n* **Skin info:** Combination. Oily T zone. Is now normal to dry in winters. (26 yo F)\n* **Climate:** Continental, hence at the moment slightly cold and dry.\n* **Ingredient list:** This is the inci list on their website that can be accessed [here](https://www.disguisecosmetics.com/pages/in-key-c-c-sorbet). I like that they have mentioned the function of each ingredient within brackets.\n\nAqua (Hydration), Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer (Texture and Film-Forming), Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate (Emollient and Structure), Hydrogenated Polydecene (Emollient), Trideceth-10 (Emollient), Isopropyl Myristate (Emollient), Olive Oil Glycereth-8 Esters (Emollient), Dimethicone (Texture), Propanediol (Emollient), Olive Seed Oil (Skin Replenishing), Betain (Skin Soothing), Seaweed Extract (Skin Repair), Green Tea Leaf Extract (Anti-Inflammatory and Antioxidant), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract (Hydration and Soothing), Avocado Fruit Oil (Skin Soothing), Tocopheryl Acetate (Antioxidant), Disodium EDTA (Chelating Agent), Phenoxyethanol (Preservative), Ethylhexylglycerin (Preservative), Fragrance, CI 19140 (water soluble yellow pigment), CI 42090 (water soluble blue pigment)\n\n* **Moisturiser type:** Gel, but slightly on the thicker end.\n* **Special info:** Disguise makes lovely lipsticks. It is a cruelty free brand that is managed by \"three scientists\" as per them. I did check their credentials and they all have some experience in the cosmetics industry. Also an Indian brand that I actually like (yes rare, i know). There customer service is good and they are very helpful. I have dm'd them on instagram many times and they have responded within 24 hrs.\n* **Experience & opinion:** As we have been collectively mourning the unavailability of the Simple light hydrating moisturiser for quite some time, I thought that I should be very judicious with my only bottle of Simple light moisturiser and buy something that I can use alternatively with it. While I like the Simple moisturiser, it was also proving to be inefficient with the arrival of winters. During day time it was sufficient but when I would apply it at night, in the morning my skin would be dry and flaky near my lips and nose. And that's another reason why I wanted to purchase something nourishing but not greasy. In the meantime I also got COSRX's honey sleeping mask, and for some reason, Honey which works for most people, did not work for me. I got small bumps on my otherwise clear skin, so I stopped using it and again was looking for something that would calm my skin and help remedy this.\n\nDisguise's sorbet in that sense became my solution to all of this. I have used their lipsticks which i love and was eyeing the Sorbet. They market it is as [\"ultralight cooling and calming balm\"](https://www.disguisecosmetics.com/products/c-c-sorbet). The inci list is good if not great. You may notice that it is a silicone heavy moisturiser, which I thought would make it occlusive enough. I have been using it for the last two weeks, and it has actually really helped me tackle all the problems I was facing. I use it during my night time routine after my innisfree green tea seed serum. While Simple was not enough for dry winters, Sorbet is. **Like I mentioned, it is a light but an occlusive moisturiser.** It also calmed my skin and my skin has gone back to how it was before I started using COSRX honey sleeping mask. The texture is nice and light and the moisturiser does not feel heavy at all. Well at least to my skin. I have been enjoying using it so much. Perhaps the only downside is that it has fragrance and dye (last ingredients) but that's not an issue for me since the product has been working well for me. The main con for me is that it is too small in size. I am already at the verge of finishing it given that I only use it during night and that too for the past 2 and a half weeks. However, Disguise collects the empties to reuse them/recycle them, which I guess is a good thing though too much of a hassle. If only they can bring a big sized tube to this, it would be wonderful. I also understand that silicone heavy moisturisers can give the impact that they are working when infact it is just silicone. However, since my skin was suffering before using this and this calmed it down (or did nothing so the skin came back to how it was), it worked for me atleast. My skin is not dry when I wake up and neither is it aggravated at the moment.\n\n* **Repurchase Status:** Might be HG is there is a bigger sized tube for it.\n\nI do not know if it can be used as a primer since I dont use makeup.\n\nAlso would love to know other suitable options to Simple Light moisturiser!",

The packaging is sleek and attractive, making it easy to carry in your bag for quick touch-ups. The formula itself is lightweight and doesn't leave a heavy residue, which is a major plus. It effectively absorbs oil and adds volume to limp hair, giving it a refreshed and clean look. However, it may not be as effective on very oily hair, and you might need to reapply throughout the day. The scent is light and pleasant, but it can be a bit strong for those sensitive to fragrances.\n\nPros:\n- Affordable\n- Lightweight formula\n- Adds volume\n- Pleasant scent\n\nCons:\n- May need reapplication\n- Not as effective on very oily hair\n- Scent might be strong for some\n\nWNRP\n\n2. Kristin Ess Style Reviving Dry Shampoo\n\nIngredients:\nIsobutane, Propane, Alcohol Denat., Dimethylimidazolidinone Rice Starch, Fragrance (Parfum), Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Benzoate, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Hydroxycitronellal, Limonene, Linalool.\n\nReview:\nKristin Ess Style Reviving Dry Shampoo excels in absorbing oil and refreshing hair without leaving a white cast, making it suitable for all hair colors. The formula is enriched with ingredients that help to extend the life of your style and add texture without feeling gritty. The scent is a luxurious floral fragrance that lingers subtly throughout the day. It also offers a nice boost of volume, making it perfect for those days when your hair needs a little extra lift. The only downside is that it is on the pricier side compared to other dry shampoos. May not work for very oily hair.\n\nPros:\n- No white residue\n- Extends style life\n- Adds volume and texture\n- Luxurious scent\n\nCons:\n- More expensive \n- Not as effective on very oily hair\n- Scent may be strong for some\n\nWNRP\n\n3. Redken Deep Clean Dry Shampoo\n\nIngredients:\nIsobutane, Alcohol Denat., Propane, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Calcium Carbonate, Polyvinylcaprolactam, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Dimethicone, Dimethiconol, Linalool, Citronellol, Benzyl Salicylate, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Coumarin, Benzyl Alcohol, Parfum/Fragrance.\n\nReview:\nRedken Deep Clean Dry Shampoo is a powerhouse for those who need a heavy-duty product. It’s formulated to tackle even the oiliest of hair, providing a deep clean that extends the time between washes. This dry shampoo leaves hair feeling genuinely clean without the typical dry shampoo residue. It has a neutral scent that is not overpowering, making it suitable for those sensitive to fragrances. While effective, it can sometimes leave hair feeling a bit dry, so it’s best used in moderation or paired with a moisturizing product.\n\nPros:\n- Excellent for very oily hair\n- Provides a deep clean\n- Neutral scent\n- Professional packaging\n\nCons:\n- Can leave hair feeling dry\n- Best used in moderation\n- Very costly for the quantity \n\nWRP",

    "body": "I started my tret journey back in March, on 0.025% Obagi cream. I managed to go up to nightly use in two months and had absolutely zero peeling or purging – just the usual, occasional hormonal spot here and there. My derm then suggested we move up to 0.05%, but the price tag made my eyes water (around ~£120). I then found Menarini online for ~£13; I'd read good things about gel vs cream, and I didn't need a prescription to order it. So, I took the plunge. \n\nI think it's the worst thing I've ever done for my skin. I went in carefully, sandwiching once every three days. Suddenly, I broke out all over my chin, around my mouth and along my jawline. Super painful cystic acne, with spots coming up in clusters of two or three - never just one. My skin didn't *feel* irritated but it clearly was, so I simplified my routine even further and completely stopped using my SA cleanser. \n\nI thought I was just mid purge, so I tried to persevere, but after 3 weeks I just felt constantly sore and depressed so I got back in touch with the derm and explained. He said he's not familiar with Menarini but that there might be something in the formulation that my skin doesn't agree with - but he didn't say what. He advised I take a break completely and contact him again once my skin has calmed down/cleared. I'm now on day 5 with no tret. I haven't had any new acne, and my existing breakouts are calming super quickly. \n\nI'm going to follow his advice and get back in touch when my skin feels ready, but I want to do some homework before I take the hit on paying so much for Obagi. So I'm curious - what could my skin be reacting poorly to in the Menarini? I'm not clued-up on ingredients at all but so many people in this sub are incredibly knowledgeable, so I thought it was worth a shot. I found the ingredients lists for both, and have copied and pasted them below:\n\nMenarini 0.05% gel\n\nActive Ingredients tretinoin gel USP – 0.05% Excipients: PEG-4 olivat, PEG-7 olive oil ethers, methyl hydroxybenzoate, propyl hydroxybenzoate, propylene glycol, silicone oil, caprylic / capric triglyceride, carbomer, triethanolamine, purified water.\n\n---\n\nObagi 0.025%\n\nEach gram contains: Tretinoin 0.025%, stearic acid, isopropyl myristate, polyoxyl 40 stearate, stearyl alcohol, xanthan gum, sorbic acid, butylated hydroxytoluene, and purified water.",

    "body": "I saw someone ask about reviews for products that don’t work for us, lying around in our drawers. This cleanser is one of those cult favorites that just didn’t work for me, so I wanted to give it a review. \n\n—\n\nLast month, I spent a week in New York City. While there, I visited the beautiful showroom for Glossier.\n\nEvery product is laid out neatly for visitors to test, organized roughly by function. Moisturizers, primers, serums, and balms at one; powder, foundation, and concealer at another; and lip, cheek, and eye products at another.\n\nAt the back of the showroom, there is a washbasin, surrounded by their skincare products. One such product is the infamous Milky Jelly Cleanser.\n\nOf course, by the time I got a chance to test out the cleanser, I had quite a collection of swatches on my hand.\n\n**First Impressions**\n\nFirst, the ingredients:\n\n>Water/Aqua/Eau, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Propanediol, Isohexadecane, Poloxamer 184, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Xylitylglucoside, Betaine, Allantoin, Glycerin, Panthenol, Symphytum Officinale Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Anhydroxylitol, Polysorbate 80, Xylitol, Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Isopropyl Myristate, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hydroxide.\n\nRight off the bat, you'll notice that there is no fragrance added. It does smell faintly of roses due to the inclusion of the rose water (Rosa Damascena Flower Water), so be aware of that if you are very sensitive to fragrance or just really dislike the scent of roses.\n\nThe cleansing aspect of it is performed by the addition of a polymer (Poloxamer 184), which helps water to mix with oils and other products on the skin, letting them be rinsed away.\n\nThe product feels... well... very jelly-like. It's a really unique-feeling cleanser in that way. I can't think of any other cleanser that has its texture. It is more viscous than typical cleansers, which are more runny, but spreads easily and feels very \"clean.\" In that way, it's more like a silicone makeup primer, but without the powderiness that usually accompanies primers due to the addition of silica (for oil-absorption).\n\nI used it for about a week in place of my normal makeup remover, and I must say -- it lives up to the claim of being a pretty effective remover. It spread easily and worked just like all of the videos that Glossier has posted on their social media, removing my concealer, eye makeup, lipstick, and most of my mascara with ease. I did not try it with more waterproof formulas, like MAC Face & Body or a waterproof mascara.\n\nAfter use, it left my skin smooth, soft, and clean-feeling. It did not feel stripped, even after multiple days of usage. It also did not bother my rosacea or make me pinker than usual.\n\n**Consensus**\n\nThe Milky Jelly Cleanser has been a bit of a cult favorite for awhile now, and with good reason. It removes makeup pretty well (though I'd still use a makeup remover for any makeup beyond the light, concealer/mascara/lipstick days), cleanses great, and doesn't leave skin stripped. Bonus: it lacks fragrance and typical surfactants that can leave skin stripped and tight.\n\nUnfortunately, it broke my skin out after a couple of days usage, but I am also incredibly acne-prone. After just a couple days, my skin had closed comedones all over. Paula's Choice 2% BHA cleared this up within just 2-3 days of nightly usage.\n\nThis doesn't make me less likely to recommend it however, as it is a great, no frills cleanser and I imagine that a bottle would last about 2-3 months of daily usage.\n\nYou can purchase Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser [on their website for $18 USD + tax and shipping](https://www.glossier.com/products/milky-jelly-cleanser).\n\n---\n\n*Note on Glossier's returns: Glossier's customer service is amazing. After I contacted them to let them know that I purchased this product in store, but was back home in LA without a way to return it, they responded with a friendly note to let me know that they had passed my feedback along and issued me a full refund, no returning of the product needed.*\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "I had a loose pigment which was pain in the ass to use. It is matte. I found a tutorial online on how to press eyeshadows. It said to mix eyeshadows powder with a few drops of rubbing alcohol in a pan, cover with a napkin, put a coin on top (I used a coin battery, it fits perfectly into 20mm pan), press and wait 10 min until alcohol evaporates. \n\nI did so. Well, it is pressed now. But its totally unusable. It feels extremely dry and rough, and I almost can't get pigment even on my finger. \n\nMaybe I have overpressed it? It wasn't said about how hard exactly should I press, so I used all my weight to press it really hard for a few minutes. \n\nShould I have added something besides rubbing alcohol? It was said not to use isopropyl myristate on matte formulas cause it can ruin them.",

    "body": "So I have this dilemma.    \n\nI have used cleansing oils for probably 10 years now. Currently I use and like Kose Softymo Deep cleansing oil, it works well and the price is great. But I have to admit, I have NEVER enjoyed using cleansing oils in my life. To me they are almost a necessary evil - so effective, but I just HATE how runny and drippy they are. Sure, I have learned through practice & experience how not to drip everywhere, but nonetheless it's not an experience I enjoy. If Johnson & Johnson can make a cheap baby oil gel, can't we get some gel oil cleansers up in here???      \n\nI also don't like balms and sherbets b/c I can't deal with the spatulas and the jars. I like to pump and apply to my face, quickly. And the ethical concerns w/ polyethylene and all make me a little reluctant as well       \n\nWhat I do like: lotion and cream cleansers. They don't run. I enjoy massaging them around my face. They come in handy pumps or tubes, instead of jars. But...they are often much worse at cleansing compared to balms and oils. I have a couple I like as AM or 2nd cleansers, but I've yet to find any good enough to be 1st cleansers. AND...often they contain high-risk/comedogenic ingredients (MANY oils + milks have ethylhexyl palmitate and isopropyl myristate high on the ingreds lists)    \n\nDo there exist any (affordably priced) unicorns out there???    \n- gel or cream texture so as not to run, as liquid-y oils do       \n- packaged in a tube or pump, not in a jar    \n- enough oil/cleansing power to melt off stubborn ss & face makeup        \n- rinses relatively clean w/ water             \n- ingreds that aren't terrifying to an acne-prone        \n\nIn all likelihood I bet this unicorn doesn't exist, but I figured if anyone knew, it would be here on AB! fingers crossed    \n\n(And yep I saw snow's review on the cremorlab cleansing gel but it's $$ and not easily accessible. I saw the acid queen's review on some cleansing oil gel but she listed it as a 2nd cleanser. I know Boscia makes one but that's also too $$ for me to use daily. Not looking for a pool cleanser type of product either)",

I too haven't. But a few years back , my mother bought this oil for my sister and it did wonders for her. Then i also thought of giving it a try cause I was facing hairfall. I used it for about a month and my hair fall  stopped as I use it as a carrier oil with rosemary essential oil. I feel my hair getting more strength after using it and my hair are no more dry.\n\nI use this oil before shampoo and leave it overnight. It's so light weight that it easily gets absorbed in the scalp. It has a pale yellow colour. It feels like serum to me. It has nice nutty fragrance. After hair wash , I take few drops of it and use it as a leave in conditioner. My hair stays hydrated until next wash. I'm loving this oil so much so I thought of sharing it . My hair feels so smooth and frizz free. There's no more problems with detangling and the most wonderful thing is that I don't have any split ends and frizziness. It has made my ends of the hair smooth and healthier than ever before and I don't find the need to trim them. \n\nI haven't heard of this brand though. So I can't tell how this particular brand is but I found this oil better and affordable than any other I've used so far. It's the brand modicare I guess.\n\nThe thing which surprises me is that it has the exact same ingredient list as of morrocanoil hair treatment oil.\n\nIngredient list of modicare salon professional argan oil of morroco: Dimethicone, argan oil, cyclopentasiloxane, isopropyl myristate, perfume, linseed oil, propyl paraben, B.H.T, colour CI 47000, colour CI 26100\n\nIngredient list of morrocanoil hair treatment oil: Cyclomethicone, dimethicone, argan oil, parfum/fragrance, linseed extract, ci 26100, ci 47000.\n\nThat's all I guess.",

It's one of my favorite summer perfumes, just dry, not very sweet, slightly dirty coconut. Not seasonal for the northern hemisphere, but it's on my mind.\n\nIt doesn't look like you can buy it anymore and I'm more interested in trying new things than hunting down secondhand bottles as backups. Does anyone know of something similarly coconut dominant that isn't tropical/sweet?\n\nThe notes are: \"the richest amber resin, black coconut, coconut husks, and smoky vetiver\" (I think the vetiver is a big part of why I like it)\n\nI've tried and I own Fantome's Paimon, which also has a coconut husk note, but that smells like a somewhat medicinal, incensy vanilla to me and I don't get coconut from it.\n\nThanks!",

I don’t think I would have ordered it myself and that would have been a tragedy. I finished my sample and ordered the 10ml EDP and 1ml parfum.  It's part of Hurwitz' Haiku Series that also features Gekkou Hanami and Wasabi Shiso.\n\nTsukiyo-en EDP is subtle, exquisite, delicate, quite beautiful, and sits close to the skin. Its opening is wet/dewy minty green flowers, just unfurling or blossoming. We’re not talking bold freesia or tuberose or Jasmine. We’re talking tuliplike subtlety and a bit lilting, not quite citrus. Maybe an herb (I’m not good with the notes). It’s like a moonlit greenhouse. What may have been bolder in the sunlight becomes softer and diffused at night.\n\nDSH Tsukiyo-en is so subtle, nuanced and quiet, it massages my senses and draws me in. It gives my brain a chance to observe and not just smell it, but *see* it. No one but me, the wearer, and someone really close to me physically will appreciate it. It is introspective and it is very personal. And if I wanted to smell it beyond 5 hours I'd have to reapply it. I'm okay with that\n\nI just know I need more time with it to compare the extrait and EDP. Right now, with repeat wear of the EDP, I am getting a bit more mint than I would prefer. It's not huge, it just stands out more than the others by maybe a few millimeters. The extrait does not have mint standing out. It's warmer and even closer to the skin. If I still like the EDP after finishing the 10 ml, I'm ordering a bottle.  And if I like the extrait more, I'll order a small bottle of that. I've found it worthwhile to sample both versions of DSH perfumes. I did the same with Eau de Trianon, and much preferred the EDP.\n\nIt's unfortunate that my 10 mil EDP and the small extrait sample came in roller balls. I think they are the devil. So I got my needle nose pliers out and yanked off the rollerball and decanted the EDP and to a spray atomizer. Same with the extrait but I keep it in the same bottle.\n\nMs. Hurwitz excels at coloring a scene into her perfumes with subtle shading, so sometimes you get an entire vignette in a bottle This, Eau de Trianon, and Le Jardin Vert are like Plein Air paintings.\n\nDepending where you look, notes are all over the place. This is why I place more weight on accords:\n\n*DSH site notes:* green bamboo leaves, white tea, bathing herbs, and mikan fruit (citrus).\n\n*Parfumo.net:* Top Notes: Mugwort, Bamboo leaf, Champaca leaf CO2, Mint, Satsuma, Shiso leaf:\nHeart Notes: Bulgarian rose otto, Champaca absolute, Marjoram, Jasmine sambac, Tunisian neroli, White tea:\nBase Notes: Indian patchouli, Hinoki cypress, Sandalwood, Violet leaf absolute (I smell no patchouli or sandalwood)\n\nSamples are available at the [perfume website](https://www.dshperfumes.com/shop/tsukiyo-en-moonlight-garden/). Hurwitz makes almost all her perfumes available in alcohol or Isopropyl myristate (legal to be shipped overseas), as well as extrait. Tsukiyo-en is also available as a body wash, body lotion, and massage oil. Layer it at will. Its delicate perfection never overpowers.",

    "body": "Recently got Concious Chemist from Foxy sale as CC products were around 50% off. The order was fulfilled by CC and arrived in ~10 days. Got a vitamin C serum free with my order. The detailed reviews are as follows:\n\n\n1) Hydro+ hyaluronic acid gel cream\n\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Aloe barbadensis Leaf Juice,Glycerin, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, C12-C15 Alkyl benzoate, Trehalose, Winter cherry extract, Allantoin, Ginkgo Biloba Leaf Extract, Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Phytosphingosine, Phenoxyethanol, Cholesterol, Marula oil, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Benzyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Laurate, Pea Protein Extract, Sodium Gluconate, Blue Tansy.\n\n\nMRP: 599 for 50 mL. Sale price: 299\n\n\nMy experience: I had some high expectations from this as I really need a dupe for Hydroboost. Also, it has different types of HAs and ceramides which I was looking for in a product for oily skin.\n\n\nBut, it is not a dupe of Hydroboost water gel. The texture is different. Almost similar to Soon Jung emulsion but a little thicker. Not that hydrating or moisturizing. After 5-10 min of application the product is non-existent as it feels like nothing is applied on the skin. Even after misting my face and using almost 3-4 pumps of this gel creme, I could feel nothing on my skin. It just vanished and made my skin feel drier. So I put it again twice so that I could get some hydration/moisturization. But alas, it pilled and how. It was plausible considering the amount of product I put on my skin but even with that much amount it couldn't do anything. I even tried this on my arms to see if maybe using actives on my face is hampering the moisturization and making my skin drier (although hydroboost works perfectly fine). But it also pilled on my arms after the first application and made my skin drier if it's even possible. WNRP ever.\n\n\nI don't even know what to do with this bottle cause I feel ultra embarrassed to even resell this moisturizer.  \n\n\n\n2) Clear Shield Invisible Daily sunscreen\n\n\nSPF rating: 30, PA ++, water and sweat resistant\n\n\nIngredients: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethicone, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (and) Octocrylene (and) Ethylhexyl Salicylate (and) Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane (and) Benzophenone-3, Vitamin E,C12-C15 Alkyl benzoate, PEG-8 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides (and) Water (and) Octyldodeceth-25 (and) Sodium Hyaluronate, Purslane extract\n\n\nMRP: 575 for 50 mL. Sale price: 288\n\n\nMy experience: I'm not particularly fond of dimethicone-based sunscreens as they can feel heavy and can be comedogenic for my skin type. This one however doesn't feel too heavy or greasy. Feels exactly like a light makeup primer and can be used as one. Otherwise, I don't think I would use this daily. SPF rating is only 30 with PA++ and also contains benzophenone-3/oxybenzone. There are much better and safer sunscreens out there so I might just use it indoors or on my arms to finish this bottle. WNRP. \n\n\n3) Vivid C pro-collagen serum\n\n\nIngredients: Aqua, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid Aloe Vera Leaf Ext.^, Glycerine, Carrot Seed Oil Natural Betaine*, Pomegranate Oil Cetearyl Olivate (and) Sorbitan Olivate, Vitamin E Isopropyl Myristate, Benzyl Alcohol (and) , Ethylhexylglycerin (and) , Tocopherol , Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7 (and) Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hydroxide, Ferulic Acid, Glutathione, Sodium Gluconate\n\n\nMRP: 599 for 50 mL. Sale price: 15 mL mini version free\n\n\nMy experience: Off whitish serum which blends really well and sinks into the skin. But oh lord, the foul smell of ferulic acid 💀\n\nI've been staying away from LAA cause some active acne. But 3-O-EAA should be safer. I've used this in the AM mostly along with sunscreen and I could see a bit of brightening stuff. But TBH, I also use The Deconstruct's Clearing serum so I can't attribute the brightening effect to a single product really. However, I don't really have a negative thing to say about this product except for the foul smell. Would have to see its effects in long term use. W(maybe)RP.",

I wasn't able to find more than 1 review in the search, but please feel free to direct me to any I may have missed.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone else has had my experince with this scent specifically - it smells like absolutely nothing. Like not even a hint of anything. I've never been fully asnomic to any scent before, so it seems odd to me that I would only be asnomic to one particular scent blend - has anyone else had this experience, of only being asnomic to one particular fragrance?\n\nAlso, I did reach out to Fyrinnae to inquire about this, just to see if maybe my sample didn't have any fragrance oil in it - they said that \"It is somewhat soft but seemingly various people are unable to smell certain fragrances. A bottle could not be just filled with just isopropyl myristate, but can you ensure product is coming out of the ball applicator?\". I ensured them that I had used quite a lot of the product & it was definitely coming out, but again that I didn't smell anything, but I got no response after that. Just wondering if anyone else had a similar experience!\n\nETA: My sample has been rested for 3.5 months at this point. \n\nHere are the scent notes: *marshmallow, sweet benzoin resin, white sandalwood, sugar, and a hint of myrrh*\n\nEdit 2: Fyrinnae's chemist reached out via email late last night to offer a replacement, in case there was a batch issue. They also explained in more detail why it couldn't have been the case that the fragrance wasn't included, so I'm a bit confused.\n\nEdit 3: Just one more edit in case anyone reads this: I did accept Fyrinnae's offer to be sent a replacement of this sample, and now I haven't heard back from them in a few days. I hope they do get back to me & not ghost me on their offer.",

I'm always on the look out for fragrance-free milk and cream cleansers, and I don't like to spend a lot on them really, I'd rather drop the ££ elsewhere in my routine. This one contains meadowfoam oil, jojoba oil and shea butter, which is nice because I always like a few oils in a second/AM cleanser to replace what's lost when you wash your face. It also contains a couple polymers, which apparently stop surfactants from penetrating too deeply and over cleansing your skin. The high oil content here might even mean that this cleanser can break down makeup and water resistant sunscreens, but I haven't tried it to find out yet!\n\nThe surfactants used don't look particularly interesting and seem few and far between, so perhaps this is a better option for those who use a washcloth or who like cleansers that leave a light emollient film, but I thought I'd share this on here since I've never really seen a cleanser this budget (£2 for 200ml!) with such a good INCI. Presumably it's pretty accessible too since it's Sainsbury's own brand, if it's sold in most stores then it'd be pretty easy just to pick up with your shop. It looks like a great budget option for anyone with dry or sensitive skin - isopropyl myristate can be an acne trigger for some so be mindful of that, but it’s in a good few of my favourite cleansers and despite being super acne prone it never breaks me out.\n\nThey also do a [foaming facial wash](https://incidecoder.com/products/source-of-nature-facial-wash) that looks pretty great too - I don't usually bother with foaming cleansers but the ingredients here look pretty promising and it's £2 for 150ml. Come to think of it, it actually looks more interesting than the milk - lots of glycerin, two really great gentle surfactants, soybean oil, but sadly no polymers unlike the milk. They do a toner and a couple night creams (toner doesn't look up to much but the creams look nice), and an eye makeup remover that might be worth looking into too. So pleased to see a budget skincare line formulated with care, and it's so cool that they made them fragrance-free so anybody can try them!\n\n**Source of Nature Cleansing Milk White Tea & Shea Butter:**\n\n*Aqua, Glycerin, Isopropyl Myristate, Propanediol, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenoxyethanol, Sorbitan Olivate, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Squalane, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycine Soja Oil, Disodium EDTA, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Polysorbate 60, Tocopherol, Citric Acid*\n\n**Source of Nature Facial Wash:**\n\n*Aqua, Glycerin, Coco-Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Citric Acid, Glycine Soja Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Tocopherol, Chloroacetic Acid*\n\nYou can find the rest of the product's on [Sainsbury's website](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/SearchDisplayView?catalogId=10241&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=44&amp;krypto=%2FDRH%2BBsB4VVnkVm97G%2F8Mu8Bsx8j7NduAzxTe1ccgua5bGLF7lGU%2BINmM35%2B2Ncnumxpqa4cpZzK5G09peKvec46DINkM8jgRfYq%2FEK425jsHdBj5D%2FUSC1VzkdVHP3hM1%2BNZeRNnNz1owO8jHWT9E4cAhUumZ09bC0tuezO4nygeWTndXU%2FwOhCaWRr7qtwdGBbzetv5jrKnyz0vTzNkg%3D%3D), the full INCIs are there.",

While I don’t necessarily agree with the fear mongering of the cream vehicle, I am at my wits end and alas had to try some gel for these comedones. \n\nFirst things first, it was hard to apply the gel the first application. It’s consistency is that of slime, booger, jello etc. I originally buffered with vanicream daily moisturizer beforehand and this caused pilling (contrasting ingredients) so the next applications I opted for a gel moisturizer and albeit that was the trick. It applied seamlessly, light weight and it basically felt as if it evaporated off my skin. It’s so light I was worried it wouldn’t work. It did… my purging pimples have been less large and more dry. What once was pressure filled boils are now crusted whiteheads. This is after day one. I had about 3 new zits join me on my face. \nI am now getting a glimpse of hope, praying it will dry these suckers rather than encourage them to become raging inflamed white heads. \n\nI will keep you all updated ",

However, I couldn’t find an ingredients list anywhere and the only reviews of the product I could find were a few obviously planted ones and some fluffy magazine reviews.  The words “natural” and “chemical-free” (LOL) got thrown around a lot in reference to the ingredients, but not much else.  I’ve been interested in trying COOLA sunscreens before since they seem well-reviewed, but they’re really out of my ideal price range.  These Target versions seemed slightly more reasonable at $15 a pop (about half the price of regular COOLA brand sunscreens).  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nCuriosity got the better of me.  I bought the tinted face SPF 30 and Sport SPF 50.  I’m still in the patch testing phase with the tinted face 30, and the sensitivity testing phase with the SPF 50, but I thought I’d share the ingredients lists and some initial impressions in case anyone else is curious.

Its following is slight, far behind that of Mitchell's Wool Fat. Aside from that slight following, this soap is unanimously detested for being one of the worst soaps on the market. So let's take a look!\n\n\nIngredients:\nSodium Palmate, Potassium Palmate, Sodium Palm Rernelate, Aqua, Glycerin, Potassium Palm Kernelate, Paraffium Liquidum, Isopropyl Myristate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Sodium Chloride, BHT, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Pentasodium Pentetate.\n\nI am not 100% sure that this is the actual ingredient list as it is hard to come by and unlisted on the T&H website to my knowledge. I had to find this on Amazon, but if anyone in the comments knows this to be incorrect then by all means please inform me.  \n\nThat being said this is far from what I look for in an ingredient list. I see no Stearic Acid which is a big red flag, and on top of that, there is only one oil in the whole soap. I'm not thrilled that the only oil in the soap is Palm oil, a highly controversial soaping ingredient, but at least it's something other than preservatives, which fill the rest of the list.\n\nIngredients - 1/10\n\nPackaging:\nOh damn, it's nice guys. I have it in the hand turned wooden bowl and I don't have much to say on it other than it exudes luxury. The sticker is waterproof, elegant, and classy beyond belief. The bowl has intuitive ridges on the side that help with grip, and the puck fits nicely into the bowl. My only issue with this packaging is how the lid of the bowl is only loosely placed onto the bowl, with no way to secure it. However, that is the price you pay for wooden bowls.\n\nPackaging - 9.5/10\n\nScent:\nT&H list the 1805 scent as: \"Fresh and oceanic, 1805 has top notes of bergamot, mandarin and cardamom, combined with a lavender, geranium and clary sage heart resting on a sandalwood, cedarwood and musk base.\"\n\nI get just about none of that aside from the oceanic bit, and even then I think it would be a bit of a stretch to call this an aquatic. I have far from a sophisticated nose, but I'm adequate at picking out certain notes here and there. That being said, to me 1805 smells sweet and perfume-like, and that's the extent of what I smell here. It's not a bad smell by any means, just relatively simplistic.\n\nHowever, I do smell something strange here as well. Something that to me smells like a backing of fat, like lard. There is no tallow or any type of animal product in the soap, so I'm not sure where this is coming from. That being said, no one else I have asked smelled such an undertone.\n\nScent - 6/10\n\nLather:\nNow this is where I was really nervous. So far, I was more or less a fan of the soap, but this could change everything. I let a Stirling Kong soak while I took a shower and left the soap to bloom. When I got out, I was ready for whatever may come, be it suds or yogurt, I was ready.\n\nIt was suds, I'm not quite sure what I was expecting, but it pretty much matched up with what everyone is saying about it. I loaded for about a minute and got nothing but suds, even with a fully wrung out brush. I persisted in an attempt to salvage any chance I had, and then it happened, slowly but surely, a paste began to form between the bristles.\n\nI persisted, building the paste more and more, until I was ready to transfer it to my face. When the time came, I brought the brush to my face, and immediately I was met with the discouraging sound of large air bubbles popping. As I built the lather on my face, I noticed that it has a foamy yet hydrated sheen over it, and was a bit denser than bath soap.\n\nObviously there was no cushion here, but being a relatively aggressive shaver, with tough skin, and soft facial hair I have very little need for tons of cushion. It's still nice to feel protected, however. The soap really surprised me with its slickness, this stuff was incredibly slick. My razor would just glide down my face, with endless amount of ghost lather available. This could be due to the fact that the lather was basically suds, but I have to give credit where credit is due, the soap is very slick.\n\nAfter the surprisingly close shave, my face didn't feel at all moisturized, but it didn't feel dried out either. A post shave balm is not necessary but is recommended.\n\nLather - 4/10\n\nPrice:\n$48, nope. Just nope. You'll get a nice bowl for mediocre soap that smells fairly nice. I'm not even going to do the math for how much that is per ounce, because it's not worth it regardless.\n\nPrice - 0/10\n\nOverall:\nTruefitt and Hill 1805 Luxury Shaving Soap is a misfire. It's ingredients are not inherently conducive to shaving soap, it's scent is pleasant but one note, it's lather is downright bad, and it's completely overpriced. You would be wise to avoid it, however, I would be lying if I said it didn't surprise me.\n\nTo be quite honest, I felt fondly for this soap originally, as its presentation is beautiful, and it's very slick. I hardly use it, however I'm glad I have it as a decoration or a once in a while use. This doesn't change the fact that it's not nearly on par with any of the artisans, even artisans I don't particularly care for offer better products than this soap.\n\nOverall: 20.5/50 which equates to an F, which makes sense to me. It's not quite worth purchasing, but if you own a puck by some circumstance it's at least worth a try, the slickness might surprise you!\n\nThank you all for reading! Keep shaving!",

    "body": "Hey gang!\n\nI know we’ve been chatting recently about reviewing products that don’t get a lot of love on this sub, so I wanted to talk about the **Klairs Gentle Black Deep Cleansing Oil** which has become one of my go-to products.\n\nWishtrend lists the ingredients on their website but I’ll repeat them here: *Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate , Isopropyl Myristate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil , Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant) Seed Oil , Tocopheryl Acetate , PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate , Polysorbate 20, Fragrance, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter) , Carapa Guaianensis Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil*\n\nMy first experience with cleansing oil was the Face Shop Rice Water Cleansing Oil, but TFS was not friendly to my face as it gave me closed comedones after only a few days of use. I’m also really sensitive to fragrances as they trigger headaches for me, and sadly the heavy scent of the TFS did just that. In comparison, the Klairs cleansing oil doesn’t break me out like a fiend, and the scent is extremely light, almost woody and earthy but not unpleasantly so. The viscosity of the oil is slightly thicker than TFS and spreads very nicely on the face without dripping all over my bathroom counter.\n\nI’ve been using this for the past three weeks to take off my makeup (bb cream, concealer, blush) and it’s been very effective with that. I can’t comment on how it works with eye makeup since I use a separate remover for that, but there have been moments when the Klairs has dripped into my eyes and it doesn’t sting at all. The oil emulsifies really well with water, and afterwards my face feels super soft. I still follow up with my regular cleanser, but it’s possible that this may be successful as an oil cleanser by itself.\n\nAs for whether this oil gets any grits out, it’s hard to say. TFS wasn’t successful in that area, but I’ve been experimenting with the Klairs and leaving it on my face for five minutes before massaging, and that seems to work okay. Today I used a 15% AHA peel on my face before massaging my face with the Klairs, and I actually saw a few grits, woohoo!\n\nWishtrend carries this for $23 USD on their website, and at the time I picked it up with free shipping since I was also buying the OST Vit C on sale at the time. It’s a bit pricey in comparison to other cleansing oils, but the minimal fragrance really carries a lot of weight for me, so it’s very likely that I’ll be picking this up again once my bottle runs out.\n\nHope this has been helpful! Let me know if you’ve given this a try, I’d love to hear what you think :)",

    "body": "Hi folks, as we Northern hemisphereans gear up for summer, I thought I'd share a review for [Sun Bum's Tinted Mineral Face SPF 30](https://www.sunbum.com/collections/sunscreen-plp/products/mineral-spf-30-tinted-sunscreen-face-lotion-1-7oz). \n\nBottom line up front: Unfortunately this was not moisturizing enough and slightly too darkly tinted for my very dry, pale skin, but I think normal types (maybe oily too?) with tan or darker skin tones might really like it. [Photos here.](https://imgur.com/a/PyJphUk)\n\nWhat we're working with: I have very dry, somewhat sensitive, acne-prone skin, which is a real bitch when it comes to sunscreen. *All my dry + acne-prone people where you at?!* I'll explain: Being acne-prone and sensitive points to mineral SPFs being best for me (and they are - every chemical or mineral/chemical I've tried has broken me out, but I'm still trying). Unfortunately, my skin is also very dry (not oily, which is what acne-prone skin is normally associated with). This is unfortunate because mineral SPFs often take advantage of the great mattifying effect of dat zinc, and concentrate on this rather than being hydrating/moisturizing which is what I need (USUALLY - please give me recs if you have a super hydrating mineral SPF dear god). So you see my conundrum. With this face, I was hoping the shea butter and evening primrose oil in this SunBum would give me some of that dry-skin food, but it did not. \n\n* **Product name** \\- [Sun Bum Mineral SPF Tinted 30 Sunscreen Face Lotion](https://www.sunbum.com/collections/sunscreen-plp/products/mineral-spf-30-tinted-sunscreen-face-lotion-1-7oz)\n   * Ingredients: Titanium Dioxide 5.3%, Zinc Oxide 2.4%, Cyclopentasiloxane, Isopropyl Myristate, Polyamide-5, Stearalkonium Hectorite, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Polysilicone-11, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Seed Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Plankton Extract, Glycerin, Mica, Iron Oxides, Propylene Carbonate, Synthetic Wax, Hydrogen Dimethicone, Isopropyl Titianium Triisostearate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Silica Silylate\n* **How long I used it** \\- Once - was an immediate no for me, but maybe not for you!\n* **Packaging** \\- Easy-to-dispense tube, but I have to say the actual spout of the tube is rather oddly shaped and traps a lot of product in it in an annoying way. I included photos of this in the link above (last two photos).\n* **Product feel and smell** \\- No discernible smell at all which is very nice. The feel is where it gets interesting - as many here know, Sun Bum products are extremely silicone-y. I don't have a lot of experience with this so for me it was very weird. The application was like a velvet slip n' slide. That seems nice until you start wondering - is this even staying on my skin or am I just pushing it around? Ultimately it does stay, but it's a weird feeling if you're not used to it. I know some people love the silicony-ness and I think it's supposed to be a good primer for makeup, right? (I don't use makeup, so I want my SPF to be standalone and great application since it's my last step.)\n* **Pros and Cons**\n   * Pros: No smell / Application is nice when you get used to it // tint is not horrible (that's a pro and all you tinted mineral users know what I'm talking about)\n   * Cons: Exposed my flaky face for all its flakiness - deal breaker // annoying dispensing spout that catches product // tint was just a bit off, and no room for error since this is my last step of routine\n* **Overall** \\- Not for this dry gal, but again it may be good for more balanced types. \n\n((Disclaimer: I use the term \"acne-prone\" to say I am prone to break outs. As you can see in those photos, my skin is generally clear these days, especially compared to my accutane days (7 years ago). But I started breaking out again in the past 2 years in a few small papules and pustules - especially on right cheek and around mouth/chin. It is very mild, I know. And I know how much it pissed me off when I had serious, 70% of my face, stubborn inflammatory pus-filled ACNE, and people with beautiful skin and one teeny red bump be like \"omg I have acne!\" --bitch please. I know, I get it. We're all on our respective journeys.))",
