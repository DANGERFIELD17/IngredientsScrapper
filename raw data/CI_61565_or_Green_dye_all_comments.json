    "body": "*I am not OP.  This is a repost.*\n\n[**Original from Oct 23, 2017 - Public North Carolina High School. Says my son's hairstyle and color violates school's social norms.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/789wcm/public_north_carolina_high_school_says_my_sons/)\n\nI was called to school today and was told that my son has been given a warning that his new hairstyle is against school's social norms. I asked for a copy of a document that describes the school's social norms which they did not provide, they instead said it's a matter of judgement by the school staff.\n\nMy son has long hair and has recently dyed it electric blue. He likes it this way. They told me that he has a week to change his hairstyle to an appropriate and acceptable hairstyle or he will be suspended until his hairstyle becomes acceptable. I told them that to me it seems like this is a matter of freedom of expression and the school needs to abide by the first amendment, they told me that there is no first amendment in schools and the freedom of expression of students is only as far as the school staff allow.\n\nI'm not going to tell my son that he can't wear his favorite hairstyle and color only to appease the school administrators, unless they have a legal right in restricting his access to the school and education for his hairstyle.\n\nWhat is the most reasonable course of action for us? First, is this a first amendment issue? And second, who do I talk to next?\n\n[**Update from Nov 17, 2017.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7dnbcs/public_north_carolina_high_school_says_my_sons/)\n\nI want to you all for the help and advice that you gave us. I realized that this, while stupid, is probably within the rights of the school. But that didn't mean there was nothing we could do. A lot of you brought up the idea of a using a wig. Sadly, wigs also weren't allowed except for \"legitimate religious, cultural or medical reasons with prior approval.\"\n\nHowever, what did surprise me was that there were two girls who were on a green dye for months without a problem. This definitely sounded like gender discrimination. Allowing that dye for girls and not boys. So I went in there to speak with the principal again, I told him that I'm recording the conversation and after speaking about wigs, told him that they're allowing girls to do that but not boys. Principal said this is a matter of judgement because unnatural hair colors doesn't diminish the feminine attributes of women, but unnatural hair colors for men does diminish their masculine attributes. I got it then, that nonsense is all this has been about. They think a long and blue hair on a boy isn't manly enough.\n\nI reminded him that this is gender discrimination and gender is a protected class. He remained silent for more than a minute, I expected him to say it's fine and they'll backtrack but I was shocked when he told me that I'm right, they'll reinforce this requirement for girls too. \"It's best to get rid of these unnatural colors from our school.\"\n\nI hate what I did. The last thing I wanted was to cause trouble for those girls or start a chain of actions that could have ended up with them being forced to change their favorite hairstyles. They were contacted too, and were given the same choice.\n\nTwo days later my son came to me and said he's spoken with the girls and they have a solution. They want to dye their hair a very white silverish color. It's naturally occurring because you get it when you get old, and some people are born with it as well. I know the more mature thing would have been to tell him to end this game, but I was a teenager once as well and I was even more stubbern than he is now. So I allowed it.\n\nThe school didn't like it. The three of them were called to the principal's office where they argued their case that their hair color is naturally occurring now. They said it's the same color as one of the teachers who is quite old, \"are you gonna suspend Mr. X as well over his hair color?\"\n\nThe principal laughed at them and backed off. It's been a couple of weeks since then and there hasn't been any issues. And this new color looks good on my son.",

For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. \r\n\r\n**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. \r\n\r\n**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. \r\n\r\n**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.\r\n\r\nThank you for visiting our sub.

And because K is basically my fourth child I do the same for her, at least while she’s at my house.\n\nSo a few days ago the girls come home and they asked me if K could dye her hair pink in the bathroom. I asked to see her grades and she showed me. She was doing well and I said sure, I didn’t care.\n\nI honestly just assumed she had already asked her actual parents and just wanted to see if it was ok to use the bathroom since M got green dye every where when she did it. I told them to just clean it up after and they said ok.\n\nSo fast forward to today when I get a very angry phone call from Ks mother. She demanded to know why I told K she could dye her hair pink. I told her I said it was alright she used my bathroom to dye her hair pink. She went off on me about my parenting choices. She criticized my decision to let MY daughter get piercings, a tattoo, or dye her hair and told me she wasn’t gonna let my bad parenting influence her child anymore. \n\nI kinda just laughed and reminded her I was basically the one parenting K for the last year. I reminded her I fed her almost every day, paid for her to go on vacation, gave her a roof to sleep under 25 days out of a 30 day month and so much more. This only got her angrier and she claimed that that was all over as well as K and Ms friendship. \n\nBefore I could say anything else she hung up on me. I’ve tried to call her an explain and apologize for the situation escalating but she has blocked me. \n\nMy daughter and K are both distraught and I feel awful for them both. I’m not really sure what to do or if I’m even really in the wrong here. Am I really the ass here?\n\nEdit: some people are saying I haven’t painted a clear enough picture of K and her mother’s relationship. Her mother is neglectful. She never tries to communicate with me or say thank you for anything I’ve done for K. Last time we spoke was in early August. Ks father ignores my husband and I when we try to reach out to him. The point in where I really realized her parents don’t give a shit is when I was the one who had to take K to the ER over a sprained ankle and when I told her mother she said she was too busy to just deal with a sprain. I thought saying K is at my house 25 out of 30 days of the month and there is no communication would show how little Ks parents care.",

It's model however doesn't use the cross model most plants use, instead using the sunflower's top model, [basically the texture would face one direction.](https://imgur.com/a/SLcLCmD) This texture was hastly made by using the status effect icon and sunflower's stem btw, it'd look much smaller and better if it was made by Mojang.\n\n**Usage**\n\nThe obvious use of a clover would be to brew potions of luck. You can also brew potions of luck with fermented spider eyes to make potions of bad luck. If the clover is given to a brown mooshroom or  used in the suspicious stew crafting recipe, it'll give you a suspicious stew that upon drinking, will give you the luck effect. You can also compost the clover much like any flower. You can also craft lime or green dye using the clover.",

Unfortunately, you can't sit anywhere without an entity that allows you to do so, and that brings up a whole range of problems; such as cart displacement, item cost, and a generally ugly appearance. As a slight compromise, meet the Cushion seat!\n\n[The design of the seat, modeled and textured in BlockBench; Includes the texture for spruce planks](https://preview.redd.it/jg5api8r8av71.png?width=452&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d32cf4807e649fd606ce43b5de05f33fdea89f0)\n\n# Purpose\n\nThis slab-like block has the unique functionality of being sittable, akin to the minecart; However, it's design as a block allows decoration with trapdoors, signs, or any other block you want to use. This would allow for custom chairs that can be used, without the entity cost of including a minecart.\n\nThe seat can also be pulled by pistons and slimeblocks, allowing players to create a cockpit for their flying machines and redstone elevators.\n\nOne could also use this as a building trick for climbable carpeted stairs, without changing the way carpet works in the base game. It could work as a custom bed for your pets, or you can place a few next to each other to build a couch that can sit multiple people.\n\n# Customization\n\nBy appending any dye or carpet, one could change the color, and perhaps the texture of the seat itself, allowing more freedom with their chair design. Some dyes could even give a completely new look to the seat. Some texture ideas include:\n\n* Red Dye/most colored dyes - same cushion texture, different color/wood type\n* Light Grey Dye - Stone/Stone-brick texture, allows you to mesh the seat with stone-type blocks\n* Green Dye - Same wood design, contains an obligatory creeper pattern\n\n# Crafting\n\nThe seat itself could be crafted with any plank/slab under any color carpet.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dq8uq38tdav71.png?width=246&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac5b72eb3dec9be6be34d880fe00665bd7a27801\n\nThrough this, you'd be able to build customizable chairs that can be sat in as well; enforcing creativity, while also giving some functionality for players. This wouldn't make other chair designs obsolete either, as stairs can include a back rest, without taking up space behind it, giving it more use against walls. To give the seat arms, a back rest, and any other features, you'd have to leave a decent amount of space around it for building.",

    "body": "Everybody knows Qarth has no chapter in TWOIAF and that Elio and Linda said [in interview](http://www.adriasnews.com/2015/09/elio-linda-interview.html) \"*George would not give us anything about Qarth*\" and somehow compared its level of secrecy to the Summerhall events.\n\nSlaver's Bay was also left out of TWOIAF. However it happened because nobody (even Yandell) cared about Slaver's Bay. In Qarth's case, Yandell makes reference to an in-universe book, the *Jade Compendium,* what's really telling.\n\nWe had threads like this before, but I'm here to share my impressions and findings.\n\n**1.** **What might be hidden in Qarth?**\n\nThe importance of Summerhall and Meereen are easily perceived. The tragedy of Sumerhall will be Dunk and Egg's final chapter and is a secret in itself. In turn, we have seen that what divides Daenerys' followers and Quenn's false friends in Meereen are historical reasons. So it is reasonable that Martin prefers to leave the historical backstage for TWOW and surprise readers, rather than to put three extra pages in TWOIAF.\n\nQarth's history, on the other hand, has different implications. Since the city was never part of the Valyrian Freehold, it is quite possible that these two civilizations have already warred. In fact, in ACOK one of Daenerys' bloodriders finds something very relevant south of Vaes Tolorro:\n\n>*Rakharo was the first to return. Due south the red waste stretched on and on, he reported, until it ended on a bleak shore beside the poison water. Between here and there lay only swirling sand, wind-scoured rocks, and plants bristly with sharp thorns.* ***He had passed the bones of a dragon, he swore, so immense that he had ridden his horse through its great black jaws***\\*\\*\\*.\\*\\*\\* *Other than that, he had seen nothing.* ***(ACOK, Daenerys I)***\n\nThis striking description resembles that of other formidable animals, well known to readers:\n\n>*The singers had given them the names of gods: Balerion, Meraxes, Vhaghar. Tyrion had stood between their gaping jaws, wordless and awed.* ***You could have ridden a horse down Vhaghar's gullet***\\*, although you would not have ridden it out again.\\* ***Meraxes was even bigger***\\*. And the greatest of them,\\* ***Balerion, the Black Dread, could have swallowed an aurochs whole, or even one of the hairy mammoths*** *said to roam the cold wastes beyond the Port of Ibben.* ***(AGOT, Tyrion I)***\n\nTherefore, the bones discovered in the Red Waste show us that the dragon that died there was comparable to the larger Targaryen's dragons. In the light of Martin's refusal to elaborate further on Qarth's history, this discovery becomes more striking, for it seems to indicate that in the past the qaathi (people from whom qartheens are the last living descendants) were able to defeat such dragons.\n\nAnother item that connects Valyrians and Quartheens is the horn Dragonbinder. Euron claims to have found the artifact as he walked over Valyria. However, many doubt this claim, and believe Euron stole the horn from the Warlocks he has captured. This hunch is supported by a semi-canonical source (the app, on \"Qarth\" entry).\n\nHowever, one might wonder how did qartheen warlocks acquire a valyrian dragon horn, which supposedly has the power to subdue and \"bind\" dragons to the will of whoever blows it.\n\nIt's hard to picture valyrians giving Qarth artifacts capable of taming dragons, under any pretext soever (eg, wedding gift, offering to Undying Ones or reward for services). Hence, it would have been simpler if someone in Qarth had stolen the horn. And not necessarily from a living person.\n\nWhile reflecting on Drogon's training, Daenerys recalled that \"*the dragonlords of old Valyria had controlled their mounts with binding spells and sorcerous horns*\" (ADWD, Daenerys X). In that sense, the dragon bones in the Red Waste could be a clue as to how the Warlocks got it. Looting a dragonrider's corpse that Qarth managed to defeat would explain the origin of the horn.\n\nThe sorcerous artifact could even explain why Valyria never expanded their hold towards Qarth. With the horn, the warlocks could neutralize dragons. Red Waste and triple walls provided protection against land attacks, while Dragonbinder would protect Qarth from dragon fire.\n\nLastly: George might still be concerned about sharing information about Qarth because he would have to reveal the secrets of the House of the Undying and it's warlocks, of the Shades of Evening they consume, and of the Black Bark Trees from which the beverage is extracted.\n\n**2. Really?**\n\nNo. All these speculations are very coherent, but we can't say any of this for sure.\n\nIndeed, Qarth is not the only place in the known world that has secret organizations with magical profile. TWOIAF has an entire chapter devoted to Braavos without spoiling any secret of the Faceless Men. Another chapter was dedicated to Asshai (where there are also qarthenos wizards in activity) and the city remains as mysterious and unfathomable as ever. King's Landing widely cited and explored, but we gained no new knowledge regarding the Alchemists' Guild.\n\nAs for Dragonbinder, even though the aforementioned hypothesis was able to bring together the few elements we have in a coherent way, there is no justification for closing ourselves to other possibilities. Or would it be utterly impossible for Martin to claim that, in the past, a mountless dragon lord fell in disgrace, traveled to Qarth, and sold his precious horn to remake his fortune? That's also a plausible explanation for how it got there.\n\nNor can it be argued that no valyrian would ever give up the horn because it would allow Qarth to challenge the Freehold, for, see, regardless of how they got it, the Warlocks already have a horn. If this would put them in position to compete with the Freehold, the challenge would have already taken place. And if that would have had already happened, Qarth would have its own dragons. Since none of this happened, we must conclude that the Dragonbinder alone had not enough power to shake Valyria.\n\nOn the other hand, the dragon carcass in the middle of the Red Waste hardly prove anything except that it was the site of the last rest of the beast. To think that the creature was ridden by a dragon knight is mere speculation.\n\nDragon bones have been found from Ibben to Sothoryos. Yandel believes this is evidence that these creatures, though first originated from the Fourteen Flames, \"*must have been spread across much of the known world before they were tamed*\" (TWOIAF, Ancient History: The Rise of Valyria), while others believe that dragons appeared in the \"*Shadow Lands beyond Asshai and the islands of the Jade Sea*\" (AGOT, Daenerys III).\n\nTherefore, the bones in the red desert may be just the remains of a ancient wild dragon.\n\n**3. So what do we really have?**\n\nWhat we really have on Qarth is the *Jade Compendium,* written by Coloquo Vottar, a volantene.\n\nVotar's work was first mentioned in AFFC and then again in ADWD and TWOIAF. However, the book is not limited to being quoted. He actually appears on the Wall. Sam seeks for a copy in the underground libraries of Castle Black, in order to deliver it to Mae\n\nster Aemon, who, after examining it with help from Clydas, hands him over to Lord Commander Jon Snow.\n\nWhat is interesting to note is that the passage in which Aemon and Jon briefly discuss the *Jade Compendium* appears in both AFFC, Samwell I, and ADWD, Jon II. [As some users noted here this week](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/c2l7tk/spoilers_extended_discarded_how_grrm_rewrote_an/erkw1cp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), Martin originally only wrote this chapter in Samwell's POV, but some time after 2005 he decided to add Jon's. So it seems Martin thought this conversation needed to be highlighted.\n\nIn introducing the Compendium to Jon Snow, Aemon's intention was for the Lord Commander to realize that Stannis's sword did not resemble Azor Ahai's Lightbringer. Jon gets to read the book, but only the few pages indicated by the old maester. This is how Lord Commander summarizes the passage he read:\n\n>*\\[...\\] \"I looked at that book Maester Aemon left me. The Jade Compendium. The pages that told of Azor Ahai. Lightbringer was his sword. Tempered with his wife's blood if Votar can be believed. Thereafter Lightbringer was never cold to the touch, but warm as Nissa Nissa had been warm. In battle the blade burned fiery hot.* ***Once Azor Ahai fought a monster. When he thrust the sword through the belly of the beast, its blood began to boil. Smoke and steam poured from its mouth, its eyes melted and dribbled down its cheeks, and its body burst into flame.****\"*  \n>  \n>*Clydas blinked. \"A sword that makes its own heat …\"*  \n>  \n>*\"… would be a fine thing on the Wall.\" Jon put aside his wine cup and drew on his black moleskin gloves. \"A pity that the sword that Stannis wields is cold. \\[...\\]* **(ADWD, Jon III)**\n\nThe bold part adds new facts to the version of the legend of Azor Ahai that was told to us in ACOK by Sallador Saan. Thus, it seems that the Compendium has a **more complete** version of the myth. And this version would have been the result of the voyages of a foreigner, Colloquo Votar, by \"*all the lands of the Jade Sea*\" (AFFC, Samwell I; ADWD, Jon II). And among those lands are Yi Ti, Leng and Qarth.\n\nCoincidentally, this is the book whose account of Qarth is, in the opinion of Maester Yandel, **the best source** of information that Westeros has about the city and its surroundings (TWOIAF, Beyond the Sunset Kingdom: Other Lands/ TWOIAF, The Bones and Beyond: Yi Ti). The book is **probably also the most complete source**. Otherwise Yandel would not limit himself to tell the reader to consult the *Compendium*.\n\nObviously, Yandel's statement was the form found by George Martin to tell us that we will only have access to the Compendium (and information about Qarth) through what the characters tell us. However, in putting things like this, Martin also reveals that the Compendium must contain relevant unpublished information.\n\n**4. But what information has the** ***Jade Compendium*** **given us so far?**\n\nSamwell Tarly refers to the book as \"a thick volume of tales and legends from the East\" (AFFC, Samwell I), and really tales and legends is all we know to be in it. Here is the list of what we have heard:\n\n1. The most complete version we have ever heard of the legend of Azor Ahai and Lightbringer, as seem above (ADWD, Jon III);\n2. a curious legend of Yi Ti about a woman with a monkey tail who managed to bring back the sun, after he had hidden his face from the earth for a lifetime, ashamed of something that no one has ever discovered what was (TWOIAF, Ancient History: The Long Night);\n3. The best report on Qarth, in Maester Yandel's opinion (TWOIAF, Beyond the Sunset Kingdom: Other Lands);\n4. The statement that, beneath every YiTish city, three older cities lie buried (TWOIAF, The Bones and Beyond: Yi Ti);\n5. the report that the Empress of Leng, at least four times in the history of the island, put all strangers on the island to death, on orders received from the \"Old Ones\", gods who lived deep below the ruined subterranean cities (TWOIAF, The Bones and Beyond: Leng);\n\nWe can observe that, apart from what we have dealt with throughout this post, we only have three new information and they are all about Yi Ti and Leng -- in other words, regions that are of no interest to the main plot.\n\nIn addition, of the three information, only one makes an indirect reference to something of interest in the main plot: a legend about Yi Ti's experience during the Long Night, in which a monkey-tail heroine saved the world from catastrophe.\n\n**5. Ok, and?**\n\nAnd it turns out that this particular legend seems to reverberate in the culture of Yi Ti to this day, just as the legend of Azor Ahai seems to be embedded in the customs of Qarth.\n\nIt's not for nothing that the book by which the westerosis have the most complete source of information about Qarth is that which also contains the most complete version of the Azor Ahai's legend.\n\nI explain: Some time ago, [absolutely detail-oriented readers suggested](https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/80407-lightbringer-theory-spoilers-if-you-havent-finished-all-the-books/&tab=comments#comment-4072625) that the [qartheens female gowns](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Qartheen_gown), which leave one exposed breast, would be a reference to Nissa Nissa, to whom, according to legend, Azor Ahai would have ordered to \"*bare your breast, and know that I love you best of all that is in this world*\" (ACOK, Davos I) before tempering Lightbringer in her heart.\n\nThis already sounded to me like something that fits well with Martin's world-style creation. When, in the light of that, I read about the monkey-tailed heroine, I immediately recalled what Daenerys had observed in the eastern market of Vaes Dothraki:\n\n>\"*the bright-eyed men of Yi Ti in monkey-tail hats*\" (AGOT, Daenerys VI)  \n>  \n>\"*a fat cloth trader from Yi Ti was haggling with a Pentoshi over the price of some green dye, the monkey tail on his hat swaying back and forth as he shook his head*\" (AGOT, Daenerys VI)\n\nTherefore, I feel compelled to infer that the influence that the myths of the Long Night exerted on the fashion of Yi Ti and Qarth was created to serve as an example, for comparison.\n\nThis case was made to serve as a parameter and enable the reader to decipher the correlations between the events described in the *Jade Compendium* and elements of everyday life of the characters, hidden under the facade of tales and legends of strange, bizarre lands.\n\nThat is why I believe that Martin's silence about Qarth serves as an invitation to reflect on the encrypted evidence at our disposal. And, as you can see from the list above, there are at least two more tales from Colloquo Votar's book whose importance remain unknown.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So, would anybody be so kind to help me decipher the rest? Thanks in advance.**\n\nEDIT:**TL;DR** \\- The *Jade Compendium* has encrypted crossed-information about Qarth (and possibly Azor Ahai and Lightbringer) in the shape of tales and legends from Leng and Yi Ti.",

    "body": "So it seems like just recently, mostly today, many people are noticing the biggest issues with the Villager trading change, which, instead of addressing players biggest gripes with the system, just spreads it out across multiple biomes, meaning players will have to make multiple different bases across multiple different biomes, and doesn't in any way, dissuade players from making trading halls.\n\nNow it's not *just* this that's an issue, there's a notable amount of times where Mojang has created a 'solution' to an issue that hasn't really accomplished much aside from made it more tedious to actually play.\n\nTake for example Netherite. Getting Netherite was simple, just dig down to Y:15 in the Nether and destroy every single block you see until you come across it. However, as of 1.20, it now requires a template, which is locked behind Bastions. Sure, it's incentive to explore Bastions, but rather than feeling like a cool addition to the Bastions making them worth checking out, it feels like a deliberate roadblock in the progression of sorts. For less skilled players, this basically blocks them away from actually playing with Netherite, and less skilled players benefit from Netherite the most, arguably, while for more skilled players, this is just extra tedium.\n\nAnother example could be with iron spawning. It's pretty clear that a good chunk of the community thinks iron farms are overpowered, and it seems like Mojang tried tackling this by making it more common in the mountains and deeper underground, along with making iron affected by Fortune and the raw iron blocks and big iron veins. However, Mojang also massively decreased iron spawning at sea level, which is usually where most players tend to live, and where iron used to spawn, yet again making iron more tedious to acquire, unless, however, you set up an iron farm, completely defeating the purpose.\n\nThis also leans into one of Minecraft's bigger overarching problems it's had for years, adding new content and then spreading it so far out that often to get new items it can take upwards of hours, even if it's something as simple as a single sapling. With an elytra and a sugar cane and Creeper farm, it's trivial, but if you have none of those, it's a long and unrewarding trek for items that should really not be as awkward to get. This also applies retroactively, I cannot tell you how many hour long treks I've made in Minecraft to get *ONE* cactus simply because I want green dye. Hiding content away like that doesn't make the game feel as content rich as it actually is.",

        "body": "The crisis appears to be coming from people having different answers as to what the ultimate arc of the game \"should\" be, and therefore what represents an adequate target for endgame content or an endgame state. I've always thought of Creative as being essentially a creative toolkit, showing you everything in the game, as a test bed, or low stress building game, art medium, whatever, and therefore in survival the ultimate \"goal\" is to basically get to a state where you're functionally in Creative. Endgame armor so you can't really die, endgame tools so you can remove blocks with ease, enough materials that you can build whatever you want or experiment with redstone, build farms so you don't have to worry about food, fuel, or XP, Elytra so you can fly and traverse huge distances, trading halls to reduce the time and resources required to make replacement gear when the time comes, some rare and unique stuff to hunt down like new flowers, sherds, armor trims.\n\nThat's what has made the most sense to me for a while. The exploration is the midgame, finding where to settle a mid-/long-term base or building project, seeking out villages, finding where your closest ocean or desert temples or woodland mansions are to plunder.\n\nYou could say the endgame should just be fighting bigger and badder bosses. A bigger, rarer temple with some even somehow better loot in it. But I don't think anyone will really ever be happy with that, no matter what they add... structures are already so rare, so far away, and there's only so many ways you can add new valuable items.\n\nYou could say the endgame is exploration... but sooner or later you will realize once you've seen one biome you've kind of seen pretty much everything there is to see about it. Making biomes massive and letting them more naturally blend helped a lot with how natural the world feels. Just adding more is tricky - it's nice to have new stuff to see, but as you add more and more variants with bigger and bigger biomes, you rapidly run in to situations where something you want might be 20,000+ blocks away and that's super frustrating, especially if you want to travel to it a lot. I think you could consider some kind of teleportation mechanic here and balance its cost and functionality accordingly.\n\nYou could say the endgame is automation, and while lots of people enjoy that, it makes itself irrelevant. You should make these kinds of things to facilitate your endgame play, they don't hold up well as the *focus* of endgame play. I do often look forward to the point late game where everything else is built up, we have near infinite resources and I have safe areas to create redstone puzzles for fun. This again is the the trajectory of Survival ultimately being to get you to Creative.\n\nTheir solution tactic appears to be to try to break up \"one stop shops\" for content. Mining at just one height no longer showers you with iron, gold, coal, diamond and redstone, you need to split your efforts between mountain and underwater mining for coal, Y~0 for iron, Y~-50 for diamond. But we got updates to make caving way more viable, so while strip mining is still most optimal, you feel less like you're wasting your time if you don't, and you can take a break and try something else if you do. One village no longe solves all your problems, though you are incentivized to set up camp in or at least near to one for convenience. Collecting all types of trees can take a *lot* of walking and exploring, but at least once you have them all you can make farms back home.\n\nI wonder if having some kind of reputation system amongst villagers would help this secondary system integrate a little better with the \"creative\" endgame. I'm imagining something like, each illager or witch you kill, each illager outpost or woodland mansion you clear, each raid you successfully beat, all increase your reputation (and to a lesser extent the reputation of other players, depending on how involved they were). Curing zombie villagers could still be a mechanic but the benefit would be reduced and cap after just one or two cures so the breed -> cure -> trading hall route is a bit less optimal but still valid. If the feeling you're going after is that you're relieving these villagers of the groups terrorizing them and making them less safe, then lots of things could contribute. Expanding their village would help a bit, allowing them to breed more would help, spawning iron golems for them, fighting off their enemies within a certain radius, even trading with them. And you could imagine expanding the \"gossip\" mechanic whereby your reputation with villagers can spread, so if you have a cluster close by then all of the villagers there see you more or less equally. If you go super far away, they've probably never heard of you, so your reputation would matter less. Eventually if your reputation is high enough, villagers could actually seek you out during the day, and could willingly try to move in to your base to cut down on one of the worst parts of trading halls - transporting villagers. These could be from all different biomes, but the higher your reputation, not only the better your trades with any nearby villages (and maybe even allow new trades per level to appear for existing villagers?), but the more diverse wandering villagers will show up, so you don't *have* to go 15,000 blocks away to find a swamp biome village or whatever. Of course not everyone may want this, so you need a mechanism to essentially ignore and despawn them (like the wandering trader). The way I would solve this is let beds be flagged for players. Villagers ignore them so they're not used in the count to produce more villagers and they can't steal players' beds if they come to your base. If you don't want them, they just wander around for a bit and de-spawn. If they claim a bed, they stay. I would also want a mechanic to be able to lead villagers around, direct them in a sense, so you can bring them to dormitories, trading halls, whatever you want, basically let the Lead work (but don't literally use the Lead on them...). Maybe simply holding an emerald, or bread.",

I love watching Hermitcraft, but I am not someone who speed runs to the end within the first hour of gameplay to get an elytra. I play an hour or two after work when I have the time and energy. I like building small ineficient farms to make it easier for me to build and decorate a house. I want to use pink wood blocks for my roof and add a camel to my stable and maybe even trim my armor to look how I want it. But everything is too hard to get or too far, it would take me all month just to find the cherry biome I want to use for my roof. The only desert near me I already explored so there are no cammels there, I need to prune my world or go really far to find one and hope I can bring it back. I can't find the templates I want, and even if I did, I don't have enough diamonds to copy all the templates I want because I need them for tools, because I dont have mending on them because I can't find the village with that specific villager. My armor is dimond because I also can't find a bastion, and not worth trimming because it is just going to break since I can't get mending or unbreaking. This is going to be my game after the next update. Yes I know I could stock up on villigers and books before the update, the thing is I shouldn't have to.",

I remember seeing a SystemZee video about how the Ancient City \"Portal\" could be something like a gateway to a new world mode that changes everything about the world, seeing as it's an endgame thing that would unlock new stuff. I think that's pretty cool. There's no point in exploring the Ancient Cities that much since a lot of the same good (maybe even better) loot can be found in structures added many years ago like strongholds and end cities. There should be more of an incentive to go to some of the structures aside from small, insignificant, and niche items used for crafting recipes. The armor trims are a nice touch but it would be cool if there were items distributed like them that actually had a use that wasn't purely cosmetic. Echo Shards are a horrible exclusive treasure for the Ancient City, all you can make with them are a compass that shows where you last died, but at this point in the game if you're able to conquer the city and live to tell the tale, you really don't need that since death is way less common. And the other thing is being able to craft a knock-off 11 disc. Also killing the warden for the sculk catalyst is nice, not that useful but at least it lets you renew it. I guess. (just build any OP xp farm)\n\nWe don't need hard gatekept structures but I think if the challenge was great enough that it would be almost impossible to explore without certain armor, weapons, tools, enchantments, etc. (kind of like the ocean monument) the loot should be worth it and much better than what we have now. Not the exact same loot as another structure that is only slightly different.",

        "body": "Agree with the template and villager sentiment, though I’d keep in mind the villager changes are still experimental. \n\nNot sure how comparable that is to iron gen - in my estimation it’s is far more common in the new world generation than before. Whereas it generates maybe 60-80% as frequently from before in y-20 to 70, it’s maybe 3x more common from y- (-45) to 19. A single of the new iron ore “veins” can give you maybe four entire stacks in one spot. Yes, it nerfs how much iron players can gain within instant reach, but it rewards players who take the (not even that big of an extra) step and actually go below y-20, and is *much* more sustainable investment for players who commit to worlds. Especially considering almost all iron-related recipes like hoppers and rails are important, mid-late game utilities to begin with. Total net gain, and reduces the necessity in which the player needs to go through the trouble of making an iron farm - no actual “nerfs”. When drawing out existing gameplay there should be a greater end reward to justify reducing what you can get in the short-term. Lack of said idea is one of the issues with the villager change, but unless you’re playing a world for maybe an hour or two total, I wouldn’t say shifting some important resources just a bit further from the players immediate reach is always an inherently bad design.\n\nAlso, stuff being added that are sparse aren’t necessarily “fundamental” for the player. Ancient cities, mangrove swamps, trail ruins, you’re really only looking for them if you want to find them: mangrove swamps for purely decorative wood/frog lights, ancient cities because of its difficulty that tailors specifically for veteran players, trail ruins for (again) decoratives. Realistically there are going to be dozens more biomes being added to the game in the future that displace others from generating, and you’re not gonna be able to have *everything* within immediate reach. I’ve seen suggestions that the biomes should be smaller to bring stuff closer to the player, but idk, it seems off.",

Others 10 days.\n\nPersonally, I think that making things more difficult to get helps give things more meaning and ups player interest to get those things (or spend time to get those things). Not everything should be handed to the player on a platter.\n\nFor a long time in Minecraft everything was made easier, they added stackable food, saturation, sprinting, stronger enchantments, mending, bows, tridents, max XP level was reduced. This took place slowly over many years.\n\nThis imo made the game far too easy. There also was never much of a 'tech tree' like in other games where things are locked behind time gates where you have to achieve certain things to unlock others.\n\nNow that Minecraft is adding these retroactively they feel like they're making the game harder (and they are) but I think it isn't super unexpected given the prior buffs that players got. Minecraft was due to be rebalanced in some way. \n\nI think there is also for some reason, the feeling in the Minecraft community of 'I must have the best tools' when that isn't the case. You can do just fine with diamond tools, you don't HAVE to get Netherite. It helps, but not to the extent that your gameplay will suffer if you don't have EffV, UnbIII Netherite tools compared to Eff V, UnbIII, diamond tools.\n\nPlayers have to get out of this mentality of having the absolute best of everything immediately with super ease. That's not how things work, nor should it. Some things need to be harder in games and Minecraft is no different. We need a difficulty ladder to keep the game interesting for all players.\n\nI'm not saying Mojang is perfect at rebalancing but I do think it's an overreaction to suggest that Netherite is too hard to obtain now because you need a template or that getting a sapling/cactus is too hard.",

I personally think all the changes you listed are good. After all, what's the point of a procwdursllt generated infinite world if you can get everything you need without having to explore it. Adding reason to explore allows Mojang to show off Minecraft's biggest achievement, which it's open world. You are saying these ass tedium, but on the flip side it adds more gameplay.  More to do is more content to explore. I think it's fair and valid that personally, as a player, you (and others) are not a fan of this. At the same time, many people are.\n\nI don't think there really is anything inherently wrong with what Mojang has done, because an opinion on it is entirely based off of an individuals expectations and preferences.",

Maybe it would be practical to replace the top layer of sand with a more dynamic block that is divided into 8 or 16 layers, like fresh snow can be. Pairing your cactus coloration idea with this desert weather would at least make a really nice desert atmospheric mod, if it doesn't make it into the base game.",

    "body": "## Guild Wars 2: Rise of the Tengu\n\nHello everybody!\n\nI’m very proud to reveal the very first paid mini expansion to you all - **Guild Wars 2: Rise of the Tengu** is set to be released in the second half of this year! \n\nA very big thank you to anonymous beta tester /u/ash-hattman for revealing all this stuff to me over the past weeks. He even managed to capture some screenshots, send me a couple of the string files and even got me some audio. For now the information is a bit sparse but expect more stuff like the story to be leaked later!\n\n---\n\n## Features\n\nThe Quaggan have shown their true face, cast aside by the human gods over a thousand years ago they’ve sworn to take revenge on them and their worshipers. With the recent outburst of dragon magic they’ve started to summon their saviors back into the world of Tyria once and for all.\n\nJoin up with the proud Tengu and stop the bloodthirsty Quaggan from sacrificing more innocent civilians. Are you in time to stop the White Mantle and Mursaat from taking over Tyria once and for all?\n\n- Two exclusive new zones: Temple of Tolerance and the Aerie!\n- An exclusive level 90 dungeon!\n- Create a playable Tengu!\n- Level up to 90!\n- Wield polearms!\n- Completely reworked underwater combat system for PvP!\n- 100% Underwater PvP map - the Fall of Abbadon!\n- And much more!\n\n---\n\n## Temple of Tolerance\n\nThe Quaggan have shown their true nature and are trying to bring back the Mursaat into this world. Join up with the Tengu to put a hold to their plans and fight for the freedom of Tyria! This zone has 3 new World bosses that spawn every 30 minutes, defeating these bosses (and the new dungeon) will be the only way to gather new Legendary materials. \n\nIn this zone you’ll also find diary entries made by [Tsuru Whitewing](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tsuru_Whitewing) who has witnessed the return of the Mursaat to Tyria. Gather all of them for an achievement.\n\n- [Loading screen (1920x1080)](http://i.imgur.com/uKKmXAE)\n- [Map of the Temple of Tolerance](http://i.imgur.com/bOwDeHt)\n- [Screenshot taken in the south eastern part of the map](http://i.imgur.com/QyOT8PB)\n- [Listen to Tsuru Whitewing’s diary](https://soundcloud.com/that_shaman/rise-of-the-tengu) (01:55)\n\nThe zone has multiple sections: \n\n- *Songfeather's Forest*: A dark forest in which the Quaggan perform blood sacrifices to summon Mursaat\n- *Temple Ruins*: The main stronghold of the Mursaat\n- *Bloomanoo Village*: The main town of the Quaggan led by Bloomanoo\n- *Mirror Lake*: The last outpost of the white mantle\n- *Heart of Primordus*: Magic is bursting out of the crust of the earth after Scarlet hit the layline in Lion's Arch\n\n---\n\n## The Aerie\n\nThe main city of the Tengu, in the current alpha version it's impossible to enter the zone. Developers described it as being a vertical map like the grove only much higher.\n\n---\n\n## Tengu\n\nThe Tengu are an avian race, they’ve secluded themselves from the rest of the World, but now the Quaggan have shown their true evil nature their homeland is being overrun by Mursaat.\n\n- [Character creation - selected](http://i.imgur.com/mtvtbWs)\n- [Character creation - deselected](http://i.imgur.com/V0xVaNz)\n- [Screenshot of a playable Tengu in the Temple of Tolerance](http://i.imgur.com/QyOT8PB)\n\nMiscellaneous info about the Tengu:\n\n- To save lot of time the Tengu won’t have any personal story to worry about\n- After a short introduction you’ll be automatically leveled to 80.\n- You will need to buy a special character slot (about twice the price of a regular slot) if you want to play as a Tengu\n- In the current Alpha version you can not customize your looks\n\n---\n\n## Polearms\n\nYou will now be able to wield polearms. These will only drop in the Dominion of winds and require a 15 gold unlock for each character. In the current beta version only mesmers are able to wield polearms:\n\n- [Screenshot of a mesmer in front of the Aerie - North side](http://i.imgur.com/N550IMO)\n- [Screenshot of a mesmer in front of the Aerie - West side](http://i.imgur.com/u6XZdhe)\n- [Skill icons from the dat file](http://i.imgur.com/hCXG5VV)\n\nMesmer skills:\n\nName|Description\n:|:\nEther Bash|Strike your target with the polearm\nCry of Pain|Grab the wrong end of the polearm. Apply torment and confusion to foes. Inflicts bleeding on self.\nClumsiness|Throw your polearm to a random location. Apply confusion to foes in the area and enrage allies. Disables weapon skills for 5 seconds.\nFrustration|Create a phantasm that uses a random attack to damage and cripple foes.\nTear space|Create a tear in space at your location\nRip time|Create a rip in time at your location launching foes through it in the opposite direction.\n\n---\n\n## Fall of Abbadon\n\nUnderwater combat has been completely revamped for PvP after retiring the Raid on the Capricorn. The new map takes place entirely underwater and is very vertical.\n\n- [Map in the Mists](http://i.imgur.com/3xuLol6)\n- [Full resolution map from the dat file](http://i.imgur.com/tR9R0hU)\n\n---\n\n## List of (gemstore) items\n\nItem|Description\n:|:\n |**Access passes**\n*110762_0060*|Dominion of Winds access pass\n**[&AgEX/gAA]**|Gain access to the Dominion of Winds for 1 day\n**[&AgEY/gAA]**|Gain access to the Dominion of Winds for 7 days\n**[&AgEZ/gAA]**|Gain access to the Dominion of Winds for 30 days\n |**Wardrobe**\n**[&AgEb/gAA]**|Rare Skin Unlocker\n*110761_0763*|Unlock a Rare skin of choice in the wardrobe.\n**[&AgEa/gAA]**|Exotic Skin Unlocker\n*110760_0883*|Unlock a Rare skin of choice in the wardrobe.\n**[&AgEc/gAA]**|Random Skin Unlocker\n*110761_0437*|Unlocks a random skin (rare quality or higher)\n |**Skritt Mercenary**\n*110762_0057*|Hire a Skritt mercenary to follow you around.

The cake took much longer to bake than I expected but turned out really good.  As for decoration I baked meringue for the first time to try and make mushrooms (they came out a little flat but still super good) and I brushed them with cinnamon and cocoa powder to color them.  I made the mistake of softening butter in the microwave for the frosting so it started melting as I was piping it but I still think the tree trunk pattern cake out well.  As for the moss I crushed up some matcha wafers with more matcha powder and green dye, and the fireflies were fruit chews (vanilla and lemon) that I cut in half and rolled into balls. \nI was very happy with this cake and my grandmother who usually isn't a fan of cake ate most of it throughout the week.  So I think that's probably a great sign.",

I'm not sure what the best place for it would be, but as it will involve humanity clawing its way to glory, I thought I'd test the waters here first. If there's interest in it, I'll start posting it from the beginning and go from there!*\n\n---\n\n“Hello, Candidate Veronice,” the scarecrow said in cultured tones. \n\nHe was the tallest unmodified man Deidre had ever seen, and thin as a rail. His arched nose and graying widow’s peak made him look like an ancient noble from a forgotten feudal world. He wore the military fatigues of the Colonial Elite Forces like the robes of an emperor, and made Deidre feel like she should bow. \n\nShe saluted instead.\n\n“Reporting as ordered, sir,” she said, hoping they were the right words. He seemed like a man who was difficult to impress, and easily disappointed.\n\n“Very good. I am Lieutenant Colonel Valkentoff, probabilist grade *nine-point-seven*.” He emphasized that last part very clearly, as if it should matter a great deal. \n\nIt did. \n\nAll mental abilities were roughly quantified on a ten-point scale, with ten, of course, being the highest. What Valkentoff had just told Deidre was that he was one of the galaxy’s most skilled manipulators of the basic laws of chance; the odds that certain key events would happen. The man could use his mind to push at the underpinnings of reality and get things to play out as he desired them. No wonder he seemed egotistic. His glorious golden sclera, auric pools surrounding gray irises, confirmed his specialty.\n\n“So obsessed with numbers. I suppose you’d have to be,” said a feminine voice. \n\nDeidre actually had to look for its owner, and was surprised to realize she’d been standing beside Valkentoff the entire time. The woman was slight and unassuming, somewhat hunched over, with intensely forgettable features that seemed to just… fade away. She had dull brown hair pulled back into a tight bun. Even her CEF uniform looked drab. The only thing about her that stood out was the lush green dye that overpowered the whites of her eyes.\n\n“Major Givens, atcher service. Grats on getting here, Deidre.”\n\n“Um, thank you, Miss- er, Major Givens.”\n\nValkentoff cleared his throat. Givens rolled her eyes. “Oh, yes. Empath, grade nine-point-eight-*nine*,” she said with an impish smile.\n\n“There are only *tenths* of a decimal point in the Scale, Major Givens,” Valkentoff said, scowling.\n\n“God, you’re depressing,” Givens said with a sigh. “Nine-point-eight, then. Still more than you.”\n\nValkentoff scoffed. He seemed to think little of her particular specialty. “Candidate Veronice,” he began, addressing Deidre directly. “Major Givens and I are to be the first of your instructors. We are here to begin your training - your *true* training. You are to become a tool that will ensure humanity’s place among the stars. Are you ready for this responsibility?”\n\n“I… yes. Sir. Lieutenant Colonel,” Deidre said. Something odd pushed at Deidre, encouraging her to respond confidently. She glanced at Major Givens. The empath winked.\n\n“Delightful, but until we help you understand what that actually *means*, they’re just words,” Valkentoff said, waving his hand. The room’s lighting dimmed and the far wall lit up, silhouetting the two officers. The only other light was the red glow from Deidre’s ever-present inhibitor. A detailed galactic map appeared, impossibly vast. More stars than Deidre could visit in a thousand lifetimes. It was a little intimidating. \n\n“How much do you know about the state of the Colonial Empire, Candidate? We are aware of what you’ve been *taught*, but that is not always what one *knows*.”\n\n“The human race achieved faster-than-light travel three hundred and forty-nine years ago through trade with the first known alien race, the Chivalrac,” Deidre repeated in the methodical voice of one quoting from memory. “Since that time, its position in the galaxy has expanded through colonization, diplomacy, and warfare to encompass nearly two hundred systems.”\n\n“Quite right,” Valkentoff said. “And are we doing *well?*”\n\n“Er… ‘well,’ sir?”\n\n“Yes, Candidate. ‘Well.’ Is the human race in a *good* position out here amongst the twinkling stars and enchanting aliens?”\n\nDeidre could feel a trap approaching, but plowed ahead anyway. “As far as I know, yes. The discovery of mental abilities over two centuries ago has helped our cause greatly, as have advances in genetics, nanotechnology, cybern-”\n\n“So you don’t know anything beyond what you’ve been taught, then.” Valkentoff sighed. “As expected. Allow me to educate you, little Candidate, on man’s current position in the galaxy.”\n\nBehind him, a portion of the galactic map near the inner rim of the Orion Arm lit up with semi-connected blue shading. It looked like faint daubs of paint forming an ungainly column on the grand procession of the Milky Way. “Our holdings, of course.” \n\nGreen splotches scattered across the map, loosely clustered in and around the reassuring blue of humanity. “Our allies.” Gray splotches exploded across the map. “Independents and unknowns.” Finally, red seared between the gaps, making the galaxy look like a mismatched Christmas tree. “And our enemies.”\n\nIn all, the galaxy seemed barely colonized. Even with the colorations predicting general empire sizes and holdings by shading in the empty spaces between systems, there was still a great deal left to be discovered. \n\nValkentoff seemed to sense Deidre’s thoughts. “So much more to be had, isn’t there? Well, you can see what 200-odd worlds really means out here, Candidate. *Nothing*. We’re a minor player on the biggest, most unforgiving stage in history. The fact that we show up at all on the map - and this is an official galactic map, mind you - is a feather in our cap. There are plenty of worthless civilizations out there with a mere handful of worlds. Some only have one.\n\n“Humanity is not in a position to be ‘doing’ anything, Candidate. We are not important enough to be *well* - nor have we gained enough to be doing poorly, either. We are still struggling to simply *matter* on a galactic scale. It is an immensely difficult task.”\n\nMajor Givens spoke up for the first time in the presentation. “The other races out there are staggeringly different from us *and* each other, Deidre. Maintaining the level of adaptability needed to combat such an overpowering diversity of customs, technologies, and tactics is something we still struggle with to this day.” \n\nDeidre frowned at that, and the Major held up a hand. “I know, I know - it’s not all bloodshed. You mentioned diplomacy and colonization, and yes, they play their role, but ever since the Vaunt collapsed, the galaxy’s races have been in a state of conflict more often than not. There are opportunities in that chaos, make no mistake, but there are some *very* challenging hurdles to overcome, as well…” \n\nThe screen behind her changed, zooming in to focus on the tiny pocket of humanity in the immensity of the Milky Way. Bars stretched out beside the blue-shaded worlds, each topped with a number - population statistics.\n\n“…the greatest of which is also the simplest: Manpower. No matter how you look at it, we are vastly, *hilariously* outnumbered. We spike the water supplies with fertility drugs, encourage multi-child households like you wouldn’t believe, and crank the cloning factories up to eleven, but it’s still not enough - there are just *too damn many of them*, Deidre.” Givens sighed. “You’d think three hundred and forty-seven billion human-type organisms would be a lot, but space is, I’m sure you’ve heard, incomprehensibly big. We’re like a drop in the damn bucket.”\n\n“A *fraction* of a drop,” Valkentoff said. “Four hundred billion suns fill the Milky Way. If we could be assured complete ownership of a star simply by stationing a *single human being* beside it, we still wouldn’t have enough to conquer this galaxy.”\n\n“Eesh,” Deidre squeaked.\n\nValkentoff nodded gravely. “However, there is one point in our favor, one point you need to be corrected on, Candidate: The discovery of mentalics has not simply ‘helped’ our cause… it is the sole point of uniqueness the human race possesses. We have met aliens that can tap the potential of one field or another, but we have *never* met a race that has access to the array we do. Not a single one has ever been reported as possessing a ‘variety’ of powers, and those with more than even *two* distinct ones are vanishingly rare. There are biorezzers and telepaths out there, probabilists and all manner of kineticists-\"\n\n“Even empaths,” Givens interrupted.\n\n“Yes, yes,” Valkentoff said, waving a hand. “All the fields exist, but they tend to be divided up amongst the races. Except ours. We’ve got them *all*, Candidate - and that’s how we’re going to beat them.”\n\nHe paused, and his tone changed to one of vague caution. “This is, of course, a fact we try to hide; we’d rather not have tentacled horrors prying open our brains to learn what makes us different.”\n\n“Which brings us to you,” Major Givens said softly, extending a petite hand to indicate Deidre. “Do you see now what you represent?”\n\nShe understood. “I’m the first polymath. The first mentalist with more than adequate skill in every field we know.”\n\n“You’re the key, Candidate,” Valkentoff whispered. “We are going to train you to be the most powerful mentalist in existence, and then we will snapshot your mind, clone your body, and stake our claim to the galaxy with a hundred million of your sisters.”\n\nGivens nodded - almost sadly, it seemed. “With your help, we can do it. It all starts with you, Deidre Veronice. Now… are you ready for this responsibility? Truly? Can we trust you?”\n\nShe sounded so earnest, so desirous of reassurance that Deidre was about to answer immediately with another knee-jerk ‘yes’ like before, when she stopped. What was humanity to her? Who were those teeming billions? Was she really willing to dedicate her life to them without even knowing what they were like - *or* anything about the alien races she’d be condemning to servitude or obliteration? \n\nThen she thought of her friends at the Institute, the classmates who would have fought to protect her, or the guardians who died for her without knowing her. They’d never stopped to think about who Deidre was or what she might become - all they knew was that she was their charge, and it was their duty to protect her.\n\nDeidre smiled. Those faceless soldiers hadn’t given their lives for *her*, not really. They were doing their jobs for the Colonial Empire, and the Empire was, hopefully, doing its job for the good of all. They *couldn’t* know Deidre, just as Deidre couldn’t know the barest fraction of mankind - and didn’t need to. She had a responsibility to uphold the *idea* of her species, the thought that humans deserved their place in the stars. If she couldn’t be for humanity in aggregate, then honestly… what *could* she possibly stand for?\n \nSurvival - it was the simplest drive. Deidre could accept that; could train, learn, and, eventually, be duplicated for that.\n\n“Absolutely,” she whispered.\n\n---\n\n*Our story has a start now!* **[Head here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/6u1sdg/oc_humanitys_place_part_1/)** *to read from the beginning!*",

    "body": "Another story from my old alma mater and dealing with morons...  (tl;dr at end)\n\nIts Halloween, so of course college students are doing stupid things.  This included one guy from my dorm (let's call him Richard), who was spending his night chasing after people trying to get into the dorm and silly stringing them.  I almost managed to get inside without incident, but he caught me at the door and unloaded a whole can on me.  I started shrieking at him within moments, trying to get him to stop, but he didn't listen.  The reason I had shrieked?  Some of the silly string had gotten into my ear canal.  Once he was finally done, I flung what I could at him, yelling at him for getting that crap in my ear.  He shifted awkwardly and then darted off to chase other dorm residents.\n\nMy roommate helped me pick off the rest of the string and then we headed into the bathroom to try and flush out my ear canal.  No dice:  my right ear was good and plugged.  Being silly little freshmen, we didn't know if rubbing alcohol or even hydrogen peroxide would do anything, and didn't want to risk it possibly making things worse.  And using a q-tip was completely out of the question.  All I could do that night was take a long hot shower before bed, and then lay on my right side, hoping gravity would do its thing.\n\nI woke up to a spot of bright green dye on my pillowcase and my hearing still wonky.\n\nIt took almost a week for me to flush everything out and for my hearing to go back to normal, and a couple more days for area around my ear canal to lose that bright green tinge.\n\nNow, Richard had a roommate that we'll call Jimmy.  I knew Jimmy.  Hell, Jimmy became my best friend during our college years, and Jimmy knew what Richard had done to me and he wasn't too thrilled about it either.  Jimmy wanted to know if I wanted to get even.\n\nI wouldn't be posting this if I didn't say \"hell yes!\"\n\nStep 1:  go to Wally World, buy a shit load of those little confetti packets\n\nStep 2:  gain access to Richard's car\n\nStep 2 was easier than it sounded:  it was rare that Richard would sleep in his own dorm room on the weekends.  He usually ended up at his girlfriend's place or one of his friends' across campus, and he typically left his car keys behind.  Jimmy wanted to pull this off right before Thanksgiving break, but I suggested it would be better to wait until winter break.  Why?  Richard had a very **long** drive back home, enough so that he didn't bother going home over Thanksgiving break, opting to go with his girlfriend instead, but he would go home for winter break...  That, and the longer wait made Richard think I was over the whole \"temporary partially deaf thing\"  (Guess again sucker!)\n\nFinals week.  Richard is out partying with his buds.  Jimmy comes down to my end of the dorm with Richard's keys and a small toolbox.  I grab the confetti and we head out to track down Richard's car (a late 80s beater--this takes place in the late 90s).  I'll spare you the details of what happened next since: a) I don't know my way around cars enough beyond the basics, b) Jimmy did and then some, and c) I was the look out (I didn't see the point of this, since shenanigans were common as hell on campus).  It took a little doing, but we left with empty confetti bags and Richard's A/C fans cranked to as high as they would go.  Jimmy put the keys back like nothing had happened and Richard was none the wiser.\n\nJimmy headed back home the next morning, and I left campus that afternoon.  Richard didn't leave until the following morning.  I wish I could've seen his reaction when he started up his car and had gotten a face-full of confetti.  His A/C was *still* spitting out the random confetti dot months later...\n\ntl;dr: Car A/C vents and confetti:  the revenge that keeps on giving.\n\nedit: forgot I and s",

But in the Matrix, we do infuse almost everything with green, so even what you see as white on the screen has been through a green dye bath. If you look at our white shirts, or our grays, they’ve all had a green wash. Often you can’t tell how they’re going to grade the film in the end, so you have to give yourself a little bit of a back up, and make a decision to do things like that so there’ll always be a tinge of green. Owen and I would go to Bill and say, “This green, this green, or this green? We think this green.” And then Bill has to think ahead six months or a year, “When I’m grading this film, which green is going to be the one?” Hopefully we all choose the right one.",

    "body": "Chapter Two: Supply\n\n“Why’d he send you to Supply? Don’t most Manteds wanna join Patrol or Security?” The Human wiggled between a large Pireon and an Elees, neither of whom gave it a second glance. They did look at her, but she lifted her thorax and held her head still as she strode forward.\n\nThe Human waited for her at the lift, then said, “You’re gonna have to move faster if you want to stay on the Penny.”\n\n“The what?” Khemen wished she hadn’t spoken as soon as the words left her mouth.\n\n“The *Penny*.” The Human stared at her, then moved its shoulders and said, “The *Copper Expansion?* The ship you’re on?” It looked at her, then gusted air from its face. “Whatever. Supply.” The final word was said in a different tone, and the lift began to move.\n\nThe lift fell smoothly down for long enough that Khemen began to think that it was broken, but then the doors slid open and the Human surged past her and out. She followed it slowly.\n\nThe lift opened directly into Supply, which was a large room, with a heavy desk curving around the central area. Many doors and openings led away through the outer wall of the space into other areas and Khemen hoped she wouldn’t have to learn the warren immediately. She knew her home warren, and that of her only two friends, but had become hopelessly lost in her first year at the school she’d been sent to after her final pupal molt.\n\n“Jonesy,” the Human was saying. “I talked to the Chief. He says we can have the afternoon crew for unloading the shipment for the Arcade.”\n\nJonesy was a Yagnoth, and unusually tall. His walking tentacles held him up well over the countertop, and he had wider shoulders than any other Yagnoth she’d seen. Right now, he peered down at the Human, two of his tentacles still working on whatever he’d been doing before he’d been interrupted. He blew air sharply through his air siphons. “The afternoon crew’s due to work on the incoming shipment of armament.”\n\n“Aww, that ship’s not due to dock for another two hours. We got time.”\n\nJonesy’s gripping arm picked up a paper and shoved it into the Human’s chest. “Fill out the form and quit wasting my time.” He looked at Khemen over the Human’s shoulder. “I didn’t think they let sub-adults out of the nest.”\n\nThe Human’s eyes rolled in their sockets and Khemen shuddered. “I am not a nymph.” She stepped forward and presented her paperwork. “The Chief said I was to work in Supply.”\n\n“That green isn’t neo-adult,” Jonesy said, but he bent his eyes to her papers.\n\nKhemen twitched upward. “I am a neo-adult Chreobroter—” Her eyes fell on the green dye on her arms and she stopped. “I *am* a neo-adult.”\n\nJonesy riffled her papers and then dropped them on the counter. “Supply. Why’d that old goat put you here?”\n\nThe Human raised his head, but Jonesy just slammed the closest tentacle to him down on the counter.\n\n“No one asked you, pest,” he said. For some reason, this made the Human bare his teeth, and Khemen hoped there wouldn’t be a fight the day she started.\n\n“All right,” Jonesy said, after watching her. “Sure. I’ve always wanted to see just how much I can get out of one of you Manteds. Let’s go. Do you have belongings? A berth? Anything other than—” He picked up her papers and waved them in her direction. “This set of clearly falsified junk?”\n\nKhemen didn’t know what to say. Her papers weren’t false, exactly, but…\n\nAt her silence, he blew through his siphons again and sank slightly lower. He and the Human exchanged a glance that Khemen couldn’t interpret. “Your name’s Khementec al-Hirea. Do you need us to say the whole thing, or is there another version that works?”\n\n“Khemen?”\n\n“Khemen it is. Now. Standard crew berthings are down that hallway,” he pointed to the side and she stared worriedly at the three possible options, “and then the mess is along there.” Another tentacle pointed in a different direction and she spun to see what pile of detritus he was assigning her to clean. There were two doors, both sparkling clean.\n\n“I’m sorry, your—Jonesy, I do not see the debris which I am to be working on.”\n\nThe Human made a sharp sound and shoved its papers across the desk at Jonesy. “You’ve got your work cut out for you here,” it said.\n\n“Get out of my sight.” Jonesy shoved the Human’s papers under the desk without looking at them. “And I wanna know the moment they set up the cotton candy machine, you hear me?”\n\nThe Human, already halfway through a random door, waggled an arm at him and didn’t answer.\n\nKhemen tried to keep her eyes front and center, the way the Matriarch had drilled into her, but she couldn’t keep her fovea from shifting around at the increasingly worrying silence from her new instructor. Finally, she allowed them to focus on him.\n\nHe was gazing back at her, something unexpectedly patient-looking in his demeanor. “I don’t know what you’re running from, kid,” he said, “but the Penny’s a safe enough place for you to finish your growing up. You’re, what? On your Adulthood Ceremony?”\n\nShe twitched slightly and the small papillae on his head rippled. “Well, that’s just fine. Now. You’ll need a berth and then something to eat. I remember when my paralarvae were going through their final eclosion. I didn’t think we could keep enough food in the nest for them all.”\n\nHe waited, but she didn’t know what to say. She was hungry, but it wasn’t her place to ask for a meal. She hadn’t done any work yet.\n\n“Look over there,” he said, one tentacle pointing to where he’d said the berths were. “There are labels on the tops of each door. al-Adosket set them up. Just follow the ones to berthing group 35-QIX and tell them that you’re a new hire in Supply and they’re to give you the standard uniform set and a bed in a triple berth.” He looked at her and she nodded. “Then come back here and I’ll send you on to the mess.”\n\nShe lifted her thorax and aligned her arms, then started toward the door, which she could see, now that she was actively focusing on it, had a perfectly clear notation in Manoteda.\n\nAs she passed him, Jonesy said, “And welcome to the Penny, kid.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n[First Chapter](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/oj10m9/pack_bond/)",

Violin of Silence: This violin is made of a very expensive wood and has a horse hair bow string. The violin makes no sound, not even when dropped or smashed.\n\n2. Blindfold of Sight: A black cloth blindfold that when attuned to allows the wearer to have an extra 30 feet of darkvision while their eyes are covered by it.\n\n3. Necklace of Repulsion: An ornate silver necklace that once attuned to forces the creature to make an intelligence saving throw of 19. On a failed save they feel an intense urge to unattune to the necklace.\n\n 4. Ghostly Dice: A pair of red six sided die that once rolled continue to roll until something stops them.\n\n5. Torriens Ring: A blue ring that once attuned to changes color to be either red or green.\n\n6. Mirror of The Ghast: A large mirror that does not show the reflection of living creatures. The effects of this mirror do not work on creatures who are immune to poison or are elven.\n\n7. Prototype Swords of Vision: A collection of swords ranging from greatswords to rapiers that once attuned to allows the creature to be colorblind for an hour. This ability can be used once per long rest.\n\n8. Zeki’s Box of Water: A rusty copper box with small dents scattered around it. The box is always full of illusionary water. When the water hits an object other than the box it disappears.\n\n9. Book of Reading: A large tome with a velvet cover.

Jumpsuit of Teleportation: This stylish, full-body jumpsuit can only be activated when worn by itself due to weight limitations. When activated, the suit will be teleported to the desired location, but not the character wearing it.\n\n15. Journal of Stubbornness: A small empty journal that looks completely normal to everyday people except the pages cannot be written in.\n\n16. Crown of Arcane Harmony: A golden crown with many colorful and expensive jewels on it. once attuned to the crown, a creature has learned to master the process of attunement. The maximum ammount of magic item it can attune to is increased by one.\n\n17. Bagpipes of Invisibility: For as long as you play these bagpipes, you are invisible. You are, however, incredibly audible even when in magical silence.\n\n18. Weather Detecting Stone: A small flat stone perfect for skipping across a pond. If this stone is wet, it is raining.

Ring of Invisibleness: A platinum band ring. The ring is invisible when worn.\n\n21. The Compass of The North: This copper compass points towards whatever you tell it to find, as long as it is north of you. When it is not in use or cannot find an object due to it not being north of the compass, the compass defaults to pointing north.\n\n22. Oversized Cloak: A black cloak with giant runes transcribed inside of it. When attuned, the cloak resizes to your form, though slightly too large.\n\n23. Skeleton Repellent: A clear perfume bottle with cleanish yellow liquid that contains 1d4 uses. This spray on works on the creature that uses it. A spray from this can forces the user's skeleton to escape into the ethereal plane for 1d6 hours. During this time, the creature can still breath, speak, and drink as normal. However, the creature's movement is reduced to 0 and cannot make a melee attack or cast a spell that requires movement. If this spray is used on a creature other than the one spraying it, it has no effect.\n\n24.

Any creatures of animal intelligence or less that are put in the bag will stay in close proximity to each other while in the bag (stay in a herd.). The bag does not have an extra dimensional space, so the limitations to what may be placed in this bag are quite small.  Further, the bag only holds its normal amount of air and must remain open for creatures inside to breathe.  The herding function does not stop the creatures from leaving the bag, it simply means they will leave all at one time.\n\nHammer of efficient lock picking: when struck forcefully against a simple lock of standard materials for an hour, the lock will magically break apart.  Generally, the lock is broken long before the function triggers.\n\nSpectral glove of digging: upon command, this glove turns into a ghostly semi corporeal hand.  Sadly, it’s only function it will obey is to pick the wearer’s nose.  There is a 50% chance if another character gives consent it will obey the wearer’s command to pick another person’s nose.  When finished it’s excavations, the gloved returns to the wearer’s hand complete with the residue it has unearthed.\n\nCodpiece of announcement: when worn upon the groin, the codpiece shrinks to the tightest possible comfortable fit upon the wearer’s genitalia.  Considered to be a bold fashion statement in some circles.  Interestingly it works on creatures with vastly different types of genitalia, it simply gives different outlines as is appropriate.  10% of the time these malfunction and shrink a bit too snugly causing the wearer’s to take 1-2 points of sundial damage and, if the genitalia is known For being sensitive, make a constitution save against nausea.\n\nHorseshoe of steadiness: a strange item as it does not work on horses.  When shod upon a cow, however, it will not allow the cow to be tipped over involuntarily.\n\nHorseshoes of speed: these miraculous but very heavy horseshoes increase the wearer’s base movement by five feet.  Sadly, they only work when nailed into the feet of a humanoid creature who does not naturally have hooves or similar feet — it must be nailed into the humanoid’s bare feet.  In addition to the crippling hindrance and the bleeding, the shoes add an encumbrance penalty.\n\nCrystal wine glass of returning: when thrown, this delicate and intricate wineglass will return to the holders hand by the end of the round after being thrown.  Sadly, the glass is extraordinarily fragile and even a strike against the lightest surface could shatter it, with unfortunate consequences upon returning if the thrower is not wearing gauntlets.  There is a 50% chance that even when violently thrown, if the glass does not shatter that any fluid in the glass will remain when the glass returns.\n\nItems of fragility: these items look like normal doors, barstools, cauldrons, weapons, tools, or the like.  When struck with any force or when bearing even the slightest weight, the items collapses into dust.  Often purchased by practical jokers or occasionally someone with a low strength score trying to impress a possible romantic interest with their “might.”\n\nHammer of singing: when this xylophone hammer strikes any key on a xylophone, the sound emanates from the hammer and not the xylophone.\n\nComb of the Frostmaiden: Despite it’s name, any gender may wear this ornate almost tiara-like comb in their hair.  When donned, the comb grants the character the ability to shed dandruff once per round.",

        "body": "It's my time to shine! *Opens file literally called Shitty Magic Items.doc*\n\n**Recanter of Infinite Water**: Contains a one-way portal to the Elemental Plane of Water, but it goes in the wrong direction. Water and other fluids can be poured into the Recanter in unlimited quantities, but cannot come back out. Solid objects treat it as a normal jug, and the inside is bone-dry to the touch.\n\n**Ring of Later Breathing**: After donning this ring, the wearer doesn't need to breathe for up to one hour. At the end of one hour, or when the ring is removed, the wearer must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they are stunned for a number of rounds equal to the number of minutes they wore the ring, as they suddenly need to catch up on all the breathing they missed. On a success, they are stunned for one round.\n\n**Ring of Water Beating**: While wearing this ring, creatures made of water do not have resistance against the wearer's physical attacks, and fighting underwater doesn't impose disadvantage.\n\n**Ring of Air Breathing**: The wearer gains the ability to breathe air.\n\n**Scroll of Planar Enemy**: When this scroll is activated, it summons a powerful otherworldly entity (celestial, fiend, fey, or elemental) which has a deadly vendetta against the caster. The entity may attempt to immediately kill the caster, thwart the caster's plans or goals, or harm the caster's allies and loved ones. This vendetta continues until the caster is dead, or the entity is defeated or sent back to its home plane.\n\n**Scroll of Page Armor**: When this scroll is activated, the caster becomes entirely immune to papercuts, dry rot, and having to carry documents for legislators.\n\n**Third Arm**: Permanently attaches an extra arm to the user, which can only be removed by chopping it off (or other severe physical trauma that could remove a limb). The additional hand can be used for spellcasting or any other effects that require a free hand. Note that most appearance-altering magic cannot change the basic arrangement of limbs.\n\n**Ring of Warning**: The ring sometimes glows bright blue, at intervals with no discernible pattern or cause. When it is glowing, it has the effect of the light cantrip.\n\n**Magic Compass**: A thick, heavy, golden compass whose needle sometimes moves erratically and sometimes points in a particular direction. When used as an improvised weapon, it deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage, which counts as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance to nonmagical damage.\n\n**Magic Compass and Straightedge**: A large set of ornate calipers and a long, straight silver rod. They can be used in tandem to construct faintly glowing geometric shapes in the air and on surfaces, which must fit within a 5ft square and last for 30 seconds. These shapes can be moved and interacted with like physical objects.\n\n**Sentient Bread**: Sentient magical artifact. INT: 8 (-1), WIS: 7 (-2), CHA: 11 (0), Chaotic Neutral. A loaf of bread containing the soul of “Jerry”. The loaf has blindsense to a range of 10ft and can communicate telepathically with any creatures within 30ft. The loaf desperately wants to be vored, and will constantly ask any creatures nearby to eat it. If they refuse to do so, it will attempt to take control of them compel them to do so.\n\n**Iron Boots**: Heavy iron boots that cause the wearer to rapidly sink to the bottom of any body of water, at a rate of 120ft per round. The wearer's speed is halved.\n\n**Proximity Nines**: When one of these mines is activated, the result of any roll on a die capable of rolling a 9 (d10s, d12s, and d20s) is a 9. This effect lasts for one hour or until deactivated as an action, and affects all rolls made within 30ft of the mine. Once a mine has been activated, it loses its charge and cannot be used again.\n\n**Bag of Golding**: Any item placed inside the bag is instantly turned into solid gold. It reverts to its original form immediately when it is removed.\n\n**Bag of Molding**: Any item placed inside the bag instantly rots and grows mold and fungus.\n\n**Bag of Folding**: A moderately-large satchel which can be folded down to the size of a postage stamp, regardless of its contents.\n\n**Scroll of Resonant Whispers**: The caster selects one target within 60ft. The target hears pleasant voices whispering compliments and humming melodies. They regain 1d4 hit points. A deafened creature is immune to this effect.\n\n**Glass Sword**: +3 magic shortsword (1d6 piercing) with a blade made of glass. The blade has 12 hit points, and takes any damage it deals. When it reaches 0 hit points, or if it takes more than 8 points of damage at once, it shatters and is no longer usable. If the mending cantrip is used on it, it regains 1d4 hit points. It cannot regain hit points again in this way until the next dawn.\n\n**Boots of Lava Walking**: Grants the wearer the ability to walk on the surface of lava. Provides no protection from heat.\n\n**Boots of Sticking**: When a command word is spoken, these boots latch onto whatever surface they are touching and cannot be dislodged until the command word is spoken again.\n\n**Boots of Levitation**: Cause the wearer to hover half an inch above whatever surface they are standing on.\n\n**Mantle of Visibility**: This brightly-colored mantle grants its user a -5 penalty on Stealth checks, and a +1 bonus to Charisma.\n\n**Chainmail Bikini**: Approximately 1 square foot of finely-woven chainmail, designed to be worn as a bikini. AC equals 12 + DEX as long as they are not wearing any other clothes.",

I just wish the music was getting the praise it deserved. \n\nCase in point, when this sub did the “Eliminate the song” thread and ended up picking the two songs that were released as singles as the two best songs on the album, and so many people also saying “I didn’t even know these were released as singles” I’m was like ahhhh!!

Whether people knew it or not, she’s been at the forefront of what’s driving  pop music for at least a decade.

That’s what’s really surprised me. It’s a monster that’s gotten even bigger than her lol. It’s a double edged sword because memes burn hot and fast and eventually people move on. But so does Charli - idk what she’s gonna do next but I’d be surprised to see her chasing this same sort of moment she’s having now. This is for sure giving her a ton of very deserved new fans and opening up her audience  but at the end of the day it’s the people who have been here for years that will always be with her in the future no matter what direction she’s gonna go next.  Not sure everyone who is just jumping on board for brat will as well. \nALSO on a less serious note, I do love the smug satisfaction of knowing I’ve been saying she was the best for yearssss and people finally admitting I was right. 😇",

I just wish the music was getting the praise it deserved. \n\nIt's much easier to commit to the puke green partygirl aesthetic than listen to even 40 minutes worth of autotuned vocals and abrasive club beats. Like, I knew so many people both in real life and online who listened to the first few tracks and called it a day. \n\nBut what matters most to me, and I assume for Charli as well, is her ability to challenge the mainstream whilst capturing the cultural zeitgeist in one fell swoop. Dua wanted so desperately to play the role of the effortless cool girl, but she doesn't have the street cred, the creativity, or the personality to carry out her vision. Despite imbuing her album with strong political messages, Beyonce was not Kamala's first source of inspiration for her upcoming campaign. Taylor worked incredibly hard to market her latest album, but it's reaching nowhere near the virality and exposure as 'brat summer'. I swear, no one outside her fanbase is streaming the album. Like Charli, Ariana tapped into her vulnerabilities, but how does one root for the underdog when she's actively pulling families apart? Chappell Roan has also adopted a quirky, sleazy aesthetic, but Charli is not afraid to fully commit to an experimental sound.\n\nI could go on, but Charli's slow rise to prominence is disrupting the status quo. It's forcing pop stars, labels, and executives to reconsider what it means to produce successful music both commercially and artistically. While I do agree with Anthony Fantano that pop music is sounding better than ever, it's at the expense of utilizing these amazing producers and songwriters to playlist songs with great technique but no soul. Like Charli once mentioned in an interview on the subway, good artists make great music. But great artists create a world that is inscapable to even the most skeptical listeners. And so, while critical acclaim is nice and all, a brilliant artist will make art that supercedes all institutions and forces the nonlistener to grapple with their identity. Whether you like, love, hate, or feel ambivalent about BRAT, you WILL have a brat summer by embracing the most wretched aesthetic. Those neon green cupcakes will perhaps inspire you to reflect upon your inner brat by accepting that not everything about us is beautiful, clean, or ideal, but is nevertheless worth celebrating even in a society that demands absolute perfection.",

Also after seeing her grapple with her place in the music industry as a cult classic but not a major pop star - I'm glad she's getting this type of success on an album that seems so authentic to her, rather than her getting it on an album like crash or sucker. I wouldn't say that crash and sucker aren't authentically her tho- because they are, just in a different and maybe more contrived way? \n\nOverall, it feels very surreal seeing mainstream news outlets talking about the brat summer role in a presidential election.

Some fans will discover her and only like her mainstream-aligned songs, some others will enjoy everything including what we would call her experimental side, but it’s obvious now that for Charli (and SOPHIE, Björk, David Bowie, Lou Reed, Radiohead, etc) it’s all experimental / boundary pushing, it’s just that sometimes it aligns with where popular culture currently finds itself.",

I think a lot of this skepticism comes from people who've never used it, so I wanted to demonstrate it's power. Note: Everything in this post took less than five minutes to generate.\n\nHere's my initial prompt: \"Could you generated six unique, creative and innovated campaign ideas for marketing a new dog grooming business?\"\n\nThe ChatGPT response:\n\n1. Partner with local dog shelters and offer discounted grooming services to newly adopted dogs. This will not only help promote your business, but also give back to the community and support a good cause.\n\n2. Host a \"puppy pampering\" event at your grooming salon, where potential customers can bring their dogs in for a free mini-grooming session and learn more about your services.\n\n3. Offer a loyalty program where regular customers can earn rewards and discounts on grooming services. This will encourage repeat business and help build a loyal customer base.\n\n4. Create a referral program where current customers can refer friends and family to your business in exchange for discounts or free services.\n\n5. Collaborate with local pet stores and offer a \"bundle deal\" where customers can purchase grooming services and pet supplies at a discounted price.\n\n6. Host a \"doggy fashion show\" event, showcasing the before and after grooming transformations of your customers' dogs. This will not only be a fun and unique event, but also a great opportunity to showcase your skills and the quality of your grooming services.\n\nHere's a follow-up refinement: \"Could you tailor the campaigns for St. Patrick's Day promotions?\"\n\nThe ChatGPT response:\n\nSure! Here are six unique, creative, and innovative campaign ideas for marketing a new dog grooming business with a St. Patrick's Day theme:\n\n1. Offer a \"Lucky Dog\" package, which includes a full grooming service and a special St. Patrick's Day-themed accessory (such as a green bandana or bowtie).\n\n2. Host a \"St. Paws Day\" parade where customers can bring their dogs in costume and participate in a march around the neighborhood. Offer a discount on grooming services to all participants.\n\n3. Create a \"Pot of Gold\" referral program, where current customers can refer friends and family to your business in exchange for discounts or free services. For every successful referral, customers can \"find\" a virtual gold coin and redeem it for prizes or discounts.\n\n4. Collaborate with a local Irish pub and offer a \"Pint and a Groom\" package, where customers can enjoy a drink at the pub while their dog gets pampered at your salon.\n\n5. Host a St. Patrick's Day-themed doggy photo shoot, where customers can have professional photos taken of their dogs in festive costumes or against a green background. Offer a discount on grooming services to all participants.\n\n6. Offer a special St. Patrick's Day-themed grooming service, which includes a shamrock-shaped haircut or a green dye job. This will be a unique and memorable offering for customers looking to celebrate the holiday with their pets.\n\nAnother follow-up prompt: \"Could you generate six taglines to go with the campaigns?\"\n\n1. \"Lucky dogs get pampered at [Business Name]\"\n\n2. \"Celebrate St. Paws Day with [Business Name]\"\n\n3. \"Get your pot of gold at [Business Name] with our referral program\"\n\n4. \"Pint and a groom - the perfect St. Patrick's Day combo\"\n\n5. \"Get your dog in the St. Patrick's Day spirit with our festive grooming services\"\n\n6. \"Find your luck at [Business Name] with our St. Patrick's Day specials\"\n\nAnd one final prompt: \"Awesome. How about something even more creative, with metaphor and in six words or less each?\"\n\nThe ChatGPT response:\n\nSure! Here are six creative taglines, using metaphor and six words or less, for a new dog grooming business:\n\n1. \"Groomed to perfection, like a four-legged leprechaun\"\n\n2. \"Fur-tastic transformations at the end of the rainbow\"\n\n3. \"Where every dog is a pot of gold\"\n\n4. \"Your dog's mane-tenance headquarters\"\n\n5. \"Polished pooches, every time\"\n\n6. \"Bark less, wag more with a grooming from us\"\n\nNote: I just put \"six\" for simplicity's sake, but you could put as many ideas as you want it to generate. You can also refine prompts endlessly; this was just a quick demonstration. ChatGPT is an AMAZING tool, for ideation of nothing else.",

I 100% urge anyone to just sign up and start talking to it! \n\nI started using it last week and I was so tickled when it referenced a previous question I asked  — in the NEW RESPONSE it gave me. (amateur, I know) \n\nI also asked, “I’m considering naming my company Property Pride. My company offers … located in…. targeting…  customers. What other ideas do you have?”\n\nI was SO shocked when it gave me a list of 20 names that “convey pride in one’s property.” This is when I realized this is much more sophisticated than any AI I had imagined and SO much easier than \n\n> ask Google a question > comb thru multiple search results > form my own coherent conclusions… maybe. \n\nI’ve since been talking to ChatGPT instead of going straight to Google. Searching for synonyms or coming up with my names, titles, etc. is so not fun with Google (or even using thesaurus dot com) because there’s no context ever transferred (no matter how long your questions are). \n\nChatGPT is excellent for helping to get your creative juices flowing by brainstorming & genuinely contributing ideas that are contextual (like a human conversation would). \n\nIt did NOT pull Google Keyword data or Google Trend data. Lol But it DID direct me to the right place and offered a list of other tools / platforms I may want to research in order to obtain the data I’m looking for. Even when the answers aren’t “the” answers, it still offers valuable, contextual insight. Kinda feels like a half decent assistant that helps me stay moving rather than hitting mental walls. 🤷🏼‍♀️ \n\nIt also helped me understand/ brainstorm ways I could personally use ChatGPT and integrate it with other tools to do certain tasks. I literally just asked it what it’s ideal uses are. What tools can be integrated to make a ___ business owner’s life easier? \nWhich of those tools are most newbie friendly? \nEtc etc \n\nThis opened me up to the power of training customer service chat bots— that get smarter over time & learn your tone / brand’s language. \nI imagined it would be clunky, like Facebook ads that show users 3 pre-loaded questions & delivering whatever predetermined response, but I was wrong. \n\nI don’t want to bore you but I could keep going. ☺️ I’m not using it anywhere it’s max capacity and it was still so helpful in initiating creative ideas, like OP so beautifully demonstrated, as well as keeping the process alive without me running out of ideas on where to go next). That alone could help all types of marketers. \n\nDon’t let the “ChatGPT is replacing 90% of us by next year” hysteria turn you away. I don’t even want it to write FOR me. It just helps me think faster and cover more ground than I would without it. 👍\n\nNow I have more ideas for questions to ask it, thanks OP",

Held to a strong light, it looks translucent.\n\nThen I realised that the edge felt tacky to touch, and that the green dye had come off onto my fingers! The surface was similarly slightly sticky too.\n\nI gave it a wipe with a damp cloth and the dye came off onto that too, and after leaving to air for an hour the record seemed to be dry. I wouldn't risk playing it though 😬.\n\nHas anyone had this with very old (64 years!) coloured vinyl? Is this maybe the result of it being stored in inappropriate conditions?\n\nIt is this one: \nhttps://www.discogs.com/release/8188674\nNope that in the images it looks closer to turquoise, quite different to mine.",

Probably has something in it that deteriorates like rubbery plastic.\n\nSome things I've observed:\n\n1. I've NEVER seen any other coloured vinyl records commercially released in the UK in the early 1960s or before, except for reddish-orange Gala Goldentone 6\" 78 rpm records (England's version of Little Golden Records), which were styrene, not vinyl.\n2. Coloured vinyl records were common in America. RCA Victor launched the 45 rpm format in 1949 with striking \"colour-coded\" records, each colour denoting a different genre.\n3. The *only* American-made record I've known to change colour is the original 1972 promo pressing of Todd Rundgren's *Something/Anything?*. The first disc is transparent red. The second disc was originally a transparent blue, but on many copies the blue has turned either dark green, purple or COMPLETELY opaque black, indicating a chemical reaction in the dye. But I've seen no reports of the sticky degradation you mention here.\n4. I have a handful of American and Canadian-made coloured records from the 1949 to the mid-1960s (including said RCA Victor coloured 45s). None of them have deteriorated in the same way. I've certainly experienced nothing like this on any coloured record pressed like this thereafter from any country.\n5. British vinyl formulations were somewhat different than American vinyl formulations. Anyone who collects original British Parlophone and Apple Beatles records might be able to sense this. Whatever they were using at EMI Hayes seemed to wear easier than others, but not THE easiest in my experience.\n\nFrom all this I can surmise, perhaps the pressing plants in England at the time (1960) didn't yet have access to the formulations/dyes American pressing plants were using, so they had to make a compromise not knowing much about the chemical reactions of the materials.",

    "body": "For a while now, I have wanted data on what percent of players have each slot in the collection log filled. I wanted to see which slots were the most common and most rare, as well as find the most common slots that I personally haven't filled yet to get me ideas on what to work on.\n\nIn order to get this data, I used the API at [collectionlog.net](https://collectionlog.net). I essentially downloaded the entire site. (To the site admins who may have wondered why a single IP was making so many API requests: I'm sorry and I won't do it again for a long time. Or ever, if you would prefer that. Promise!)\n\nFor a player to be listed on the website, they must have installed the in-game Collection Log plugin. At the time I obtained the data, there were 49,719 players listed on the website. However, a player's collection log data is only updated when they open their own in-game collection log and go to pages where they have unlocked new slots. If a player installs the plugin but never goes through and clicks on all the pages, their online data will be incomplete. For example, if someone installs the plugin, opens their collection log, and closes it without clicking on all the pages, their online data will only include slots for the very first category: Abyssal Sire.\n\nI only wanted my data to include users who had a near-complete set of online data. Including duplicates, an up-to-date log contains 1603 fillable slots. For my data, I chose to include a cutoff of 1500 slots, where if a player's online log contained less than 1500 fillable slots, I determined that their data was not complete, and I didn't include it. This left a total of 22,094 players.\n\n[Here is a link to the data.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PzvZM2pa144rN7hUQ2LEMBZKFapbq-Yycy2hM_-qawQ)\n\nThe most common slots to have filled are what you would expect: Long bone (97%), Mark of grace (96%), Hespori seed (95%), Dark totem pieces (91-94%), Ancient shard (94%), full Graceful (92-93%), Purple sweets (93%), Xeric's talisman (93%), Defenders (92%), etc. The rarest items are also what you would expect: Raids capes, LMS capes, and 3rd age items (all less than 0.7%). The rarest single item is the 2000 ToA KC cape, with just 3/22094 people (0.014%) having it. The rarest item that isn't in one of those 3 categories is the Dragon metal slice (0.96%) from Adamant dragons.\n\nI also looked at the results for some high-profile cloggers. The Rank #1 clogger, Bazilijus, is only missing 1 item that more than 10% of the users with online data have obtained: the Elidinis' ward (25%). After that, the only items they have left are the Stale baguette (8.9%), Inquisitor's mace (3.1%), 7 Raids capes, 20 misc. clue items, 10 Gilded items, and 21 3rd age items. The most common clue item they have left is the BGS ornament kit (6.6%).\n\nThe Youtuber [GuidesForUsAll](https://www.youtube.com/@GuidesForUsAll) has a very good long-running collection log series. The most common items he doesn't have yet are the Tome of fire (47%), Dex scroll (42%), Arcane scroll (42%), Enhanced weapon seed (32%), DWH (32%), Saradomin platebody (29%), Robin hood hat (29%), Tarnished locket (27%), Heavy frame (27%), Abyssal green dye (26%), and Dragonbone necklace (26%). After that, it's a bunch of Raids uniques. Gotta get raiding Shelby!\n\nEDIT: As many people have correctly pointed out, this data only includes players who are motivated enough to install the plugin and keep their online data relatively up-to-date. This is not a representative sample of all players.\n\nEDIT 2: I just added data for different account types. Many people theorized that the reason the Enhanced crystal weapon seed was relatively commonly obtained was because of ironmen. ~~However I found that mains had this item 31% of the time while ironmen had it 38%, which isn't that big of a difference.~~\n\nEDIT 3: There was an error with the account type-specific data. The enhanced crystal weapon seed does actually show a massive disparity between mains (18%) and irons (59%). Other items with large differences between mains and irons are MTA uniques, Uncharged trident, DWH, Pharaoh's spectre, Basilisk jaw, and Barrows items.",

    "body": "Hey everyone!\n\nFirst off: Firesong, I know you are here. Look away.\n\n\n----------------------------\n\nOne of the PCs in our current playthrough of Call from the Deep is a chef, and they love catching and preparing new species of fish. In the first few sessions I came up with stuff on the spot, but now I have taken the time to write some down. The regions are Swordcoast specific, but I mean, this is a free resource, what do you want me to say? Take it or leave it! ;)\n\nAlso, here's the thing. Writing kinda creative, slightly funny descriptions for 50 species of fish is actually a lot of work. I got to 21 and while I think I have a lot more in me with time, why don't you shoot me (or us, because I will be updating this post) some descriptions? Try it, I often start just typing a word without knowing how the sentence ends. It's fun. This also applies to DMing by the way. \n\nAnyway, here's the list!\n\n--------------------------------\nEDIT// Thanks for all the awesome suggestions! Some fish were so popular that they got multiple descriptions, so I will probably add some more fish and use those descriptions. If you are interested, look out for this table with more fish in /r/d100 or maybe /r/DnDBehindTheScreen soon. Maybe we can get it to 100 entries! =) \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n|+|A|B|C|D|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Name|Rarity|Region|Description|\n|2|Bluetail Trout|Common|anywhere|Whatever image of a fish you have in your head, that's this fish, except with a blue tint.|\n|3|Feltknuckle|Common|anywhere|A small fish around 30cm long as an adult, with unusually soft, almost satin-like scales.|\n|4|Green Goober|Common|anywhere|Around a meter long, and very wide like a big sausage. Bumps on the whole body. Greenish-brown with an ugly face, this fish is not pretty, but fried - NOT COOKED! - it is a true treat.|\n|5|Pike|Common|anywhere|around half a meter long, slender and quick. Puts up a fight when you try to catch it.|\n|6|Ghostsod|Rare|Deep Ocean|A large fish around a meter long, this one is ghostly white and phases out and back into the Material Plane when in danger. Catching this one is only possible with an anti-magic fishing hook. The reward for the effort is an exotic meal, the flesh so soft it almost seems immaterial.|\n|7|Waxer|Common|anywhere|Around 20cm, small and spindly. Off-white color. Chewy when cooked.|\n|8|Redbrock Brookling|Common|anywhere|A tiny fish primarily caught in rivers, the red-to-grey gradient on this small guy inspired his name.|\n|9|Brownspeckled Spur|Common|anywhere|Ghastly white with brown speckles, this meter long fish has a very slow metabolism. A fully grown specimen therefore is usually between 20 and 30 years old.|\n|10|Red Rocks Swistler|Common|On the Sword Coast between Neverwinter and Waterdeep|Can a fish be described as \"tall\"? If so, the Red Rocks Swistler is tall, in the sense that it is long, thin. Explodes violently when fried, so needs to be cooked.|\n|11|Thawling|Common|anywhere|A unusally stiff fish. Fresh out of the water it can be used as a blunt weapon, but once cooked or fried the meat is very tasty.|\n|12|Gerstepel|Common|anywhere|An ordinary 30cm long, ordinary green scales, ordinary taste. Better not eat this one though, extraordinarily poisonous.|\n|13|Stippled Stick|Common|anywhere|Thin, long and round like a stick, this brown little fellow has carved an evolutionary niche by looking like a stick, and unfortunately also tasting like one.|\n|14|Geppard Trout|Common|anywhere|This is just a trout with a cool name.|\n|15|Moonshae Pike|Common|Moonshae Islands|This particular variant of pike can only be found around the Moonshae Islands. It's great taste makes it a sought-after export and Moonshae Pike can be found in Inns and Taverns all across the Sword Coast.|\n|16|Swordshark|Rare|Deep Ocean|Roll Initiative! You don't wanna catch this one, if you manage to pull this one up to the surface, only half the battle is won. Now you gotta fight a literal shark with fins sharp as sword in the water, because you won't get it onto your boat while it is conscious.|\n|17|Baldur Rockling|Common|Along the Swordcoast|A small fish that hides between rocks and pebbles, camouflaged with grey-green patterns. Only found in shallow waters along the sword coast.|\n|18|Waterdhavian Flop|Common|Specific to the Waterdhavian Waters|Silver-Grey scales glisten in the sun when the Waterdhavian Flop flops on the deck of your ship after a successful fishing trip. While other fish flop in a similar manner, none do it with quite as much energy and zest for life as this one.|\n|19|Flying Ora|Common|anywhere|The Flying Ora is a golden carp-like fish that feeds on low-flying insects over the water.|\n|20|Leyling|Common|anywhere|The Leyling is ordinary in most things, except for its face which is unsettlingly expressive. Even dead, it will frown when you put it in the pan.|\n|21|Lopsided Orm|Rare|anywhere|A huge fish, this one can grow to a meter and a half. It's very short fins kinda make it wobble a lil' bit though, which got it its name.|\n|22|Cistern Snapper|Common|anywhere|So common I can't be arsed to write a proper description. It's a fish, what do you want me to say? Tastes fine, I guess. Nothing special.|\n|23|Blue Olfern|Common|anywhere|A sleek blue fish known for the intelligence. Their side fins split into a series smaller fins and tendrils not dissimilar to the branches of a fern tree. - prismatic_raze|\n|24|Calimshan Redfin|Common|Rare around the Dragonhead, more common further south towards Calimshan|A deceptive fish that almost always surprises the fisherman. When submerged in water, this fish appears to have dull coloration, but once caught and removed from the water, their bright crimson fins are revealed. The fins are often dried out as decorations or used to make dye. The meat is known to make a tasty jerky. - prismatic_raze|\n|25|Silkfang|Common|anywhere|An aggressive fish whose tail looks like a bundle of silk. They cover themselves using their tail before ambushing smaller fish with their 162 razor sharp teeth. This is always how many teeth they have, never more, never less. Folklore says that these fish adapted to disguising themselves this way because of the many ship wrecks that happened along the silk trade routes that they populate. - prismatic_raze|\n|26|Triboar Triton|Common|Deep Ocean|This massive plant-eating fish is known as a rare delicacy in the aristocracy. They dwell deep in the darkness of the sea and have have chitinous armor that grows out of their scales. The males of this species have three eyes while the females only have one. Many sages regard these creatures as a good omen, and they are often featured as messengers of the gods in ancient religious mythos. Their meat is known for its medicinal properties. - prismatic_raze|\n|27|Big Mesmer|Common|anywhere|The Big Mesmer is a sign that predatory fish such as sharks are near by. These fish share a symbiotic relationship with the predators of their ecosystems. By releasing a pheromone in the water, the Big Mesmer attracts small schools of fish and the lures them into the hunting grounds of larger carnivores. In exchange for luring in food, the predatory fish in the area leave the Big Mesmers alone and allow them to feed on the left over scraps. The pheromone is often harvested to be made into perfumes, potions, or a spell component for charm spells. - prismatic_raze|\n|28|Nelanther Sailfish|Common|anywhere|This fish is known to frequent windy areas and mainly feasts on bugs and tadpoles. Their dorsal fin is able to open into a sail-like appendage. During high winds, this allows the fish to become airborne over short distances. Often traveling in large groups, researchers speculate that these fish migrate across very large distances using their dorsal fins as sails in order to save their energy in case of an attack from a predator. These fish often follow behind vessels at sea in order to eat any bugs that stowed away and then fell off. - prismatic_raze|\n|29|Zephyr Fish|Rare|anywhere|These fish always migrate from the West to the East during winter and are known for their gentle nature. One odd characteristic is that these fish often will be attracted to shiny objects in the water and--if they're able--will carry these objects with them in their mouths. There are many sailors' tales about a lucky fisherman who caught a Zephyr fish that had a diamond or gold in its mouth. Treasure hunters at sea will often try to catch Zephyr to see if they've picked up treasure from shipwrecks that are rumored to be nearby. - prismatic_raze|\n|30|Armorhead Catfish|Common|anywhere| |\n|31|Variegated Lardfish|Common|anywhere|Although usually a verdant green, this oddly blubbery fish can appear in a variety of colours. Sought after by alchemists and some magic users, use of Detect Magic will reveal faint traces of conjuration magic. - Stryk3r123|\n|32|Crimson Tigerfish|Rare|anywhere|Blood red and characterized by a frilled spine and bulging eyes. The crimson tigerfish can and will aggressively snap and bite at its captor. Its meat is relatively tough. There is an ongoing debate on whether this fish in particular has health benefits. - Stryk3r123|\n|33|Nonstippled Stick|Common|anywhere| |\n|34|Cloudpeak Catfish|Common|anywhere|The white meat of the Cloudpeak Catfish has a spongy texture similar to lobster when cooked. Honestly, the connection from white, spongy meat to clouds is a stretch, but you gotta distinguish these fish somehow. - snowbo92|\n|35|Dragonhead Trout|Rare|Dragonhead|The sour expression and long whiskers make for an unmistakable visage. Used often in local cultural artwork. - Chaucer85|\n|36|Dragonfish|Common|anywhere|Broad fins and ridges have lead to this species other name, the Seamoth. Its natural toxins are too weak to kill larger predators, but favored among hunters for stunning prey. - Chaucer85|\n|37|Neon Tetra|Rare|anywhere|Characterized by it's bright green color with blue dots, this fish is a really tasty treat when salted and dried, but be careful to drain it well, because it's blood is slightly poisonous to humans, and can cause nausea and headaches. It is also popular among collectors, the vibrant colors of this species are famously depicted in the paintings of Ginso Tet. - CR9_Kraken_Fledgling & Chaucer85|\n|38|Ebonkoi|Common|anywhere|Getting its name from its deep purple colour, ebonkoi scales slightly irritate the skin when touched. Despite its putrid scent and repulsive taste, its meat is strangely invigorating. - Stryk3r123|\n|39|Sunblaze|Common|anywhere| |\n|40|Velen Cobbler|Common|anywhere| Velen Cobbler is a white fish with firm flesh and mild flavor. Good for making stews (\"cobbled\" together with other ingredients). - DurnansGhost|\n|41|Tarakas|Common|anywhere| |\n|42|Grey Chont|Common|anywhere| |\n|43|Trailing Harborfish|Common|anywhere| |\n|44|Hungerfish|Common|anywhere|The Hungerfish is long mouthed, bloated, brown and grey stappled, and covered in green growths. In other words it is a deeply ugly fish. When caught by anglers it is almost always immediately thrown back. The meat of a hungerfish tastes so bad that it can't even be used to bulk up pig slop. Only someone literally starving would be desperately hungry enough to eat one. - Sharpyred|\n|45|Striped Steelfish|Common|anywhere| |\n|46|True Ironfish|Common|anywhere|A long, eel-like fish native to the warmer waters south of the Moosnhae Islands, so named for their incredibly tough scales. Not only is its meat tasty, locals of the jungles use its scales for jewelry and sometimes even armor. - WamlytheGrabGod|\n|47|Reddish Bluefish|Common|anywhere| |\n|48|Brainling|Rare|anywhere|A remarkable fish with a strikingly oversized and bulbous forehead. Commonly kept as pets by rich folk, but they can be rather tasty if cooked, especially the meat of their heads. - WamlytheCrabDog|\n|49|Green Breadfish|Common|anywhere|About as appetizing as the moldy loaf of bread this brown and green fish resembles, the Green Breadfish is commonly found in marshy areas, swamps or wetlands. While the fish is inedible the scales, if carefully crushed, can be mixed to create a dark green dye. - DeadWrangler|\n|50|False Fingerling|Common|anywhere|Tiny, around 7-10 cm-s long when fully grown, and as thick as a human finger, with small fins. Usually greyish brown with a black streak on their back. In large batches, they make for a great soup. Can be differentiated from True Fingerlings by their blue tinted fins, and slightly earthier taste. - CR9_KRaken_Fledgling|\n|51|Granite Grebbler|Common|anywhere|This small, speckled grey fish is found in ravine and quarry lakes, or in slightly larger groups on rocky or cliffside coastal shores. While small, the fish are easily caught in a net and are quite tasty fried. A cheap, travelling favourite for coastal fishermen. - DeadWrangler|\n\n^Table ^formatting ^brought ^to ^you ^by ^[ExcelToReddit](https://xl2reddit.github.io/)",

Not only is its meat tasty, locals of the jungles use its scales for jewelry and sometimes even armor.\n\nNeon Tetra: An exceptionally small and vividly colored fish native to more tropical locales. Too small to make a proper meal of, but they make for entertaining pets, though they require much more swimming space than their tiny size lets on.\n\nEbonkoi: A fish that appears in areas corrupted by large amounts of evil magic, presumably mutated by said magic. The meat is foul and bitter, but that's not what makes these fish so valuable-their blood can be distilled into potions that temporarily vitalize one's muscles.\n\nDragonfish: A striking fish, so named for its large fins and elongated snout.

The skin is a deep green and will gain brownish spots on its underbelly as it ages. This species is blind, and feeds by locating food using its long \"whiskers\" to sense for plant matter, while its head features a very bony \"helmet\" to protect from direct impacts. While the head is largely inedible, the meat in the body tastes earthier than other fish.\n\n**33) Nonstippled Stick**\n\nThis very tiny fish, about the size of a human finger, can be found at the bottom of lakes. It hides among the biomatter that floats to the bottom, naturally camouflaged by its ruddy brown, featureless skin. While not a substantial source of meat, when cooked with the skin on they provide a satisfying crunch and go well on top of soups or stews. They can be differentiated from a false fingerling by the hard fin directly above their head.\n\n**39) Sunblaze**\n\nA small, striking fish with highly-reflective scales on its sides. While the primary goal of the scales is to blind and confuse potential predators, large schools of sunblazes will near the ocean surface early in the morning, reflecting the light of the sun and creating large, swirling patches of reflected light as they meet the sunrise. While the flesh is not immensely appealing, the scales are commonly used in jewelry and apparel.",

They publicly announced that the change was due to the green dye being needed for the war effort.

It’s why hair dressers consider this a color correction bc each shaft is missing chunks of the cuticle and to correct its via synthetic bonds (olaplex / k18) or hair filler. \n\nI would get a protein filler this will synthetically fill the gaps of missing puzzle pieces where your hair won’t come out splotchy then I do 5-6 you might be closer to level 6 but remember your ends are lighter so if you want level 6 use 5 on ur bleached ends. \n\nThe letter determines the under toned in the pigment. \n\nYou need either a neutral or an ash to cancel the red undertones from the pink.

Sides would have cactus texture but in grey or brown, without spines and it wouldn't hurt entities.\n\n**How produce them ?**\n\nI hesitated, I thought about using a campfire to dry them or use 2 cactus to craft a log, but I think have found the good idea. If we use bone meal on the cactus block at the bottom, it would turn it with 3-5 blocks above into logs. I know cactus grow only at 3 blocks high, but for 3-5 blocks above, it would concern cactus made by players. (I used Acacia logs on the picture to illustrate my idea)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/obz1ujpp964a1.png?width=1061&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae320a43689e9457c87bcaddc2a519b79a3979b3\n\n**Uses.**\n\n\\- Like every logs, it could be used to make grey planks , but one log would make only 2 planks blocks.\n\n\\- A full bark variant and a stripped variant would be availables. Stripped logs would have on sides a grey texture with holes. \n\n\\- Logs could be used to make charcoal, campfires, smokers, hanging signs, ...\n\n\\-Cactus wood could be used on desert villages to replace oak and jungle wood for fences, doors, buttons,...\n\n\\- Logs and variants could be used to plants and farm cactus like if it was on sand, but would have the advantage to not be subject to gravity. (Like jungle wood that can be used to farm cocoa).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6rq26axaa64a1.png?width=913&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b26512d3b752d7271329cd853ad397c67ef22a6\n\nNote : I know cactus wood in real life seem to be fragile and it could be weird to Imagine an house built with cactus, but woods in Minecraft could be used not only to build house, but to make furnitures, floors, ... and in a way, every blocks in Minecraft could be used to make an house while you place them on top of each other without any sense. Players should be free to play and build like they want, with a roleplay or not, with a logic or not, ...\n\n**Trapdoors and doors.**\n\nI'm sorry, I'm not good to make textures, but I Imaginated something like this picture found on the web. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dyi9634va64a1.png?width=359&format=png&auto=webp&s=94f55e65833f44fd1d474f11c820d257ad66a905\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cactus with arms.**\n\nI don't know how really it's called , ( arm, a branch, ...) but I think you know what I mean. Like chorus plant stems, we could place green cactus  on sides to make branchs. It couldn't grow naturally , but cactus like this could be found on deserts and badlands and could be completly young and green or with a old trunk, or it could be made manually by players. (I used melons on the picture to illustrate my idea because it's actually impossible to do this with cactus)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/opuojiuya64a1.png?width=995&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e6e81012846bc255bcf9b40ccc27ebbfb1f08f9\n\n**What about normal green cactus ?**\n\nDon't worry about this, nothing would change. It would still hurt entities,  be melted on furnaces to make green dye, be composted, grow up to 3 blocks (branches would have to be made  manually by players), ... so don't worry about your farms ;) .\n\n**In my opinion.**\n\n \\- I think it could make deserts more viable and give more diversity. \n\n \\- It could give a source of renewable wood but maybe more hard to exploit, that could give challenge for a desert only world, but at least, dead bushs could still be used to get sticks to save wood.\n\n \\- It would add an other special wood that don't come from a tree, like bamboo and nether fungus.\n\n \\- For peoples who would find illogic to have wood from cactus, I would like to say, please, it's a game, there  are many fictitious or unrealistic things in minecraft (for example, cocoa and jungle trees are differents species in real life, or oaks don't produces apples, so imagine it could be a fictitious species of cactus that produce hard wood),  but we love this game.\n\n \\- I don't see any reasons to disagree with this suggestion, but if it's the case, you are allowed , but at least, please let a comment to explain why.",

I Imaginated we could find stripped fallen cactus trunks under warm and lukewarm oceans, and sometime on beachs, rivers and temperate oceans. I know it could be weird to find a wood called \"cactus \" on these places, but I think the holed grey texture could be nice to imitate a driftwood and I can't imagine how we could make  renewable a normal dripwood with its own would colour.",

    "body": "I don't get near a pit bull on a retractable leash.\n\nRetractable leashes have two major flaws: they do not comply with most leash laws, and they are dangerous to people and dogs. Retractable leashes consist of a thin cord wound around a spring-loaded device housed inside a plastic handle. A dog on a 20-foot retractable leash has nearly unfettered freedom, defeating the primary purpose of a leash by permitting the dog to get far enough away that a situation can quickly turn dangerous. Additionally, the thin cord can break, tangle around the dog walker, or jerk the body of the dog walker when the cord is fully unwound. Furthermore, the spring-loaded mechanism has a tendency to malfunction over time, refusing to extend or retract, or unspooling at will. For these reasons, almost all of the leash laws in the United States require dog owners to use a physical leash under six feet in length.\n\nThe fact that retractable leashes are ubiquitous does not mean they are safe. Many of the things we see all the time are unsafe. Down through history, common items that were used all the time turned out to be unsafe, such as arsenic (used to make green dye), heroin (sold as a cough medicine by Bayer), asbestos (artificial snow around Christmas trees), and lead (added to gasoline).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o4067z75j3191.png?width=866&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfccdd15a169d6f61e6b4c1ad62fde175c07c8b2",

It’s also one of those products that you need to research, and that you want to spend the extra money to get a quality one (especially one that does not utilize those stupid thin cords). They’re also definitely not for *all* dogs. I do not see a problem using them with small dogs, elderly dogs that can barely move, and well-trained, completely under control dogs. And they should be used in the right setting. My retractable leash is also **not** one of those thin cords … those types are absolutely dangerous, not to mention that they can easily snap (or rip a leg off); the leash part of mine is a flat, 3/4” pretty durable fabric. \n\nI walk my 17lb dog on it so he can have some freedom when we walk in the park or on the path at my complex, and we get to an open area, a field or deserted area. When in the park, I also loop the handle through something I’m wearing so that just in case it slips out of my hand, it’s still attached and won’t go flying. I pay attention to everything going on around us 24/7, and as soon as I see any person or dog approaching in the distance, he is reeled in and kept on a short leash. \n\nI don’t have an issue with them as a whole, it’s just that, like anything, you need to have the right equipment, use it properly, and use it responsibly.

I made a swatch and it looked so weird! It was nothing like an elegant classic tweed. The fabric, although soft and drapey looked like someone had worn it before, it was kind of dirty looking, strange thin strings of black fibers made it look like a black cat had  a nap on it. Also, I realized the yarn would not work for the pattern I chose.\n\nWhat do I do with the sweater quantity of yarn I already have? At some point in one of the knitting podcasts (I think) I saw \"Sycamore sweater\" and here it clicked! I bought a ball of green yarn and decided to knit a sweater which will be looking \"dirty\" but also \"moldy\" or \"mossy\". The green yarn was coloring my fingers while knitting, so I knew it was going to bleed the color when blocking, but at this point I didn't really care! I was ready to embrace any disasters and imperfections and just let them be.\n\n\nI liked knitting the pattern, it was surprisingly fast. I enjoy the fabric of the sweater, it's super comfortable! Color catching cloth helped me to protect the white yarn from the green dye in the first wash, I still see the green tint, but it's not too bad. From a distance, it even looks nice, as you cannot see the untidy look of the fabric. I feel like a walking piece of modern art, even though I wear the sweater only to walk with my dog. Fortunately, my good boy doesn't judge my fashion choices.\n\nThe lesson for me was to take things less seriously and just enjoy knitting!",

The light green band is from the water tension on the egg and the bowl.  It will move down slowly as the water evaporates. Haven't figured out how to get the bottom nicely dried, but I might suspend the egg so it's not touching the bottom. ",

    "body": "Alrite, I have let my mind run some ideas around for some time leading up to bringing up a quite simple addition for the game.\n\n***How about letting Minecraft-players craft green dye from grass items (mainly short grass)?***\n\n[\\\\\"I mean... 'Tis kinda straight onward concept, innit?\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/agdkx3ghiub81.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=f04b3daf92653723c5ed6aa3050940010c2480ac)\n\nThe purpose of this idea is mostly for fun and slightly for convenient application since the current go-to method for obtaining green dye is by smelting a cactus block: while I do see harvesting cacti as an alright implementation for seeking out deserts, I have a feel that they wouldn't lose much of purpose from grass giving green dyes (As cactus blocks can be farmed and smelted for experience points as well as be used for a simple defensive barrier, while Desert/Badlands have generated structures to explore for with Desert Temples and elevated Mineshafts respectively).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, I shall be fair and address upon possible flaw of this idea that comes in form of relative redundancy: given how **Shepherd Villagers do sell green dyes** (on Apprentice and Expert-tiers, one emerald per dye) and **Wandering Traders selling Cactus Blocks** for 3 emeralds/piece, it does leave the green dye market decently supplied as it is in the game.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, this is mostly a fun thought for an idea to suggest for a small addition to the game that I thought could be a fun additional use for grass outside lawn-moving it for composts. To top off this relatively quick suggestion, I do think that in terms of crafting the dye with grass I would think that **having four of them in a 2x2-grid** would be a fine ratio for more easily obtainable green dye (thou I guess that going full 3x3 could be justified as well for simply lawn-moving the materials).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*And, that's all I got on this. Any thoughts?* :o",

No fuel and not a lot of time required at all, especially with a setup where you've got a Skeleton or Composting Farm Setup to supply you with infinite Bone Meal. \n\nIts too easy at too little cost. Disincentives exploration of the world. \n\nThis suggestion is kinda like adding the ability to get Brown Dye every time you strip Dark Oak Logs because Oak Bark can be used to make brown dye IRL, which would make Cocoa Beans not worth gathering at all.

Unknown what time the server opens again but it is open as early as 3pm PST.\n* The Kingdom contains shops and activities to do in-between exploring the main dungeons to reclaim their memories.\n* One end of the Kingdom of Libestal contains 4 empty plots of land for the girls to build whatever they wish.\n* There is a shopkeeper that sells a Fashion Surprise Box. For 300 coins you can pick one random box out of a selection with 4 chances to win a random hat, and the rest being a Construction Supplies Box (A box that lets you pick one decorative block stack to have. (This is basically gacha)\n* One building at the Amber Coin area contains a game called Color Cannon. They select a color they want to bet on and decide on how many coins to bet. Then the cannon will start firing, taking out 4 colored squares with each shot. After six shots, only one square will remain. Players who bet on that color will win. Winning players will receive a payout based on the multiplier listed for the color they bet on (Blue x2, Green x3, Yellow x5, Red x10) (This is basically gambling)\n* There is a PVP arena near the Jade Sword area where the girls can fight against each other (outside of this there is no PVP turned on).\n* Nearby the middle of town is a large quest board where the girls can pick up and receive different quests. So far many of these quests are tutorial based ones that teach you how this Minecraft Realm works, including how to get items at the blacksmith, how to cook, and more.\n* All the girls along with their special weapons each received different items to play the game including: An egg to summon a horse to ride around on, a cellphone to call other players and make groups, a recycle bin, a map that updates automatically as the player travels around, and a book that lets them read what quests to do and to help them out with forming parties or recovering lost items.\n* One quest (noticed from Ina) allows one to get a Magic Feather allowing you to fly freely at your Construction Build area, making it easier for you to build.\n* Stains are located outside of the town and can be fought and killed for coins. It's found to be a good way to get money besides doing the quests. EDIT: As the days has passed it is found that a good way to earn money is making use of the repeating sidequest that occur on the quest board.\n* Unofficially there is a lottery system created by Fauna. For 10 coins you can draw a ticket of 3 numbers 1-9 (no repeats). At 5pm PST she will draw the winning numbers. The winner will receive however amount of money is in the prize pool (depending on how tickets are sold) (Note: 30% of the prize is given to Fauna with a 10% going to the Scarlet Wand Library).\n* Each dungeon contains an optional treasure chest. These chests can be found and obtained by completing generally a more difficult puzzle/part of the dungeon. This treasure is a music CD of the song of the Myth member that the dungeon represents.\n\nToday's Summary Notes:\n\n* Fauna starts by noting that if there's no winners for the lottery then the jackpot will carry over to the next day. Also members can keep their lottery tickets for the next day. She also plans on increasing the jackpot size. Fauna also notes Calli's tavern that she built, Nerissa's House, and Kronii's House.\n* After the drawing today, Fauna will run a campaign where everyone shall receive a free lottery ticket.\n* Fauna while working to get new tools started doing some quests and started working on the quest for the Ocean Temple Dungeon (which she still needs to do). She was working on the quest to get diamonds so she can get some diamond tools.\n* As Fauna was in the area, she went to solo the Ocean Temple Dungeon. She completed the dungeon and got the memory, however she did not get the extra treasure. She did get lots of diamonds from the area.\n* Nerissa's plan for today is to make lots of money by doing quests and gambling. She met with Fauna and Fauna suggested the lottery. Nerissa got a lottery ticket, for 10 gold. Nerissa did not read the fine print.\n* Today's lottery was drawn. The numbers today are 7-3-4. Fauna checked the numbers and Mococo won the lottery. Fauna sent a message to her to claim her prize of 707 coins. (A profit of bout 27 coins since Mococo spent 680 coins on the tickets). Mococo replied to Fauna \"BAU BAU BAU BAU BAU Fauna Mart is not a scam! I have won\"\n   * Should be noted that Fauna gets 30% of the jackpot, which from the 1010 jackpot is 303 coins, with 10% going to the Library (101 coins).\n* Nerissa has been trying to make a milkshake and needs an apple to get it. However getting an apple in this game is very difficult (apparently it took Irys like 5 minutes of oak leaf chopping to get it) and she's been asking people to help her out in getting an apple. After some grinding Nerissa eventually got her apple.\n   * Nerissa didn't fully understand how to do this sidequest, she ended up making butter instead. Chat helped her out with what do.\n* Fauna got Gigi to get lottery tickets after she was told that the money would be use for the library. Fauna came by to Gigi and Nerissa came by as well (Asking for apples). After some talking (they both came to the conclusion that the lottery wasn't a scam since it was for the library), Gigi gave Nerissa 300 coins which Nerissa used to buy 30 Lottery tickets (so she has 31 tickets in total).\n* Biboo logged on and met up with Nerissa. Biboo remaked on how Nerissa has a hat and how she's been trying to get a hat of her own but with no success. Nerissa helped out by buying 3 of the Surprise Boxes for Biboo to to use, however all 3 draws left Biboo with no hat in the end.\n* Fauna while working on her shop added a Jukebox and got Gura's Reflect to play on it (Acquired from Nerissa). She has it set up on the door. While working on it Biboo came by, and Fauna told her that the lottery wasn't a scam since Mococo won. Biboo was convinced since Fauna has a hat and Biboo really wants a hat of her own. Biboo bought 10 lottery tickets (I will not write down all of the tickets). Ceci also came by as well to chat.Raora logged on and checked out the place. Fauna and the girls convinced Raora that the lottery wasn't a scam and Raora caved and bought 1 lottery ticket (number for Raora is 6-9-7).\n* Calli comes online and shows the Divorce Diner that she made. This is the Jade Sword Tavern (That others can use). She shows off her menu and the special of the day. Calli also at some point acquired the Scarlet Wand Hat. She however wants the Jade Sword Hat and wishes to trade it with someone for the Scarlet Wand Hat in the future. Calli also explains how the divorce system will work. Calli shows off the flyer she created that explains her diner and menu (This is an actual flyer that she shows on stream). Calli also showed the chat her Magic Feather that allows her to fly.\n   * As Calli went to hand in some sidequests, she met up with Fauna and Raora. Calli took the two back to her diner and gave them a tour of the place. They noted how FaunaMart blocks the view of the Arena from the Diner.\n   * Calli and Fauna went to FaunaMart and Fauna offered her 3 Stain Bones for 240 Coins. Calli accepted (she wanted the bones for her dishes for her diner. Calli also bought a lottery ticket from Fauna as well (Calli now has 27 coins)\n* Bijou and Ceci are working on the main quest which is by the Cerulean Cup Guild. They checked out the area and noticed the place has a large pool. They both cannonball in. Liz also comes by and the 3 hang out at the pool together. The 3 go together to do the main quest for today's dungeon.\n   * According to the comments below: We have our first adoption in ENreco. ERB has agreed to be Koseki Bijou mother so that she can be 'Koseki Bijou Bloodflame'. Ceci was their notary.\n   * There were too many enemies at the area for the quest and Biboo got slained by the Stains. Fauna called and told Biboo that she was selling Stain Bones for 80 coins per Bone, but before she could finish speaking Biboo hung up. Ceci also asked for a Nourishing Soup. Calli made an offer to sell her soup to Ceci. Ceci gifts Calli 59 coins and 16 green dye for the soup. The Nourshing Soup is needed for the Main Quest.\n   * Ceci and Calli chatted and Calli promoted her wares and her diner. In the end, Calli gave Ceci her Red Hat that Ceci now wears. Ceci giving her thanks plays her own ukulele. Ceci showed the hat to Fauna, and the two touched tips.\n* Gigi gave her daily 500 coin dowry to Calli to keep her marriage between her Pearl, Ame.\n* Apparently Nerissa discovered an Infinite Money Glitch. In the game, there is a quest to kill 10 stains. Killing 10 stains earns 100 coins. However after doing this quest the first time, if you repeat the quest again, just killing one of anything (it doesn't have to be a stain) auto completes the quest making it super easy to obtain 100 coins. With this strat, Nerissa currently has over 4000 coins.\n   * Gigi also has obtained over 4000 coins but her strat of getting this much money is done through other means.\n   * It seems thanks to more members learning of this glitch it'll most likely get patched in the future (Also with staff watching the streams too).\n   * Raora and Calli have found out about the glitch and are making the most of out of before it gets patched. (Apparently Nerissa chat told everyone about the glitch). Raora mentioned she wanted to get 1000 coins and Calli noted its a good number to buy food. Calli was also thinking of increasing her prices due to the economy change but the market might crash.\n   * The quest got patched at the top of the hour and can no longer be completed. This was because of Ina's dungeon unlocking and when a new dungeon unlocks, the quests change and update.\n   * Nerissa after gaining tons of money goes to the Color Cannon to gamble and try and get more money.\n* Fauna was reminded to give her Free Lottery ticket campaign and made sure to give them away. She gives a free lottery ticket with the purchase of Stain Bones. Biboo was given a lottery ticket after buying some Bone Stains.\n* Fuwamoco came by to FaunaMart and Mococo collected her winnings. She played the lottery again and Mococo bought 71 tickets. Fuwawa then went and got a tour of Calli's diner. Calli noted of the menu but Fuwawa can only afford a mushroom soup at the moment.\n* Today's dungeon will be done by the following groups: (Nerissa, Ceci, Fauna). (Raora, Liz, Fuwamoco, Calli). (Gigi, Shiori, Bijou, Kronii).\n   * This dungeon's mechanic is that there's a sanity counter. The counter slowly goes down as you progress and decreases faster if you make mistakes. Low enough sanity makes the screen fade to black and a purple face show up on the screen. If you reach zero sanity you get the withering heart and wither and die (before respawning with 25 sanity).\n   * The group comes across a spirit and are asked to smash pots. This is a puzzle containing a series of clues. They are found within books on the shelves. Smashing the wrong pot makes you lose your sanity. Break the right pots and progress the dungeon. There's also a special book that may be a hint for the future.\n   * The next part is a spooky maze that they must navigate through. The longer they have to travel through the maze the more sanity they lose.\n   * Then they must cross a bridge. The bridge has unknown holes that they can fall through making them lose sanity.\n   * The last thing they must do is they must find Lily of the Valley and plant them in pots. Doing this completes the dungeons\n   * Completing the dungeon grants them a cutscene to play. It plays Ina's lore. Members who complete the dungeon now have green sparkles coming out of their weapons.\n   * It is currently unknown where this dungeon's secret treasure chest is located. It seems that the first puzzle with the pots has a book that hints on how to obtain the chest. They believe that they need to get a purple flower and put it in the pot (This is unconfirmed, the chest has still not been found). (EDIT: The secret treasure of Ina's CD was found by Bijou! It can be found in the maze through a secret wall).\n      * During Raora's group in getting the treasure Mococo fell into a hole and got stuck, with Liz joining her in the hole.\n   * Nerissa's group is the first one to complete the dungeon. They touch hats in celebration.\n   * Despite Raora's group going through the dungeon twice they were unable to find the hidden treasure today.\n   * Kronii's group was able to finish the dungeon very quickly. They too did not find the secret treasure either.\n* Fauna got Shiori to buy a lottery ticket. Shiori was having some trouble figuring out how to trade coins so Fauna gave Shiori one free ticket (as part of her campaign).\n* Biboo called Fauna asking about Beetroot but Fauna noted she didn't have any. However the suggested to stock beetroot at the shop was appreciated and that Biboo call Calli asking about the Beetroot. Biboo called Calli about the Beetroot. Calli was happy to give her one for a low price of 10 coins. This was acceptable. Biboo came to the diner to trade with a hungry woman (Nerissa) following right behind her.\n* Nerissa told Calli that her wife was stolen and she would like to get her wife back. Calli told Nerissa how it would work: Invite all 3 for a dinner at the diner, and when the food is serve the divorce will occur. According to Nerissa as she tells Gigi, Shiori has 2 wifes (her and Biboo) and Nerissa wants Shiori to divorce Biboo for Nerissa. This is cause Nerissa and Shiori were married first (however Shiori has no memory about this). Nerissa's voices in her head told Nerissa about this marriage between Shiori and Biboo.\n   * This marriage drama between Nerissa, Shiori, and Biboo has escalated now. Liz and Ceci got involved in this. Liz suggested that this should be decided through a fight in the arena. After some talking Shiori and Biboo are sticking with their marriage. Turns out its a misunderstanding since Shiori says there was no marraige ceremony. (This marriage ordeal may best be viewed in a future clip due to the multiple members involved).\n   * When Gigi came to Shiori and Biboo they talked about the marriages and the misunderstandings that occured. Along with Gigi nearly being married to Biboo and other things.\n* Gigi bought the Fashion Surprise Boxes and got 2 different hats in a row. When you get a hat the message shows up in chat for everyone to see. Fauna thinks that Gigi might be the main character. Fauna asks Gigi to sell her hat to her. Gigi will sell the hat for 50 lottery tickets. Fauna accepts. She couldn't put the hat on the armory stand but it was able to be put on the item frame. The Hat is being sold for 1,500 coins. Gigi is wearing the other hat she occurred.\n   * Gigi went and bought even more boxes and got 2 more hats. She gave her spare hats away. Fauna overheard and was like \"She can't do that, my hat economy\"\n* Nerissa while navigating the dungeon accidentally summoned her horse. This made her lose her Horse Summoning Egg and the horse is now in the world. Even exiting the dungeon she doesn't have her horse egg anymore. After fully getting out with the entire party she got the horse summon egg back.\n* It should be noted that Ceci sudden end to her stream was due to a power outage in her home.\n* Kronii logged on and got a visit to Calli's diner. Kronii is also in a call with her dungeon group (Shiori, Gigi, Biboo). They ordered food from the establishment. Calli works to make the food for them. Kronii asks if the food is sodium free. Calli: Everything is sodium free if you believe. More shenanigans occured at the diner with the 4 of them. It should be noted that as of writing Kronii has only 8 coins after buying food at the diner (Kronii likes to tell people she has 8000 coins). Calli showed the group the upstairs room and showed the new expanded bed. Gigi noted that this bed would be perfect for her and her wife.\n   * Kronii had to call Calli privately saying she can only offer 15 diamonds as payment for the food. Calli agreed. (It seems Kronii is going to be paying for everyone's food at the diner today but Kronii is broke). It seems the others have a feeling that Kronii is broke so they are ordering the most expensive food on the menu. 15 Diamonds for Bone in Fried Stain and 2 Ultimate Milkshakes. Calli: \"The things I do for my liege\". Calli had to remove the milkshake from the Specials and replaced it with the Lasagna. Kronii: \"This milkshake will bring all the boys to the yard!\"\n* Raora has discovered a new strat into making money quickly: Potato Salad quest. Since 1 potato salad yields 100 coins, just make a bunch for very cheap and you can get lots of money very quickly. (The costs to get the ingredients for a potato salad is less than 100 coins so it becomes a profit in total). She plans to use the money for lottery tickets. Which she says its fine since she can just get more money quickly anyway.\n* Raora has discovered the strat of farming building materials by dismantling the regenerating Overworld structures. It's an easy way to obtain bricks to build her castle. She can also use it to mine special blocks like furnances and barrels, allowing her to obtain them without the need for crafting or buying.\n* Calli adds a door to her diner so non-guild members cannot enter while she is offline.\n* Gigi obtained another hat through the boxes. Biboo is in shock as she been desperately trying to obtain a hat of her own but the gacha boxes for it have not been in her favor. She keeps spending all of her money. Raora passed by Biboo and Biboo asked to pet Raora and comfort her in the loss of the hat gacha. Biboo called Gigi about the hat and to do the dungeon together to get the CD. Gigi tells her that she'll do it after she makes money through the Gold Sword economy. (You lots of swords to give to the Questmaster and completing its quest for money. Its a 100 coin profit, plus getting the swords allows for level up for enchantments). Gigi then tells Biboo what all the money she's grinding being used for: 1000 to Fauna a day for the Library, and 500 to Calli a day for the Dowry. Biboo whispers to chat (as she's on a phone call with Gigi) that she is being scammed. Biboo then tells Gigi that she owes her 600 coins every day. Gigi will do this for her wife. Biboo says that this is a tax called \"Bijou Tax\" (Biboo will use the money for the Surprise Boxes). After Gigi got Bijou Taxed, the two went to Calli's Dungeon to get the CD.\n* Raora visited Kronii whos working on building her cabin. The two started talking and Kronii asked if Raora was part of Amber Coin. Raora said yes and Kronii told her to get off her property, but Raora refused. Kronii called upon Biboo and Gigi for backup to help Kronii, the queen. The two got into a fight and banter a lot (For fun). (It should be noted that you cannot destroy the property thats not on your guild). When GG and Biboo came back, they started to get back at Raora. Raora told them to get off her property. More arguing and bantering occurred. Biboo challenged Raora to a duel for the Queen's honor. Raora will not take on the duel. She says \"ew no Im not gonna touch you, Im not gonna go on your level\".\n   * Biboo is charmed however by Raora being a cat. Raora purrs and it makes Biboo fall for her. Kronii and Gigi are disgusted by this act and run back to their own property. Biboo gave Raora some bread and Raora gave her 300 coins for a Surprise Box. Raora: Who is a true queen now!? ahahaha!\n   * Both Raora and Kronii work on building in their respective guild areas.\n* The next dungeon tomorrow will be at Volcano. Since its part of the Amber Coin (each of these main quests is part of a guild), Gigi is disgusted by having to deal with the Amber Coin (well the group of Kronii, Shiori, Biboo, and Shiori are acted disgusted by the guild. Mainly just Kronii and Gigi, tho Shiori does smack them and Biboo is pretty neutral about it). Gigi is convinced by Biboo to talk to the Amber Coin NPC's for her wife. It's what she wanted.\n* The main quest for the Volcano Dungeon is to give 500 coins. Tomorrow's dungeon will be the Volcano Dungeon (Kiara's dungeon).\n* Biboo went to solo Ina's dungeon to try and find where the CD is. It seems to be that to get the chest you have to find a specific door in the maze that leads to a bridge and then find a way across the bridge without falling through to the void and returning to the maze. You can get to the bridge by going through a door that you had already gone through. When Bijou got to the bridge, she attempted to navigate across by slowly crawling across but fell near the end (meanwhile Gigi got another hat). Biboo was able to figure out which blocks on the bridge are real and which are fake by mining them with a pickaxe. If it looks like it starts to break by showing cracks then it real. The fake ones will not show anything if you attempt to mine at them. However there are also invisible walls around too. After many attempts crossing the bridge Biboo moves onto the final area to try and see if the chest could be there instead. In the end, turns out when she was going through the maze, she found the CD, it was through an invisible wall. The Bridge turned out to be a distraction. Biboo called Raora about it. Biboo asked if Raora wanted to know or give a hint, and Raora asked for a hint: Maze.\n   * As thanks for the hint, Raora gave Biboo 900 coins to buy the Surprise Boxes in hopes of getting a hat. Biboo went to the tavern where the shopkeeper is, bought a box, and then put Violet on the Jukebox as she rolled in attempts to get a hat. Raora said she'll take any construction supply boxes from her cause she need building materials. Biboo did not get the hat, even with Violet playing on the Jukebox.\n* 6 hours later into Biboo's stream as she has Reflect playing on the jukebox in the Tavern... Biboo FINALLY got her hat. It is the Slime Stain Hat, which is the hat she wanted as well since its purple. After obtaining the hat, Biboo built a Moai Statue next to Kronii's house in the free build area.\n* The server will automatically kick members out for maintenance at 2am PST. Note that due to me being mere human I will unable to be around for the full time until the server's kicking.",

He is an attorney, political activist and blogger that gained notoriety through his [crusade](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/04/04/net-impact) against Vladimir Putin.  Primarily through advocacy on YouTube, where his [channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/NavalnyRu) as of this writing exceeds 6.4 million subscribers, Navalny highlights the Russian government’s corruption with particular emphasis on theft of state assets by Vladimir Putin and the circle of oligarchs that stand behind him. \n\n**Novichok & Context**\n\nIn August 2020, Navalny was hospitalized in Germany following an assassination attempt with a [novichok nerve agent](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/world/europe/navalny-opcw-russia-novichok.html).  Novichok nerve agents are a type of binary chemical weapon.  Binary chemical weapons are stored and transported in the form of their less toxic chemical precursors, which makes them harder to identify and detect before use.  Novichok nerve agents belong to a class of chemical weapons developed by the USSR starting in the early 1970s.  While known to be currently manufactured by several other countries outside the current Russian federation, a similar novichok nerve agent was used for the purpose of assassinating Sergei and Yulia Skripal at their home in England in 2018.  \n\nSergei Skripal was a former Russian military intelligence officer who acted as a double-agent for the United Kingdom’s intelligence services from the 1990s to 2000s.  Skripal was arrested outside his home in Moscow in December 2004, before being convicted of high treason against the Russian federation for his espionage activities in service of the British crown.  \n\nThough sentenced to thirteen years in prison, he was exchanged for several Russian nationals who were imprisoned for life in the United Kingdom as a part of a spy swap in 2010.  While the Russian Federation had since abolished capital punishment, many [suspected](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/06/sergei-skripal-does-revenge-for-treason-lie-behind-harm-to-ex-spy) that Skripal’s assassination was intended as a death sentence carried out from afar.  A similar fate befell the former FSB and KGB officer, Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned with a polonium isotope six years after he defected to the United Kingdom in the early 2000s with his wife and young son.  \n\nAnd Vladimir Putin’s political rivals have not only died as a result of exposure to chemical weapons or radioactive isotopes.  For example, Boris Nemtsov was [gunned down](https://www.tvc.ru/news/show/id/62541) while jogging across the Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge in Moscow, in front of the Kremlin walls and near Red Square in February 2015, two days before he was supposed to attend a protest against Russia’s aggression in Ukraine.  Few [seriously questioned](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/world/europe/killing-of-boris-nemtsov-putin-critic-breeds-fear-in-russia.html) Putin’s involvement --- particularly in consideration of the fact that Ramzan Kadyrov’s former security chief almost certainly pulled the trigger.  A [show trial](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/3/russia-five-men-stand-trial-for-boris-nemtsov-murder) resulted in five Chechens being convicted for Nemstov’s assassination.  Beyond Nemtsov, at least Boris Berezovsky, Stanislav Markelov, Anastasia Baburova, Sergei Magnitsky, Anna Politkovskaya, Sergei Yushenkov and Yuri Shchekochikhin all rank among assassinations behind which Putin and his government are the [common denominator](https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-critics-of-vladimir-putin-who-died-20170325-story.html).  \n\n**Neither Death Nor Exile**\n\nBefore his return, one might have expected that Navalny would have availed himself of the opportunity to remain in [exile](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/01/06/508477662/political-exile-a-centuries-old-russian-tradition-returns), like Mikhail Khodorkovsky, as opposed to the death he narrowly escaped before.  Navalny chose neither.  \n\nAfter having recovered from poisoning by the novichok nerve agent, Navalny returned to Russia on January 17, 2021.  Navalny was arrested immediately upon return.  Navalny’s arrest was met with global outrage.  Navalny was convicted of fraud and embezzlement and faced a suspended sentence several years back --- despite the complete lack any credible evidence whatsoever to substantiate the charges.  He has been repeatedly arrested, served multiple prison sentences and he has been physically attacked by Putin’s “supporters” on multiple occasions.  In one such incident, a green dye commonly used as an antiseptic was [thrown in his face](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39735867) while in a [Siberian village](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-39337139).  Despite being subject to politically motivated fake criminal charges, assault and scores of other insults, Navalny has persevered.  \n\nTwo days later, on January 19, 2021, Navalny released a video titled [Putin’s Palace - History of the world’s largest bribe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipAnwilMncI), which has amassed more than 110,000,000 views since release.  The video alleges that a property valued at approximately $1.37 billion (US) located on the Black Sea was built for Putin’s benefit by the circle of oligarchs that form his inner circle.  Putin denies ownership.  [Yet, BBC coverage from 2012](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17730959) quotes one of Putin’s business associates as having indicated that every last detail of the Bond-villain style palace was designed according to Putin’s precise specifications. \n\nAround the same time, Navalny released a [recorded phone conversation](https://apnews.com/article/alexei-navalny-poisoning-underpants-202f470c2d1c19151b9deb564d94e8f9) in which he pretended to be an FSB officer, debriefing the FSB agent who poisoned him.  In the call, the poisoner apologetically states that the “situation would have turned out differently” if Navalny’s plane had not made the emergency landing that enabled Navalny to receive emergency medical treatment.  And of course, the situation might further have ended differently had Navalny not received medical care in Germany.  According to the call, the FSB agent placed the combined novichok agent inside Navalny’s underwear.  \n\nBased on its OSINT investigation, Bellingcat [revealed the FSB team of chemical weapons experts behind Navalny’s poisoning](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/12/14/fsb-team-of-chemical-weapon-experts-implicated-in-alexey-navalny-novichok-poisoning/) who were likewise involved in a series of other [murders of Russian political activists](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2021/01/27/navalny-poison-squad-implicated-in-murders-of-three-russian-activists/).  The details of Bellingcat’s investigation are essentially confirmed by the phone call Navalny staged with the FSB operative who poisoned him --- though the FSB told the Associated Press that Navalny’s video was fake.\n\nFollowing Navalny’s arrest, the largest protests in more than a decade erupted across Russia.  Tens of thousands took to the streets in sub-zero temperatures from Moscow to Yakutsk in which over 5,100 people [were arrested](https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-moscow-coronavirus-pandemic-arrests-russia-085b16035e9c89ffb9919e4d94a2309c) in at least [109 cities](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/23/international-home/russia-protests-navalny.html) in each of Russia’s eleven time-zones.  Every single major city in Russia saw demonstrations in support of Navalny, prompting [unprecedented](https://apnews.com/article/world-news-moscow-60bb3ba4b68e80db4239e96c2d7ab060) repression tactics by Russian police. \n\nRather than backing down in response, the pro-Navalny demonstrations have continued to gain [momendum](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/across-russia-pro-navalny-demonstrations-continue-to-build-momentum) and show no sign of dissipating.  Masha Gessen [explained](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/alexey-navalnys-fearless-return-to-russia) that:\n\n> [Navalny] has . . . show[n] people what they had always known about the Putin regime but had the option of pretending away.  He has shown the depth of the regime’s corruption.  He has shown that Putin’s secret police carries out murders.  With his return to Russia, he has shown the regime’s utter lack of imagination and inability to plan ahead.  He has also shown that, contrary to the Kremlin’s assertions and to conventional wisdom among Western Russia-watchers, there is an alternative to Putin. \n\nNow, there is no clear path forward where Putin isn’t the clear loser.  If Putin does manage to eventually kill Navalny, Russia may face international retaliation at least as severe as that imposed on Russia after Sergei Magnitsky’s murder.  On the other hand, if Putin does not manage to kill Navalny, Putin’s political rivals will continue to be emboldened, as Putin’s power-base ages and fragments.  While the point at which domestic and/or international political pressure rises to the level of an existential threat to Putin’s control remains unclear, Navalny has moved Russia in that direction.  Putin has never been weaker than he is now. \n\n**Geopolitics of Navalny’s Return**\n\nThe West is not without leverage against Russia, however limited the options may be.  Economic [sanctions](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-politics-navalny-eu-idUSKBN2A924T), in particular, are a preferred means of coercion.  For example, in 2012 the Obama Administration signed the bipartisan Magnitsky Act into law, which imposed particularized economic sanctions against individuals implicated in Sergei Magnitsky’s murder in a Moscow prison.  Thereafter, numerous other countries passed similar legislation.  Magnitsky-style sanctions blacklisted named persons from Western banks and financial institutions and prohibited nearly all forms of commercial transaction with Western entities or individuals.  In addition, some states have denied visas, restricted travel and frozen and/or seized assets owned or controlled by individuals subject to such sanctions.  Russia maintains that these efforts violate Russian sovereignty and interfere with Russia’s judicial system.  \n\nSo far, the United States and Canada have condemned the Russian government’s actions in relation to Navalny and the protests supporting him.  And beyond Magnitsky-style sanctions, other punitive economic measures have been proposed.  \n\nIn Europe, two camps have emerged along familiar lines: (1) the United Kingdom, France, and Central and Eastern European countries like Poland, Romania and the Baltic states which historically take more [hawkish positions](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/18/alexei-navalny-us-europe-condemn-arrest-of-poisoned-putin-critic.html) toward Russia and Putin’s government; and (2) commercially entangled Western European countries like Germany and Italy, who seek to compartmentalize economic interests and human rights abuses.  \n\nFor example, [France](https://www.dw.com/en/france-presses-germany-to-ditch-nord-stream-2-over-navalny/a-56411291) has already urged Germany to scrap the gas pipeline project, Nord Stream 2, with Russia in response to Navalny’s assassination attempt and Russia’s anti-democratic political repression.  Yet, while Berlin has condemned the Kremlin and demanded Navalny’s release, Angela Merkel’s spokeswoman Martina Fietz has made clear that the German government has no intention of changing course with respect to future pipeline construction.  Likewise, Armin Laschet, who is the new leader of Merkel’s CDU party criticized any attempt to use Nord Stream 2 as a tool of political leverage against Putin’s government, [arguing](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-politics-laschet-exclusive/exclusive-navalny-affair-no-grounds-to-cancel-nord-stream-pipeline-new-german-cdu-chief-says-idUSKBN2A51FL) that:\n\n> For 50 years, even in the aggressive times of the Cold War, Germany has bought gas from the Soviet Union, now from Russia. The German government is following the right course.\n\nGerman Economic Minister Peter Altmaier has likewise spoken out against linking Moscow’s political repression to Nord Stream 2, [stating](https://www.rferl.org/a/german-minister-warns-against-linking-fate-of-navalny-with-nord-stream-pipeline/31090454.html) that: \n\n> Business relationships and business projects that have existed for decades are one thing and serious human rights violations and our reactions to them are another.\n\nFurther, calls within the [United Kingdom](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-55844146) to impose sanctions on Russian oligarchs Roman Abramovich and Alisher Usmanov, who own or control interests in English football teams have been heard throughout Parliament.\n\nBut whether it is wise to punish Putin’s Russia for Navalny’s attempted assassination by sanctions or otherwise is another matter entirely.  Would imposing sanctions in response to the assassination attempt be nothing more than a symbolic gesture of condemnation?  Alternatively, would they be oriented towards *actually bringing about democratic reform* inside Russia and ending Putin’s regime?  Would the symbolic value of imposing sanctions at all be worth the risk that their imposition might wind up strengthening Putin’s hold on power?  And of course, would imposing sanctions make Navalny look like the Western puppet that many Putin supporters have alleged?  \n\nThe theoretical basis for when sanctions should work is straightforward:  impose costs greater than whatever benefit the target derives from continuing in the conduct for which he is being sanctioned.  And sanctions are typically effective at bringing about the specific harm they are oriented to cause.  The problem is that the harm sanctions create almost never translates to actual changes in policy consistent with the sanction’s intent and often bring about unintended consequences.  \n\nRussia’s own punitive measures against Ukraine in the mid-2000s provide an illustrative example.  [Seitz & Zazzaro]( https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11558-019-09360-2) found that when Russia punished Ukraine for democratic and pro-Western reform by raising gas prices, those affected “were significantly more likely to change their opinions in support of Western-style political and economic systems” --- the exact opposite of what the Kremlin intended.  There is more to be said about why sanctions typically fail, but for our purposes it is enough to ask whether the foreseeable risks of backlash in response to Western sanctions outweigh any likely benefit.  \n\n**The Future of Democracy in Russia**\n\nVadim Nikitin and others have [argued](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/putin-navalny-russia-protests/) that Navalny’s decision to return to Russia:\n\n> … was an act of such singular courage that it seemed to send a jolt of electricity through the nation’s jaded conscience\n\nIt is by no means clear that Navalny will lead Russia to a democratic future.  Nor is it clear that Putin will not try --- and succeed --- to assassinate Navalny, again.  But this moment belongs to the Russian people, and the United States and Europe would do well to reflect on its significance.  For democracy to prevail in Russia, change must arise from within.  After all, these protests in support of Navalny mirror those that preceded [color revolutions across the Soviet bloc](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/vladimir-putins-unchanging-unthinking-response-to-alexey-navalny).  Likewise, it is worth recalling that six months after Lenin’s [return from exile under similar circumstances](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/vladimir-lenin-return-journey-russia-changed-world-forever-180962127/) in Germany, he led the newly formed Soviet Union that emerged from Imperial Russia’s ashes. \n\nWhat is clear is that external pressure --- whether in the form of sanctions, cancelled business dealings or otherwise --- will reinforce Putin’s control of Russian politics and unite Russians against the West.  Several years ago, Navalny was the butt of Russian media late night jokes.  Then, even if many Russians themselves supported democratic reform, few saw Navalny as any kind of real transformative figure or alternative to Putin.  Now, they take to the streets by the tens of thousands in every major city in Russia across Russia’s eleven time zones to demand his release.",

If people are interested, an analysis post could maybe challenge some common misconceptions about them. \n\nRegarding Navalny - The West tends to view Russia in a very black boxesque thinking. Analysis often revolves around Putin (rightly so), but fails to properly factor in the power base in the background (the Oligarchs, the courts, popular support etc.), making it difficult to understand the dynamics of power within the country itself. Whether Navalny‘s actions and subsequent arrest will transform a lingering type of unrest into a real momentum of de facto power ultimately hinges upon the support they can muster within the system, courts, political structure, executive etc. in any case, further developments will be interesting to see, especially if the protests manage to actually threaten power, rather than being mostly symbolic.",

        "body": "I don't think Navalny is pushing for a popular overthrow of the government. Probably rightly so: it's very hard to get a really big number of Russians moving, and the results are usually unpredictable. He's not nearly populist enough to appeal to a broad audience here.\n\nInstead, I think he's pushing for a split in elites. His appeals toward US/EU to implement sanctions against a list of people are the direct offer to this people: \"support me against Putin, and those sanctions might disappear, stay with him, and all your vacations for the rest of your life will be in Crimea and your foreign accounts will be frozen\".\n\nThis makes him more likely to succeed than an appeal to common people - he's no Trump or Lenin to make blue collars unite around him - but also a bit suspect with the respect to his intentions to make average Russian's life better, and possibly open to future pressure from the West (the West might make it hard for him to keep his promises to local elites unless he makes concessions).\n\nHowever, Putin seem to have predicted this, and made an effort to purge elites from those easily susceptible to such offers. On the other hand, he IS getting older, and there might be enough oligrarch/siloviks (especially as the next generation starts to replace the original ones) willing to bet on a new horse. I don't think it's likely for Navalny to succeed in replacing Putin any time soon unless some Black Swan event occurs (one or two more pandemics in a row might be it; so can be Putin's sudden death). But when the time finally comes for power groups to find Putin's replacement, he might have a fighting chance if he can keep at least minimal popular support and succeed in getting some leverage with the West against certain families.",

Here on r/geopolitics we just say it as it is - that Putin is a hugely corrupt mafioso murderer because that's the reality. The West's failure to publicly acknowledge such a fact is not seen around the world as diplomacy, but weakness. How could it be that the West, which has an economy which dwarfs that of Russia, behave like cowards afraid of a school bully? It's not surprising that the world is moving away from democratic values if the guardians of democracy fear raising their voices, let alone taking meaningful action.\n\nI advocate for the West to ramp up economic sanctions to bring Russia to its knees. A new cold war leading to economic collapse in Russia, just like happened with the USSR. The West should make demands of Russia, and when Russia refuses - which it will do - the screws get tightened. This ramp-up should happen over the period of a decade, not only to allow Western economies to adapt but so that Russian citizens don't turn against the West.\n\nYes, sanctions against Russia would be bad for the world economy, but they needn't be bad for the West. Whenever there is voluntary trade, there are always two parties who benefit. While the West trades with Russia, Russia gets half the benefit. If such trade is kept within the West, then the West would see all the benefit.\n\nFor a few decades, Europe has not been using its economic might strategically. Europe doesn't have a coherent plan. It just stumbles from one crisis to another. Europe has the clout to be much stronger, and be a real pillar of strength among western allies, which would result in a West which no longer needs to hide behind diplomatic niceties, out of fear.",

    "body": "Hey guys! As I went to start this super easy project, I noticed a lot simple answers or mainly questions. I haven’t come across an actual tutorial yet on how do dye your UCP camo. So just a heads up i have some EMR gear so I wanted to get it as close to that as possible. I could’ve went darker but wanted to test out all the punches and vest first. So here’s my step by step on how I did it successfully and a little comparison with pictures! All pictures are in order with my steps. (step one= picture one)\n\nStep one: First thing is wash all your gear 1-3 times as my STUNK. Once it’s clean get yourself a 15-30 gallon tote. Any works that won’t leak. \n\nStep two: This is where you want 2-4 pots boiling water back to back so you can keep it hot. Start with enough water to just get to the top of your equipment. Then we add our ingredients.\nIngredient list: \nBoiling water\nHalf cup of salt \nHalf cup of dish soap\n8oz bottle of Rit Dark green dye \nPut in your salt and dish soap and mix it up with boiling water. Now when you’ve got it almost covered add your green dye with your last pot of boiling water and mix GOOD. \n\nStep three: Cover yours with a tote top or just leave it open to the air doesn’t matter. Let that sit for about 1-2 hours. At this point you should boil another 2-3 pots of water and re-add this so the water stays hot and seeps into all your gear. At this point go ahead and add another handful of salt and 1/8 cup of dish soap just to help the new water mix. \n\nStep four: Drink a beer and let it hit the 4-5 hour mark and drain all the water out, be careful not to stain a good sink. Once it’s drained ring them out good and wash once on look warm setting. Then throw them into the dryer.\n\nStep 5: Set your stuff out see if you colors are how you like them and compare them to a piece that you set aside. In my case i waisted on the assault pack so I could test out this specific mix. I will probably only do 4-6 ounces for my backpack. \n\nAnyways I hope this helps all the people buying these sets on ebay for 40-70 dollars. Really enjoyed doing this, happy with the outcome, and some solid gear for a super good price. Hope someone can try this and also post there success!! \n",

Verteporfin, known for inhibiting Yes-associated protein and reducing scarring, shows potential in enhancing regenerative healing, but there are concerns about its dose dependency and the need to determine the optimal concentration for effective treatment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, the DHT sensitivity of regenerated follicles remains a concern due to the influence of embryonic development on male pattern baldness. The precise depth of microneedling, crucial for maximizing Verteporfin's effects, also needs further investigation to ensure the treatment targets the appropriate skin layers without causing undue harm. As research progresses, finding the right balance of dose, application method, and adjunctive treatments will be key to improving outcomes. While these findings are promising, they are part of emerging research and should be interpreted as supplementary to professional medical advice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile this presents a potential breakthrough, it's crucial to note that this is emerging research **and not a substitute for professional medical advice.**\n\n1.

The justification of microneedling at this depth is to induce a similar 'depth of trauma' to that which is experienced in hair transplantation.\n      1. *Örs, S. (2017).

Here, after microneedling at this painful range verteporfin could either be injected into the scalp or somehow applied topically\n\n# Hypothetical Protocol with Verteporfin and Microneedling:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **5AR Treatment:** Scalp DHT must be reduced to produce conducive environment for regenerating hair follicles that MAY (high likelihood) be DHT sensitive.\n   1. Why is this a high likelihood?  The following is an article in The Guardian: [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/oct/01/could-scientists-reverse-male-pattern-baldness-hair-loss-cell-therapy](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/oct/01/could-scientists-reverse-male-pattern-baldness-hair-loss-cell-therapy) It talks about how male pattern baldness patterns could potentially be predicated from as early as embryonic development. Hair Follicles that are DHT sensitive could have a different cell linage.\n2. **Preparation and Cleaning:** Ensure the scalp is clean to reduce infection risks.\n3. **Microneedling Procedure:** Perform microneedling at a depth of 3mm-3.5mm to target the deeper layers of the scalp effectively.\n4. **Application of Verteporfin:** Apply Verteporfin topically or inject post-microneedling to inhibit YAP activity, enhancing follicular regeneration and minimizing scarring.\n5. **Post-treatment Care:** Follow a stringent aftercare regimen to avoid infections and monitor healing, acknowledging the slower regenerative process.\n\n\\---\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Overview of Healing in Mammals vs. Regenerative Species and the Role of YAP Inhibition\n\n**Healing in Mammals**\n\nMammals, including humans, primarily heal through a process that results in scarring. When an injury occurs, the body's immediate response is to close the wound, prevent infection, and restore integrity to the area. This involves a complex cascade of inflammatory responses, tissue formation, and remodeling, often resulting in scar tissue, which is fibrous and lacks the original tissue's full functionality and appearance. The scarring process is quick and effective for survival but does not restore the original tissue's architecture.\n\n[ Erickson, J. R., & Echeverri, K. \\(2018\\). Learning from regeneration research organisms: The circuitous road to scar free wound healing. Developmental Biology, 433\\(2\\), 144–154. https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.ydbio.2017.09.025 ](https://preview.redd.it/t5pz1261oa8c1.jpg?width=565&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=17dc84379b65059016fc8814be32aceb93af52dd)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Regeneration in Other Species**\n\nIn contrast, some species, such as certain amphibians and reptiles, can regenerate lost limbs or organs. This regeneration involves the re-growth of complex structures, including bone, muscle, and skin, to fully restore the lost part's function and appearance. For example, axolotls can regenerate entire limbs, tail, heart, and other organs with perfect functionality and without scarring. The process involves dedifferentiation of cells, proliferation, and re-differentiation, meticulously reconstructing the lost part.\n\n[ Avila-Martinez, N., Gansevoort, M., Verbakel, J. M.

Talbott and colleagues demonstrated that a single local administration of Verteporfin following injury significantly reduced scarring and induced regenerative healing in red Duroc pigs. Notably, these pigs are a close analog to human skin in terms of thickness and are often used in dermatological research, making the findings particularly relevant. The successful regeneration of scarless skin and hair follicles in these pigs points to the potential of Verteporfin to prevent scarring and regenerate hair follicles in humans as well.\n\n[ Talbott, H.

It demonstrates the remarkable healing effects of Verteporfin on mice, where treated skin areas not only heal effectively but also closely resemble unaffected skin in appearance and functionality, indicating the broad potential of Verteporfin in promoting regenerative healing across species.\n\n[ Zhang, Y., Wang, S., Yang, Y. et al. Scarless wound healing programmed by core-shell microneedles.

This is a diagram showing how the microneedle patch is made. The process starts with a mold that has sharp points (like an ice cube tray with spikes). A material is poured into the mold, vacuum is applied to remove air bubbles, and it's left to dry. Then, it's exposed to UV light to solidify, and finally, the finished product is removed from the mold.\n\nb. A photo of the actual microneedle patch, which has many tiny needles on it. This is probably a small patch that could fit on your skin.\n\nc. These are scanning electron microscope (SEM) images showing the needles of the patch from different views. The first one shows the side of the needles, the second shows the bottom, and the third is a close-up of a single needle.\n\nd. These images were taken with a confocal microscope, which can look at slices of the sample at different depths. They are showing how deep the drug (labeled with a red dye) goes into the needle.\n\ne. Here we see the needles have two parts: a core and a shell. The shell is marked with a red dye and the core with a green dye. When the two images are merged, it shows how the core is surrounded by the shell.\n\nf. This graph shows the force needed to break the shell of the needle and the entire needle with the drug. It helps to understand how strong the needles are.\n\ng. This graph shows the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are important in the body's defense and also for signaling when the needles are exposed to light.\n\nh. This graph shows how the drug (Verteporfin or VP) is released from the needles over time in different conditions.\n\ni. This is a Western blot, a technique used to detect specific proteins in a sample. It shows how the levels of certain proteins change in cells treated with different concentrations of the drug.\n\nj. This graph shows how well different types of microneedles can bind to a protein called IFN-γ over time.\n\nk. The last panel shows flow cytometry data, which is a way to measure characteristics of cells. This experiment was looking at how the needles affect the behavior of a type of immune cell called macrophages.\n\nThe text mentions that the needles are made of something called PF-MN, which probably refers to the materials used. The needles are designed to release their drug payload in response to something (like a change in the body's chemistry), and the studies are showing how well they release the drug, how strong they are, and how they affect cells in the lab. The statistical significance indicates that the results are highly reliable (P < 0.0001).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Human Fetal Tissue Regeneration**\n\nEarly in fetal development, humans have the ability to heal wounds without scarring. This is observed in the unique regenerative capacity of fetal skin, which can completely regenerate without scar formation until a certain point in gestation. The environment within the womb, including high hydration and specific growth factors, along with a distinct cellular response, allows for this scarless healing. As development progresses, this ability diminishes, and postnatal wounds typically heal by scarring.\n\n[Hu, M.S., Maan, Z.N., Wu, JC. et al. Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Repair in Wound Healing. Ann Biomed Eng 42, 1494–1507 \\(2014\\). https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1007\\/s10439-014-1010-z](https://preview.redd.it/mhrzmq5foa8c1.jpg?width=661&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea9a97d8d28231bd2d9c213291df29d912b378a0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Significance of YAP Inhibition**\n\nYes-associated protein (YAP) is a key regulator within the Hippo signaling pathway, crucial for controlling organ size, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. It's also significantly involved in wound healing and tissue regeneration. In the context of healing, YAP influences the behavior of fibroblasts—cells that play a critical role in wound repair and the formation of scar tissue. When YAP is active, fibroblasts are more likely to create the fibrous, collagen-rich tissue that leads to scars. Inhibiting YAP can reduce this scarring tendency and encourage a more regenerative form of healing.\n\n[ Zhang, Y., Wang, S., Yang, Y. et al. Scarless wound healing programmed by core-shell microneedles. Nat Commun 14, 3431 \\(2023\\). https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1038\\/s41467-023-39129-6 ](https://preview.redd.it/cb5c00fjoa8c1.jpg?width=1456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1ebefdbb80a81e2bc235452558adf3ff157db6c0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Speculating on the Appropriate Amount of Trauma for Scarless Healing\n\n**Understanding Trauma and Scarring:** In wound healing, the amount of trauma sustained by tissue can significantly influence the healing outcome. A delicate balance exists between sufficient trauma to trigger the body's natural healing mechanisms and excessive trauma leading to scarring. The body's response to injury involves a complex interplay of cellular signals, structural changes, and inflammatory responses, all of which contribute to either regenerative healing or scar formation.\n\n**Role of En1 and YAP in Healing**\n\nResearch by Shamik Mascharak and colleagues in \"Preventing Engrailed-1 activation in fibroblasts yields wound regeneration without scarring\" highlights the significance of Engrailed-1 (En1) as a mechanoresponsive regulator in fibroblast activation. When En1 is activated, typically in response to trauma, it guides fibroblasts to repair the wound in a way that often leads to scarring. YAP plays a pivotal role in this process by signaling the activation of En1, thus promoting the fibroblast response that leads to scar tissue formation. YAP inhibition prevents signaling to the EN1 gene, which is instrumental in directing fibroblasts during wound healing. By modulating this pathway, it's possible to shift the behavior of fibroblasts from rapidly creating scar tissue to slowly rebuilding tissue structures in a way that more closely resembles the original, without scarring.\n\n**Determining the Optimal Trauma Level**\n\nIn the context of microneedling combined with Verteporfin treatment, the goal is to induce a sufficient level of trauma to trigger the body's repair mechanisms without crossing the threshold into excessive injury that results in scarring. Determining the optimal level of trauma requires a precise understanding of the skin's tolerance and the intensity of the microneedling procedure. This involves considering the depth and density of needle penetration and the individual's skin characteristics.\n\n**Introducing Verteporfin to Inhibit YAP**\n\nOnce the appropriate level of trauma is administered via microneedling, Verteporfin is introduced as a YAP inhibitor. By inhibiting YAP, Verteporfin aims to prevent the activation of En1 and the subsequent fibroblast-driven scarring response. The hypothesis is that by modulating this pathway, the healing can shift towards regeneration, closely mimicking scarless fetal healing. The hope is that this approach will not only reduce scarring but also promote the regeneration of hair follicles in bald areas, leveraging the body's inherent regenerative potential.\n\n[ Shamik Mascharak et al. ,Preventing Engrailed-1 activation in fibroblasts yields wound regeneration without scarring. Science372,eaba2374\\(2021\\).DOI:10.1126\\/science.aba2374 ](https://preview.redd.it/m488b9qkoa8c1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=92189a2563fa2045a9277df9302853751db781ec)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Animal Studies and Verteporfin**\n\nAnimal studies have been instrumental in understanding the potential of YAP inhibitors like Verteporfin in promoting regenerative healing. For example, research involving mice and other mammals has shown that applying Verteporfin to wounds can lead to less scarring and more regenerative-like healing. These studies are vital as they show the potential for YAP inhibitors to change the way wounds heal, potentially enabling a more regenerative process similar to what is observed in fetal tissue and regenerative species.\n\nYou can see the further elaboration in this science article.

It is reasonable to conclude that Verteporfin has led to improved outcomes, including reduced scarring and enhanced hair follicle regeneration, based on the evidence.\n\n**Questions on Verteporfin dosage and use**\n\nHowever, it remains unclear whether the effects of Verteporfin are dose-dependent. Moreover, it is yet to be determined if the hair follicles observed in Dr. Barghouthi's and Dr. Bloxham's case reports will demonstrate growth similar to that of native terminal hairs. I also have questions regarding the number of Verteporfin hair transplant rounds one can undergo before potentially experiencing a decline in hair follicle regeneration in the donor area, if such a decline occurs at all.\n\n**Scalp DHT Concern**\n\nFinally, scalp DHT will continue to be a concern. Even if we manage to regenerate follicles in bald areas, the potential for regrowth might depend on the concentration of scalp DHT. It would be prudent to reduce scalp DHT as much as possible to create a more hospitable environment, especially if the regenerated follicles share a similar cell-niche lineage with the former DHT-sensitive follicles that once inhabited the bald areas. This approach may increase the likelihood of successful hair regrowth in those areas.\n\nWhy is this a high likelihood?  The following excerpt is from this article in The Guardian: [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/oct/01/could-scientists-reverse-male-pattern-baldness-hair-loss-cell-therapy](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/oct/01/could-scientists-reverse-male-pattern-baldness-hair-loss-cell-therapy) It talks about how male pattern baldness patterns could potentially be predicated from as early as embryonic development. Hair Follicles that are DHT sensitive could have a different cell linage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>In a paper published in May, Higgins described evidence that the hairline of a middle-aged man could be traced back to the earliest stages of embryonic development. Around the third week of an embryo’s life, cells form three layers called the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. Most organs in the body contain cells that derive from just one of these lineages: the endoderm gives rise to the internal organs, the mesoderm becomes the muscle and connective tissues, and the ectoderm becomes the central nervous system. “Normally a tissue is one lineage, but the \\[skin\\] is a bit of an enigma,” says Higgins.  \n>  \n>“The dermis \\[the skin’s lower layer\\] on the face is ectoderm and the dermis on your body is mesoderm, but the top of your head is not really known.”  Higgins argues that male pattern baldness traces out the boundary between skin cells that have taken two very different paths during development. This, she says, could explain why the cells on only certain parts of the head are oversensitive to dihydrotestosterone.  Kemp and colleagues are working to develop a test, based on the gene expression of dermal papilla cells, to establish whether the part of the scalp they come from is balding, destined to bald or will always retain its hair. “Ideally you want to be able to map the head,” he says. “We’re finding genetic differences between the hairs and we’re in the preliminary phases of doing that.  (Devlin, 2023)\n\nDevlin, H. (2023, October 1). ‘We’re not making new hairs, we’re rescuing’: could scientists reverse male pattern baldness? *The Guardian*. [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/oct/01/could-scientists-reverse-male-pattern-baldness-hair-loss-cell-therapy](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/oct/01/could-scientists-reverse-male-pattern-baldness-hair-loss-cell-therapy)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBased on the description provided in the paper by Higgins and colleagues, the high likelihood that regenerated hair follicles in bald areas would also be DHT sensitive stems from the developmental origins and lineage specificity of skin cells. Higgins suggests that male pattern baldness delineates the boundary between skin cells that have diverged along two distinct developmental paths. This implies that the predisposition for hair follicles to be sensitive to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is fundamentally linked to their embryonic cell lineage—whether they originate from ectoderm or mesoderm cells.\n\nIf the regenerated hair follicles in bald areas are derived from or share a similar lineage to the original follicles that were sensitive to DHT, they would likely retain the same sensitivity characteristics. Since male pattern baldness is associated with the oversensitivity of certain scalp cells to DHT, particularly those in characteristically balding patterns, any new follicles that are regenerated or reconstituted from these same cell lineages would presumably exhibit similar DHT sensitivities. Essentially, the genetic and developmental blueprint that predisposes certain hair follicles to hair loss due to DHT sensitivity would still be present in the cells of those regions, influencing the characteristics of any newly regenerated follicles.\n\n&#x200B;",

    "body": "This post just explains a couple of the meanings behind Yorushika titles. All the information here comes from interviews, lyrics, n-buna or suis themselves, or other official sources.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**ヨルシカ Yorushika**\n\nStarting with the name of the band itself, Yorushika means \"only at night\" and comes from a lyric in Clouds and the Ghost. *yoru shika mou nemurezi ni*. Something like \"now I can only sleep at night\". Ghosts are usually supposed to come out at night, but the one in this song is a bit different because he comes out during the day to search for the girl.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou all might also know of \"night deer\". That was not the intention but it seems like Yorushika has embraced the meaning, putting deer on their Zense merch!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**n-buna and suis**\n\nn-buna, read as ナブナ nabuna, hates being made fun of, so he kept repeating 嬲るな naburu na (don't make fun of me) and eventually it turned into nabuna. As for suis, I don't think there's anything confirmed, but her name likely comes from the French word suis (am, as in \"I am\").\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**夏草が邪魔をする Natsukusa ga Jama wo Suru**\n\nThe title of Yorushika's first mini album, usually translated to \"The Summer Grass is Getting in My Way\". Here, the summer grass is a metaphor for things that prevent you from seeing things clearly.  With so much grass standing in your way, it's difficult to see what lies beyond it. That is the theme of the album.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**負け犬にアンコールはいらない Makeinu ni Encore wa Iranai**\n\n\nYorushika's second mini album. 負け犬 Makeinu can usually be translated to \"underdog\" in English, but Makeinu refers to a dog who runs away after losing a fight. As for the \"encore\", n-buna explains that it is a metaphor for reincarnation (as that is the theme of the album.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**ただ君に晴れ Tada Kimi ni Hare**\n\n Only this one is speculation, but: the title likely comes from a long piece of text you can see towards the end of the music video. The text ends with these two lines:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nこれから先の人生、躓くことなんて当たり前だ。\n\nそれでも、ただ君に、晴れぬ空などないことを。\n&nbsp;\n\nIn our lives from here on out, it'll be natural to stumble.\n\nBut even so, I just wish that never be any sky that isn't clear for you. (I just use \"clear\" instead of \"sunny\" because the lyrics imply that it's more of a nighttime song.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**藍二乗 Ai Nijou**\n\nThe title translates to “indigo squared.” The use of the Japanese word for indigo, 藍 (ai), is also meant to allude to the imaginary number i. i² equals -1, and according to n-buna, this gives the meaning of “you’re not around.” \n\nn-buna has also said that an additional meaning to “indigo squared” is what Amy sees as he looks up to the indigo night sky with his vision blurred by tears, creating a doubled image of the night. This is why Ai Nijou's *official* English title is \"Blur\". Amy's ink is also indigo colored.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**八月、某、月明かり and 夕凪、某、花惑い Hachigatsu, Bou, Tsukiakari and Yuunagi, Bou, Hana Madoi**\n\nBoth these songs have a 某 in the middle of their titles. This word basically means \"a certain...\" and is attached to words as a prefix. For Hachigatsu and Yuunagi, n-buna says that the 某 refers to 某所 bousho (a certain place) and 某日 boujitsu (a certain day) respectively. \n\nAs for 花惑い Hana madoi, the 花 hana (flowers) are meant to allude to 花火 hanabi (fireworks), while 惑い madoi is about being captivated by them.\n\nSo, something like \"August, A Certain Place, Moonlight\" and \"Evening Calm, A Certain Day, Breathtaking Fireworks\".\n\nAnd about the reading of 某, n-buna says you can read it any way you'd like, whether it's \"bou\" or \"nanigashi\" but **not** \"soregashi\", as that would refer to \"a certain person\" which would be a little wrong.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**詩書きとコーヒー Shikaki to Koohii**\n\nI'm just putting this one here because it seems that people are usually unsure how to read the song title. 詩書き is often mistaken for \"utagaki\" but Yorushika has confirmed on their Twitter that it is read as \"shikaki\". It doesn't seem like a word that anyone uses, so I found that even Japanese fans were confused by it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**五月は花緑青の窓辺から Gogatsu wa Hanarokushou no Madobe Kara**\n\n花緑青 hanarokushou, commonly known as paris green, or sometimes emerald green, is a beautiful but toxic green dye. It's the poison that Amy talks about, and he also compares tears to poison.\n\nI think a lot of people mistake the title as saying \"In May, from the Emerald Green *Window*\". However, that is not the window. It is *by the window*, so something like a windowsill. As pictured in Nautilus, there is a bottle of the poison sitting on Amy's windowsill.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**夜紛い Yoru Magai**\n\nThe title \"Yoru Magai\" refers to the time of day when the sunset is fading into the night, and could be mistaken as such. This is why you might see this title often translated to \"False Night\".\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**憂一乗 Yuu Ichijou**\n\nThe title literally translates to \"Sorrow to the power of one.\" If you know math, any number raised to the power of one equals the number itself, so in this title, there is only sorrow.\n\nThis song parallel’s Amy's song, “Ai Nijou” as well, and n-buna has said that the first words of both of these titles are meant to sound like “You” and “I.”\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**神様のダンス Kami-sama no Dance**\n\nWhile it translates to \"Dance of God,\" you've probably seen it translated to \"Dance of You\". In Elma's Diary, she talks about how Amy is the closest thing to god for her.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**昼鳶 Hirutobi**\n\nThis is a kind of thief who sneaks into peoples homes during the day to steal from them, and then runs away. It can be read as either \"hirutonbi\" or \"hirutobi\" but I believe hirutobi is Yorushika's official way of reading it. (at least suis says hirutobi)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**春ひさぎ Haru Hisagi**\n\n春ひさぎ Haru Hisagi is an archaic word for 売春 baishun (prostitution). n-buna says there is a double meaning here. The song can be seen as being about regular prostitution, or an ironic song about selling music like products.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**花人局 Hanamotase**\n\nThe title 花人局 hanamotase comes from the word 美人局 tsutsumotase, but with the first character (美 beauty) being replaced with a 花 (flower). Hanamotase also resembles 花を持たせる hana wo motaseru (to let someone hold a flower).\n\nI'm not sure how to explain a badger game correctly, so here's a dictionary definition: an extortion scheme in which a woman places a man in a compromising position and then victimizes him by demanding money when her male accomplice, pretending to be an outraged husband or relative, enters and threatens violence, scandal, etc.\n\nAs n-buna puts it: In a badger game, you wake up with somebody next to you. In a flower and badger game, you wake up with nobody next to you.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**思想犯 Shisouhan**\n\nA word coined by George Orwell in his novel \"1984\". In the novel, it refers to the crime of having any thought that goes against the beliefs of the government.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**花に亡霊 Hana ni Bourei**\n\nHana ni Bourei was made with this passage by Yasunari Kawabata in mind: “Tell the man who you are parting with the name of the flower. The flowers will bloom without fail each year.” The ghost in the title of the song is like a memory, and that is the fundamental theme of the song. It's like finding memories inside a flower.",

    "body": "*Sorry for the delay - I've made this an extra-large update to make up for it! Oh, and if you're new to this world (Deidreverse?), start at the beginning with [**Part 1!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/6u1sdg/oc_humanitys_place_part_1/)*\n\n_ - _ - _ - _ - _\n\nDeidre wandered in a daze. The corridors all seemed to look the same and she wasn’t really paying attention, so by the time she realized she was nowhere near the hab level, she’d gotten herself thoroughly lost. *A grand beginning for the promised child*, she thought, rolling her eyes. \n\nShe looked around uncertainly, then called up the ship’s guide in her MindCom. A colorful map overlaid itself onto her vision, big icons labeled ‘You Are Here’ and ‘Your Quarters’ appearing on it with reassuring pulses. A route connected the two in red and she followed it dutifully, managing to find her way back to her room after a while. She breathed a sigh of relief as the door slid closed behind her, then leaned against it, still shaken by her life’s drastic upheaval.\n\nShe felt… she didn’t know *how* she felt, actually. By all rights, she should have been elated - recognition for her abilities, a trip to the stars almost a decade before anyone else had ever gotten it - but there were friends back at the Institute, classmates and teachers alike, and a routine she understood and liked. \n\nDeidre went into the closet-like bathroom and stared at herself in the mirror. Her straight black hair was still spotted with dust from the previous day’s attack. She picked a comb off the counter and began to brush it absentmindedly, taking care to avoid hitting her inhibitor. The spiderlike hunk of circuitry embedded in her right temple glowed its usual crippling red. The last constant in her life, it seemed.\n\nShe snorted. The one thing that had always been there to hold her in thrall, shackle her mind… and it had suddenly become a silver lining? \n\n“You’re unbelievable,” she told herself, smiling. \n\nThin lips parted to reveal rows of perfect white teeth; the Institute did a full cosmetic overhaul on new recruits, including dental work. Some of it was intended to ensure a certain level of elegance in the elite of the armed forces. Other items, like Deidre’s eyes, were for identification purposes. \n\nAll psi-potentials had the whites of their eyes, their sclera, dyed an electric azure to mark them as trainees. Deidre had always liked the look. Combined with her natural dark blue irises, she thought it seemed rather striking; genetic reparations for her painfully thin frame, perhaps.\n\nWhen students got older and chose a specialization, their eyes would be re-dyed to match it. The thought gave Deidre pause. If she had no specialty, what color would she get? She doubted she’d ever get to go back to good ‘ol human white, but they’d have to pick *something*… \n\nShe shook her head. She knew she was wasting time. It didn’t matter what color they made her eyes. She had friends and teachers that needed to hear her goodbyes. After all, how could she possibly leave without telling the people she’d built her life around? Sighing, she padded into the living room and activated the screen set into the far wall. Who to call first?\n\n“Activate transmission link to Colonial Institute Arcturus,” she said slowly.\n\n“Link activated. What is your desired connection?” the wall said in a soft feminine voice.\n\nDeidre shrugged. Might as well go alphabetical. “Student listing. Barwick, Amber Louise.”\n“Attempting connection…”\n\nDeidre pulled up a chair in front of the glowing monitor as an animated ‘*Connecting*…’ graphic appeared on-screen. She was probably going to be here a while.\n\n_ - _ - _ - _ - _\n\nThe night seemed to drag on forever, each conversation finding new ways to scrape at Deidre’s emotions. She fell into bed exhausted, only to sleep fitfully in the handful of hours she had left before an alarm woke her at 0800. \n\nDeidre had had good friends, a boy she liked… all gone now. Every exchange had torn her heart out, but even then, she wasn’t quite sure how to feel about *any* of it. She wasn’t a maudlin drama queen or a soulless bastion of self-confidence; didn’t tend to define herself very rigidly in just about anything, preferring instead to go with the flow whenever possible. Life at the Institute had made that sort of thing easy, after all. \n\nIt wasn’t quite the army, but it was still a military school, and there was always someone with all the answers. Deidre basked in being noncommittal, and now that delightful support structure was miles below her, on the surface of a world she might never see again. It had been so easy to let life lead her wherever she was needed, to use her free time to focus on her relationships and abilities instead of worrying about the future.\n\nThat was before the future had tried to kill her, of course.\n\nDeidre’s thoughts turned to the armored woman as she showered and dressed. It seemed clear she had met Deidre before. There was just *something* about the way she’d spoken, some familiarity that was impossible to fake. It was entirely possible they would meet again. *Actually*, Deidre realized, her heart sinking, *we absolutely will*. She was a time-traveler, wasn’t she? And what had Mahsk said that day, just before the woman had vanished? Something about not knowing why the woman hadn’t chosen that particular moment *first?*\n\n*So nice to know she’ll be keeping in touch*, Deidre thought as she fished a breakfast tray out of the wall dispenser.\n \nShe set down her meal and glared at the omelet in its center, half-heartedly hoping it would decide to turn into a Danish. But the woman would have to fail, wouldn’t she? \n\nAfter all, if she hadn’t succeeded in the future, why else would she be here in the present?\n\n \n_ - _ - _ - _ - _\n\n*Note: For those who got hooked by the excerpt I posted a couple weeks ago, it falls here in the storyline. I'm including it for completeness, but if you already know how it goes, skip to the next content break!*\n\n_ - _ - _ - _ - _\n\n \n“Hello, Candidate Veronice,” the scarecrow said in cultured tones. \n\nHe was the tallest unmodified man Deidre had ever seen, and thin as a rail. His arched nose and graying widow’s peak made him look like an ancient noble from a forgotten feudal world. He wore the military fatigues of the Colonial Elite Forces like the robes of an emperor, and made Deidre feel like she should bow. \n\nShe saluted instead.\n\n“Reporting as ordered, sir,” she said, hoping they were the right words. He seemed like a man who was difficult to impress, and easily disappointed.\n\n“Very good. I am Lieutenant Colonel Valkentoff, probabilist grade *nine-point-seven*.” He emphasized that last part very clearly, as if it should matter a great deal. \n\nIt did. \n\nAll mental abilities were roughly quantified on a ten-point scale, with ten, of course, being the highest. What Valkentoff had just told Deidre was that he was one of the galaxy’s most skilled manipulators of the basic laws of chance; the odds that certain key events would happen. The man could use his mind to push at the underpinnings of reality and get things to play out as he desired them. No wonder he seemed egotistic. His glorious golden sclera, auric pools surrounding gray irises, confirmed his specialty.\n\n“So obsessed with numbers. I suppose you’d have to be,” said a feminine voice. \n\nDeidre actually had to look for its owner, and was surprised to realize she’d been standing beside Valkentoff the entire time. The woman was slight and unassuming, somewhat hunched over, with intensely forgettable features that seemed to just… fade away. She had dull brown hair pulled back into a tight bun. Even her CEF uniform looked drab. The only thing about her that stood out was the lush green dye that overpowered the whites of her eyes.\n\n“Major Givens, atcher service. Grats on getting here, Deidre.”\n\n“Um, thank you, Miss- er, Major Givens.”\n\nValkentoff cleared his throat. Givens rolled her eyes. “Oh, yes. Empath, grade nine-point-eight-*nine*,” she said with an impish smile.\n\n“There are only *tenths* of a decimal point in the Scale, Major Givens,” Valkentoff said, scowling.\n\n“God, you’re depressing,” Givens said with a sigh. “Nine-point-eight, then. Still more than you.”\n\nValkentoff scoffed. He seemed to think little of her particular specialty. “Candidate Veronice,” he began, addressing Deidre directly. “Major Givens and I are to be the first of your instructors. We are here to begin your training - your *true* training. You are to become a tool that will ensure humanity’s place among the stars. Are you ready for this responsibility?”\n\n“I… yes. Sir. Lieutenant Colonel,” Deidre said. Something odd pushed at Deidre, encouraging her to respond confidently. She glanced at Major Givens. The empath winked.\n\n“Delightful, but until we help you understand what that actually *means*, they’re just words,” Valkentoff said, waving his hand. The room’s lighting dimmed and the far wall lit up, silhouetting the two officers. The only other light was the red glow from Deidre’s ever-present inhibitor. A detailed galactic map appeared, impossibly vast. More stars than Deidre could visit in a thousand lifetimes. It was a little intimidating. \n\n“How much do you know about the state of the Colonial Empire, Candidate? We are aware of what you’ve been *taught*, but that is not always what one *knows*.”\n\n“The human race achieved faster-than-light travel three hundred and forty-nine years ago through trade with the first known alien race, the Chivalrac,” Deidre repeated in the methodical voice of one quoting from memory. “Since that time, its position in the galaxy has expanded through colonization, diplomacy, and warfare to encompass nearly two hundred systems.”\n\n“Quite right,” Valkentoff said. “And are we doing *well?*”\n\n“Er… ‘well,’ sir?”\n\n“Yes, Candidate. ‘Well.’ Is the human race in a *good* position out here amongst the twinkling stars and enchanting aliens?”\n\nDeidre could feel a trap approaching, but plowed ahead anyway. “As far as I know, yes. The discovery of mental abilities over two centuries ago has helped our cause greatly, as have advances in genetics, nanotechnology, cybern-”\n\n“So you don’t know anything beyond what you’ve been taught, then.” Valkentoff sighed. “As expected. Allow me to educate you, little Candidate, on man’s current position in the galaxy.”\n\nBehind him, a portion of the galactic map near the inner rim of the Orion Arm lit up with semi-connected blue shading. It looked like faint daubs of paint forming an ungainly column on the grand procession of the Milky Way. “Our holdings, of course.” \n\nGreen splotches scattered across the map, loosely clustered in and around the reassuring blue of humanity. “Our allies.” Gray splotches exploded across the map. “Independents and unknowns.” Finally, red seared between the gaps, making the galaxy look like a mismatched Christmas tree. “And our enemies.”\n\nIn all, the galaxy seemed barely colonized. Even with the colorations predicting general empire sizes and holdings by shading in the empty spaces between systems, there was still a great deal left to be discovered. \n\nValkentoff seemed to sense Deidre’s thoughts. “So much more to be had, isn’t there? Well, you can see what 200-odd worlds really means out here, Candidate. *Nothing*. We’re a minor player on the biggest, most unforgiving stage in history. The fact that we show up at all on the map - and this is an official galactic map, mind you - is a feather in our cap. There are plenty of worthless civilizations out there with a mere handful of worlds. Some only have one.\n\n“Humanity is not in a position to be ‘doing’ anything, Candidate. We are not important enough to be *well* - nor have we gained enough to be doing poorly, either. We are still struggling to simply *matter* on a galactic scale. It is an immensely difficult task.”\n\nMajor Givens spoke up for the first time in the presentation. “The other races out there are staggeringly different from us *and* each other, Deidre. Maintaining the level of adaptability needed to combat such an overpowering diversity of customs, technologies, and tactics is something we still struggle with to this day.” \n\nDeidre frowned at that, and the Major held up a hand. “I know, I know - it’s not all bloodshed. You mentioned diplomacy and colonization, and yes, they play their role, but ever since the Vaunt collapsed, the galaxy’s races have been in a state of conflict more often than not. There are opportunities in that chaos, make no mistake, but there are some *very* challenging hurdles to overcome, as well…” \n\nThe screen behind her changed, zooming in to focus on the tiny pocket of humanity in the immensity of the Milky Way. Bars stretched out beside the blue-shaded worlds, each topped with a number - population statistics.\n\n“…the greatest of which is also the simplest: Manpower. No matter how you look at it, we are vastly, *hilariously* outnumbered. We spike the water supplies with fertility drugs, encourage multi-child households like you wouldn’t believe, and crank the cloning factories up to eleven, but it’s still not enough - there are just *too damn many of them*, Deidre.” Givens sighed. “You’d think three hundred and forty-seven billion human-type organisms would be a lot, but space is, I’m sure you’ve heard, incomprehensibly big. We’re like a drop in the damn bucket.”\n\n“A *fraction* of a drop,” Valkentoff said. “Four hundred billion suns fill the Milky Way. If we could be assured complete ownership of a star simply by stationing a *single human being* beside it, we still wouldn’t have enough to conquer this galaxy.”\n\n“Eesh,” Deidre squeaked.\n\nValkentoff nodded gravely. “However, there is one point in our favor, one point you need to be corrected on, Candidate: The discovery of mentalics has not simply ‘helped’ our cause… it is the sole point of uniqueness the human race possesses. We have met aliens that can tap the potential of one field or another, but we have *never* met a race that has access to the array we do. Not a single one has ever been reported as possessing a ‘variety’ of powers, and those with more than even *two* distinct ones are vanishingly rare. There are biorezzers and telepaths out there, probabilists and all manner of kineticists-\"\n\n“Even empaths,” Givens interrupted.\n\n“Yes, yes,” Valkentoff said, waving a hand. “All the fields exist, but they tend to be divided up amongst the races. Except ours. We’ve got them *all*, Candidate - and that’s how we’re going to beat them.”\n\nHe paused, and his tone changed to one of vague caution. “This is, of course, a fact we try to hide; we’d rather not have tentacled horrors prying open our brains to learn what makes us different.”\n\n“Which brings us to you,” Major Givens said softly, extending a petite hand to indicate Deidre. “Do you see now what you represent?”\n\nShe understood. “I’m the first polymath. The first mentalist with more than adequate skill in every field we know.”\n\n“You’re the key, Candidate,” Valkentoff whispered. “We are going to train you to be the most powerful mentalist in existence, and then we will snapshot your mind, clone your body, and stake our claim to the galaxy with a hundred million of your sisters.”\n\nGivens nodded - almost sadly, it seemed. “With your help, we can do it. It all starts with you, Deidre Veronice. Now… are you ready for this responsibility? Truly? Can we trust you?”\n\nShe sounded so earnest, so desirous of reassurance that Deidre was about to answer immediately with another knee-jerk ‘yes’ like before, when she stopped. What was humanity to her? Who were those teeming billions? Was she really willing to dedicate her life to them without even knowing what they were like - *or* anything about the alien races she’d be condemning to servitude or obliteration? \n\nThen she thought of her friends at the Institute, the classmates who would have fought to protect her, or the guardians who died for her without knowing her. They’d never stopped to think about who Deidre was or what she might become - all they knew was that she was their charge, and it was their duty to protect her.\n\nDeidre smiled. Those faceless soldiers hadn’t given their lives for *her*, not really. They were doing their jobs for the Colonial Empire, and the Empire was, hopefully, doing its job for the good of all. They *couldn’t* know Deidre, just as Deidre couldn’t know the barest fraction of mankind - and didn’t need to. She had a responsibility to uphold the *idea* of her species, the thought that humans deserved their place in the stars. If she couldn’t be for humanity in aggregate, then honestly… what *could* she possibly stand for?\n \nSurvival - it was the simplest drive. Deidre could accept that; could train, learn, and, eventually, be duplicated for that.\n\n“Absolutely,” she whispered.\n \n\n\n_ - _ - _ - _ - _\n\n*New material continues here!*\n\n_ - _ - _ - _ - _\n\n \n\nGivens smiled broadly, but Valkentoff merely nodded. \n\n“Good,” he said. “Now, you aren’t expected to become a master of every field, so no need to worry about spending a lifetime in training. Our analysts have charted a set of studies to make you an ideal military asset in as little time as possible. This means some mentalics will be left by the wayside, of course, but by the time we’re done with you, you should have a full suite of offensive and defensive capabilities in both the physical and mental arenas.”\n\n“There’s a bit of a final exam, too,” Major Givens added.\n\nValkentoff glanced at the empath, pausing for the briefest moment. He appeared annoyed at having to share briefing responsibilities with her. “I was just coming to that, yes.” The screen lit up again, displaying a large solar system. At least fifteen planets circled a bright yellow star, many of them in what appeared to be its habitable zone. \n\n“This is Gallio, a particularly desirable system twenty-five light years coreward from our empire’s central holdings. A large number of its planets can support human life with little to no terraforming, it is rich in heavy metals and key industrial materials, and strategically, it would provide the perfect staging ground for expansion into at least eighty-four additional systems.\n\n“The only problem is that it is currently in the hands of the Drijstei.” Valkentoff glared at the screen as it changed to show a rotating model of what looked like a humanoid stick insect. The mottled, brownish creature was thin and gangly, its many rigid appendages studded with too many joints. \n\n“We *will* control Gallio, and a full-scale military operation to accomplish this is currently in the planning stages. The assault is scheduled to occur in several years, precisely when your training is projected to be nearing completion. You will be a key component of the attack, and it will serve to test your potential use on the field.”\n\nMajor Givens nodded, looking very serious. “Always keep it in mind, Deidre - it may be years away, but it’s a massive undertaking, and there’s a *lot* riding on its success,” she added.\n\n“Quite,” Valkentoff said. “In any case, before we get into focusing your skills, we need to complete your education. We’ll go over the basics of our general position in the galaxy over the next few days. You can infodump all the details on the various races we’ve encountered-”\n\n“-and the colonies we’ve established-”\n\n“-er, yes, Major, our holdings, as well as our technologies. I understand your MindCom is the latest model and has all the relevant software updates, so you should have no problem dealing with the data. Now, please direct your attention to this breakdown of our fleet. As you can see, our armed forces are evenly split between…”\n\nDeidre listened, but it was only with half an ear - her attention wavered as the enormity of her role began to dawn on her. That, coupled with the euphoria of being free from her inhibitor, was making concentration extremely difficult. The secrets of the Colonial Empire laid bare? A starring role in mankind’s conquest of the galaxy? It was going to be an incredible day.\n\nThe first, Deidre hoped, of many.\n\n_ - _ - _ - _ - _\n\n**Chapter 2**\n\n**Making the Future**\n\n“What’s this?” \n\nAn image of a centaur-like creature appeared, except in place of a head, it had a mass of fibrous red tentacles, like an animated plate of angel hair pasta. Right below them, a long, thin-lipped vertical mouth filled with sharklike rows of teeth extended down to just above its lower body. Its well-toned legs were covered in short tufts of bristly fur and ended in splayed, claw-tipped, six-fingered feet.\n\n“A heglell,” Deidre said immediately. “Carnivorous. Fast. Highly adaptable, but slow to make intuitive leaps; reactive to a fault. They were allies of convenience while we fought the xrank, but one of our telepaths discovered they wanted to betray us.”\n\n“And why would they do that?” Valkentoff prodded.\n\nDeidre sighed. “For whatever reason, they find humans irresistibly attractive. However, they are simultaneously repulsed by this urge. Unable to reconcile the two, they decided it would be best to remove the temptation from the galaxy.”\n\nMajor Givens chuckled. “They’re deeply religious, too. It would be like an entire civilization of Puritans discovering they’ve got the hots for warthogs. They simply can’t handle it.”\n\nValkentoff shook his head. “Idiots. We took the opportunity to leave them in the lurch when a xrank counteroffensive hit.” He looked at Deidre. “When did that happen? What was the result?”\n\n“Seventeen years ago. While their homeworld was being carpetbombed, we hit the heart of the xrank empire - they know our diplomatic tendency is to be loyal, and expected our forces would be with the heglell. Instead, we shattered their asteroid headquarters and took out their entire ruling council.”\n\n“Two birds with one stone. Then what happened?”\n\nMajor Givens groaned. “You really want her to go through it all? We’ve been at this for a week and a half now. She obviously knows her stuff. At least, her MindCom does, and she’s good at fast-access.”\n\nValkentoff sighed and powered down the wallscreen. The room’s lights came back on. “I suppose so. Enough with the history lessons, then.” He took a hexagonal coin out of his pocket. The Colonial Armed Forces didn’t use money - not internally - so he must’ve gotten it from one of the colonies. \n\n“An Eridanian lender chit. My family’s estates are there. Call it. Heads or tails, please,” he said, turning the coin over to show a weathered portrait of a bearded nobleman and, on the other side, what looked like a hydro-plantation. Rewritable etchings around its edge could be altered to change its balance.\n\n“Heads,” Deidre said with a shrug.\n\nValkentoff flipped the coin. It bounced once on the tabletop and stopped. “Tails,” he announced. “Want to try again?”\n\nDeidre gave the coin an appraising glance, then looked back at the Lieutenant Colonel. “No… I think I know what will happen.”\n\n“Smart girl,” Valkentoff said, not unkindly. “Modifying the outcome of entire battles is a difficult talent to train into someone, but allowing them to pit their skills against a person who *can* is one way to raise them to the necessary level.” He picked up the coin.\n\nMajor Givens got up and began heading for the exit door. “I’ll be spending my days on the rec level ‘til you’re done,” she said as she left. “I hear the *Principle*’s food is excellent.”\n\nDeidre frowned. “Why is she…?”\n\n“I’m going to flip this coin, and you are going to try to win. It will probably take a very, very long time. Shall we begin?”\n\nDeidre narrowed her eyes and focused on the coin. “Yes. Heads.”\n\nValkentoff knocked the chit back into the air with his thumb. It flashed briefly before slamming into the table with a surprisingly deep *thump*. The nobleman’s face showed clearly on top. Valkentoff looked absolutely bewildered for the briefest of moments, then actually let out a bemused chuckle. “Very clever,” he murmured. “Now we’ll try it without the kinesis, yes?”\n\n“Yes, Lieutenant Colonel.” It was nice to know he *did* have a sense of humor in there, somewhere.\n\nHe picked up the coin, held it out, and nodded at Deidre. “Tails,” he said, and flipped it.\n\n_ - _ - _ - _ - _\n\nBeams of energy seared through space, incandescent lines tearing great glowing swaths of destruction along their targets. Missiles, gravity shells, house-sized gauss rounds, and worse passed back and forth across the silent vacuum. \n\nIt was five months since Valkentoff had begun flipping his coin - two weeks since Deidre had won a toss.\n\nShe didn’t know it then, but as they moved on to dice of all shapes and sizes, the *Crimson Principle* began charting a course toward a brewing skirmish with an enkidav assault fleet. \n\nThe enkidav were, to put it bluntly, a race of surgery-obsessed whackjobs. Nobody quite knew what they’d originally looked like, because every single one was a bizarre blend of sculpted skin and flesh. They also happened to be spectacularly vicious toward other two-legged, mammalian races, slaughtering entire colonies and ‘deconstructing’ their physical attributes in order to fuel their insatiable drive to stand apart from one another.\n\nThis made them very unwelcome neighbors.\n\nXenobiologists had theorized that their entire species suffered from an unstoppable mental disorder, a genetic wrench in the works that forced them to eventually feel inadequate about themselves no matter what they changed. \n\nThe Colonial Armed Forces figured obliterating their disdained bodies in a firestorm of ordnance would help to clear things up.\n\nDeepsight oracles had gotten an inkling that the enkidav were hoping to harvest Venetia, a beautiful water colony on the edge of Colonial space. It was a pretty good inkling, too, coming weeks in advance of the attack. A defensive screen had been planned, ships carefully maneuvered into position, and, fifteen minutes ago, when the enkidav attackers leapt into the system… the trap was sprung.\n\n“Being able to alter probabilities is useless without knowing what you want to happen,” Valkentoff said to Deidre as they watched the battle unfold. “You cannot simply ‘hope’ that your side wins. You must have a clear vision of the future in mind. You must know what steps will lead to the victory you desire.”\n\n“Er, all of them exploding seems like a good place to start, Lieutenant Colonel,” Deidre ventured.\n\nThe ghost of a smile flickered across Valkentoff’s lips. “Ah, but which ones? Probability must be wielded like a scalpel. Spread yourself too thin, and you will be unable to affect anything.” He turned away from Deidre and said in a commanding voice, “Heartseeker! Target the two enkidav command vessels.”\n\nThe viewing window flickered and cool blue targeting reticules appeared over a pair of enemy ships as the onboard tactical computer processed Valkentoff’s command. Tactical details scrolled alongside them. They looked like terrifying, spiderlike medical instruments - things that might descend from the ceiling to slice apart your chest. Deidre realized that was probably the desired effect.\n\n“Enkidav always have two leaders. What if one commander is inadequate? They constantly second-guess themselves, you see. Since this is a planetary assault, it’s large enough for each to have their own ship. They will be the most powerful vessels in their fleet - but take them both out, and confusion will destroy the rest. Therefore, *they* are to be the targets of our probabilistic strike.”\n\n“Okay. Do you want to focus on one at a time, or...?”\n\n“We will each take one. Whichever is eliminated first, well… it’s not a perfect contest, but we shall declare its probabilist the ‘winner,’ yes?”\n\nDeidre nodded.\n\n“Excellent. I will take the *Gla’visht* there,” he said as he pointed to the further of the two vessels. “Your target will be… the *Sclaviss Telk*, according to its transponder codes. Ready? Begin.”\n\nThe ship was massive - a sprawling nightmare of fusion-powered metal and glass, laced with enough firepower to obliterate a small colony on its own. Deidre wasn’t entirely sure where to start. Out of the corner of her eye, she watched as a Colonial troopship skimmed along the hull of Valkentoff’s ship and attached itself. Perhaps he planned to have marines destroy it from within? \n\nThe thought gave Deidre an idea. All around the *Sclaviss Telk*, a network of anti-missile defense systems and beam shields was hard at work deflecting the great majority of the attacks aimed at it. If Deidre waited long enough, perhaps the next… yes… a wave of missiles streamed from a long-range Colonial gunship toward her target. Deidre concentrated, and the laser screen around the enkidav vessel shimmered. Its defensive patterns rearranged ever so slightly, its targeting computers became just a hair less accurate, and the missile trajectories wavered only a fraction from their original routes. \n\nAll tiny changes, but the results were spectacular - the barrage tore through the defenses of the *Sclaviss Telk* and crisscrossed its upper hull in a glorious array of fire and shrapnel. Gases hissed into space, and Deidre imagined she could even see little crewmen pirouetting through the air, helplessly clutching at their throats as the vacuum tore the life from them.\n\nThe damage was severe, but localized - Deidre had simply nudged the first available attacks through the flagship’s defenses, and they’d struck its hull in an unimportant area. She would have to wait for another opening in a more critical section if she wanted to truly cripple the ship. The next volley destroyed its gauss banks. The third obliterated its primary missile defense systems. The fight wore on as Deidre directed assaults deeper and deeper into the ship’s hull. A monstrous, incredibly durable thing, it seemed hell-bent on refusing her gentle nudges toward oblivion. \n\n*What can I do to kill you?* she thought, pulling up known enkidav ship designs through her MindCom. *Perhaps a beam attack across its central power relay would-*\n\nWith a searing flare of red-tinged light, the *Gla’visht* blew sky high. Enormous detonations ripped through its superstructure, extending outward from its well-defended core. In seconds, all that was left were sparking hunks of twisted metal winging through the void.\n\n“That came from *inside* the ship!” Deidre squawked. “How could you-”\n\n“Creativity is the soul of probabilistic alteration, Candidate,” Valkentoff said, quirking his eyebrows at her. “I’ll explain my path, but first, lives are being lost - let us mop up your target. I see you’ve pruned away its defenses and pulled a good number of its teeth. Its central power relay-”\n\n“-was going to be my next target, sir!”\n\n“Mm, very good. Let us see it through, then.” Valkentoff furrowed his brow in concentration, and Deidre turned her attention back to the vessel as well. \n\nThere were plenty of options now; with the other command ship destroyed, enough weaponry was coming toward the *Sclaviss Telk* that Deidre had little trouble ensuring a few particularly punishing strikes hit home. Lightning crept from the ship’s damaged interior as its power conduits began to short-circuit. Its lights flickered and went out. Valkentoff was obviously doing something to the backups and safeguards, as the vessel’s emergency power didn’t kick in. \n\nFloating helpless in space, it was easy prey for the Colonial attack fleet. A few more strafing runs and its hull shattered, metal spewing into the darkness. The ship came apart at the seams, minor explosions flinging pieces of the hulk in every direction. Its monitoring readout on the viewscreen went dead.\n\nThe enkidav fleet was extensive, capable of taking out a well-defended world and then some. Hundreds of ships had come to Venetia, from light corvettes and fighter craft to troop transports, carriers, and battlecruisers, all of them armed to the teeth. Even so, with its leaders dead, its forces in disarray, and a full Colonial strikeforce with luck on its side hounding the remnants, there was little hope. Barely twenty minutes after the command ships had perished, the last enkidav vessel disappeared in a bloom of fire. \n\nHer first battle was over.\n\nDeidre was breathing hard from both the rush of adrenaline and the exertion of trying to manage probabilities on such a grand scale. It had been exhilarating. “Now… will you tell me how you did it?” she whispered, watching the remains of her enemies drift through the void. “Sir?”\n\n“Of course,” Valkentoff said, turning to look at her. “I noticed the marine troopship on approach as I discussed the battle. I made certain they were not shot down. Since at least some perception of events is required in order to modify them, I patched into the soldiers’ video feeds through my MindCom. When they boarded the enkidav vessel, I did my best to keep them alive. They were hopelessly outnumbered, of course - beyond even my abilities. All were eventually killed or apprehended.”\n\n“But… then how did you destroy the ship?”\n\n“As I said, killed *or* apprehended. I made certain there were at least some in the latter category. They were taken to the captain, who ordered their faces cut off and their bodies thrown into the core - nonstandard punishment, certainly, but he was feeling particularly vengeful and I provided the extra ‘nudge’ that was required. The soldiers were stripped of their weapons, but one of the enkidav was very… *absentminded*. He somehow overlooked a fusion grenade on one of the demolitionists. When that particular marine was thrown into the core, the charge just happened to activate at the appropriate point in the power cycle and the resulting detonation started a chain reaction that tore the ship apart.”\n\n“Wow.” Deidre smiled, impressed. “That’s great - but how could you have known all that would be worth your time? If even *one* of those events fell apart, you’d have had to start all over again with something else!”\n\nValkentoff glared at her. “You are a probabilist!” he snapped. “You *make your own luck!* Every situation has countless outcomes and alternatives, branching on and on, beyond imagination. My original goal was to have the marines attack the core directly. When that failed, I attempted to get one of them to assassinate the captain. That too, was unsuccessful. They went through *six* of the nine prisoners before I was able to get them to leave an explosive on one and even then, my first choice had been a nanovex plasma trigger. You see? This gift of ours is to sift success from the ashes of chance. Do you understand, Candidate?”\n\n“Yes, Lieutenant Colonel!” Deidre shouted, snapping to attention. \n\nThe rebuke didn’t feel bad at all - in fact, it just helped to crystallize things even further. It was *amazing*. The sheer *freedom* her abilities represented was incredible. She smiled broadly at Valkentoff, glee coursing through her system like warm, electric honey.\n\nThe scarecrowish nobleman did not seem impressed. Instead his features darkened in response to her happiness, brows furrowing and lips turning downward. “Why are you smiling, Candidate?” he whispered, taking a step forward to lean over her.\n\nThe grin on Deidre’s face curdled. “Er, well, it’s just… *wonderful*, sir. Exciting! Having all those chances to do anything you like? It’s-”\n\n“God help me,” Valkentoff muttered, massaging his forehead with a spindly hand. “You’re having *fun?* This is war, child! Let go of the playground and *think*. People died today. *Our* people. Look here!” He turned to the viewscreen in front of them and held out his hand. A data window expanded in front of his fingertips. He swept his arm in Deidre’s direction and the window slid over to float before her.\n\nThere was a two-digit number on it. ‘37.’ Deidre looked at it for a moment, confused, before turning back to Valkentoff. “What does it mean?”\n\n“The *Sclaviss Telk* lasted approximately five minutes longer than the *Gla’visht* - entirely because you were unable to engineer its destruction sooner. In fact, it would likely have been active even longer without my assistance. That number is Heartseeker’s best guess for how many of our people died as a result; how many human beings would still be alive if both ships had been destroyed simultaneously. And you’re *excited?*”\n\nDeidre’s heart plummeted. She’d treated it like a game - a training exercise. Her rush of energy twisted, fell into guilt. What she’d done felt like a betrayal of everything she’d just committed to protecting. She wanted to use her gifts for humanity… and here she was, having a grand time while her kin perished.\n\nValkentoff watched for a few moments while she silently berated herself. When he spoke again, his tone had lost its acid. “You are a study in misinterpretation, Candidate. Again, you have learned the wrong lesson. Do you curse your childish frivolities? Do you feel a failure? Depression is not what I wished to elicit, either. Pick up your chin and look at this.” He held out his hand.\n\nDeidre did as he asked. The number in the box had changed again. ‘2,834.’ She frowned. “Injuries?” she asked tentatively.\n\nValkentoff actually snorted. “Calm down. That is Heartseeker’s estimate of how many lives were saved by your presence here. I could not have destroyed both vessels on my own - not at the same time, anyway. The *Sclaviss Telk* would have been around much longer without your help, and this number reflects the approximate number of deaths that would have been caused as a result. Do you see *now?* Do you finally get it?”\n\n“I…” Deidre’s emotions were in disarray. Guilt? Happiness? Satisfaction? She wasn’t sure how to feel, now. “…no, sir. Sorry.”\n\n“We are in a war of *survival*, Deidre.” Her eyes widened; it was the first time he’d called her anything other than ‘Candidate.’ \n\n“Survival in the face of alien races unknowable, inhuman, and covetous. This war isn’t good. This war isn’t evil. This war simply *is*. If we lose it, we cease to be. Humanity stops. In the eyes of the Colonial Empire, that makes it necessary. *Life isn’t moral*, Deidre, and that’s what this conflict is about. My life, your life… and the three hundred and forty-seven billion others out there. So think about that, the next time you’re excited or depressed by this conflict.”\n\n“Wait, you’re telling me I shouldn’t feel *anything?*”\n\n“Yes, Candidate. That is, in fact, the lesson. You are here to win a war unlike any ever fought back on Earth, and if you become emotional about it, then piece by piece, your soul will start to unravel. So if you must feel something, feel pride - you did your job today. You saved more people than you killed… but you *did* do both, and you *will* do it again. How can you possibly feel responsible for that every day without going insane?” He turned away from the viewing window, from her.\n\n“You want to save humanity?” he asked, his voice soft, bitter. “Find a way to kill yours.”\n\nWith that, he left her there, looking out over the wreckage of the enkidav fleet.\n\n_ - _ - _ - _ - _\n\n*Continued in [**Part 3**](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/6wisb1/oc_humanitys_place_part_3/)!*",

Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.), calling it the “Louisiana MAHA bill”—a reference to his own “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) agenda that aims to crack down on food colorants, food additives, and seed oils.\nPer Senate Bill 14, beginning in 2028, Louisiana public schools and nonpublic school receiving state funds will be prohibited from serving in school breakfasts, lunches, and aftercare meals any foods containing one of 15 ingredients:\n\n- Blue dye 1\n- Blue dye 2\n- Green dye 3\n- Red dye 3\n- Red dye 40\n- Yellow dye 5\n- Yellow dye 6\n- Azodicarbonamide (ADA)\n- Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)\n- Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)\n- Potassium bromate\n- Propylparaben\n- Acesulfame potassium\n- Aspartame\n- Sucralose\n\n\nThe prohibition does not apply to foods sold in vending machines or at concession stands.\nSenate Bill 14 also contains a provision for the disclosure of “harmful ingredients,” which requires labeling of food products to disclose when they contain one of 40+ ingredients, beginning in 2028. The bill also requires foodservice establishments to display disclaimers on their menus or in a visible location when they prepare foods with seed oils (i.e., canola/rapeseed, corn, cottonseed, grapeseed, rice bran, safflower, soybean, and sunflower oils).\n\nRegarding the ingredient disclosure provision, manufacturers must label foods containing any of 40+ ingredients with a QR code directing consumers to a webpage that displays the following disclaimer: “NOTICE: This product contains [ingredient]. For more information about this ingredient, including FDA approvals, click HERE.” The disclaimer must link to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) webpage on food chemical safety. The 40+ ingredients covered by this provision are:\n\n- Acesulfame potassium\n- Acetylated esters of mono- and diglycerides (acetic acid ester)\n- Anisole\n- Aspartame\n- ADA\n- BHA\n- BHT\n- Bleached flour\n- Bromated flour\n- Calcium bromate\n- Canthaxanthin\n- Diacetyl\n- Dimethylamylamine (DMAA)\n- Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DSS)\n- Interesterified palm oil\n- Interesterified soybean oil\n- Lactylated fatty acid esters of glycerol and propylene glycol\n- Lye\n- Morpholine\n- Olestra\n- Partially hydrogenated oil (PHO)\n- Propylparaben\n- Sodium aluminum sulfate\n- Sodium lauryl sulfate\n- Sodium stearyl fumarate\n- Stearyl tartrate\n- Sucralose\n- Synthetic trans fatty acid\n- Thiodipropionic acid\n- Toluene\n- Potassium aluminum sulfate\n- Potassium bromate\n- Potassium iodate\n- Propylene oxide\n- Canthaxanthin\n- Blue dye 1\n- Blue dye 2\n- Citrus red dye 2\n- Green dye 3\n- Red dye 3\n- Red dye 40\n- Yellow dye 5\n- Yellow dye 6\n- Certified food colors by FDA\n\nAlthough several states have passed bills inspired by MAHA in recent months—such as Oklahoma, Texas, and West Virginia—the movement is controversial. Some stakeholders have disputed MAHA claims, calling them “an oversimplification without a clear understanding of the myriad complexities facing the production of safe and nutritious foods” that “ignores current food and animal food regulatory systems designed to promote public and animal health.”",

Great game; go buy it.\n\n[Previously, on Blessed are the Simple](http://redd.it/39s0i7)\n\n[Blessed are the Simple wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/series/blessed_are_the_simple)\n\nOh, only did a single edit pass because I'm impatient. Feel free to point out any issues you have.\n\n---\n\nMajor Victor Lazzario, commander of the illustrious First Sky Knight Squadron, the “Blizkem Vruguls,” or “Lightning Wings” in the ancestral Luchjiken tongue, sat atop his war drake, a rather large and faithful specimen who was easily identifiable thanks to the yellow metallic luster of his tail feathers. The wind whistled in his ears as it streamed across the edges of his helmet, mixing with the sound of 24 drakes pumping their wings to create a heart-stopping song of aerial domination that could make any sky knight's heart swell with pride. Major Lazzario's lips curled into a feral grin; he and his war beast both knew that blood was soon to follow their song.\n\n“Men!” roared Major Lazzario, turning his head to see his knights riding in perfect formation behind him. “My brothers and sisters! My fellow Luchjiken Sky Knights! Are you ready for war?!?”\n\n“HO-AH!”\n\n“Are you ready dominate the battlefield?!?”\n\n“HO-AH!”\n\n“ARE YOU READY TO MAKE HISTORY?!?” Major Lazario cried, grasping his lance and holding it high in the air.\n\n**“HO-AH!!!”**\n\n**“WITH ME! ATTACK!”**\n\nThe commander of the First Sky Knight Squadron slammed the visor down on his helmet before kicking his drake into a dive, the flying lizard tucking in its wings, turning itself and its rider into a living missile of steel and scales. The wind howled now past him, sapping the warmth from his body as the major led his squadron into the first dive attack on the unsuspecting fort below. He gripped his lance and held it higher than one would have if riding a horse; the forces of his beast leveling out from his dive would pull his lance on target, skewering or knocking some unsuspecting soldier off the fort's walls.\n\nFort Aerinus was built long ago at the southern mouth of Blue Steiner Valley, before the wars that gave birth to the Sun Elf Triumvirate, and was meant to keep the land armies of the norther riders from pillaging the farms in the steppes south of rocky foothills. When the three sun elf nations joined in an alliance, the old fort built from gray stones became nothing more than a border post to regulate traffic between the two kingdoms.\n\n“FOR LUCHJIKEN!” yelled the major, moments before his own beast unleashed its war cry, unfolding its wings at the last second to arrest its downward momentum.\n\nMajor's Lazzario's lance was spot on, sending one unlucky soldier plummeting over the walls, screaming the final moments of his life when he realized he was about to hit the ground. The soldier patrolling the fort's wall next to him was not so fortunate; he discovered just how sharp the claws of an alpha drake could be when the beast rent him into a bloody mess.\n\nAnd thus it was of great surprise for the Aurequeran soldiers, who at most were used to dealing with petty thieves and smugglers, to wake up that summer morning to the sounds of the dawn watch screaming and dying. Those who quickly mustered from the barracks were shocked to find the legendary Sky Knights of Luchjiken strafing their battlements with lighting and fire, the first-rate knights easily dispatching the unprepared second-rate soldiers. \n\nDivided into six flights of four knights, the knights of the Luchjiken's First Squadron attacked in waves and from every direction, their coordination ensuring that the hapless defenders could never find cover or respite from the flames of the drakes or the magic of the riders. Those that were forced out into the open were quickly slaughtered, either by claw or by lance. Cries of anguish and death soon gave way to the screeching roars of drakes hunting their prey, as well as the crackle of mage-fire across the battlements, the flames consuming the dead and wooden structures within the walls with equal hunger.\n\n“Let none get away!” ordered Major Lazzario as he brought his great beast to land on top of the central keep of the fort, now littered with the burning and eviscerated bodies of the fort's defenders.\n\nLeaping from the back of his drake before drawing his sword and shield from his saddle, the veteran knight whistled to the great lizard and pointed to the walls of the fort. With a low grumble, the beast nodded before taking flight once more, freeing up space for the rest of Major Lazzario's flight to land and dismount. Taking a moment to look over the ramparts and to the field to the south, the Luchjiken knight could see the other three flights sweeping the steppes, attacking and corralling the few who managed to escape during the initial onslaught.\n\nThey had hoped that with the early morning attack they would be able to minimize any civilian casualties. In order for this blitz to work, the senior officers of the Luchjiken military deemed it necessary to silence all individuals, military or otherwise, that could send word inland of their attack. And judging by the number of burning wagons and dead horses, their decision to attack at the crack of dawn was the correct one. A shame that drakes had notorious night vision; the major felt that a night attack would have surely reduced the amount of burning wagons to a number he could count on one hand.\n\n“Are we all here?” called Major Lazzario, banishing the thoughts from his mind and turning back to his knights.\n\n“Yes sir!” the sky knights of First and Second Flights answered as one.\n\n“Then let's get in there and fish these bastards out!” ordered the knight as he drew his sword.\n\n“HO-AH!”\n\nMajor Lazzario and the seven knights slipped into Fort Aerinus, wreaking havoc among the defenders who were busy trying to fend off the drakes who were breathing fire into any window or opening that they could find. With more administrative personnel than actual soldiers, the defenders could do nothing but surrender or crumple against the heavy shock troopers, whose armor and blades quickly ran red with the blood of the Aurequer soldiers.\n\nBefore the sun was at its zenith, Major Lazzario stood in the square of the fort, staring proudly at his kingdom's colors flying high above Fort Aerinus. Above, he could see the other sky knight squadrons flying south to their own targets, while in the valley to the north, he saw a slow moving dust cloud, the tell-tale sign of the Luchjiken Army on the march.\n\n---\n\nVeela walked down the open air market of Academy Town with a bag of groceries in one arm. Nicknamed “the White Maiden” by the merchants of the growing town on account of her silver hair and preference for white dresses, the priestess had long ago become familiar with the town's residents in the same way the townspeople quickly became familiar with her husband in his imposing black armor. Of course, while he became famous through his frightening demeanor, initial casual acts of property damage, superb work ethic, and his midnight black armor, Veela became well-known for being quite the opposite; often garbed in white, billowing dresses accentuating her eye-catching features, the young woman was polite, quiet, and in the words of many of the housewives, “adorably ignorant and more than happy to help with her magic, and humble to boot.” Of course, Veela was very careful not to let anyone know that she was a fae elf – slander traveled both ways between the fae and the city elves, and she was well aware of how long it took to convince the young Helen that she meant the girl no harm.\n\nPassing a town crier in one of the Academy Town's many fountain squares, the white maiden dropped a coin in the young beast-child's basket before accepting the week's newspaper with a smile. Dropping the paper into her bag, she continued on her way up the hill where the academy sat, overlooking the burgeoning town. Months ago, when she was still trying to learn letters, Veela was amazed by the utter *convenience* that the city elves enjoyed; things like the town criers and the sheer abundance and variety of food that they enjoyed were foreign marvels to the priestess. Today, however, her mind was not focused on the glamour and differences of city life, but instead was occupied by the conversation she had with her husband the previous night.\n\nVeela told Seeksvotu not to worry about his master who recently took hr first steps on the path of the warrior. If Elenore had been born a fae elf and they were in Sanskra, then Veela would simply carry out her duties as the priestess of Seeksvotu and lead the girl's First Spear Ceremony during the next summer solstice. Alas, Elenore was not a fae, and Veela wasn't sure if the headstrong girl would even agree to having such a ceremony. To begin with, the fae priestess didn't even know what the girl, or the city elves in general, worshiped. Despite living among the city elves for eight months, the closest thing she to a temple that she'd seen were these places called “reflectives;” large, ornate buildings of various styles where people went to think in silence, sometimes in solitude, sometimes in groups, but usually at some regular interval that they were comfortable with.\n\n*It's a shame that I had to leave Dia to take up my duties at home. If she was here, I know she would have an idea on how to reach out to Seeksvotu's master,* thought Veela with a sigh.\n\nContinuing down one the main avenue that lead straight to the academy gates, the movements of two youths putting some kind of sign up caught Veela's eyes, her curiosity driving her to stop and watch. Unlike Sanskra, the significantly larger Academy Town featured things called “bulletin boards,” which were large, blank boards posted in the larger fountain squares for residents to post various things like work requests or outstanding news from other cities. Up until recently Veela paid them little attention, as she still had difficulty reading quickly and was simply much more comfortable talking with the housewives and merchants to obtain the same information.\n\nTheir task finished, the two youths picked up their pails, brushes, and large rolls of paper, off to another bulletin board. While there were few who paid a passing glance at the boys' work, Veela was hypnotized. Paints and dyes were always difficult to come by in the fae lands; thus to the priestess, the brightly colored sign was a first for her. Entranced by the painted images of smiling, happy people in similarly colorful clothing, Veela's eyes lingered on the picture of happiness before brushing over the carefully painted words at the bottom.\n\n“Celebrate... Summer... Solstice... With... Us... Fire... Works. Fireworks? After... Dusk...” Veela whispered to herself as she read the foreign words out loud.\n\nVeela stopped to fully comprehend the sentence she just read, before smiling to herself.\n\n---\n\n“Hello? Hadrian? Did you hear what I said?”\n\n*\\Snap!*\\\n\n“Huh? Wha?” muttered the young man, blinking rapidly while wiping the tears from his eyes.\n\nIt took the once-prideful, now perpetually-exhausted student researcher several seconds to get his bearings, remember that he was in the usual study room, that the sun should be falling and not rising at this time, and that he was pretty sure that it was just him, the princess, and Jenny working on their studies, and not the prior three with Elenore, Helen, Yovan, and his familiar surrounding the long study table. That last issue took considerable amount of time for the young man to fully process, as there were six people in the study room instead of just three. Seven, if he included his purple eyeball thing sitting in the corner.\n\n“I'm sorry,” Hadrian said as he rolled his neck. “I think I was asleep.”\n\n*Master, the shiny gold hair lady asked if you wanted to go with them to the summer thingy,* a familiar yet alien voice whispered in his mind.\n\n“How? Your eyes were open,” said Elenore.\n\n*It's true, Master. Weyeball even poked into your mind, but it was all pishhhhhh!*\n\n“I guess I zoned out,” said Hadrian sheepishly. “It's been happening a lot lately. But I feel like we're getting real close to something, right Yovan?”\n\n“Yes. Like learning how to sleep while standing and becoming masters at disposing those *things* that keep dropping out of the window,” the similarly exhausted effeminate young man said while leaning against the wall.\n\n*You still haven't told the shiny gold hair lady if you want to go the summer thingy,* Weyeball gently reminded his summoner.\n\n“Right,” said Hadrian, pretending to ignore the one-sided telepathic conversation he was having. “What were you saying while I was, umm, out?”\n\n“She wants you to join us at the Summer Solstice Festival,” answered Princess Leliana from behind a book. “Is that right?” she asked just as she furiously scratched out the majority of her classical theory work with a scowl.\n\n“That's about it,” said Elenore, nodding sagely. “Uh, Princess, do you by chance need help?”\n\n“OH PLEASE HELP ME ELENORE,” cried the raven-haired beauty in desperation as she prostrated herself on the table.\n\n“Hey, before we go on *another* tangent,” interjected Helen, finally making herself known from the wall she shared with Yovan. “But will you finally give us your answer, Hadrian?” she said with an irritated tone.\n\n“THE FESTIVAL MOTHERFUCKER, WILL YOU GO?!?” shouted Yovan as a follow up, slamming his hands down onto the table.\n\n“...”\n\n“...”\n\n*That was weird,* the familiar commented.\n\n“... Yeah, I'll go,” answered Hadrian, ending the awkward silence.\n\n*Hooray! Playing with the pretty gold lady!*\n\n“Which reminds me, why is my familiar here?” asked the shadow elf while glaring at the strange single-eyed creature.\n\n“We were looking for you, and your familiar said he knew where you were,” answered Elenore, now hanging over Princess Leliana's shoulder in an attempt to help her with her studies.\n\n“And this guy didn't know?” Hadrian asked, pointing to the other man in the room who wore a sheepish grin.\n\n“They found me first, since I was in the familiar stables,” answered Yovan.\n\n“Yes, where you were brushing your fire fox with a zombie-like expression on your face,” corrected Helen as she mimicked her classmate's empty face.\n\n“Madame Swiftfowl is a harsh taskmaster,” countered the scholar.\n\n“It's true,” affirmed Hadrian as he propped his arm against the table and planted his face in his hand. “Now if that's all you need from me, I'm going to go to sleep now,” he muttered. “Wake me up in 20.”\n\n*Praise me! And go sleep in bed! Bed much better! Very soft!*\n\n“Yes, you're a good boy Weyeball. Now please be quiet.”\n\nThe strange purple creature made a pleased buzzing noise after being complimented by his master. With Elenore busy tutoring Princess Leliana, Yovan leaning against the wall with his own blank and empty gaze, the mischievous Helen decided to inspect the summoned beast, curious about Hadrian's seldom-seen familiar.\n\n“What a weird little guy,” she said, engaging in a staring contest with the two-legged eyeball creature. “So Hadrian, how come you never told us that your familiar can speak telepathically?”\n\n“Never asked, always figured it was the same for everyone, except for maybe Lambda,” he answered curtly.\n\n“Does that mean he can hear your thoughts?”\n\n“Only if I think really hard at him,” muttered Hadrian, his heavy eyelids slowly descending on his vision. “Kind of weird to do, actually.”\n\n“So you can use him to send one-way messages then,” concluded Helen as she held a finger dangerously close to Weyeball's single, massive eye.\n\n“You shouldn't do that...” Hadrian whispered, the last thing he saw before the rejuvenating darkness fell was the fiery girl about to be bitten by his familiar.\n\n“Hey, shouldn't you stop her?” asked Elenore, her voice filled with concern and amusement.\n\nHadrian, meanwhile, simply mumbled something incoherent, as his mind was once again at rest. That rest would soon be shattered by Helen shouting and cursing after being bitten by his purple familiar. That rest would quickly be resumed after Elenore ordered the two male fourth year students to bed, which to her surprise, was obeyed immediately and without any fuss from Hadrian. \n\n---\n\n“Master, you're here!” exclaimed Mikhail. “But what happened to your wings?”\n\n“Hello, Brother Mikhail,” the angelic man said, bowing courteously. “Didn't I tell you not to call me that?”\n\n“What? Oh, yes, of course!” the devotee to the Circle of the One answered hurriedly. “But more importantly, your wings!”\n\nHitchcock sighed. “Yes, yes, my wings. But first, let us go somewhere a bit quieter, no?”\n\nThe angelic man in purple robes moved without waiting for a response from his companion, knowing full well that he would obediently follow. Perhaps a year ago, the sight of a man clothed in purple robes would have drawn stares and suspicion. These days, men in purple robes marked by  two concentric circles crossed by two lines embroidered in gold or black were frequently seen throughout the Kingdom of Aurequer; and while men robed as Hitchcock was were still a rather rare sight, it was becoming increasingly common to see men and women of all walks of life wearing simple jewelry sporting the two circles.\n\nHowever, walking down the lesser-known avenues of Academy Town, the two men drew stares for a different reason. First and foremost, Hitchcock was undeniably handsome in a gentle sort of way. Second, hooded men in all black always stick out like a sore thumb, especially during a hot summer day, and Mikhail Blackspine was one such thumb. Third, they were followed by a small group of silent, emotionless individuals, among which were two children.\n\n“Here we are,” said the angelic leader of the Circle of One as he led the small group into a rather empty cafe. “Table for two, Phillip,” Hitchcock cheerfully said to the store owner.\n\n“Of course, Mister Hitchcock,” the store owner courteously answered, the two-circle necklace dangling around his neck catching the rays from the dying sun as he made a slight bow.\n\n“You're not taking them inside?” asked Hitchcock, gesturing to the figures shuffling about outside the little cafe.\n\n“While it's easier to maintain control over them when they're close, at times like this it's less stressful to give them a little control over themselves and a general order to stay in the vicinity.”\n\n“Wouldn't that make it harder for you to maintain control using your rare gift?” asked the cult leader just as Phil returned with drinks for the two men.\n\n“Aye,” answered Mikhail, eyeing the storekeeper warily. “But it keeps them from completely rotting in the head. But never mind me. Your wings -”\n\n“Hitchcock.”\n\n“Hitchcock, yes,” Mikhail said, nodding vigorously. “Your wings are gone.”\n\nThe angelic man sighed, his facial expression a painting that would certainly move any women who saw it. “Mikhail, did it ever occur to you that having wings sprouting out of my back would be very inconvenient if I, say, wanted to sit down on a long seat such as this one,” he said, gesturing with his hands to the leather bench wide enough for two. “Or,” he continued, “if I wanted to lay down and sleep?”\n\n“I...”\n\n“Never thought about it?” completed Hitchcock with a warm smile. “It's to that end that I learned to retract them. It's a bit troublesome to do so, but it lets me go about without drawing too much attention to myself.”\n\n“Of course, my lo-er, Hitchcock,” said the man in black, nodding in understanding.\n\n“Now, about why we're here,” said Hitchcock, taking a moment to drink from his glass. “Oh, this is good,” he sighed.\n\n“Umm... Hitchcock?”\n\n“I'm sorry, my friend,” the silver haired man said, apologizing profusely and flustering his subordinate. “It's just that being able to go out into the world and enjoy simple things such as this is a rare luxury.”\n\n“I'm sure it is,” said Mikhail, slightly unnerved by the rather honest behavior of his master. “But...?”\n\n“Yes, of course, business,” said Hitchcock as he sat up straight and cleared his throat. “There is someone who has caught my eye. A young woman.”\n\nMikhail's eyes bulged in shock. “A woman?!?”\n\n“Calm down,” Hitchcock said patiently. “It's not what you think. I've been looking for someone like her for some time now, and I believe that we can use her in the future.”\n\n“Oh. So you don't see her that way. But you don't want me to kill her?” asked the cultist, an eyebrow raised in confusion.\n\n“No. I have something else in mind for you. An opportunity will make itself available rather soon, in which I need you to make trouble for the young lady.”\n\n“Beg your pardon, but what's the purpose of causing my kind of trouble for her?”\n\n“Why, it's to help her realize the true nature of her familiar.”\n\n“And what's so special about her familiar?”\n\nHitchcock gave Mikhail one of his angelic smiles.\n\n“Do you remember the human?”\n\n---\n\nHigh boots, a green skirt, a breezy, v-cut white tunic beneath a brown vest that was both utilitarian and stylish. Spinning before the mirror, Elenore could only smile at her assembled look; for nearly five months, the young noble was forced to wear nothing but uniforms and those boring school robes.\n\n“I think I'm missing something... ah!”\n\nElenore skipped over to her vanity, dropping herself down on her seat before rummaging through a jewelry box. She smiled when she pulled two ornate silver earrings containing green gems the shape of teardrops. Elenore knew that they weren't emeralds; they were some kind of semiprecious stone, she knew that much, at least. Regardless, she liked them anyway and put them through her piercings in her ears, sighing with relief knowing that the time spent without any kind of earrings in the past months hadn't caused her piercings to close.\n\nHumming to herself, Elenore happily applied her limited cosmetics to her face. It had been far too long since she was able to feel like a proper girl for once, a fact that she wasn't entirely sure she resented. Sure, she missed using the knowledge her mother taught her to make herself look pretty on a regular basis, but at the same time she had come to appreciate the “male morning routine involving minimal effort” that she experienced as a Royal Scout Cadet.\n\n“Hey Elly, are you ready yet?” called Helen from the other side of her door before knocking.\n\n“Don't you usually knock *before* you start yelling?” retorted Elenore as she put away her make up.\n\n“Well, I wouldn't have to knock if *someone* would hurry up!”\n\n“Fine, fine!”\n\nElenore pushed herself from her vanity and walked the short distance to the door of her room, pulling it open. For a moment, her eyes widened at the sight that greeted her, before a warm smile graced her face.\n\nThe whole gang had gathered – Princess Leliana, Sergeant Jessica, Jenny and her boyfriend Marcus, Hadrian and that girly-looking friend of his, Helen, and of course, Lambda and Veela.\n\nPrincess Leliana, of course, was the very picture of the latest fashion trends, wearing a blue one piece topped with a black beret. Helen wore a tunic with a dangerously low cut and simple, leather trousers that were rolled up slightly above her ankles in defense against the evening heat; despite wearing traditionally masculine clothing, Elenore couldn't help but note that Helen still managed to find clothes that brought out her sex appeal. Veela seemed to wear something that did quite the opposite. The pale fae elf wore a strange, red gown with an embroidered floral pattern with a black sash tied about her waist and the long end wrapping around her back and hanging over her shoulder; while it was certainly beautiful with the vivid colors contrasting fantastically against Veela's skin, Elenore felt that it concealed the older woman's femininity to a degree. Jenny, in one of her usual frilly dresses, was on a completely different spectrum than both Helen and Veela, the pink and lace giving the short demure girl an air that seemed exclusive to women of her stature and youthful appearance.\n\n“You ready to go yet?” asked Hadrian impatiently. “I want to hit up that fried potato stall before they get crowded.”\n\n“Fried potatoes?” asked Sergeant Jessica. “What's so special about that?”\n\n“Well, there's cheese, there's cream, there's fried pork bits in there...” trailed Yovan, tapping his fingers with each feature mentioned.\n\nElenore felt a hand rest on her shoulder. Turning her head, she found the fiery red-head giving her a look of sympathy; a gesture that Elenore returned with a sigh of resignation. They were boys; this kind of behavior was to be expected. The men of their group, Sergeant Jessica included, appeared to put only a minimal effort into making themselves look presentable. Sergeant Jessica and Marcus both wore unremarkable casual clothes made slightly unusual by how sharply pressed they were, while Hadrian's friend wore well worn and comfortable casual clothing beneath his robes. Hadrian looked as if he made some effort into his attire; while still casual, his trousers, shirt, and vest were still more formal than what his friend wore, and were at least color-coordinated.\n\nLambda, on the other hand, wore something Elenore had never seen before. While it still carried that air of utilitarianism that everything he owned gave off, the buttoned shirt he wore simply felt more appropriate than the dress uniform he once wore or the usual sleeveless shirts he seemed to prefer. He still wore the baggy fatigue pants and boots as usual, causing the elf to briefly wonder if his choice of his attire was shaped by his own personal tastes as much as it was by a lack of tailors and shoe makers with experience in making anything Lambda-sized.\n\nElenore glanced at Veela, who seemed to be intently listening to the two young men's description of the various foods to be consumed at the festival. Perhaps she could ask the silver-haired woman if she could press Lambda into learning about elven fashion in the future? Then he could teach Hadrian as well.\n\n“You guys are making me hungry,” spoke Princess Leliana as she folded her arms. “Can we go now?”\n\nHelen laughed as she led the group out of the dormitory. “If I didn't know any better, I'd say you're a bit peckish, no?”\n\n“This is the first time I've been to a festival like this,” the princess admitted shamelessly. “I want to try eating the stuff the regular citizenry get to enjoy.”\n\n“Is that why your handmaid isn't here?” asked Hadrian before getting elbowed by Elenore after being caught staring one second too long into an open room they passed.\n\n“Actually, she let me have a pass for tonight, considering it's the first time that I'll be able to experience one of these things without an armed escort or someone breathing down my neck and watching my every move,” said the black-haired girl. “Plus, she's on a date,” she continued, sticking out her tongue impishly.\n\n“Good for her,” said Hadrian dismissively as he rubbed his ribs.\n\n“So Sergeant Jessica doesn't count?” asked Elenore, turning back to find the dark-skinned and usually terrifying sergeant strolling along with the rear of the group. “And what about security?”\n\n“I never count,” answered the woman with a smile.\n\n“And we have Lambda here to protect us!” chimed the princess. “Right Lambda?” Princess Leliana said, turning around to stare at the human with a hopeful expression.\n\nLambda, meanwhile, far from having his usual neutral face, had his brows furrowed in deep thought, his mouth twisted as he pondered something profound. Or, as Elenore was guessing, something incredibly simple.\n\n“...Yes,” her familiar answered absentmindedly. “Hadrian, Helen, what does one do at a 'festival?'”\n\n“Have fun,” answered the young master, trying so very hard not to laugh at her familiar while Lambda's two consultants failed to contain themselves.\n\n---\n\nIf it was one thing that Lambda and his brothers were envious of, it was the food that the regulars were given. While it was uncommon, some supercommandoes would find themselves attached to regular units during missions for extended periods, often while out in the field. When meal time inevitably came, of course the soldiers would share and trade their food, either in a mess hall or around a small thermal unit. And in every case, the supercommandoes would find that the nutrient tubes, or “soylent green” as one regular had come to call Lambda's food, paled in comparison to the MRE's given to the free born soldiers, even when those same soldiers themselves complained of the quality of their own food.\n\nListening to the complaints of the regulars, it was inevitable for this envy to extend to civilians, who had much more freedom and time in preparing and choosing their meals. And thus, when Lambda was told that eating was a big part of enjoying a festival, he was considerably more eager to participate in an event celebrating something as irrelevant as a solstice.\n\nThe smells alone were tantalizing; spices, oils, meats, vegetables and fruits, for a man who's subsistence while growing up consisted primarily of water and nutrient pastes whose flavors were described with strange names such as “green #2,” it was both heaven and hell. When the group finally stopped at the stall with the potato-things, Lambda could barely contain himself. Yes, he had become acclimated to the smells and sights of the open air markets of Lambroa and Academy Town, and in the latter, had managed to sample nearly everything the town had to offer. But the foods he saw that night were beyond those; they were colorful and exotic, the smells inviting and enticing.\n\n“Lambda, are you crying?” the prideful ex-ranger asked between mouthfuls of his own potato-thing.\n\n“I won't lie,” admitted the human, letting a few tears roll from the corners of his eyes as he sent himself to heaven with another morsel of his food.\n\n“You like?” asked Veela, herself taking from the human's plate.\n\nLambda nodded vigorously while grinning.\n\n“It's good, but is it really *that* great?” asked his commander, poking at her own plate.\n\n“Well, I can certainly see the appeal,” added the princess as she daintily ate her own portion. “Though I can see how eating this every day would kill you,” she said, pulling some of the fried tuber away from the gooey mass and watching the melted cheese strings fall away.\n\nThe group continued to eat and talk in this manner as they made their way through the main avenue of the Academy Town, slowly migrating towards the town center to watch the fireworks. For Lambda, it was a dizzying experience; the sights, smells, and tastes an orgy to his senses as he continued to eat, long after the others proclaimed themselves full. Good music, good food, and good company; a combination so rare to the human super soldier that he inadvertently dropped his guard.\n\n---\n\n“This is all too familiar,” muttered the man in black who stood upon the lonely rooftop terrace.\n\nOverlooking the festivities below, he couldn't help but smirk at the idea that the same events that he created almost a year ago were going to be repeated tonight. Same actors, slightly different plan, but a wholly different desired result, although the pile of bodies of his thralls would be constant. The roles were rearranged, too; furthermore, there were more actors this time around. Oh, and he managed to make off with a good amount of black powder from the fools doing the fireworks display. That was going to make things fun.\n\nHolding up his wand like a baton, Mikhail hummed to himself as he began to issue orders and move his pieces below. A shame that he would have to sacrifice the children so early, and in a ploy that *wouldn't* end with the giant dead. Truly, a shame, but orders were orders, and he doubted any others among Hitchcock's inner circle could get the job done.\n\n“Hand on... shit, they're moving.”\n\nMikhail grumbled to himself as he quickly relayed new orders. It looked like the girl and her giant managed to buy themselves a few more minutes of peace.\n\n“I can work with this,” he said to himself as he left the terrace to find a better vantage point.\n\n---\n\n“Is there something you want to talk about?”\n\nElenore called out to Veela as she shifted through the basket of cheap hand-made jewelry. She clicked her tongue in annoyance when she pulled another bracelet with the name “Eleanor.” Evidently finding one of those little bracelets with her name spelled properly on it would be impossible, a fact that the young woman had known for over a decade.\n\n“Yes,” answered the pale woman, who came up besides the young commander to inspect some wood and metal earrings. “Lambda said you were worried about something after your last mission?”\n\nElenore paused just as she moved on to the rings, closing her eyes and sighing heavily. “Yeah, I've had something on my mind. I was hoping that I could distract myself with the festival tonight,” she said. “Guess I was wrong. Those fireworks only made things worse,” she muttered under her breath.\n\n“If you clear it up now, wouldn't you be able to enjoy the rest of the festival much better?”\n\n“I suppose that's true,” said Elenore in agreement. “It's just – I don't know. It feels weird to realize that I didn't feel anything. Thank you very much,” she quickly said to the shopkeeper as she exchanged her coins for a carefully selected crimson and silver hairpiece.\n\n“It just means that you have a strong heart,” said Veela as she followed the girl from the stall back into the streets.\n\n“Not being remotely affected by taking the life of another seems to indicate a lack of heart. And I don't think I'm used to it either, because the first time... well, I wasn't really aware of it.”\n\n“You're not used to it. The headhunters at home, even after several successful Pale One hunts, were seldom used to seeing the dead. Not until after many, many hunts.”\n\n“I don't have 'many hunts' under my belt, Veela,” Elenore responded with a snarky reply.\n\n“But you are not wearing a belt?” said the priestess, tilting her head as she stared at the girl's waist.\n\n“No I didn't mean – it's an expression. It means to have experienced something. You've heard of that expression before?”\n\nVeela shook her head in confirmation.\n\n“Well, never mind that,” said Elenore dismissively. “On top of that, I saw Lambda fight those champions, and...”\n\n“It was glorious?”\n\n“I'd rather say bloody,” she corrected the fae elf with a wry smile. “But no, it wasn't just how *brutal* it was; I'm not entirely surprised by that kind of thing from Lambda. It's just... he looked like he enjoyed it. Like he wasn't bothered by that kind of thing at all.”\n\n“It's because it was necessary,” said Veela as she put a reassuring hand on the younger woman's shoulder. “That is why Lambda is a warrior. He does what is necessary, as was taught to my kin long, long ago.”\n\n“But that doesn't mean he has to enjoy it,” Elenore said as she led the two to sit at the edge of a nearby fountain.\n\n“Perhaps,” said Veela in a motherly tone. “But that doesn't mean that you enjoyed it either, no?”\n\nElenore blinked as the words of the foreign woman hit her. With wide eyes, she turned to see the woman clad in red, sitting next to her, a bright and warm smile on her face. Not like her mother, no. More like how Sergeant Jessica would sometimes smile at the princess' antics.\n\n“But it still doesn't change the fact that I didn't feel anything at all,” she said, her pessimism slamming back into her.\n\n“Elenore,” Veela gently said as she reached out to hold the worried girls' hands. “As I said, it means you have a strong heart. You are the master of Lambda. Like him, you are a natural warrior. It is not your nature to question what you believe to be right and to show any more remorse than necessary.”\n\n“But I didn't show remorse at all.”\n\n“Then what are you doing now?” asked the priestess patiently. “I am the priestess of Seeksvotu. It has always been my duty to teach the warriors of Sanskra, and to assist them spiritually. What you do now is just another form of remorse.”\n\nElenore's eye's widened once again. Not simply because of what Lambda's wife was saying, but because she was typically rather quiet and demure. At that moment, she felt like she was someone she could trust her deepest, darkest secrets to.\n\n“You think you are upset because you didn't react. That is only some of the truth. You are mostly upset because you have realized how truly fragile life is, and that you have the strength to take it. City elves such as yourself often believe that life is a sacred, precious thing. That you can destroy such a thing so easily scares you; just as the fact that you have already done so does. Your nature as a warrior, however, makes you refuse to acknowledge that your rightful actions were wrong; thus in your mind you focus on some lesser truth to ignore what truly confuses your heart.”\n\nElenore continued to stare at the older woman. It made sense, in a strange sort of way.\n\n“We all say that killing is wrong. Yes, I have heard there are other nations in this world, and each one has soldiers who are ready to kill to save their people. If it is so wrong, then why do we honor our warriors so?” asked Veela, a cryptic smile on her face. “Life begets life, Elenore. To take a life for the sake of life... is not wrong, but natural. You know this deep down, which makes you confused thanks to your teachings.”\n\nElenore nodded as she absorbed the fae priestess' words. They made sense, and thinking upon it, there seemed to be a strange brutal truth hidden behind the fact that watchmen, the keepers of the peace, were always armed, no matter where you went.\n\n“Still, you need time to think on this, no?” said Veela as she stood, stealing the thoughts straight from the troubled girl's mind. “Shall we forget about this for the rest of the evening and enjoy ourselves?”\n\nThe younger woman nodded to her elder, a gracious smile on her face as she stood up and followed Veela who took the lead this time. Sure, she still wondered if she was some kind of murderous animal at heart; but didn't the priestess just tell her that neither she nor Lambda were like that? Warriors. They were warriors according to her, although Lambda arguably more than her. Lambda became a monster against the Mawkawnii to ultimately save the rest of the tribe, while she herself killed those Mawkawnii raiders to make sure Uldenmeyer wouldn't end up like the community of Wilsons.\n\n“Oh! Look at that!” cried Veela before grabbing Elenore by the hand and pulling her along to another clothing stall.\n\nElenore smiled; shopping for clothing during a festival. An activity that undoubtedly took precedent over her contemplation of the morality and ethics – whatever the difference was between the two – of killing.\n\n“Look at this dress!” the fae elf said gleefully, holding up a white dress for Elenore to see. “It looks lovely, don't you think?” she said, causing the seamstress behind her to beam.\n\n“All the clothes I've seen you wear are almost always white,” observed Elenore out loud. “How about something with color, like green?” she said as she pulled another dress of a similar make but in a shade of dark green.\n\nVeela's face dropped into a frown. “No more green. We have too much green dye at Sanskra.”\n\n“But it has this lovely ivy pattern!”\n\n“Everything had leaf patterns,” the priestess said flatly.\n\n“... Right,” said Elenore nervously as she considered buying the dress for herself.\n\n---\n\nContinued in the comments",

        "body": "**Part Two**\n\n“What are you guys doing?” said Javier, scowling as usual.\n\n“Look!” hissed Mina, from behind the box where she were hiding, motioning for the older thief to hide next to them.\n\n“What am I looking for?”\n\n“Over there, by the fountain!” the younger Dezzie whispered as she pointed.\n\n“... Is that...?”\n\n“It's them!” said the black-haired elf girl.\n\nSeveral stalls down the road were two familiar figures. A young elf girl with short, curly hair and dark brown skin accompanied by a wolf-boy with black and white fur.\n\n“They're just standing there,” commented the black-furred wolf boy.\n\n“For the past twenty minutes,” continued Mina.\n\n“Those meat sticks are probably cold now,” lamented Dezzie, commenting on the food held by the two lost thieves they were observing.\n\n“They look like statues,” muttered Javier worriedly.\n\n“And *you* look like you're up to no good.”\n\nThe three child thieves turned around to find a familiar purple-skinned shadow elf leering down on them. Behind them was the giant, who by virtue of his height was naturally looking down on them with an imposing look. Accompanying them was a male elf with blonde hair and two women, one tall with bronze skin and the other short with deep blue eyes.\n\n“Hadrian!” screamed Mina, who jumped up and threw herself at the shadow elf unexpectedly.\n\nAt the same time that she sent the young man reeling with a hug that was also a tackle, Dezzie took the opportunity to hide herself behind her surrogate brother's back.\n\n“Cheating on your girlfriend already?” joked the blonde boy.\n\n“Eat shit and die, Yovan,” Hadrian replied while punching the other man in the shoulder.\n\n“Acquaintances?” asked the shorter black-haired woman with blue eyes, who's stare made Javier incredibly uncomfortable.\n\n“He spanked me!” shouted Dezzie while pointing at the purple elf before retreating once his glare fell upon her.\n\n“That fib that Elenore made up when she pulled me out of trouble? Well, she wasn't exactly lying,” growled the seemingly always angry man with a skin pigment issue.\n\n“Enough,” spoke the giant, his word heavy yet soft. “Why are the three of you here?”\n\n“Five, actually,” corrected Javier as he stood up, lightly tapping his “sister” on the head who was gripping too hard on his trousers. “And for your information, we were sent to look for you and your master. By the way, where's the blonde and red one?”\n\n“You still didn't answer my question, boy,” the younger woman said.\n\nDespite her clear beauty, Javier couldn't help but feel uncomfortable with her. Her tone of voice, the way she carried herself, the way it felt like she was staring into his heart with disapproval was almost paralyzing. As such, he felt particularly compelled to capitulate under the older woman's demands.\n\n“We caused them some trouble last year,” stammered Javier as he tried to avert his gaze. “But they helped us out and...”\n\n“You stole Elenore and Helen's layzen stones, kicked me in the balls, then your little Rat Lord guy had us not only fight off an invasion of hostile lizard monster men in the sewers, but to get those damn rocks back, we had to go down into the sewers with your distrustful brat king to excise the source of those murderous frog things,” growled Hadrian.\n\n“And that's why you're the best!” cooed Mina, tracing circles on the young man's chest.\n\n“Stop that Mina,” said Hadrian, clearly uncomfortable. “And Yovan if you so much as say anything I am going to break into your room later and make you dream about your parents going at it!” he shouted, addressing the silently smirking blonde.\n\n“Not stopping me from finding some wedding bells,” the tall bronze woman said with a smirk.\n\n“So where does the spanking come in?” the short girl said, casting mischievous eyes towards the unfortunate man.\n\n“I hate you so much right now, Princess Leliana,” grumbled Hadrian while trying to pry the young elf girl from his waist.\n\n“P-P-P-PRINCESS?!?” shouted Dezzie, who's cry drew the eyes of many of the merchants and bystanders from nearby.\n\nThe giant sighed, with a look of resignation on his face, while Javier turned around and discovered the reason for his defeated expression.\n\n---\n\n“Nice going, Hadrian.”\n\n“I assure you, it was 100% unintentional,” he replied unconvincingly.\n\n“Back to the children,” grumbled Lambda.\n\nTwenty minutes after the little girl's outburst, the crowd around them reacted as one would expect – or rather, what the natives of Aendellysis would consider normal. Lambda himself had nearly forgotten about it, but apparently it was normal for civilians to kneel and prostrate themselves when in the presence of royalty. Of course, the merchants and townspeople who were familiar with the young princess' policy of “only when it's appropriate” simply watched with disinterest, most of them having gotten used to this scene long ago. After the entire ordeal, the group took cover in one of the little cafes in the large square where they could watch the two missing thieves from afar.\n\n“Right,” said the wolf-boy after a heavy sigh. “It was about a couple of weeks after you cleaned up the sewers. The Rat Lord sent two of our best frozard smashers, Ysolde and Konrad, down into the sewers. Something about closure; I don't really know,” said the wolf-boy, scratching his head and making sure not to make eye contact with the princess.\n\n“That was six months ago,” commented Hadrian, who by now had given up on trying to keep the little thief with black hair and incredibly expressive ears out of arm's length from his person.\n\n“Yeah, Ysolde and Konrad didn't come back right away,” continued Javier. “We thought, well, they went off together or something. Those two were always loyal to the Rat Lord, but they had the tendency to just wander off for days at a time. I know Konrad liked to hang out in the Northern District sometimes and Ysolde... well, I honestly didn't know her too well.”\n\n“Get on with it,” the princess said coldly.\n\n“Right, right. Well, the Rat Lord said not to mind it at first. He seemed to know something was up, and most of us just went along with it,” continued Javier, who panicked after being addressed by Princess Leliana. “Anyway, long story short, we got worried when they didn't come home.”\n\n“That was still six months ago,” stated the human.\n\n“Bad things happening in the capitol made their way down to Lamproa, you know?” said Mina, her facial expression serious and grim. “There was a clampdown by the Watch, and we weren't able to move as easily as we could, especially after all these weird circle people showed up.”\n\n“Circle people?” asked the raven-haired princess.\n\n“Some sort of cult,” said Mina dismissively. “Nice people, but they're shady, and we got saddled with a turf fight with them at the same time that the skinnies started getting kind of dangerous. All the while some of us thought that maybe Ysolde just decided to go do her own thing with the frozards all dead., and dragged Konrad along like usual.”\n\n“So what changed?”\n\n“Well, one of the younger scavenger teams decided to go down into the older part of the Rat Way where the frozard nest was. Maybe they wanted to play with those shooter things that the three piggies have been churning out since you left, or something – I don't know, I'm not interested in those things. Turns out, they found Ysolde and Konrads' light staves down there. You've been down there. How do you get back out of those tunnels without a light source, or without being attacked by skinnies?”\n\n“You don't,” growled Javier. “So, about two months ago, we dedicated what we could to start looking for them. Got a tip that they were out here, but...”\n\n“But?” asked Lambda, raising an eyebrow.\n\n“They were seen with this guy. We don't really know his name, but he always wears a black hooded cloak.”\n\n“Man is bad news,” said the smallest thief child as she finished the sweet roll she was given. “Scary, scary man,” she said, receiving a pat on the head from Jessica.\n\n“So that leaves you with the current situation,” concluded Princess Leliana. “Although two months is still quite some time.”\n\n“Like I said, we couldn't move as freely as we'd like,” clarified Javier. “And just getting out here was an adventure,” he said, sliding down the back of his seat.\n\n“So why were you hesitating?” spoke the human once more.\n\n“We were trying to come up with a plan,” answered Mina. “I mean, they've been standing there with this blank look on their faces. Just...” she trailed, unsure how to describe her friends.\n\n“A trap then,” Lambda concluded. “Did you know there are two ways to deal with a trap?”\n\n“The first, upon discovery, is to reach out and discover the intricacies of the trap, then circumvent the trap to ambush those who wished you ill will. Is that not correct?” asked Princess Leliana.\n\n“Yes, that's the long and drawn out method. But the faster way is to willingly set the trap off while holding your forces in reserve to turn the tables on whoever set it when they inevitably show up.”\n\n“That's risky if we don't know what kind of trap it is.”\n\n“It might not be for you, ya know,” said Javier. “It could only be for us.”\n\n“Considering that they're your friends, that's a high possibility,” concluded Hadrian.\n\n“Shall I go investigate, then?” asked Lambda.\n\n“Well... considering all the scars on your face, the ones that I can't see, and the fact that I've seen you get back up after breaking your spine -”\n\n“Wait, WHAT?!?” cried Princess Leliana, her eyes wide in shock.\n\n“I'd say that out of all of us, you stand the best chance of surviving any kind of trap, ambush, or any form of violence short of a large-scale spell,” concluded Hadrian with a hand on his chin. “So I say go for it, big guy.”\n\n“Wait-”\n\n“So Jessica and the princess can go sweep that side of the square,” said Hadrian as he gestured to their left, “while the thieves can go take the right while I stay on overwatch.”\n\n“Good plan. Six-Oh-Two, moving out.”",

Your post today with 50k and another post a while ago with 10k. Both got 1 infusion. I don't think you can assume the drop rate is \"way lower than 1 in 50k\" for now. And with infusion being worth 10k and coffers being worth 0.2g, it *may* be worth trying if you have enough money to gamble long enough.\n\nI have the same opinion for the infusion that comes from using the new MF stone. I only saw 1 post with some data : the guy tried 3000 times and came out with 3 infusions. It's not enough to know if the rate is 1 in 1k or if the guy got extra lucky ... But for all I know it *may* be worth it if you're rich enough to gamble for a long time : if it's actually 1/1k and the infusion is worth 10k, then you get 8.5g per try just from the infusion after taxes ... and tries cost a lot less (25 ecto + 3 weapons or 3 armors, and you also get all other returns from forging that stuff).",

    "body": "Slime. Its a sticky green substance found in swamplands and superflats. Say that 10 times fast.\n\nI've been trying to avoid organic substances(i.e. substances that make up life; molecules which contain carbon), as they are a lot harder to find and a lot less documented than inorganic substances(substances that do not contain carbon).\n\nThese are some of the properties of slime balls:\n\n- green\n- slimeblocks stick to everything except obsidian and glazed terracotta(and others for gamebreaking/technical reasons)\n- slimeblocks are elastic(when you land on them, an elastic force pushes you upwards)\n- when heated, it loses elasticity(magma cubes do not stretch when they jump, they [split](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft-computer/images/b/bf/150px-Magma_Cube_Jumping.png/revision/latest?cb=20140407005202))\n- slimeblocks have an opaque 'inside' with a translucent 'outside'\n\nThere are two types of stickiness: adhesion and cohesion. Cohesion is stickiness between the same substance while adhesion is stickiness between different substances. Obviously slime blocks do adhesion, as they stick to almost everything.\n\nAdhesion has several different types, some are mechanical, some chemical. Here are a list of possible types:\n\n- interlocking; voids and pores are filled with the material e.g. velcro, sewing\n- ionic, covalent or hydrogen bonding; materials make chemical bonds, brittle enough so they can be pulled apart but not too brittle so they stick together\n- van der Walls; materials are pulled together by van der Walls forces; slight positive and negative charges bring materials close\n- electrostatic; materials pulled together by positive/negative forces\n\nIts highly unlikely that it is the van der Walls/electrostatic forces because that would mean almost all blocks would have to be positive/negatively charged. I could see the interlocking happening; slimeblocks grow and conform to blocks it touches to stick to them. Bonding is probably less likely as it would have to react with almost every chemical.\n\nLet's check other properties.\n\nSince it is elastic, but plastic(not elastic) when heated, this sounds a lot like a thermosetting polymer.\n\nWe now have explanations for why it sticks to blocks(it grows and conforms to them) and why it is elastic, and how it is plastic when heated(it is a thermoset). We could say that it can't stick to obsidian and glazed terracotta because they have smooth surfaces and slime blocks can't grow to smooth surfaces.\n\nSo slime is a green living thermosetting polymer that grows to new blocks near it. Simple.\n\nThermosetting polymers are a lot easier to find, and green dye can be applied to make them green. Lets list them:\n\n\n\nVinyl ester resin, made by an epoxy resin reacting with an acrylic acid. Its base reactants include propene and benzene, from oil(made by plants and animals); hypochlorous acid from bacteria; and oxygen, from air. However chlorine and sodium hydroxide are not found in nature, meaning this cannot exist.\n\nBakelite, made by phenol reacting with formaldehyde. Its base reactants include propene and benzene from oil; oxygen from air; and methanol, which exists in organisms naturally.\n\nFuran resin, made by furfuryl alcohol and furfural. Its base reactants include hydrogen from water. However, it requires xylose which doesn't exist by itself in nature.\n\nMelamine resin, made by melanine and formaldehyde. Its base reactants include methanol, which exists in organisms naturally; oxygen, carbon dioxide from the air; however ammonia does not exist in nature as it decomposes.\n\n\n- Oil can exist in swamplands, as life exists there, and sediments in the water can apply pressure to create oil.\n- If slimes contain methanol like most organisms, then bakelite could be a contender.\n\nBakelite is the only one left. Apply some [green dye](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/minecraft_gamepedia/8/82/Cactus_Green.png) and we have slime.",

Subterrranean slimes are likely to feed off detritus from dead hostiles akin to some deep sea creatures for the most part with actual carnivorous tendencies arising from their attacks. Smallest size slimes deal no damage because their nibbles likely scrape off too little tissue to be a problem.\n\nMagma Cubes arise due to nether-bound slimes feeding on detritus contain traces of blaze powder, causing the outermost slime layer to crust over in a way.

I work in a museum that is mainly rugs and we are actively analyzing a lot of our pieces for heavy metal traces (Arsenic, Mercury, and Lead) as well as traces of other pesticides.\n\nThe good news: this doesn't look like any other rugs I've seen from that era, and it looks more like a later piece. I could be wrong, of course, it's hard to tell without closer detail pix. And the bright green around the edges is almost certainly a later addition, so even if the rug is from 1840, the bright green is probably made with newer arsenic-free synthetic dyes.\n\nThe bad news: almost all of the rugs in our collection have tested positive for heavy metals and/or other nasty compounds. That's because old timey people looooooved to douse rugs in pesticides, which were often made with Arsenic, Mercury, and Lead. If you work with many historic rugs, especially wet cleaning them, you are going to be exposed to a lot of historic pesticide residue.\n\nThe neutral news: museum workers are still alive and well after handling these, and so are you! We wear nitrile gloves, labcoats, and sometimes respirators when handling rugs because now we just assume everything is contaminated, and we wash our hands religiously. The main thing to look out for is whether you are having a notable reaction: itching, hives, eye irritation, sudden heart burn, or lip tingling. If you do, that rug is not fun for whatever reason (usually it's mothballs, I hate mothballs, they stick around forever on textiles and make us all feel incredibly sick, especially when wet cleaning a rug). \n\nLong story short: you are fine ❤️ even if that rug had heavy metals in it, your exposure wasn't prolonged enough to be majorly dangerous. Use a lot of caution when working with historic rugs in the future. Wash your hands thoroughly and clean your work tables. And good luck!",

At the time, I passed on them, but came back to get them simply because of the date on them - 2009. I am a complete sucker for anything 10 years or older when it comes to AM90s and now 1s. \n\nI knew there was tons of work to be done so I held off on the project for about months. I knew I wanted to switch to AM90 Midsoles for sure and I also knew that the dye was going to run after cleaning on the white....which it absolutely did (fuck dyes). Luckily, I use acrylic leather paints to cover and fix. I decided to do the toe box black to give it contrast with the Midsoles I had envision and stored. \n\nSteps:\n-Removed Midsoles and sanded the glue down and prepped\n- Removed glue from donor am90 Midsoles and prepped\n- Deep cleaned AM1s with steamer, manual scrubbing and cold wash then air dried\n- I filled in the missing and faded spots on the print using posca marker (no need to kill myself using a fine brush with acrylic leather paint)\n- Lightly sanded the edges of the panel to give it a lighter contrast between the panel and the grey fabric material.\n- Sealed the panel with a clear barried mix I made to give it more resistance and a aged look\n- Painted the all areas that are black using acrylic leather paints and a mix of mediums/additive to enhance adhesion, flexibility and resistance \n- Did the same with the tongue. The tongue actually had 3 more coats than I usually do using gac 900, because the green dye transfer could still be see . It's still visible, but barely noticeable. \n- Removed lint from all areas using a lint shaver\n- Applied glue to both Midsoles and AM1s, let dry, then carefully put them together. \n\nI enjoy projects like these and I don't think people realize the amount of effort and time takes into these things for me. I am a perfectionist and always stride for the best outcome on my projects. Usually, when I seel my customs and they are for cheap, it's most likely due to the fact that I don't want them, they did not come out as I envisioned, or they just don't fit. A project like this will definitely not be sold at a low price (35-70 which is what I sold prebious customs at). \n\nAnyways, I hope you enjoyed. I hope I motivated someone into collecting or restoring. ",

    "body": "Again sorry abut not uploading too much lately. I can't promise anything but my holidays are coming up soon so this series should be up and running shortly.\n\nKnightslime - a crumbling pink metal which is probably alive - is one of the weirdest alloys in the entirity of Tinkers Construct. Except pigiron, we don't talk about [that thing](https://i.imgur.com/fwzoHf8.png). What are its properties? What is it actually made of? Who even decided to make this monstrosity?\n\nA while ago I tackled slime and discovered it was probably a type of Bakelite that absorbed chlorophyll to become green. However, knightslime requires a different type of slime; purple slime. \n\nNatural purple dyes include:\n\n- many species of sea snail\n- purple moss(caused by anthocyanins)\n- some berries(blackberries, mulberries etc)\n- also an artifical dye; made from 2 blue dyes and a green dye(keep this one in mind)\n- compound called anthocyanin found in most plants(low pH = red/purple, high = yellow/green)\n\nThat seems like a good list, so we'll move on.\n\nSea snails are probably(?) related to slimes but theres no concrete proof of that. Berries or any type of flower/fruit also don't seem to exist on slime islands. \n\nNow the artificial dye - Cobalt Violet. It is created from a mix between cobalt blue, cerulean blue and cobalt green. Blue slime and green slime both exist, so maybe blue slime + green slime makes purple slime. But naturally, blue and green makes cyan, not purple.\n\nAnthocyanins are present in every plant cell(specifically, dissolved in the vacuole). However, unknown to most, animal cells do contain vacuoles; although they are very small and there are a lot more of them. However, anthocyanins only turn purple in a low pH environment. This means slime soil probably has a low pH, and that explains purple slime. Bakelite which has absorbed low pH anthocyanins.\n\nKnightslime is therefore a stone-iron-rubber alloy. I've never heard of a rubber-metal alloy let alone one that contains stone, but apparently [they exist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_rubber).  But there is one last factor; stone. Apparently, according to [this helpful link](https://www.quora.com/Can-metals-and-stones-be-fused-together-to-create-new-alloys-with-unique-properties), I discovered something called a **hybrid composite**, which perfectly fits knightslime.\n\nA hybrid composite is a metal mixed with two other materials which can be organic or another material. In other words, a metal(iron), and two other materials(stone and slime). The next thing to find out is its actual properties.\n\nMetal rubber contains around 1% metal and 99% rubber, and is as elastic as most rubbers. However, the ratios are a lot more than 99r:1m. The ratios are more like 125r:72m as well as 144s, or approximately 1.7r:1m:2s. There is 58x less rubber in knightslime than metal rubber. \n\nMetal rubber has an elasticity of around rubber, however as we said, the ratios are different. Iron's elasticity is 170GPa, while rubber is around 0.01GPa. This gives knightslime a modulus of 85GPa, which is around the same as the elasticity of silver. Add the stone(11 GPa), and we get around 64GPa, which is around aluminium elasticity. \n\nSo there we have it. Knightslime is a hybrid compoite made of: low pH anthocyanins mixed with Bakelite; andesite; and iron. Its elasticity is somewhere around aluminium.",

Cacti have thorns, bloom flowers, and can grow rather healthy *Cactus Fruit*.\n\n * Currently, they're only use is to make trash cans (they destroy items), to create dark-green dye, and make ugly diagonal walls to protect something.\n\nI feel like Cacti can do so much more, especially in relation to what Cacti in the real world can be used for. Thats why I'm expanding on the Cactus.\n\n---\n\n**Suggestion**\n\nHere is what I suggest:\n\n * If you break a Cactus that is at least 2 blocks tall, the Cactus won't suddenly regrow its prickly flesh on the top, making it safe to stand on for some time until the flesh is regrown.\n\n * 3 block tall Cacti, and rarely 2 block tall cacti are capable of blooming flowers that can produce at random many colors of dye.\n\n\t * The dye that Cacti can create can range from Cactus Green (from the base Cactus), Yellow, Red, Orange, Pink, and very rarely Cyan (from blooming flowers). \n\n\t\t * Blue, in general, is a rare color that anything can naturally have. There are Cacti out there that can bloom flowers like Blue and Cyan so I made it rare intentionally. \n\n\t * Cacti who have kept their blooming flowers for some time without being harvested for dye will produce Cactus Fruit, which will fill ½ a drumstick and gives the Player lots of saturation.\n\n\t\t * However, if the fruit is eaten on an empty stomach, it will make you hungrier (In the real world, drinking Cactus juice on an empty stomach causes diarrhea which in turn dehydrates you).\n\n\t\t\t * Dehydration is not possible in Minecraft so instead I suggest in inflicts the *Hunger status effect* instead.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis, in turn, turns Cacti into a far more useful plant than it already is ^and ^potentially ^prettier.\n\n * It is now *another* renewable source of Red, Yellow, Orange, Pink, and Cyan Dye. \n\n * It can also restore the saturation of Players particularly high assuming that the Player isn't already starving.\n\nAny thoughts, ideas, or issues?",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

        "body": "Ok, we can all agree The End is endgame, so if any of these seem OP, it's somewhat justified.\n\nNew rare ore in the end - Magnetite. \n\nAdds a new mechanic - magnetism.  \n\nOpposing magnetically charged blocks move in unison not unlike sticky piston mechanic.\n\nSame magnetically charged blocks oppose a certain number of blocks, moving like an invisible piston. With proper setup, this can literally make levitating, movable structures without redstone doodads attached.\n\nMagnetite arrows can home in on targets like Skyblock's custom bow enchant \"Aiming\"\n\nMagnetite-plated iron boots can walk along charged walls and \"fall\" toward specific blocks like iron blocks.\n\nCombine an end rod with magnetite to make a lightening rod. Blocks within a certain radius targeted for a lightening strike will instead target the rod. Also works with the trident enchant.\n\nCharged end rods become \"batteries\" at some point. They are used to power devices like:\n\nTeleportation Pad - made with batteries, magnetite blocks and a beacon, a player can activate it with a redstone signal to teleport to another pad within a certain radius. \n\nCurrent Propeller - made with batteries, magnetite blocks, and a hear of the sea, it grants a buff like the dolphin's grace, over a large portion of water.\n\nDouble Jump Boots attachment - made with batteries, netherite blocks, phantom membrane, and magnetite blocks, can be applied to boots using the upgrade table to enable a double-jump mechanic when worn. When timed right, can even prevent fall death. \n\nHeadlamp Attachment - made with batteries, netherite blocks, a sea lantern, and magnetite blocks, can be applied to helmets to see in the dark. (either by night vision, or a new, dynamic movable light source)\n\nPowered Glove Attachment - made with batteries, netherite blocks, a Notch apple, and magnetite blocks, it gives a natural +1 to efficiency, power, and strength bonuses. \n\nWe can add other \"attachment\" type items to incorporate a large number of enchant, potion or magic effects. Again, endgame stuff combining rare ingredients, so it's justified. However, there are 2 fun items I can't help but want to see:\n\n\\- Grappling Hook. Not like the Skyblock weird one, but almost like a shorter range,    eye of ender.\n\n\\- Treasure Finder/Metal Detector - imagine if you will that treasure chests rarely generate in soil and other top layers. However, there are no maps leading to their locations, they are just lost. But, when you have this new, nifty device, a tone emits when in a certain proximity to one of these lost chests, and it gets more consistent the nearer one gets. The chests could contain things that are valuable to endgame players, or maybe even exclusive upgrade items like a dragon slayer enchant. Maybe there's even a super rare chance of finding a map to a buried \"El Dorado\" like city of gold and treasures. It could be guarded by a new mob boss like The Golden Golem. These particular locations could generate even less frequently than strongholds, and like Elder Guardians, the golem could emit a fatigue debuff to prevent cheesing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy ALL means, guys, build on this idea!",

Or, it could be like the enderman).\n\nIt loves chorus fruit like piglins love gold. You can distract it by dropping fruit on the ground, it will go invis if you are too close but will still pick it up regardless of how close you are, giving you a good guess of its' location. During the short distraction window you have a decent amount of time to kill it.\n\nIt drops ender pearls, chorus fruit and occasionally invisibility potions or iron swords (although it never holds them, it can be implied that's what they're hitting you with). It loves to hide in chorus fruit fields. That is all.",

If you feed them chorus fruit you can tame and ride them, but if you hit any of them they’ll  totally smash the player as they would have more HP than an iron golem and as much attack as a ravager. When first tamed you get the achievement “too afraid of bridges”. The “enderwhale” (I’ll call it so but please give it a better name lol) would be friendly with endermen and could not go higher or lower, they float on a predetermined high each one of them, and they’re incredibly rare to find. I have no specific ideas of drops, but it’d be funny that, if you kill one, you get the achievement “Pinocchio, are you there?”.\nFinally I’d like to see interactions between them and the endermen, like if an enderman feed an “enderwhale” with chorus he could ride it, that’d bring a lot of live to the end dimension.\n\nEdit: just orthography business.",

        "body": "We need something better than shulkers and endermen to guard the cities. Something that can guard the ship as well.\n\nOne thing I noticed was that piglins have a much stronger variation, known as the Piglin Brute. What if that is applied to the cities as well? It would not affect spawn cap like the brute, and can only be found in the ships/cities. The mob would be a sort of symbiote, working with the chorus plant and enderman.\n\nLike an enderman, this symbiote would hit an enemy, wound it and make it teleport around for a bit, making the area much more dangerous (i mean, shulkers aren't much of a challenge). Perhaps it would be able to use armor and be much smarter than a normal enderman. It would help the consistency of a mob stronger than its conterpart (snow/iron golem, piglin (brute) and the idea now brings enderman (symbiote)).\n\nAnd yes, i got two ideas.\n\nPiglin travelers. Yes, I know Piglins get zombified in the end, but what if the endermen and Piglins near the cities were friendly to each other? The travelers would look corrupted from the chorus fruit they eat, and still retain to their habits of bartering, but now they give better (or much worse) items. \n\nBut if you attack one or are not wearing a piece of ENCHANTED gold (doesn't matter which enchantment. It's still shinier either way), you will get swarmed by up to 10 travelers, who will rarely have diamond gear from the city they spawned in. \n\nIf they attack you, you have a 50% chance to gain levitation/slowness, a 49.5% chance for nothing, and a 0.5% chance to teleport so far that you return to your spawn point.",

    "body": "I've been wanting to try vintage style cakes for a while, and finally pulled the plug last week and bought the supplies I need! I had a good bit of fun but also had my fair share of struggles lol. \n\nFirst of all, I have to accept that I hate buttercream icing. I can hardly eat this cake because the icing is way too sweet for my taste. I am going to try a Swiss meringue and a whipped icing for future cakes. If anyone has a recipe they swear by, I'm all ears! \n\nSecond, achieving a dark color was extremely difficult!! I am very disinterested in using artificial dyes, so I had bought natural dyes from my local co-op. To get this green shade, I used the ENTIRE bottle of green dye! I want to find a more practical way to achieve dark colors without using artificial dyes. So please send me your recipes/ingredients or trusted brands!! \n\nAlso, I am curious about what piping tips you all would say are the most important for cake decorating. I only have 4 right now and I want to buy more, but am not certain which would be best! \n\nFinally, can anyone recommend a quality large cake stand with a tall lid? I got one off Amazon originally but when I opened it it was so small even this cake wouldn't have fit (these are 9\" cakes that once frosted are approx 10\" diameter). The cake stands I saw on Amazon were almost all 9.5-11\", which would just barely fit this, and most of the lids maxed at 4.5\". ",

    "body": " \n\nMy name is James Holden, and I’m a babysitter for the [supernatural](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/moanr0/im_a_babysitter_for_the_supernatural_the_time_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). \n\nIt is rather unfortunate what must come next. To share my story somewhat chronologically, I must tell you of a mistake I once made. A very big and stupid mistake, regretfully. For all the trouble it caused, the mistake itself sounds quite simple; I took my second babysitting job for the supernatural; without first learning more about the world I now found myself interacting with. \n\nLet's just consider this for a second. Now knowing that the supernatural exists, and can harm me, I took another babysitting job for a supernatural race without first learning more from Minerva. I sure hope I’ve gotten smarter since then. Probably not. \n\nIt all started with a phone call. I had been at home, waiting for a call from Minerva. She had promised to set up an appointment where we could talk through everything. When the phone rang, I jumped for it, hoping it was finally the call I had been waiting for. \n\n“He\\~llo?” I was too excited, and my voice cracked a little.\n\n“Hi, is this James Holden, the babysitter?” A lazy voice ambled from the receiver. A female voice; definitely not Minerva’s.\n\n“Yes, this is he,” I tried to not let my disappointment show through my voice. “How can I help you?”\n\n‘Well, I’d like to hire you.” There was a slight chuckle, like the voice found the question funny. “Is there… something wrong with that?”\n\nIt wasn't common for me to get new customers, so this phone call was a bit of a surprise. My regular work merely consisted of the parents in my area; people I’d babysat for, before. Minerva had been my first new customer in some time. \n\n“If you don’t mind me asking, how did you hear about my services?” Perhaps one of my regulars told a friend or co-worker. \n\n“I heard that you sat for Minerva, that’s quite a recommendation!”\n\nAh, so this wasn't just any babysitting job. I wondered if Minerva mentioned that she had been my first experience with the supernatural. Probably not, seeing as she had been surprised by my ignorance. \n\n“I see. So, when do you need a babysitter?” I inquired.\n\n“My partner and I have an appointment tomorrow morning, and we were hoping you could watch our children while we were out.” The voice drifted from the phone, unconcerned, with the little warning they had given me.\n\n“Well, that's not much warning. Usually I ask for a week's notice if possible.” I was a little annoyed, to be honest. I really hated it when people weren’t considerate of my schedule. I could always say no, of course, but having them call and ask still peeved me. I mean, the last person you want to annoy is the person watching your children, right? \n\n“Of course, of course. I’m *very* sorry for the inconvenience.” \n\nThe voice didn’t sound particularly sorry, but they continued: \n\n“Look, it’s really important to us, and we’d be willing to pay more; *triple* your usual rate.\n\nTriple my usual rate. *Triple*. \n\nThat was a lot of money, in normal circumstances, I would take a next-day job in a heartbeat for that kind of cash. \n\n“...How long is your appointment?” I inquired.\n\n“Not long at all; three hours- three-and-a-half, at the most.” \n\nThe voice seemed satisfied, as if they knew I would take the job, short notice or not. They were right, unfortunately. I had no idea how to approach the obvious question: If they were a supernatural race, what kind of additional challenges would I face? Could I outright ask, or would that be rude? Minerva seemed pretty open about being a Witch, but that was after I accepted the job, and it hadn’t come up prior to just before she left. \n\n“How many kids will I be watching?” I decided to be a little vague, try to get them talking about the job. “And is there anything I need to know before I come over to babysit?”  \n “I have two little ones you will need to watch, the third is coming with me. As far as what you need to know, I’ll give you the rules when you arrive, they should be pretty self-explanatory.”\n\nAh, rules once again. This statement had thoughts roaring through my brain. Would every job babysitting for a supernatural family involve rules? Do they vary by individual family, or by species? I was also a little worried Minerva also had rules, they had been detailed, but not very explanatory. Would this be a similar situation, where I knew what I was doing, but not why I had to do it? \n\nI pushed my worries aside. “Sounds great! Just let me know the address, and I’ll be there tomorrow morning!” \n\nThe next day came slowly. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t anxious about the next day. I had no idea what I had gotten myself into, and I was quite confident that taking the job had been a mistake. I spent most of the night tossing and turning, worrying about everything that could go wrong tomorrow, and about all the things I had no idea about. It was scary enough to babysit for a new person. I had done it enough at this point to feel pretty confident in my ability, but I felt like an amateur with this job. How could I feel confident knowing that I could not prepare myself for this next job? Well, I could have, I should have, called Minerva, but I was too scared. It was a weird state, simultaneously scared to babysit for this being, and also being scared to assuage my fears by calling the only person who I knew would have knowledge I could use. I should have called the job off, but it wasn’t in my nature to call off an appointment just because I was feeling uneasy. \n\nI found the house easily enough. It, like Minerva's, sat off the beaten path. The drive up to the house was very reminiscent of the drive I had taken only the day previous up to Minerva’s house. The same unnatural bubble of silence muffled the engine noise of my car. The same weird feeling of something unnatural. I can’t explain it, but it definitely didn’t make me feel any more confident about this job. I could see dark clouds off in the distance, promising rain. The drive was long and windy. Stone paving stones made a distinct geometric pattern. The curved driveway, combined with the heavy foliage, meant I couldn’t even see the house until I rounded the last corner. The house was stately, smaller than Minerva’s, but still large for the area. Except for the oppressive atmosphere present in the forest it seemed to be the opposite of Minerva’s house. Minerva’s house had been closed off and imposing. The tall structure had towered over me, all the windows shuttered. This house was only two stories, and wide open. Every shutter was flung wide, and all of the windows were open. On either end of the house were conservatories with mesh walls. There were toys all over the grass in the yard, and the jungle gym in the side yard was well used. \n\nI took a second to collect myself. Checking my car clock, then my watch; they both agreed. I was 5 minutes early. I ran my hands through my hair, trying to stifle the resilient hairs in the back which always stuck up. I took one deep breath; then another, and exited the car. \n\nI knocked, half expecting the door to fling open before I could even touch the wood. Instead, my fist struck the door, making a clear ringing sound. It was awfully similar to somebody striking a chime, but the door had felt like solid wood. I waited, shifting my weight from one foot to the other, waiting to meet this mysterious client. \n\nThe door swung inward with a musical shriek, revealing a woman who I could only assume was the mysterious caller. She was a good head shorter than me, slender with a delicate frame. She wore a simple summer dress, her feet bare. She seemed completely ordinary, except that her hair was green. No simple green dye either, it was dappled and had a dull shimmer in the sunlight, like it was her natural coloring. \n\nShe looked up at me, smiling softly, “Ah, James I presume, it’s nice to meet you.”\n\nMy suspicions were confirmed, this was definitely the same voice from the call. The same slow cadence, enunciating every syllable as if she had all the time in the world. Her voice was a little higher than it had seemed on the phone, and richer. Almost as if the phone had ignored an entire dimension of her voice. \n\nI smiled, “Yes, I’m James. It’s nice to meet you. I’m somewhat embarrassed I never asked your name on the phone”. I stepped forward, reaching my hand out for a handshake. \n\nShe looked down at my hand with a curious smile, “It’s Analise, no need to feel embarrassed. Why don’t you follow me, and I'll get you all set up?”\n\nI pulled my hand back and followed her into the house. The house was very much a reflection of the outside. Toys littered the ground, and the shaggy carpet covered a well-worn wood floor. The walls carried the remains of crayon or marker scribbles, and what appeared to be chocolate fingerprints. The house felt just as open as it seemed from the outside. The warm late-morning air drifted through wide-open windows, playing dust through the flat planes of sunbeams. \n\nAnalise led me into a messy kitchen. It looked like a troop of monkeys had made breakfast, badly. There was some evidence that somebody had started cleaning the mess, but it was still a fairly substantial catastrophe of dishes, and what seemed to be pancake batter. I tried to not show any emotion, but Analise seemed to read my face.\n\n“Don’t worry about the mess. I’m hiring you to watch the kids, not clean my house.” She continued with a slight chuckle, “But I certainly won’t complain if I find the house cleaner than I left it!”\n\nI nodded. “I’m sure I can do something to help, I know how to tackle a mess.”  \n “Yes, I’m sure you are quite adept at dealing with messes.” She gave me another smile and then glanced down at her watch, grimacing. “I’m going to be late to meet up with Laramine and Jade, my partner and third child.” \n\n“Okay, rules are here.” She patted an envelope I hadn’t noticed on the counter. “Children are playing upstairs, and the bathroom is the first room on the right of the hall we came down. Questions?”\n\n“Are you not going to introduce me to the children before you leave?”  I asked, a little off guard from the sudden influx of information.\n\nAnalise winced slightly. “It’s best if I leave without a goodbye, they can be a little clingy.”\n\nI knew the type, I’d babysat many children like that before. “Anything I need to know? Should I feed them lunch? Any allergies?\n\nShe shook her head quickly. “I’ll be back before lunchtime, but there are snacks in the pantry if they get hungry. Everything you need to know is in the rules. I don’t like the codex, but I follow it. Now I really must be going.”  \n I was a little put off by her change in behavior. She had seemed laid back and easygoing before, but now she seemed more active, and a little stressed. I wanted to ask her what she meant by “codex” but she was already walking out the door.\n\n“Take care of my kids! I’ll be back soon!” \n\nThe door slammed with a sound like metal on metal, loud and ringing, but not unpleasant. I felt more out of depth than I had when I first arrived. I stood in a stranger’s kitchen, with an envelope clenched in my hands, with no idea what was going on. I sighed, still confused by the sudden change in behavior, and opened the envelope. \n\n*James,*\n\n*Sorry for the short notice. As I described on the phone, I have three children, and you will be watching two of them. They should be upstairs playing when you arrive. As you know, sprite children are very energetic and playful. It’s important to keep them entertained and distracted. I should be gone for only three or so hours. Below are the rules of the house, you should find them considerably simpler than those you must have followed at Minerva's house.* \n\n1. *Keep the windows open at all times, regardless of the weather. It may rain. If it does, make sure the children play at least for ten minutes either outside, or within one of the mesh conservatories.* \n2. *If you see a shadowy figure attempting to enter a window, simply leave the room. They can’t get it if you don’t pay them attention. Don’t worry about leaving the children alone in the room, they wouldn’t dare try to enter the same room as them.* \n3. *Feel free to eat anything in the pantry, except from the top shelf.* \n4. *Mirrors are not to be trusted*\n5. *Plug your ears if you hear wind chimes ring.* \n\n*That’s all! There are plenty of games and activities in the playroom to keep the children occupied. Be sure to pay attention to the weather and get the kids outside if it rains.*\n\n*Thanks!*   \n *Analise* \n\nWell, the rules definitely *seemed* less complicated than Minerva’s. It seemed like I’d have to pay attention here; I could see myself not noticing the rain, or even the wind chimes until it was too late. \n\nTHUMP\n\nA loud bang sounded from overhead, rattling the glasses on the shelves. I sighed and decided it was just about time to head upstairs. The stairs were no different from the rest of the house, the rough carpet pitted and tattered from excessive wear and tear. The upstairs hallway had, if anything, more scribbles along the wall. There were pictures of Analise with 3 kids and a guy with blue hair in cracked frames. I followed the noise to a room halfway down the hallway. \n\nIf I had described the kitchen as a light mess, then this room would’ve been a catastrophe. The floor was littered with toys, drawing materials, art supplies, papers, costumes, and anything else you might find in a child's playroom. The walls were covered floor to ceiling with colorings, streaks, and hung pictures; unlike the downstairs, there had been no attempt to clean these walls of their scars. \n\nIn the middle of the mess sat two young boys, one with green hair like Analise, and one with blue hair like the man in the pictures. They froze when they saw me. We sat staring at each other, then the questions began. \n\n“Are you the babysitter?”\n\n“Are you James?”\n\n“Did Mom leave?”\n\n“Do you want to play games?” \n\n“Did you bring any food?”\n\nI was a little overwhelmed by all their questions, and raised my hands until they quieted. I tried to keep my voice smooth and level as I said, “Yes, I’m James the babysitter. Yes, your mom has already left. I would love to play games with you. We can go get some food from downstairs if you are hungry.”\n\nThey grinned at me. A wild grin that exuded wild energy. The one with green hair spoke first, “I’m Ridgemont, and this is Ivy! What game do you want to play first?”\n\nHe pointed to a cabinet I had not noticed when I first walked into the room. I walked over and opened it, revealing stack upon stack of board games. Like everything in the room, the boxes were well worn, but they seemed to be in good shape. They were stacked with care alphabetically, I noticed as I looked over the names.\n\nI turned back to the kids, holding a box in my hands. “Let’s play chutes and ladders!” I announced. \n\nSometime later, we had run through several of the boy’s board games. Each was handled carefully, and packed away precisely, a direct contrast to the rest of the room. On the floor was Monopoly, the properties already filled with hotels and houses. In front of each of us stacks of colorful money towered; my stack noticeably the shortest. Ivy stared intently at his clenched fist. It was his turn; a four would land him on my property, and a 10 or 11 would put him on Ridgemont's. Suddenly he flung the dice into the upright game lid, swinging his entire arm. One dice landed flat, four: He was safe from me at the very least. The other dice was spinning on one of its corners. We all leaned in closer, watching, waiting. The rotation slowed, the dots on the dice no longer a blur. It tipped from side to side, then fell, resting on the cardboard. Another four. He was safe. He jumped up, cheering, \n\n“Who's the best? I’m the best! That’s right, me! Who’s the Monopoly champ? I am! That’s right, me!”. \n\nHe stomped his feet excitedly, celebrating his roll.\n\n“The game isn’t over yet!” Ridgemont reminded him, speaking loudly over his brother's cheers, “Plus, you rolled doubles, so you have to roll again. You might land on my property!” \n\nI smiled at their antics. They were energetic and loud, but they certainly knew how to make a board game interesting. I glanced out the window, as had become my habit, and noticed the beginning sprinkles of rain. \n\nI clapped my hands and stood up. Talking loudly to cut through the noise, I told them, “Alright guys, it’s time to go outside! It’s raining.” \n\nBoth stopped, and looked toward the window. It was already raining harder, the drops beginning to fall faster and faster.   \n Ridgemont looked back at the board, then asked, “Can we finish this game first? It’s almost over!” \n\nUsually I would be just fine with that, but I didn’t really want to mess with Analise’s rules.\n\n“No, it’s time to go outside now, but we can come back and finish the game soon though!” I told Ivy\n\nHe looked disappointed, hanging his head. “Okay James. I gotta go potty first though, is that okay?”\n\nI looked over at Ivy, who was still staring out the window, a smile widening on his face. \n\n“Sure, why don’t you meet me and Ivy outside, okay? We’re gonna be in the mesh room by the kitchen, sounds good?”\n\nHe nodded, not saying anything, and began to trudge out of the room toward the bathroom.\n\nI turned back to Ivy, keeping my voice upbeat, “Hey Ivy, ready to head outside?”\n\nHe whipped around quickly, smile still plastered across his face.\n\n“Yea! Let's go right now!”         \n\nWe started toward the conservatory at a walk, which turned into a near run by the time we approached the door. Ivy burst through the door, and began spinning with his arms outstretched in the rain, face upturned to the sky. I leaned on the doorway, trying to stay as dry as possible as I watched him. He began gracefully running up and down the length of the room, kicking up puddles of water with each sweep of his feet. \n\nIvy looked different out here in the rain. His eyes were brighter, and his hair shone with a new luster. He seemed sturdier, and more confident in his movement. Despite how fast he was moving, the rain seemed to bead on his skin, instead of running off onto the ground. \n\nI looked out into the trees. Sunlight glimmered between the raindrops, mottling the liquid rays which streamed between the trees. The entire scene sparkled, as if jewels, not water, dropped from the sky. The smell of rain infused the scene, of wet dirt and fresh wood. \n\nI shook my head, tearing myself away from the nature display in front of me. Ivy still played in the rain energetically, seeming to revel in the heaven-sent gift. Ivy, however, was nowhere to be seen. I checked my watch, it’d been eight minutes already. Was Ridgemont still in the bathroom? I felt a slight twinge of anxiety in my stomach, Analise’s not had stated specifically that each boy needed at least ten minutes in the rain. If I didn’t get him out here soon, he’d miss the rain. \n\n“Hey, Ivy! I’m going to check on your brother, okay?” I called out to Ivy\n\nHe looked at me for the first time since we came outside, then asked “Can I stay out in the rain? I promise not to leave the house.”\n\n“Of course! I’ll be right back!” I tried to keep any anxiety out of my voice, staying positive and upbeat for Ivy’s benefit. \n\nI headed back inside, toward the bathroom. The house was still completely dry on the inside, despite the open windows. The only noticeable change was a humid breeze now drifting through the house. \n\nThe bathroom door was open, the light off. The tub was empty, the cabinets contained only cleaning chemicals. Ridgemont wasn't there. I froze, trying to think. He wasn’t in the bathroom, and he knew to go to the conservatory, but I hadn’t passed him on my way in. Maybe there was a misunderstanding, and the kid had gone to the other side of the house? I ran to the other conservatory, fearing that if Ridgemont wasn’t already there, then he’d miss his ten minutes in the rain. \n\nThe conservatory door was open, but the mesh room was empty. I was really panicking now. Even if Ridgemont was outside in the rain, it meant that he was out in the yard, or the woods. If he wasn’t out in the rain and was still in the house then I was in trouble, already the rain seemed lighter, the clouds passing overhead. \n\nEven though I knew it was impossible, I still hoped I’d see Ridgemont in the other conservatory, playing with his brother when I arrived. No such luck. Ivy was alone, still enjoying the light storm.   \n “Hey, Ivy, Ridgemont wasn’t in the bathroom or the other conservatory. Do you know where he might be?” I asked Ivy reluctantly, not wanting him to worry, but also feeling like I had no other choice. I didn’t know the house well, and if Ridgemont was somewhere inside, it’d take me too long to find him on my own. \n\nIvy sounded a little uncomfortable, “Ridgemont doesn't like to play in the rain sometimes. He says it’s not fun.”\n\n“Where does he go when he doesn’t want to play outside with you?”\n\n“The attic.”\n\nI stood in the upstairs laundry room. The ladder to the attic was folded up into the ceiling, but Ivy claimed it could be retracted from above. The boy stood next to me, having finished his time in the rain while I was looking for Ridgemont alone. Ivy’s hair still shimmered, but it was duller, seeming to slowly return to how it was before. The young boy seemed nervous, fidgeting with his hands as he stood beside me, pointedly not looking up at the attic. I asked him, “Does Ridgemont not like to go outside often?”  \n Ivy shook his head, then responded, “No, usually he’s super excited to play with me outside. But the past couple of rainstorms he’s tried to stay inside.”\n\n“Does your mom let him stay inside?”\n\n“No, she drags him out by his ear, saying that the rain is good for us.” Ivy said with a chuckle, apparently remembering the sight of Analise dragging her reluctant child by the ear. Ivy’s chuckle faded, then hesitantly he told me, “But there was one time he hid really really well. The rain passed before she could find him. He seemed….. different for a while after that.”\n\n“Different?” I asked Ivy curiously?\n\nIvy paused, then said, “He was mean. He would run around the house, throwing things around. He played rough with me, and didn’t say very nice things. Mom had to take him to the doctor. She told me Ridgemont wouldn’t be like that anymore, especially once he got his wings.”\n\n“Wings?” I asked, incredulously.\n\nIvy looked at me equally incredulous. “Yeh, his wings. All sprites get them. I’m super excited to get mine! I don’t know how to get them though, mom wants it to be a surprise. She just keeps saying “In time Ivy, in time.” \n\nI looked back up at the attic, telling Ivy, “Okay, we can talk about this later. For now, let's convince your brother to go outside with us”.\n\nI pulled down the ladder with a tremendous squeak of metal grating on metal. Unlike the front door, there was nothing musical about this sound. The entrance to the attic was a gaping black maw above me. It seemed to be completely dark, with no light \n\nI began to climb the ladder, calling to Ridgemont while I did, “Hey Ridgemont? You up here buddy? I was getting worried, I couldn’t find you anywhere! Do you want to go outside with me and……”\n\nI was cut off by a blurring figure in front of me. I couldn’t get a good look before I was bodily pushed off the ladder. I landed flat on my back, my lungs compressing as my head rapped sharply on the marble floor. That hurt! I could only take tiny breaths, and my head felt like somebody had tried to force my brains out through my eye sockets by banging on the back of my skull like a glass bottle of ketchup. My eyes focused just in time to see a dark figure leap from the attic. I rolled to the side, narrowly avoiding becoming a landing pad. \n\nThe dark, lumpy figure crouched on the floor fled out the hallway door, laughing darkly. I vaguely noticed Ivy run over to me, concerned and frightened\n\n“Hey, James! Are.. are you okay? You, you fell really hard…… are you okay? What was that? What happened?”. \n\n“I’m okay,” I told him, though the slight slur in my words and the aching in my body told me I wasn’t completely fine. “Just had a little tumble.” \n\nHe looked down at me, his bright eyes concerned. There was the start of tears forming in his eyes. “Do you know what that was? Was that Ridgemont? What happened to him!”\n\nWas that Ridgemont? The size was about right, but the shape most certainly wasn’t. \n\n“I’m going to check up in the attic, see what that thing was doing up there.” I told Ivy in what I hoped was a soothing voice.\n\n“No!” Ivy almost shouted that first word, then lowered his voice, “Don’t leave me down here. Please don’t leave me down here alone with that, that, that thing!” \n\nHe was scared, and I couldn't blame him. I was freaking out myself. What had I gotten myself into?\n\n“Okay. I’ll go up first, and you follow behind me. Let me know if that thing comes back in here, okay?”\n\nIvy’s voice was trembling a little, “yeah, okay.”\n\nI started up the ladder, the deep darkness above me, then around me, made it impossible to see anything. I grabbed my phone flashlight, the tiny light it cast seemed pitiful compared to the complete dark of the attic. I didn’t see anything out of the ordinary. The attic had a tall, triangular roof, with thick beams reinforcing it along the sides. The floor was rough wood, and was crowded with a variety of boxes and gray storage bins. Off to the side was a small pile of assorted wooden boards. I noticed a glimmer of light above me, and squinted up into the darkness. Little objects seemed to be moving near the top of the roof, crowding in little patches of space.   \n Wind chimes. The ceiling was crowded with wind chimes. They hung, some slowly spinning, not making a sound. They seemed to be the only eccentricity in the attic, and so I raised myself fully into the space. Ivy, following my instructions precisely, was directly behind me. I turned and helped into the attic, keeping alert for any sound behind me. \n\n“I’m going to look around. Okay?” I asked Ivy. My voice seemed oddly flat in the oppressive atmosphere of the attic. \n\n“Okay,” Ivy whispered back, “I’m going to stay right here by the hatch.”\n\nHe still seemed spooked, and I couldn’t blame him. I was feeling a healthy dose of fear myself. My head still rang, and my ribs ached. I had no idea what attacked me, and this attic was awfully dark and scary. I couldn’t let it get to me, I had to stay strong for Ivy, Ridgemont too. I had an ominous feeling that the thing which knocked me from the latter was Ridgemont, or at least some form of Ridgemont.\n\nI started walking between the rows of storage, it was a huge attic with many bins and boxes taking up space. I kept my ears open as I looked around, not wanting to be surprised again. I couldn’t help but startle each time my feet found a loose board. There didn’t seem to be anything out of the ordinary up in the attic. Besides the creepy wind chimes above me, and the possible layer of an aggressive monster. I’m a babysitter, what on earth was I doing here?\n\nThe last row showed a clue, or at the very least, what I thought to be a clue. A dark pool of liquid pooled in the center of the aisle. The boxes in this row were crumpled and torn, the bins scratched and ripped. What on earth happened up here? An animal? I looked closer at the pool of liquid. It was dark, maybe reddish? I sure as hell was not going to stick my finger in it at any rate. I was about to return to Ivy when I noticed a gleam of color against one of the brown boxes. A strip of fabric, the same color shirt that Ridgemont had been wearing. \n\nIt was at this point I called Analise. It was probably past time for me to do so. Finding this scrap of shirt confirmed my decision. I called her, not enjoying the sudden dark as my light source pointed to the right from my ear. \n\n“Brrring……..Brrring……. I'm sorry but 678-549-09345 is not available, to lea”\n\nI hung up. She was probably driving home right now. I hoped she was driving home right now. She’d probably only check her voice mail when she arrived back home. \n\nI was trying to piece it together. The rules of this house, Ridgemont's past behavior, the dark pool of possible blood, the strip of his shirt left behind. I had a few guesses, most of them seemed to be too silly or outrageous. My best guess is that Ridgemont got his wings while he was in the attic. Something about not being outside made him go crazy, and attack me. It seemed to fill the clues, but I just didn’t know nearly enough about sprites to make a better guess. \n\n“I’m going to go back down there,” I told Ivy cautiously, not wanting him to freak out, “and I think it’d be best if you hid up here for now.”\n\nI could see him thinking, his little mind working, his bright eyes widening.   \n “But.. But then I’d be up here alone in the, in the dark. And you’d be down there alone with that thing!” He was breathing faster now, his chest heaving as his fear and anxiety grew.  \n I knelt down next to him, putting my hand on his shoulder, speaking calmly yet confident, “It’s going to be okay. I’m going to help your brother, and you're going to be super brave and ignore the darkness.”  \n He still wasn’t convinced, he gulped and said, “But mom says we aren't supposed to come up here, not ever.” \n\nI smiled cheekily at him, making merry a situation that terrified the both of us. “Okay, sure. But you're already up here right? So that rule’s already broken, throughout the window, right? What harm can it do to stay up here?”\n\n“None, I guess. Can I keep the flashlight then?” I knew he’d do it. I gave him my phone, not eager to leave my method of communication with Ivy, but knowing that he’d need the light a lot more than I would. \n\n“If your mom calls, tell her what happened, okay?”\n\nHe nodded, and I headed down the ladder. \n\nThe hallway was dark, unlike how we’d left it not five minutes ago. I peered cautiously down the hallway. It was dark. Not as dark as the attic, but a sharp contrast to how bright and open it had been before we entered the attic. \n\nI took a second to listen, I could hear something down the hall. A low clatter, then nothing. Then a louder crash. With no idea what I was getting myself into, I started down the hallway. I walked slowly, carefully, regretting my lack of a flashlight the whole time. I hoped Ivy found great comfort in having it, because I definitely would have at this point. The noises were getting louder as I moved down the hallway. They seemed to be coming from the playroom. Were we all really playing monopoly together in that very room not half an hour ago? It seemed like so much had happened in a very short amount of time. \n\nStanding in front of the door, it was obvious that the sounds were coming from within the playroom. I reached for the handle, and hesitated. What was I doing? What was I going to do? Confront some aggressive creature which already knocked me ass over heels? The commotion and clatter continued. What would I do after I opened the door? Talk to the thing? Probably not, it didn’t seem the type to listen. But still, I couldn’t just do nothing. If the thing was Ridgemont after all, he needed help, and Analise wasn’t answering. I could wait for her, but she might be too far away.\n\nMaking my decision, I backed away from the door. I went to each window, opening the blinds; letting light once again flood the house. I felt much better with the darkness conquered, if I was going into the playroom, I wasn’t going in the darkness. As I had opened the curtains, the noises from the playroom had quieted, then quieted. I had the ominous feeling that it was waiting for me, just behind the door. \n\nI took a deep breath, reached for the handle, released the breath, and opened the door. The room was dark, but by the light sinking in from the hallway I could see that it was destroyed. The bookshelf which had held the games, so carefully stacked, was now toppled, the games spilled out across the floor. The only clear spot was a square close to the center of the room. A monopoly board lay there, set up in the middle of a game, money stacks for three people laid out carefully. On the side of the board where the light stopped, halted by the angle of the door, a dark figure sat. \n\nSquinting through the darkness, I could see it was indeed Ridgemont, but he was different. I opened the door wider, and saw him in detail for the first time since the rainstorm. His hair was now oily black, hanging limply over pale, drawn skin. His shirt hung in tatters from his chest. The hands resting in his lap contained long, curved fingernails. And behind him, quivering slightly, were a set of black, leathery wings. \n\n“Ridgemont?” I asked, cursing the tremor in my voice, “Are you okay?”\n\nHe looked at me then. With crazed black eyes. Deep, insane black eyes. \n\n“No. I’m afraid I’m not.” His voice was darker too, like the rest of him. Haunted. “You see, we never got to finish our game. I HATE NOT GETTING TO FINISH MY GAMES!”\n\nHe was standing with that last line, shouting it angrily at me. He was tense, arms hanging down, fingers curved toward me.   \n “Uhm, do you want to finish the game now?” I tried asking him \n\n“No. No no no no. It’s much too late. The luck gone. The rhythm disappeared. I want to play a different game.”   \n “Okay, yeh, we can do that, we can totally do that. What game do you want to play?”\n\n“Let’s play hide and seek.” He grinned awfully. “You hide and I’ll find you. It’ll be fun.”\n\nI tried to think, couldn’t think. I knew how fast he could move, and I didn’t think he’d hesitate to attack me again. The very least I could do was protect Ivy.\n\n“I’ll play hide and seek with you, but it’s just me and you. Ivy isn’t playing this game with us. \n\n“Fine, my lame brother can go play by himself for now. Me and you will have plenty of fun on our own, and when we’re done, I’ll go force him to play with me. I’ll be nice. You can have two whole minutes to hide.”\n\n“Wai..” \n\n“One….. Two….Th”\n\nI turned from the room, and ran. I started for the front door, then reconsidered. I didn’t think that Ridgemont would follow me outside. If I wasn’t inside, would he just go straight after Ivy? Or would he track me down if I ran. I had no idea how fast his wings were. Could my car outrun him with a two-minute head start? I just didn’t have nearly enough information, or time. Internally cursing myself, I turned around, heading for the attic. I had to keep Ivy safe. There was no guarantee that Ridgemont would leave Ivy alone if he found him while looking for me. He’d said Ivy wasn’t in the game, but I didn’t know if Ridgemont's words actually meant anything. \n\nI rushed up the ladder as quietly as I could, then pulled it silently up behind me, hoping that Ridgemont would think I collapsed it after he pushed me from the ladder.   \n “Ivy? Ivy are you up here? I need my light, now!” I whispered urgently as loudly as I dared\n\n“James? What's wrong? Why are you back up here? Is Ridge alright?” A small voice whispered back from the darkness.  \n “I need my light, now please, quickly!”\n\nI heard movement from one of the rows, then a light snapped on. Ivy sneaked over, wary of my urgency. I grabbed the phone, casting the beam around. There! A small stack of 2X4 boards I had noticed earlier. I took the top one, then laid it across the hatch. I took my belt and fastened it to a rung of the folded ladder. It wasn’t perfect but hopefully would delay Ridgemont if he tried the ladder. \n\nI turned the phone on, redialing a number from a past call. Ivy looked at me curiously, fear still sparkling in his eyes.\n\n“Are you trying to call mom again?” He asked softly. \n\n“No, not this time.” I answered, with the phone in my ear, “I’m calling someone who might be able to help. Her name is Minerva.”",

I thought I'd have to bleach it until my roommate recommended a brand that would work for dark hair. I finally took the first step and bought a beautiful mermaid green dye that happens to match my animal crossing character (I have been living out my dyed hair dreams vicariously through animal crossing), and my roommate and their girlfriend dyed it. It turned out great! It was plenty visible and shone green in the sun.\n\nEnter my brother's fiancé. She and my brother have been dating for the better part of 5 years, they're soon to be married, and she asked me to be one of her bridesmaids. She has been completely rude to me and my family since we've met her, but that's a story for another time. I posted a picture of me with my new hair on my Instagram story, and I guess she saw it because I immediately got a text saying \"I need you to have regular hair color for my wedding\". There was no \"you look great\" or anything, she just immediately took the opportunity to say my hair doesn't fit in with her \"ideal wedding and family\" and the picture that \"she will cherish forever\". I was shocked and hurt that she would care more about the aesthetic of her wedding than her bridesmaids being themselves. I haven't replied to her because I don't want to say something rude that would jeopardize the rest of our relationship but I want to tell her how hurt I am. So WIBTA if I talked to her about it and kept my hair dyed for the wedding? I know it is her day, but I feel it isn't her place to control what I do to my body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: The wedding is in about a year. This was a test run to see if I liked it for the long run (I do).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2: For those who asked, the dye I used was Lime Crime's Unicorn Hair in the color Sea Witch.",

If you were known to do this and it was just who you are then she would have known that when she asked you and would have expected it for her big day... but this is really unfair to suddenly do and expect her to be okay with it.\n\nYes, it's just hair but the hair color will definitely steal a bit of spotlight in photos, will definitely be talked about, and, in future, when those who don't know you see you in photos it'll be met with \"oh my gosh, who's the girl with green hair??\" every time. Then an eye roll and just bad vibes all around. It will surely sour your relationship with your soon to be SIL.\n\nShe could have approached you better regarding the situation but it really was a bad move on your part. Dye it back before the wedding and then dye it green again later and start being the girl with the awesome mermaid hair.",

This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***\n\nWIBTA\n\nI have been wanting to dye my hair for ages, but I've been too scared to do it since I have naturally dark brown hair. I thought I'd have to bleach it until my roommate recommended a brand that would work for dark hair. I finally took the first step and bought a beautiful mermaid green dye that happens to match my animal crossing character (I have been living out my dyed hair dreams vicariously through animal crossing), and my roommate and their girlfriend dyed it. It turned out great! It was plenty visible and shone green in the sun. \n\nEnter my brother's fiancé. She and my brother have been dating for the better part of 5 years, they're soon to be married, and she asked me to be one of her bridesmaids. She has been completely rude to me and my family since we've met her, but that's a story for another time. I posted a picture of me with my new hair on my Instagram story, and I guess she saw it because I immediately got a text saying \"I need you to have regular hair color for my wedding\". There was no \"you look great\" or anything, she just immediately took the opportunity to say my hair doesn't fit in with her \"ideal wedding and family\" and the picture that \"she will cherish forever\". I was shocked and hurt that she would care more about the aesthetic of her wedding than her bridesmaids being themselves. I haven't replied to her because I don't want to say something rude that would jeopardize the rest of our relationship but I want to tell her how hurt I am. So WIBTA if I talked to her about it and kept my hair dyed for the wedding? I know it is her day, but I feel it isn't her place to control what I do to my body.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "body": "# Intoduction\n\nIn minecraft, you can't really draw things, or make kind of \"custom textures\" on walls except if you make a giant pattern hidden somewhere in the world and \"screenshot\" it with a map. So my idea is to make a Paper and Quill, a new item, similar to maps with which you can draw things!\n\n# Crafting\n\nIn order to craft a Paper and Quill, you need to put a piece of paper and a feather together in the crafting table.\n\n# How it works\n\nTo draw things in it, you first have to right click while holding the item to start editing it ( you get a menu like you are editing a book).\n\nThe resolution of the Paper is 16 x 16 pixels. You can increase its resolution by adding more paper in the crafting table (the resolutions are 16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128) Left click, you draw, right click, you erase, it's that easy.\n\nOn the left of the paper there is a set of colors (all the colors from the dyes of minecraft). For example, if you want to draw with green, you need to have green dye, then you click on the green. The dyes you don't have appear with a grey filter on it (like you can't select it). Below the set there is a \"combine colors\" button, and when you click on it, it lets you click on two different colors of dyes you have and then a mix of these two colors appears in a new slot next to the basic set of dyes.\n\nBelow it, there is the \"done\" button which saves what you've drawn.\n\n# Appearance\n\nWhen you hold the Paper and Quill in your hand, you have the same animation as if you're holding a map, that is to say you hold it in your two hands. Then, you can expose it by right clicking on an item frame life a map.\n\n# Uses\n\nWith a Paper and a Quill, you can\n\n* Make custom paintings\n* Make custom wall textures\n* Make custom maps\n* Make architecture plans\n* Make custom signs",

The cocktails were absolutely stunning—so creative and delicious (the one with egg white and lime was a great). And the view of the river, especially with the green dye for the holiday, was unreal. Perfect vibe for a girls’ night out.\n\nSince I’m still new here, I’d love some recs for other riverfront spots with great drinks and vibes. What are your faves?",

My husband walks in, telling me about an episode of Star Trek. He takes a look in the utility tub and comments that I look like I’m a mad scientist, cooking up a concoction with my giant spoon and tub of dark green liquid. I don’t know which scenario I would have thought to be less likely 10 years ago, that I would someday be a mad scientist or that I would someday be nonchalantly discussing a Star Trek episode with my husband of a decade while dyeing 200 feet of cotton 3-strand rope to be used for bondage with my boyfriend. Never mind, it’s not hard to guess which would have been a bigger shock to my former self. It would have absolutely been the latter. \n\nThis week, I’m celebrating the anniversary of my first year practicing ethical non-monogamy (ENM). It’s been a year of essentially living a double life, as I’ve shared this with very few people from my life pre-ENM. I work as a psychologist at a large university, and I just haven’t felt quite ready to be “out” to my colleagues, my future patients, my high school friends, and my mom. Although maintaining a (mostly) closeted a non-monogamous lifestyle has brought some challenges, it has also brought an incredible amount of growth- emotionally, intellectually, inter-personally, and sexually. Aside from the year that I became a mother, I can’t think of another time in my adult life that I’ve been so emotionally vulnerable. So continually challenged about everything I thought I knew about relationships and life and love. This piece is a reflection of this past year, a culmination of the things I’ve experienced and lessons I’ve learned. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I spent the first few months of practicing ENM trying to figure out how to put a label on my primary relationship and on myself. Are we polyamorous? Are we “monogamish”? Am I bisexual? Am I heteroflexible? At some point (with the help of my therapist), I challenged myself to let go of trying to fit myself into a box and try to embrace fluidity. I’ve learned that it’s totally possible to be in a committed relationship in which each partner practices a different style of ENM. I enjoy having romantic feelings for multiple partners (polyamory), while my husband enjoys having a sexual partner other than me every once in a while but has no desire to develop feelings for anybody else. It works for us and that’s really all that matters. \n* I entered the online dating scene for the first time in 12 years. It was both fun and scary putting together a dating profile after such a long time. People are really into swiping now! I must say, my experience on OKCupid was mostly positive. It gave me the opportunity to connect with people that I don’t know if I ever would have had the chance to meet in the wild. Some I’ve dated, some have just become close friends, and some I’d prefer not to run into at the grocery store (although those are few and far between). All have been entered into my dating spreadsheet because how else do moms in their mid-30s keep track of their dates? \n* I had my first sexual experience with a woman, something I had been curious about since I was a teen. I’ve loved getting to explore this facet of my sexuality. I have to admit, I haven’t quite gotten the hang of flirting with women and I’m not sure if I ever will. Will  there come a day when I’ll be able to tell whether we’re joking or actually into each other? Stay tuned for the next blog in 10 years to find out. \n* I had my first threesome and learned that it’s not as easy as it looks in porn. There are a lot of body parts to tend to and the interaction requires an obscene amount of concentration. That said, the payoff of enjoying two lusty partners at once is one of life’s greatest pleasures.  There are few things better than being the middle spoon. \n* I learned that developing feelings for other people does not diminish the feelings that I have for my spouse. This one was really a shock to my monogamy-conditioned system. In many ways, opening up our marriage has brought us closer together. I think my former self would have never believed this was possible.\n* I started the year thinking that I was “vanilla”. My husband isn’t kinky, so I had just assumed that I wasn’t either. Turns out, there was a caged sex kitten living inside of me this whole time. Once I was able to give myself permission to explore without guilt or shame, she was finally set free. When it comes to kink, I still often feel like a kid in a candy store, delighted by each new pleasure. It’s like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but with rope and sex toys and lube. “Come with me, and you’ll be in a world of pure imagination…” \n* I opened myself up to developing romantic feelings and in doing so, opened myself up to both joy and heartache. I felt the sting of rejection. I got ghosted. I got dumped. I ended a relationship with someone that I cared about deeply because the timing didn’t feel right and it was fucking brutal. I was forced to distance myself from my partners for three months during a quarantine. I cried. I cried a lot. Icing my eyes over this past year has not been pleasant, but it has been a real part of the journey. For me it confirmed that I was truly living my life with an open heart, and I wouldn’t trade that for anything. \n* I feel more sexually empowered than I ever have. I’ve learned to ask for what I want, tell my partners what feels good, have discussions about boundaries, and seek out new sexual adventures. It’s a work in progress, but I’m also learning to trust that my body is beautiful and sexy. For many years, especially post-partum, I would find myself critiquing my body during sex. Having new people look at my body and lust for it has felt amazing. It’s helped me to see my body in a new light, literally (as evidenced by a photo that my partner took of the sun shining perfectly through the window onto my freshly-spanked ass). \n* Just when it felt like my heart couldn’t possibly grow more, it did. It grew when I developed feelings for a partner and they developed them back. It grew when I developed friendships with my metamours. It grew when my husband made a computer for my partner. It grew when I experienced compersion for the first time. It grew when I was invited into my partners’ homes and met their children. It grew when I finally felt ready to invite my longest-term partner to meet my son, and they were immediately buddies. Alright, that one made it grow three sizes. \n* Last but certainly not least, I have met some of the nicest, most caring people I’ve ever known. People who accept me with all of my quirks, who check in with me, who genuinely care about my well-being and my relationships, who share in the joy and the pain that this lifestyle brings. The friendships that I’ve made since entering into the ENM community (specifically the poly community) have been incredible. I don’t think I could have navigated these unfamiliar waters without them.",

    "body": "Hello! I'm writing this from home about **23 hours after arriving at the hospital for my gallbladder removal.** I just wanted to make something of a record of my experiences for anyone who, like me, doom-scrolled on this sub or other sites and maybe found some good stories and some bad-- I figured I'd like to add a good one into the pile if it helps ease anyone's nerves at all. Of course, as everyone will tell you, this experience is not universally the same with everyone, and everyone's surgery and recovery is different, (and I am certainly no medical expert) but maybe you're in a similar situation/demographic as me and would like to compare & contrast. At least, that's what I really wanted to do when I was looking around.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**PRE-SURGERY**\n\n\nSo **about me** real quick: I'm 25 (turning 26 a week from today), I'm about 5'9, and throughout the pre and post-surgery process, I've weighed anywhere from 150 to 160; I was 151 when I went in for surgery-- more on that later. I'm a white male (only stating this because I was told that women and other races can experience this whole thing differently.) Being honest, I am not the most active and definitely do not have a balanced diet. I'm notoriously picky, typically don't get three meals a day, if even two, and there's a lot of junk food passin' thru. So if I had to guess, that's what landed me in this spot, the cholesterol-of-it-all, though my mom's grandma did have her g-bladder taken out in the 80s, so a bit of a family history there. As for my occupation, I work from home as a full-time YouTube and Twitch content creator (I *also* wish there was a better term for it that didn't make me feel like a douche--\"YouTuber and Twitch streamer\" also feels bad to me). So as I said, not like I'm doin' a ton of physical labor or even moving around a lot during a typical work day of writing/editing/streaming. But outside of this, y'know, relatively sedentary lifestyle, I'm otherwise in good health. The only thing I deal with consistently is GERD (aka acid reflux) that I was diagnosed with earlier this year and take medication for. Some folks (non-medical professionals) have suggested or pondered that this is connected to my gallbladder issues, but I don't really know for sure.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere's a bit of a **timeline of my experience/condition prior to surgery.** I think the trouble really started in late July-- I was drinking, playing games with friends over Discord, and I was just hit with the worst heartburn I've ever had. And when I drink, there's typically like a 1/3 chance I'll get heartburn, but then I pop a few Tums and it goes away quickly. This one had me writhing on the floor trying to position myself in some way to get some relief. The heartburn sensation eventually passed, I cut myself off, and haven't had more than one alc bev at a time since. The following week, I experienced a consistent abdominal discomfort-- wouldn't call it pain, but just a sort of tight sensation, and it was actually always concentrated on my **upper left** side. You may know the gallbladder is on the right, but I was told later that it's not terribly uncommon for pain/discomfort to manifest and radiate from the upper left-- it's definitely more common on the right, but not unheard of for the left. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI was complaining of this pain one night while streaming, and joked that it felt like there was a little guy in my ribs like shovin' stuff around and making me uncomfortable. My chat basically begged me to see a doctor, and one person was prescient enough to predict that it was a gallbladder issue long before I had any testing done. But the discomfort subsided after a week or so, and August came and went without issue. But then in September, I would find myself in similar fits of discomfort after eating certain foods. I'd later realize that it was fatty/greasy stuff that was often the culprit, and dairy typically didn't help either. It never played nice with the GERD in the first place, though it only ever really gives me tummy rumblings and maybe a more...\"creative\" bowel movement than usual later on. I should say, **even in my lowest moments with this, I don't think I could say my pain ever exceeded a 3.** I even hesitate to call it pain, and more so a discomfort. I saw several posts on here about people who suffer from consistent, painful attacks, but not really any from folks who had a more minor reaction. I don't know if this is because I caught this relatively early, if my condition is/was just not as bad, or if I have a high tolerance for pain. Regardless, I got an appointment with my primary phys on Sep. 19th, and he sent me off to get an **ultrasound** on the 28th. If you're new to that or wondering, it's fairly simple-- you lay down, lift your shirt up, and they'll sorta just lube you up with a goopy magic wand that lets them see what's happening inside by using sound wave magic or something. Not scary or painful. **They won't tell you if something/what is wrong during this, so keep that in mind.** The one lady said I had a nice spleen though, so I did know my spleen was all good. I told her thanks and that I grew it myself. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI got a call the next day informing me that my gallbladder has \"sludge\" in it (the word they used) and that there was \"a polyp.\" I was not told exactly where that was or how big it was, which was, y'know, unpleasant, and it seemed like the person delivering that information also did not know. With removal being the likely next step, I was referred to a laparoscopic surgeon for a consultation on Oct. 4th. In the interim, after doing a bit of googling, I started to re-shape my diet into more inoffensive and plain stuff. **Foods that worked for me:**\n\n* Toast\n* PB&J\n* Toaster Strudels (strawberry, baybee)\n* Raw carrots (i really craved a crunch after cutting myself off from chips)\n* Ramen noodles (salty and probably a culprit for what got me here, I know, but never bothered me gallbladder-wise)\n* Rigatoni\n* Dry cereal\n* Beef (both in the form of steak and little beef stick snacks)\n* Mashed potatoes\n* Fruit snacks\n* Baked/air fried chicken (though I did get a bit of discomfort from this if too big of a quantity)\n* Water (I'm unfortunately not a hydro homie, but I typically flavored it with Lemonade Mio)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Foods that almost always bothered me:**\n\n* Ice cream\n* French fries\n* Fried chicken\n* Cheeses\n* Pizza\n* Cereal with milk\n* Potato chips (or any other similar snacks)\n* Apples (I started trying to have one a day-- they keep the doctor away, after all. I realized that I couldn't bring myself to ever finish a full honeycrisp for some reason. Later found out that they're best avoided due to containing pepsin)\n* Soda (I was later told that soft drinks are probably okay, though my body did not seem to appreciate any time I gave it orange soda)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnyway, I went to **my consultation with the surgeon** which pretty much went as I expected. I was told, however, that the \"polyp\" seen on the ultrasound was not necessarily a polyp, but potentially and even more likely to be gallstones. I was also told that being male and having gallstones actually gives me an advantage on dealing with the whole process-- specifically how, I don't recall, but I was told I was already two steps ahead. The doc basically laid out my options-- either closely monitor this thing, alter my diet forever, and essentially risk future painful experiences including damage to my ducts, pancreatitis, and developing cancer. Or, get the sucker out via surgery. Obviously there are risks with that too, as there are with any surgery, but it seemed like a pretty easy choice. He didn't actually recommend either route, but the way he laid out the two paths made it seem like a no brainer. After I made my choice, he basically said \"Yeah, that's the best move if you ask me, I have patients who wait and wait because they don't want surgery, but finally decide to get it taken out after it gets unbearable, and they kick themselves for not just doing it earlier.\" After that, I was scheduled to have the lazy stoner organ removed on the morning of Oct. 14th.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn the interim, I needed to get some **pre-op testing** done, and for me, that was just a walk-in thing that I was able to do without an appointment, though it did take me a few hours to get through, possibly because I went in on Columbus Day and more people had off work. This entailed an **x-ray** (I put my chest and left side up against a horizontal surface and they take pics), some **bloodwork** (just a leetle needle to take some blood, very quick), a **urine sample** (was not expecting this, and it took me a good while) and an **EKG** (you lay down, they put some sticky pads on you, and they read your heart's mind, very easy and not painful whatsoever)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**DAY-OF**\n\nThen, I waited, kept to my blander diet, and got a call the day before letting me know to be at the hospital for 6am, and no food or drink after midnight. Obviously someone needs to get you there and back safely, so I went with my mom. I was definitely nervous-- I've had minor surgeries before, namely wisdom teeth removal a few years ago, and removal of a small frenulum on my tongue when I was in middle school. So I was familiar with the \"going under\" process, though that didn't change my irrational fears of not waking up, and y'know, it's a bit gnarlier, the prospect of them digging around in your mid-section, as opposed to just your mouth. So you're not alone if you find that off-putting and nerve-wracking. I didn't sleep at all the night before (my schedule is pretty wonky and I woke up for the day prior at like 3PM) but I figured I didn't really need my wits about me and would rather be as tired as possible when I get home anyway. But nerves aside, **try to think rationally and remind yourself of the logical points:** it's a very common procedure, and the vast majority of people who undergo it see no real complications, and their QoL improves afterwards. **The surgery and recovery period will almost certainly be preferable to your current condition, potential future worsening of said condition, or the arrival of new and even worse conditions.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo, we get there for 6am, check in, wait for a bit, then I signed some forms and got my little day-pass bracelet put on (meals and rides not included sadly) and was sent with my mom to the short-stay part of the hospital. **Here, I went to an area with a bed and a curtain, my mom waited in that area's waiting room, and I was given some fresh new duds and had to de-robe entirely (sans face mask).** I definitely forgot I would be in a no-ass-coverage gown for this, but you won't be walking around at all anymore at this point pre-surgery, and if you did have to for whatever reason, you can hold it closed behind you. But I have a nice ass so it really is nbd regardless. I put on a little lunch lady hat, as well as these special little thigh-high compression socks that I also was not anticipating. I felt very silly putting them on, and fittingly [felt a kinship with a fellow Patrick](https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--tablet-1_5x/public/2020/04/spongebob-movie-patrick-legs.jpg). These bad boys are to help with your circulation and prevent blood clots-- I actually had a thicker, green pair put on on top of them, which was nice because my leg hair sorta poked through the thinner pair, and that was just weird. I also put on some nifty yellow socks that'll keep you from slipping on the hospital floor when you're back on your feet. By this point, I'd recommend texting any fam or S.O. as you'll likely soon be putting your valuables like phone and wallet into a bag along with your clothes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter getting properly dressed, I was visited by a few people. **You're going to be answering the same questions over and over,** and if your people are any fun, they might joke about how repetitive it is. Same standard stuff: name, date of birth, height and weight, what procedure you're having done (yes, *you *have to tell *them*), if you smoke, drink, have any metal in you, piercings, anything loose with your teeth, if you properly fasted etc. In the early portions of this, **I was set up with the IV in my wrist,** which is a little pokier than the bloodwork I got done, but not really painful. I just looked away. Nothing fun going into it at this point. Probably halfway into my Q&A with all my visitors, my mom was able to join me and sit with me-- it was probably about 7:30am or so. Some more signatures and questions happen, you meet your anesthesia team, and they were my faves. Very chill and weren't constantly giving just \"doctor talk,\" if that makes sense. They'll answer any questions you have about that side of things, but we also just small-talked about Netflix and my upcoming birthday. One guy on the team was probably just a tad older than me, and assured me that I'd be good to go to still have a good time on my b-day, just don't go crazy on the beers. Which I did not intend to because I hate that shit, so it sounded good to me.  At this point, they also put some green dye into my IV, which helps them see things better when they go in.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThen my surgeon came in, we did a bunch of the same questions again, and my mom and I both asked the questions that we had. Mainly stuff about diet afterwards, how long it would take, what digestion/BMs might be like afterwards. In that order, **I was told no real dietary restrictions beyond the first two days. He seemed especially reassuring about that-- on the first day, stick to liquids and if you're really hungry, you can go for somethin' like a sandwich or toast or whatever.** But he said he's had patients who get it taken out in the morning, and are eating chicken wings for dinner the same day. He said that everyone is different though, and for every 1,000 cases he's seen, there's basically 1,000 different results. I elected to play it pretty safe afterwards, but more on that later. **As for length of the procedure, the answer is basically \"as long as it takes,\" though he said that he's had some that take 15 minutes, and some that take 3 hours. I ended up being in surgery for about 30 minutes.** I asked if I should expect/prepare for diarrhea afterwards, and he said not necessarily. Again, everyone is different-- you could potentially have it for days, weeks, or months, or apparently not at all. That last part surprised me, and I also can't really speak to that yet, as duty is yet to call. (Haha, duty.) I was also told that **walking is key.** It's okay and expected to spend most of day 1 resting in bed, but don't baby yourself if possible, and try to walk around. The doc said \"Walking is going to help even more than the drugs.\" Not sure if that's universally the advice, but that's what I was told. And of course, the other things you probably know already if you're reading this: no driving for a week, no lifting 10 lbs+ stuff, no hot tubs or baths for 3 weeks or so. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow, as for the procedure itself, this was more-so explained at the consultation and not in the moment, but essentially, **they make four small incisions, and they inset a device with a camera to see your insides. They'll also be using those incision sites to insert the surgical tools needed to evict the little bastard.** I actually had it explained to me that it's as if the doc is using VR to do it-- it's a simplification and obviously not a 1:1 metaphor, but may give you an idea of how it works. It was also said that doing the procedure this way makes it as if you're watching the surgery in 4K on a big screen instead of like, 240p on a rabbit ear TV, which is what alternative or older procedures were compared to.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnyway, after getting thru all of my questions and post-surgery advice with the doc, he said see ya later and took off. Not long after, **my anesthesia friends started sending some happy stuff into the IV to help relax me, and that kicks in pretty quick.** Very shortly after that, it was time to get 'em out-- I said bye to my ma, they started rolling me into the operating room. It was about 8 a.m. by this point. My O.R. was big and cooler than where I'd spent most of my morning hanging out. Lots of people, and some music playing from above. They scooched me from my roll-y bed to the operating table, and I had the sleepy mask put on not long after. I anticipated being asked to count down-- in fact, the last convo I remember having was with the anesthesia guy around my age. He said I'll start to be feelin' sleepy soon, I asked if I needed to count down, and he was like \"Nah, we don't really do that.\" Next thing I know, I'm waking up in the recovery room at around 10:15 a.m.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**POST-SURGERY - HOSPITAL**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo, I wake up, and I'm up four (4) battle scars and down one (1) little pear-shaped bitch. I remember being very appreciative and thankful to basically anyone I could interact with around me. They told me I did so well, and I remember I kept trying to touch my eyes and they wouldn't let me-- I was crying involuntarily, but not really a scared or upset crying, I think just happy or relieved, and just totally at the mercy of the loopy drugs. I asked for a tissue and they gave me one so I could get out the tears and the sleepy seeds. My mom was able to join me again about 5 minutes after I remember waking up. **I would say that my pain was at like a 4 or 5 when I woke up, mainly concentrated in my right shoulder, though it sort of migrated to my chest, and then my back, and would come and go. These are the gas pains that pretty much everyone can expect.** I had an ice pack applied to my rightmost scar, the one nearest to where the gallbladder was, and that's probably the most sensitive spot. Still, it was by no means unbearable or the worst physical pain I've been in. (That award goes to the day I learned to ride a bike as a kid, when I just fuckin' blackened my little nuts by losing control of my bike and collided with a fence pole. Got an ultrasound for that too, to make sure both of my senators were still fit to hold office.) **As of this point, the gas pain/incision sites have not felt any worse, and I'm sitting at like a 3 or 4 right now, having only taken ibuprofen.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut as for the immediate aftermath, you'll be, unsurprisingly, recovering in your little recovery room, and able to talk to your party member of choice and text any loved ones if you have the energy. I sorta just remember hanging around and chatting for a decent bit, munching on some ice chips and drinking apple juice until a nurse came in and wanted me to try and sit up on the side of the bed. I don't know if this happens to everyone, but **I had a big wave of nausea hit when I sat up**, presumably from the anesthetics. I was given a little bag in case I needed to microsoft expel, though I didn't end up donating anything to it. I kept feeling like something was coming up and would bring the bag to my face, but then it would pass and I'd put the bag down. Rinse and repeat like 10 times. I dry-heaved two or three times but that was the extent of it. **I would say this was the worst part for me personally, but I also just really hate the pre-game to throwing up.** Eventually I was able to start burping which provided a ton of relief, and was also given a little bit of Sprite to help aid that. **The nausea thankfully passed after no more than 3-5 minutes and hasn't returned since.**  It helps if your mommy is there to rub your widdle back as you go thru it. :) \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter sitting up, **the nurse wanted me to try standing. Honestly, way easier than I expected.** Didn't need to hold onto anything to get up, though we did take a short little walk down the hall and I was told to hold onto the IV pole. I was told **I couldn't leave until I peed** (I don't actually know why but also did not question it.) It felt like I coulda made somethin' happen, so I said I was down to try. I was in a bathroom with a little string thing I could pull if I needed help/was ready to let them know when I was done. I also had my little barf bag with me the whole time if needed. I couldn't pee though, despite sorta feeling like I totally could. I wouldn't worry if this happens with you. Nurse came back and I told her I couldn't, she said it was fine and that I might still need more fluid. So I got back in bed and continued drinkin' my drinks, and **I had about two liters of fluid put in me through the IV** to help the process along. I ended up sorta involuntarily falling asleep and took a decent nap. When I woke up, I was taken to try and pee again. I definitely felt more capable of it this time, but once again just couldn't do it when I was standing there. I honestly think it was because I just felt weird standing there in my assless chap gown, **so I just sat down and tried that way** and then it was *flowin',* like immediately. So pro-tip if you're in that spot. Also, if you're able to pee without a different nurse just sorta walking in to use the sink and not noticing you at first, you will have had a superior experience to mine. I was like \"Oh, hey. I'm peein'.\" And she turned around and was like \"Oh my god, I'm so sorry.\" Guess they didn't mark my b-room as occupied, but I forgive her. After I peed, (remember not to flush, otherwise it's like you beat the boss without saving the game), I pull the nurse string and this time my nurse walks in with my express permission, examines the hue of my piss, and then I went back to my recovery room and got dressed. I totally could've crushed the walk back to the car, but **they do need to wheelchair you out.** Left the hospital at about 12:30 p.m.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**POST-SURGERY - HOME**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo, my car ride home was uneventful and not really unpleasant. I got home, ate about half a jello cup (it sort of bothered my throat, more on that in a bit) and then had some Lipton chicken noodle soup, but strained it so it was just the broth. That shit *hit*, and I had another bowl later. I'll probably have some with the actual solids on day 2 & 3. I've kept to plain water, though I've only gotten through about three 17 oz. bottles by this point. I also had an Italian ice a few hours ago. That's all I've consumed so far, though I'm not particularly starving quite yet. I haven't really done anything besides take several naps and browse Twitter/Discord/Reddit, or text friends and fam. I expected I'd want to get back to playing Persona 5 but I don't really have the energy or interest in video games right now. Maybe soonish. I'm overall just quite fatigued. **Now, I was prescribed 2 drugs, but I haven't yet felt the need to take them.** So far, I prefer the moderate pain/discomfort over the potential side effects. I'm more keen on diarrhea than constipation. Obviously this might be different for you, and I might end up taking them later, since I'm not even 24 hours out yet. I'll try to update over the coming days, if anyone cares. **I was also sent home with a packet of info regarding what I can expect to feel, when I can resume doing stuff, what's best to eat, and what the drugs do, so I thankfully didn't have to memorize anything that was told to me verbally.** \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI attempted to go to sleep for the night around 10:30 p.m. and took some ibuprofen (actually mostly because of an unrelated headache) and it was the longest continuous sleep I managed since surgery, though I ended up waking up at around 1:00 a.m. Since then, I've been chillin' and online, and started writing this. Not really any gas pains yet since waking up-- earlier in the night, I was occasionally putting an ice-pack on my incision sites, and using a heating pad on my shoulder for gas pains. I have a follow-up with my surgeon on the 27th, and a follow-up with my primary physician in 2-4 weeks. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**THINGS I DID NOT EXPECT/YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **Throat soreness upon waking up.** That's sort of a lie, I knew it would feel a bit scratchy. They do intubate you (little tube in your throat to help you breathe while you're under-- if you're worried about the chronology for that, it goes in after you go to sleep, and it was out before I woke up.) However, I'd honestly say my worst/most annoying pain right now is in fact the sore throat. It was actually not too bad immediately after waking up, but felt worse after my post-surgery hospital nap. I think it's possible I was coming down with a cold the morning before surgery, so it could be in conjunction with that. Your mileage may vary with that, but I fuckin' hate a sore throat, I'd rather have a 5th incision spot than a sore throat.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **[This little guy I brought home.](https://www.vitalitymedical.com/media/catalog/product/cache/21f717a5a4491c4366455175eca0b3cb/a/i/airlife_volumetric_incentive_spirometer_-_2500_4000_ml.png)** Had no idea about this beforehand. Basically, this is to help you take deep breaths post-surgery, since the abdominal pain can make it tricky to get/want to take those good, deep breaths. This is chiefly to help prevent pneumonia. You basically inhale through the tube and move the little blue thing to a certain height-- for me, it's set at the 2,000 mark. I was told to try to do this **10 times per hour for every hour that I'm awake**. I was told it's alright if you get fewer, and it's hard to remember to spread 10 out over an hour-- you're not supposed to do them all at once. And if I set an alarm to do this like every 5 minutes or so, I'll go crazy, so I just try to do it when I remember to-- I've probably done it like 5 or 6 times while writing this. This is only for like the first day or two, I was told. I'm able to take those deep, \"\"fulfilling\" breaths on my own without much pain, thankfully. They may have you give this thing a test run before you actually go under.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **This whole thing was way more pee-involved than I expected.** Just like overall a lot more pissing than I thought there'd be. The primary reason I haven't had uninterrupted sleep is because I keep waking up and pissing like a race horse. I've probably peed somewhere around 12 times since getting home, and I'm assuming most of that is from the 2 liters they pumped into me at the hospital. Now, I know scales aren't perfect, but I somehow weighed 7 pounds more when I got home. Bummed me out because I wanted to know how thicc my gallbladder was, but all of the water weight got in the way. If you're in a similar situation (idk if the urination frequency is universal) you may be tempted to like, get a pee bottle of some kind, but I would encourage getting your walking in and taking a trip to the toilet. By the time of this post, I'm not peeing nearly as often.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **Wearing the compression socks home.** This one was kinda weird, it sorta seemed like a choice? Like, the nurse said I *could* take these home and wear them for the rest of the day to help prevent blood clots, but it also seemed like, totally optional? Idk, I wanted to play by all the rules, regardless of how ambiguously said rules are presented to me, so I'm wearing them even still. Plus, I said, \"You took something from me, so I'm taking your socks.\" The nurse admired my deal-making skills. They're a bit itchy, and I'll probably take them off when I'm gonna take my first post-surgery shower (probably pretty soon, sounds nice right about now.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **Walking has been no big deal, and the scars aren't that nasty.** I expected walking to be a true pain, and maybe it will be if day 2 and 3 are worse, but I've been getting up and moving with no real issue, did some laps in my kitchen, and I walk to the bathroom constantly because I'm filled to the brim with piss, etc. As for the scars, [here's a pic if you're truly interested (enjoy my boxers).](https://i.imgur.com/wMJNcll.png) The gray stuff is just glue, not pus or bruising or anything like that. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **Hiccups are literally the worst.** As you could probably guess, your abdomen suddenly contracting after this sort of procedure feels like a sucker punch literally every single time. I tend to trigger hiccups when I clear my throat/lightly cough, which I've been doing absent-mindedly due to my throat discomfort. If you find yourself with the hiccups, follow the usual advice to stop 'em so the torture ends. Sip water, deep breaths (a good opportunity to use your little breathing guy if you have one like me)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **Burping and farting makes you feel like a champion.** Basically, jettisoning any gas right now is just like, the best feeling, at least for me. I was burpin' in the hospital and that eased things up a lot, and continued to a bit at home, especially when walking around. Sorry if it's TMI, but as for farting, I wasn't able to until like 7 p.m. but it's happened a few more times since, and they've been just the bee's knees. After waking up from my longest nap so far, I was laying on my left side, and I unleashed just a magnificent opera of a fart, complete with an overture, complex plot twists, and a permeating theme about the woes of class and wealth disparity. Kings were born, rose to power, and died during the duration of this fart. I would've framed it if I could, it's like a top 10 moment for me. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n* **My emotional reaction upon waking up.** Obviously, everyone's different with this. I was goofy when I woke up from my frenulum removal as a kid, and straight-up boring after wisdom teeth removal as an early-20-something. I was just *weeping* when I woke up from this. I think I was really just grateful it was over and happy I woke up. I ugly cried as soon as I saw my mom, would return to my senses briefly, and then burst into tears again the next time I looked at her, complete with lip quivering and full-body sobbing. Any and every time my girlfriend was mentioned or referenced, I sobbed and repeated how much I love her (I apparently talked about her a ton before I was fully aware of myself again, so when the nurses said I could talk to her soon, it just sent me over the emotional edge.) They did tell me one funny exchange that I have no memory of-- I asked the nurse why they took my lunch lady hat, as if it were like this deep betrayal. She said, \"Oh I'm sorry! What were you going to make us for lunch??\" And I said, while sobbing, \"Mashed potatoessss!\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPhew. I did tell you this would be hyper-detailed. I hope you find it at least a little useful or comforting-- you can do it! I was worried that I couldn't! I still have some milestones to get through-- first BM and solid foods --but I'd rather those milestones over gallstones. And like I said, I'll try to update. It's kind of embarrassing how long this is, but I think I would've liked something like this before I got it done. If anything, it was a good distraction for me for a bit. If you have any questions I'd be happy to answer. Take care!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**UPDATE**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHi! I just wanted to leave a little epilogue now that I'm nearly 72 hours out from my surgery. I'm fairly certain that by this point, the worst has passed, and the worst was not that bad. I think my soreness probably peaked in the middle of day 2, but I never really even came close to using the opiates that were prescribed to me; four ibuprofen has consistently proven to be the ticket for me. I can also attest to walking around providing near immediate relief, especially when the shoulder gas pains kick in. Physically getting up will probably feel rough, but walking around is easy-- it's just getting there that's hard. And by day 3 I have no trouble moving around. I did have my first post-surgery BM about 2 hours ago-- there was nothing unordinary about it, to spare you any graphic details. I had considered using Miralax but ended up not needing to. I'm comfortably eating solids with no real issues so far-- since my initial post, I ate those Lipton soups but with the noodles, a few pieces of toast, and I actually had some rigatoni for dinner earlier today. I can also confirm that I just coincidentally had a cold right when I went into surgery, so you probably can expect a much less sore throat than what I had. I think that covers all the important stuff!",

    "body": "Hey so I just rewatched Sharp Objects the other day, and I just want to talk about the wallpaper a bit because I think it's such a beautiful example of top-notch set design. Not only is the wallpaper a ridiculously ornate design by De Gournay, but it's *green.* \n\nFun fact: from the late 18th century until the late 19th century, green dye (or \"Scheele's green\") used toxic levels of arsenic - meaning that anyone who wore/interacted with objects that were dyed green were slowly poisoned by them. For example, Napoleon, whose bedroom had green wallpaper, is believed to have died from stomach cancer, which is closely linked with arsenic poisoning, leading a lot of historians to consider his death the cause of long-term arsenic exposure. From this, the color green is not only associated with decadence (as Scheele's green and \"paris green,\" which also contained arsenic, were both used extensively in dying silk, fake plants, and other objects that were popular with the wealthy), but it has also grown to symbolize death, especially death from poisoning. \n\nJohn Paino, Sharp Object's production designer, has acknowledged this as intentional, saying: \"\\[The wallpaper\\] has all these beautiful hand-painted flowers, but they’re on top of this poisonous shade of green. It’s the color of arsenic. I thought, This is a perfect metaphor for Adora and her sort of putrid sense of wealth. It encapsulates a lot of themes that are prevalent in the show.\"\n\nSo not only is the De Gournay wallpaper used in the show super beautiful, but it is just another clue that, beneath Adora's  wealth and beauty, she *is poisonous*. \n\nOn top of this, wallpaper, in American gothic literature, has its own symbolism, best portrayed in *The Yellow Wallpaper* by  Charlotte Perkins Gilman. If you haven't read it (it's a short story, you should), The Yellow Wallpaper is essentially an early feminist story, wherein a woman is trapped in her home by her husband, left to go completely insane and start to believe that there are women trapped in her wallpaper. At the end of the story, she not only (likely) murders her husband, but furiously peels the wallpaper off of the walls in order to free the women she sees trapped in it. From this, the wallpaper in that story can be read as symbolizing how women are dehumanized and used as decorations within a household, or how striving to be the \"perfect\" wife/woman is a violent/abusive process. \n\nTaken together, then, Adora's green wallpaper not only speaks to her surface level obsession with beauty and wealth, but also speaks to her desire to create, through abuse, the perfect daughter, as well as how Amma's ultimate brutal murders are reflective of her reaction to that deeply oppressive lifestyle. \n\nSo long story short, the focus on the wallpaper in Sharp Objects is such a perfect example of symbolism in popular media. I literally can't stop thinking about it- it's so good.",

    "body": "This sub needs another White's initial impressions post like another hole in the head, but I enjoy reading these things, and I'm really happy with how these turned out, so I figured why not share.\n\n[Lesser boots could grovel under that arch.](https://preview.redd.it/oprhf3wgpix61.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30d331f570121ef989747c6daa4e4562ad3a10b2)\n\n[Album First](https://imgur.com/a/Lh4ZONl)\n\n**Background**\n\nThis is my fourth pair of White's. My first decent welted shoes were also a pair of Bounty Hunters, about three years ago, and they've not only held up extremely well, but have remained my favorite shoes and are still such a pleasure to strap on and get a lot of wear. I have a pair of MPs and some Cykel engineer boots. I've had this make-up in my mind for a couple of years now, so treated myself to my fourth pair this past Black Friday as I was going for a fair few bells and whistles (plus international shipping) so wanted to take advantage of the discount.\n\n**Specs:**\n\nLast: Semi-dress 55 last  \nCounter, Upper, and Vamp: Olive Waxed Flesh  \nLining Leather - No Thanks  \nLace Design: Lace to Toe  \nPull Loops: No Thanks  \nCelastic Toe Box: Single Celastic  \nHardware: Brass Eyes and Hooks (Top Garment = Eye)  \nCut Top  \nMidsole - Double (if possible)\\*  \nEdge: Natural  \nHeel Base: Standard (curved/logger)  \nHeel Lifts: Standard  \nSole: Dr. Sole red/brown half sole\\*  \nSole Trim - Standard Double Row  \n7\" Height  \nLength - 11  \nWidth - E  \nVintage White's Logo  \nKhaki Upper Stitching  \nAdded Lineman Patches, because why not\n\nI got the Black Friday discount on the base boot, but did get hit with upcharges for the double midsole, celastic toe, Dr. Sole half soles, and the lineman patches. Apparently the request of a thread color change for the uppers wasn't any additional upcharge. I originally ordered these on November 24th, with at the time I believe an 8-12 week expected turnaround.\n\nWell, a few things happened. First, sometime in January I believe, I was contacted by Baker's, who informed me that the Dr. Sole soles I ordered were out of stock, and asked how we should proceed. I was really lusting after those red/brown half soles as I thought they'd be the perfect complement to the olive waxed flesh and brass hardware. I contacted Dr. Sole myself and got confirmation that they'd be restocked soon, so I told Baker's to tell White's just to wait until they had them. A while later (as we all know even simple shipping of something like that takes ages in the time of Covid), I was greeted with yet more bad news: the largest half soles Dr. Sole makes were still too narrow for these chunky bois. I thought about going with a Dr. Sole full sole option as they're about a centimeter wider than the half soles for some reason so might've worked, but frankly I was getting impatient and had heard that their full soles were both heavy and stiff as hell. Plus, the Baker's email seemed like they didn't want to take any more gambles either, and were definitely hinting that I should just call it a minor loss and go with a stock sole option.\n\nNormally, the Vibram 705 half sole is not an option with a double midsole. Like White's commando soles, it normally comes sort of pre-attached to a somewhat thinner bit of leather midsole that is then attached to the actual midsole. Knowing this, I told them to go with the Vibram half sole if possible, or if not, then to just put a Vibram 269 on it. I'd be happy with either compromise. To my delight, these showed up with the Vibram 705 attached directly to the bottom of two very thick leather midsoles, which results in a  **t h i c c**  and chunky look that I absolutely adore. These arrived today, May 6th, so about 23 weeks altogether.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Sizing & Fit**\n\nFor my first Bounty Hunters, Kyle sized me at an 11E left foot, 10.5EE right foot. I got this same split sizing in my MPs later, and as close to that as I could manage in the Cykels, which came in slightly fewer options. While those 55-last Bounty Hunters were and are a great fit, there's just ever so slight movement around the ball and slight rubbing of the pinky toe in the right boot. The way my toes splay is asymmetrical, and the measurements show that there are differences in the sizes between my feet, but the 1/8\" narrower 11E (vs. 10.5EE) with slightly more length seemed like just what I'd need to get my right foot feeling perfect, so I went with straight up 11E in both boots on this pair and I'm very glad I did. As you can see from the on-foot pictures, I have quite the fat midfoot/instep area, but I like to have my heel locked in nice and snug with plenty of wiggle room at the toe, and this sizing in this last feels like it was designed exactly to fit my foot. As the leather stretches, the lacing gap in the facings will close up to just where I want it to be, I think.\n\nAlmost forgot to mention: yeah, these things need breaking in. The thick waxed flesh is interesting in that it's clearly pretty soft and pliable, excepting the thick layer of hard wax on the outside. Once that softens up, the uppers should be quite silky. The arch support courtesy of the Arch-Ease system is, of course, a bear to break in, and there is that expected \"standing on a roll of quarters\" feeling under your arch until it really starts to take the shape of your foot.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Construction, Finishing & Leather**\n\nI really love the dark brown waxed flesh in my MPs, but ever since seeing patina pictures of those Wesco Knuckle Draggers in olive waxed flesh from Standard & Strange, I knew I had to get a pair of boots in that leather. Over time the build specs came together in my mind, especially after seeing some other boots in this leather with brass hardware and the khaki upper stitching. The leather smells intoxicating, with almost a liqueur-like aroma on top of the expected leather scent. For the unfamiliar, waxed flesh is basically the same as Horween CXL, except finished on the rough-out side of the leather. It's a really thick 7 or so ounces. Quite shiny and smooth on the outside until some of the wax starts to wear away and the nap comes up, showing a lighter color underneath. This is definitely green, though with a lot of brown in it that will help keep them a little more grounded and less \"your shoes look like you tried to zest an avocado.\" There's some of the extreme pull-up noticeable through all the wax, and where the leather was pulled tight from lasting, there are some cracks in the outer wax.\n\nThe upper stitching on these all looks pretty solid, not perfect but still nice, with a few thread ends here and there that needed a lighter taken to them. The stitching around the welt area is often a point of shaky QC from White's. On this pair it's not perfect, but definitely cleaner than on my MPs, which is a relief.\n\nThe gripes:\n\n1. The second row of stitching around the welt is sort of...hmm. On my older Bounty Hunters, this second row extends all the way back to the end of the flared-out upper along the inside edge of the boot, but on these the stitching stops a fair bit before that. Maybe the lineman patches had something to do with that, but hopefully it's not an issue.\n2. The dreaded, notorious toe-ridge. Over at Styleforum a worrying trend has popped up since right around the time I placed this order: people getting lace-to-toe boots from White's, particularly in this last or the 4811 Smokejumper last, with a prominent ridge running right down the middle of the toe box from just in front of the laces to the toe. Some people seem to have avoided this altogether while in others it's super noticeable and really unsightly. I was getting some buyer's remorse shortly after ordering, yet was pleasantly surprised that the ridges in my pair are not super noticeable. I don't think anyone has really pinpointed the cause, but it must be some relic of how the lace-to-toe boots are either lasted or removed from the last.It honestly seems very hard to avoid, so is more of a \"you will have this happen to you\" thing than a lottery like, say, the CXL lottery. I don't think it will be very noticeable in my pair, because since the olive waxed flesh scuffs to a lighter color, the scuffs will appear around the edges of the toes of my boots rather than across the top, so any imperfections in the leather across the top of the toe will disappear in to the \"noise\" of the scuffing around the edges. I hope. I think leathers that scuff to light, or darker and less shiny leathers or roughouts, will definitely hide this ridge quite well, while lighter leathers that darken with age honestly look horrible with this toe ridge. If you go lace-to-toe, I'd keep this in mind. Also for some reason it seems like the 38 swing last in lace-to-toe configuration is somehow immune from this affliction.\n3. There's a scratch or gouge in the lineman patch of the left boot, just above the welt. It's impossible to tell how deep this scratch or cut is without picking at it and potentially making it worse, but it doesn't go through the boot and might not even go all the way through even that outer layer of leather in the lineman patch, so I'm not really too worried about it. They clearly tried to cover it up with some sort of green dye that got on the welt stitching a little and wasn't a great match anyway, but I guess it's really hard to hide scuffs and cuts with a leather like this. Not great, but not a dealbreaker as it's not structural and is pretty well hidden being where it is.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nWhile I'm still slightly bummed about the Dr. Sole thing, there was really nothing that could've been done, and I think otherwise this make-up is everything I hoped it would be. There are some QC issues that I wish weren't there, especially given how long I had to wait for these, but I think it's just part and parcel of the White's experience that anyone thinking of getting some should just be aware of, going in. They're, as you would expect, absolute brick shithouses that I'm very happy to finally have my hands on, and I can't wait for these to get super comfy. I plan on trying out the kilties as well once the uppers and laces have broken in. Love the thickness and curve of the midsoles, love the tall heel stack and prominent shelf at the back, love the hardware and totally unnecessary lineman patches. A+ boots.",

Truly crazy, innit?\n\nIn this post are showcased all the suggestions that have achieved beyond 200 upvotes, as well as the 10 closest stragglers that were just shy of making the mark.\n\n---\n\nHello and welcome to this month's TMS!\n\nBefore we start, we're changing some of the formatting to something new from this month - for the post flair counts and the upvote counts, instead of presenting the data with the usual text, we're going to be using images of graphs! This will:\n1. Reduce the amount of characters, making it less likely to reach the character limit\n2. Make the TMS look more pretty and easier to read :D\n\nLet us know if you like the new changes!\n\n***edit:** I was going to include the images as embeds, but it turns out when making posts in the Markdown Editor, image embeds are impossible, so you have to use the Fancy Pants Editor, but if you use the Fancy Pants editor, you can't do complex formatting (such as different sized headings), which is a bit of a problem. Nonetheless the image link can still be included - it just means you might need to click on it to see it.*\n\nAlso, I can't take full credit for this month's TMS: u/TitaniumBrain *massively* helped on a lot of the work, such as counting up all the points from the monthly challenges and checking the wiki changes, and this month's theme and challenges were brought to you by u/Planemaster3000! Thanks to you both! :PufferThumbsUp:\n\n---\n\n**So, let's see how the new upvote and flair data looks:**\n\n### [Upvote Bands of Posts with 200+ Upvotes](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/741618183827619850/849549443774414848/unknown.png?width=868&height=612)\n\n### [Post Flair Data of Posts with 200+ Upvotes](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/689715753783394364/849208305671077958/unknown.png?width=910&height=567)\n\nThere were a total number of 92 posts which passed the 200 upvote mark, which is less than usual, but once 1.17's released in a week's time, maybe the ideas will start cooking back up again for the rest of Caves and Cliffs! And interestingly this month, the top two most popular flairs: **Blocks & Items** and **Mobs** have tied.\n\nAnd for those of you who prefer to sort via flair rather than upvotes, or maybe prefer the old lists rather than bar charts, we've got that covered too by the bot: **[here it is!](https://www.reddit.com/user/TitaniumBots/comments/npgy9o/top_monthly_suggestions_of_may_sorted_by_flair/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=minecraftsuggestions&utm_content=t1_h0pbpjj)**\n\n---\n\n#THEME: \"Structures New & Old\"\n\n> Many of Minecraft structures are amazing, and it's always exciting when you encounter one, but sometimes, they can be a bit underwhelming and disappointing. How can existing structures be improved to be more interesting and exciting? Could there be some small tweaks, or a massive overhaul? Alternatively, should the current structures be kept as is and make way for some new and more interesting structures? Get ready to structure your ideas!\n\n> **Monthly Challenges June 2021** (this month, there's four!)\n> \n> 1. Earn the high quality flair on a post (+50 points [limit of 1 post])\n> 2. Include sketches, in game build screenshots, or other art to represent your themed suggestion (+15 points [limit of 3 unique posts])\n> 3. Gain 100 upvotes on one post, best post of the month only counted (+5 points [max 20x])\n> 4. Make a post based on a [discord](https://discord.gg/R37Br7U) prompt (+10 points [Limit of once per prompt])\n\n\n> **Steps to participate:**\n\n> * Your post must be in r/minecraftsuggestions. Your post will also automatically appear in the “monthly-workshop” channel of the [MCS Discord](https://discord.gg/R37Br7U) - we recommend that you join.\n> * Be sure to check the rules before you post\n> * Make sure your post has the [Monthly Theme] flair\n> * Must be posted within the correct month\n\n- - - \n\n#Special Mentions\n\nCongrats to **u/VG_Chat** for being **MVP for the month** thanks to their [2500+ post](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/n9h67d/the_ender_chests_opposite_the_nether_chest/)!\n\nAnd we also have the winner of **last month's Monthly Challenges** (Theme: Arthropods). *Last month's* challenges were:\n\n 1. Get more than 200 upvotes on a monthly theme post (+20 points once, +5 for 50 more upvotes)\n\n 2. Include a concept art, models, or textures of your mob idea in your post (+30 points once) \n\n 3. Come up with a unique idea involving revamping existing mobs or adding a new and challenging one based on the theme of this month (+20 points once) \n\n\nThere are two winners for this month, who are tied with **50 points** - \nthey are u/Chris_The_Alligator (for their [Skullcrab suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/njckxf/skullcrabs_a_new_nether_mob_for_soul_sand_valleys/)) and u/TheTaciturnRogue (for their [Whip Scorpion suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/njxyia/the_whip_scorpion_plus_a_new_block_and_changes_to/)) , from [this post about insect sounds in lush caves](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/nd1efb/insect_sounds_in_lush_caves_such_as_cicadas_and/), placing them pretty high up in the [Top Monthly Challengers leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/wiki/topmonthlychallengers)! \n\n**Great job, suggestors!**\n\n---\n\n#IN OTHER NEWS:\n\n### Moderators\n\nThe mod applications have made a return! If you're interested, check out this post for details: [[LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/nj4yz3/mcs_mod_applications_are_open/)]\n\nAnd talking of moderators, we have one new full moderator (subreddit + discord mod) and one new discord moderator: u/ThatOneKirbyMain2568 (A.K.A. ~~cherry man~~ Microsoft_PowerPoint on the discord), and u/TheDragonWarrior2284 (A.K.A. The Dragon Warrior on the discord)! The former is a subreddit and discord moderator, and the latter is a discord moderator exclusively. They have been trial moderators for the past month and now they have been promoted to the official status of moderator. Feel free to say hi to them if you wish!\n\nAt the same time, we unfortunately saw u/MrOzone2020 step down from moderator for personal reasons this month. But do not fear: he's still very much active on the discord, so he's still available to talk to.\n\n### Custom Awards\n\nYep, we've finally added some custom awards that you can give out to your favourite suggestions! (though unfortunately only if you have enough coins - they cost the minimum possible amount of 500 coins). If you're on the discord, you might recognise some of these fishy friends...\n\nThe custom awards we've decided on are as follows:\n\n- Poggerfish\n- PufferSax (puffer holding saxophone)\n- Well Crafted Idea (a crafting table)\n- Emerald\n- Nether Star\n\nTo hand these out, click on the \"Give Award\" button under the post, go to the \"Community\" tab and choose an award.\n\nWe'd also like to hear your feedback on these. What are your thoughts on these awards? Do you think there could be more awards? Should we set up a moderator-only award to give for the best posts? Let us know in the comments below!\n\n\n### This month's wiki changes:\n\nQuite a big chunk of FPS changes this month:\n\n**[FPS](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/wiki/fps):**\n\n* Adjustable light blocks and/or invisible light source block (partially implemented in Bedrock Edition as light blocks obtained using /give) [implemented, so removed]\n\n* Some way to transfer enchantments, **or choose specific enchantments** (e.g.: a grindstone or new block that takes enchantments from armor/weapons/tools and puts them onto books).\n\n* **Chocolate** or chocolate milk/cake (cocoa beans + milk/cake)\n\n* Shooting stars\n\nAs well as that, there's also a new **Hot Topics** section for ideas that are frequent due to recent snapshots/news, but may or may not stay on the list depending on whether it dies down. The following points were moved to this category:\n\n * Smelting raw ore blocks\n\n * Scoped bows/crossbows\n\n * Torch arrows, or making spectral arrows emit light\n \n * Glowing ink/dye used to craft glow stick/coloured lamps etc.\n\n * “Stealth” enchantment/potion or feather falling/slow falling reduces/cancels player noise, making it harder to be noticed by the Warden\n\n * Wardens get stunned by any source of sound, such as jukeboxes, TNT, fireworks, bats, etc.\n\nAnd now for another reminder for everyone, [please read the FPS List before making any suggestions just to be sure that your idea hasn't already been covered or posted frequently in the past.](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/wiki/fps) \n**Also, if you have a Discord account, we'd also like to invite you over to our [official MCS Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/R37Br7U) if you ever feel like doing some real-time brainstorming.** Or, you know, just put up some memes, we have those too (just keep them SFW and in the proper channels. ;)\n\n\n####***[KEEP IT UP, FELLOW SUGGESTORS!](https://media2.giphy.com/media/GCvktC0KFy9l6/giphy.gif?cid=790b76115d084e896473347132b2c06e&rid=giphy.gif)***\n\n---\n\n#♦️ Beautiful Suggestions 200 and Beyond ♦️\n\nIf there was a suggestion that was missed, please let us know below. Despite our best efforts, we haven't yet reached infallible perfection (we're still trying, impossible as it might be), so some mistakes are still within the realm of possibility.\n\n* [**2500✨** The Ender Chest's Opposite: The Nether Chest](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/n9h67d/the_ender_chests_opposite_the_nether_chest/)\n* [**2500✨** If you buy a wandering trader's whole stock, he moves in and becomes a villager.](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/nf8edj/if_you_buy_a_wandering_traders_whole_stock_he/)\n* [**2400✨** Candles could be used as an alternative recipe for lanterns](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/n3s1ft/candles_could_be_used_as_an_alternative_recipe/)\n* [**2300✨** Beacon Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/n6t91f/beacon_update/)\n* [**2300✨** When you die in nether over a netherrack block this block should be replaced for a soul sand block](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/n39ar5/when_you_die_in_nether_over_a_netherrack_block/)\n* [**2300✨** Arrows shot by bows with the Flame enchantment should activate Nether portals](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/nj73jk/arrows_shot_by_bows_with_the_flame_enchantment/)\n* [**2200✨** make slimes dyeable like sheeps.](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/ndm0a2/make_slimes_dyeable_like_sheeps/)\n* [**2200✨** If a crop is fully grown, passive mobs will eat its top layer, if the crop's type is their breeding food](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/n4pizl/if_a_crop_is_fully_grown_passive_mobs_will_eat/)\n* [**2100✨** Axolotls should NOT attack glow squids](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/nbiabh/axolotls_should_not_attack_glow_squids/)\n* [**2100✨** Villager kids should play in the snow](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/nct3yu/villager_kids_should_play_in_the_snow/)\n* [**2000✨** /enchant should let you apply normally incompatible enchantments.](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/nbxui9/enchant_should_let_you_apply_normally/)\n* [**1900✨** Hydrothermal Vents](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/n771ev/hydrothermal_vents/)\n* [**1900✨** Shooting stars at night.](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/nlcq74/shooting_stars_at_night/)\n* [**1900✨** You should be able to bucket baby striders, but using a lava bucket instead of a water bucket](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/njvx7w/you_should_be_able_to_bucket_baby_striders_but/)\n* [**1800✨** A way to write item lore without commands](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/nani47/a_way_to_write_item_lore_without_commands/)\n* [**1800✨** Player need eat cake to complete “A Balanced Diet”](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/ng1ae2/player_need_eat_cake_to_complete_a_balanced_diet/)\n* [**1700✨** Worn out Roads Seemingly Leading Nowhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/nafek1/worn_out_roads_seemingly_leading_nowhere/)\n* [**1700✨** standard galactic alphabet should be a language option](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/nkfjm9/standard_galactic_alphabet_should_be_a_language/)\n* [**1600✨** Petition to make off-hand slot line up with the inventory slots](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/nh63f7/petition_to_make_offhand_slot_line_up_with_the/)\n* [**1600✨** The Atlas -

Per my understanding, over-the-counter zelyonka is just the brilliant green dye crystals dissolved into diluted alcohol, so... Is it only antiseptic because of the alcohol? Or does the brilliant green actually have antiseptic properties on its own?",

When you just tried to find that **ONE** specific shade of green?\n\nWell, you have to not worry anymore, because I present you the idea and concept of this new green dye called ~~Noxxi~~ Green Rose Dye! *....well, if we have a Blue Rose Dye already, then why not.*\n\nYou can forget all the tries where your green dye was a shade darker or lighter or just looked too pallid. \n\nYou can see, that [this is a unique green to the current ones](http://i.imgur.com/8C4ZS4S.png).\n\nHere you can see, that some colors could be close to this one, but somehow they are **JUST** not right! Except if you are colorblind, then most of them are the same.\n\nThis specific green was found for its purpose by the most green enthusiastic people and most green color professionals!\n\nSo why am I asking for such a dye to be in the game? Well, because...\n\n- you will never have the wrong shade of green anymore.\n\n- you can use this beautiful green above all the other green.\n\n- this green helps healing your crippling depression.\n\n- it has nothing to do with my name.\n\n- it's green and beautiful.\n\n- a Green Rose is just as non-existential as a Blue Rose.\n\n- this specific green isn't an existing and usable color/dye yet.\n\n- I know you all want it.\n\n- this green is more nature-like and calms you by looking at it.\n\n- there are other \"rose\" dyes, but no green one.\n\n- you can show-off this color any time on your armor and prove how beautiful you are.\n\n- I love green, but I love this certain green the most.\n\n- I swear it's not because of my name.\n\n- it's a kind of unique green that isn't in-game yet.\n\n- it matches well with your #ShadowAbyssOnly Dye.\n\n- I know Anet loves green as much as I do ~~or I hope so~~.\n\n- I know you are *dying* to get this color.\n\nSo there you have all my strong points, that you totally can't argue with, as of why I ask for such dye.\n\nSay goodbye to all the...\n\n*\"I can't get the right shade of green dye on my armor!\"* and *\"I'm just unable to get that green on my armor somehow! Bah!\"*\n\nand say hello to the...\n\n*\"Oh my, this is the EXACT green dye I wanted in this game since release!\"* and *\"Look at me, I'm so green and beautiful!\"*\n\nThank you very much for listening, and keep on being green~!\n\n -Noxxi Greenrose, the concept maker of Green Rose Dye\n\n*ps.: I swear it has nothing to do with my name.*",

    "body": "Ill start with how i dont feel any balance betweent the outfits colours and that there are serious lacks or problems behind locking certain colours behind a paywall CONSTANTLY (ekhem, ekhem. pink, im looking at you)\n\nfirst of all: **Yes**, i know the game is only 6 months old. Doesnt justify THIS gap in colours, especially when we count in both 4 stars and 5 stars.\n\n**Yes,** i know they said this region is blue based (? unless it was false) but oh my lord, if theres gonna be theme for a region then why are some outfits totally different? why are 4 stars outfits that have nothing to do with this region still fall to the same scheme? And i think that its a bit too extreme to just pump blue outfits for several months bc were in some region... Like obviously not everyone is gonna be satisfied with this (although congrats to blue girlies cuz yall won as hell) I didnt even count 3 star outfits, but i hope yall get my point and maybe feel the same.\n\n\n\nAlthough there is an obvious gap in certain colours, id like to specifically talk about pink/purple being locked behind a paywall nearly all the time. Whether its evolution or just unlocking dyes.\n\nIm a pink lover, pastel colours lover and i guess i fall into the basic girl stereotype visually. I dont want to push narrative, that we pink girlies dont get anything (Because theres a lot more certain colours lovers that arent satisfied (goth girlies im looking at you...), but theres clearly a visible pattern, because nearly everytime i saw a new 5 star coming the last evolution was the most to my liking colour wise. OFC i know, they have to make money somehow. Is it still bothering me? Absolutely.\n\nI just believe that they should give us some more variety. No infold, world will not crush if u make a pink or black or even yellow outfit base outfit and make stunning 4th evolution with some turquise or gold, silver, ultramarine, etc.\n\nI do feel like they did redeem themselves a bit when providing the glow up recolours by both making glowing up actually worth it and giving us more colours to work on.\n\n\n\nBut then.... \\*deep breath\\* **dyeing system.**\n\n\n\nWhy am i beeing punished by infold for spending my diamonds to basically not be able to dye the items? And i dont mean giving us shitty colours cuz yes, i can live with that i guess. But for example my Timeless melody doesnt have any evolution and **6 OUT OF9 PALLETES TO DYE ARE BASIC/GLOW UP COLOURS** \\- BLUE AND GREEN. This shouldnt have a place, cuz im basically unable to dye it in any way... And yes its nice to work with the shades of blue and green i guess but it costs so much to unlock a pallete anyway, without evolutions. And from what im hearing its gonna be hard to get the Radiant prism unless Infold blesses us with some through event... **Cuz why is GREEN PALETTE on GREEN OUTFIT costing 24 RADIANT PRISM. Just adjust the palletes to the outfits maybe? Like dont give me basic colours basically the same as the glowed up or basic version?**\n\n\n\nOn the third picture im showing literal green dye on the dress and then basic green dress. THERES NO DIFFERENCE.\n\nTHE PALETTE COSTS 24 PRISM.\n\nAnother mention: Why is white and black locked behind evolutions too? NOT TO MENTION, often last evolution?\n\nOften the white isnt even white or there isnt even a black dye, just grey?",

Without the glow ups, we would barely have anything pink as a base dress compared to all the blues, not the mention most of the glow ups are green and brown too. \n\nIn the dye system the pinks are usually locked behind 2nd and 3rd evo too.\n\nI dare you to count all the dresses individually then say Infold likes blue the same way they like pink.

        "body": ">Often the white isnt even white or there isnt even a black dye, just grey?\n\nWhites not being actually white is an issue that basically all 3D games where you can recolor things seem to share, there is more of a technical limitation in that whatever they did for its original look just sucks at getting bright enough with an overlay to actually be white enough. (I don't think this applies to black though, I can usually make things pitch black down to hiding most details of the object as a result in other games.)\n\nI don't think it's fair to talk about the blue and green colors being pointless dye options, seeing as they are relevant on anything that isn't already blue or green. Something that is stupid however is how everything has the same palettes and the same palette *order* down to the locks, some of them should have been shuffled around per object to make the dye options they have actually relevant to the object in question, or in recognition of how some color changes are more valuable on some piece than others. Like I can spam the violet-red first two colors on like freaking anything because those are free on everything you can dye which is either a massive boon for some items or not particularly relevant for others, like you're having with your frustrations here.",
