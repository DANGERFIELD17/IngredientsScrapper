    "body": "If you’re like a lot of people, you might’ve seen those Chinese noodle pullers and thought to yourself, “that seems cool. I kind of want to learn how to do that”. Then you go online, give it a quick google, and’re greeted an absolutely bewildering mix of discussion on the topic: everything from people that say it’s impossible to makes outside of China, to people playing around with adding nutritional yeast or L-cysteine to mix, to Buzzfeed videos claiming an easy foolproof version.\n\nSo with this post, I want to (1) try clear the air a bit, and clarify what a hand-pulled noodle actually is (2) teach you three different ‘hand-pulled noodles’, for three different skill levels and (3) teach a couple ways to actually enjoy them. It’s… a lot of ground to cover. This is a novella of a post, I know – I’ve actually had to put parts of it in the comments below because I hit reddit’s character limit (40k for a post, who knew?). Save it for later if you’re not in the reading mood. But I hope by the end of it all, you’ll understand – or at least appreciate - Chinese hand pulled noodles a little better.\n\n###What is a hand-pulled noodle?\n\nSo one of the things that makes it awkward to give a ‘recipe’ for hand-pulled noodles is that hand-pulled noodles aren’t really a ‘dish’ per se. They’re a technique. And to make things even more complicated, that English translation of ‘hand pulled’ really refers to **two separate techniques**: *Lamian* and *Chenmian*. \n\nThis distinction’s important. It’s why /u/oliverbabish tried and failed mightily at hand pulled noodles, while Inga Lam over at Buzzfeed seem to make them without a hitch – because Babish was trying to make Lamian (infamously difficult) and Lam was making Chenmian (common enough in home kitchens in China). Some other similarities/differences:\n\nLamian (拉面) | Chenmian (抻面)\n:--|:--|\nMade in restaurants | Made at restaurants or at home\nOften learned by going to special schools or apprenticing | Easy to pick up \nAlkaline Noodles | Non-alkaline Noodles\nRequires a finely milled flour (more on that later) | A finely milled flour is nice, but AP Flour can also be used\nRequires a special type of alkaline called penghui (more on that later) | All you need is flour, water, and salt\nRequires many fancy movements to get it to a pullable consistency, as alkaline stiffens dough | Only needs a long rest (three hours or more) to get to a pullable consistency\nOriginates from the Northwest, Lanzhou specifically, popularized throughout China by the noodle shops that bear its name | Can be found all across north China and even out into other spots in Central Asia\nDelicious | Delicious\n\nNow, both Lamian and Chenmian can come in different shapes. Likely the most classic version of both would be those spaghetti-looking sort, the kind that you’d probably immediately recognize as ‘noodles’. In this shape, Lamian is still called… Lamian. Easy enough. But perhaps confusingly, Chenmian in this shape can also be called Latiaozi (or, in some parts of the country, also Lamian… ugh).\n\nBut besides that, another common shape is wide-and-flat. If following the Lamian method, those flat sort are generally called *kuanmian* (宽面, literally ‘wide noodles’); if following the Chenmian method, they’re called… Biang Biang noodles.\n\nNow, we’ve already covered Biang Biang noodles, but I’ll include them too because they make a *great* introductory pulled noodle. So the way I’ll organize this post is by going over:\n\n1. *Biang Biang Noodles*. Wide-and-flat Chenmian that make for a great ‘my first pulled noodle’.\n\n2. *Chenmian, a.k.a. Latiaozi*. Spaghetti-like Chenmian that’re slightly more involved than Biang Biang (they’re at slightly more risk to break, and are a touch tougher to get thin).\n\n3. *Lamian.* Spaghetti-like alkaline noodles that are… a beast. The mount Everest of Chinese cooking. \n\nBefore we jump in with though, a quick word on flour.\n\n###What flour to use for pulled noodles?\n\nWhenever we do any sort of dough related thing, we end up getting a lot of questions on the subject of “Chinese flour”. Is it bleached? Is it lower gluten? Etc. There seems to be this nagging misperception out there that flour here is somehow materially different than flour in the West.\n\nIn truth, there’s nothing overly different about Western flour and Chinese flour. That’s not to say that everything’s 100% the same – it’s just that that there’s an equally large difference between, say, King Arthur and Gold Metal as there is among those and Chinese brands.\n\nAs always, there’s a few different variables that’re important when picking out flour:\n\n1. *Gluten/Protein content.* For this, we want a high gluten flour. Gives the noodle more bite. For Lamian you want a flour that’s more than 12% protein. For Chenmian, anything over 10% protein should work ok.\n\n2. *Age.* Flour changes as it ages. Fresher flour is stretchier than older flour. In an ideal world, your flour would be less than 6 months old. Matters much more for Lamian than Chenmian (notice a trend?)\n\n3. *Fineness.* The best flour for noodles and dumplings is quite finely milled, akin to an Italian 00 flour. Nice to have for Chenmian, but critical for Lamian.\n\nFor making Lamian, there’s actually a certain brand of flour most of the noodle shops tend to reach for called ‘塞北雪’ – [this is what it looks like, if you’re curious](https://imgur.com/TpccLTw). It’s 12.2% protein, usually used within a couple months of milling, and is extremely finely milled. But while that brand of flour is certainly a beaut to pull noodles with, extremely similar flours *do* exist in the West… in the form of Italian 00 flours.\n\nSo the TL;DR on flour is:\n\n* For Lamian, use an Italian 00 Pizza Flour. In the videos we used Caputo’s Chef Pizza Flour, which’s available online and popular among home pizza makers. It’s finely milled, pretty fresh, and is 13% protein. Works like a charm.\n\n* For Chenmian, 00 Pizza Flour is preferable but not required. All purpose flour is ok, just make sure that it’s not *too* low in protein. Our AP we usually use is 10.8% protein. \n\n**Wait, so for Biang Biang/Chenmian I can use AP Flour?**\n\nYes, that’s right. But you’ll make your life much easier if you do an autolyse first. In both bread and noodle making, this will develop gluten and make for a stretchier end result (hey, just what we want in a pulled noodle!)\n\n* Dissolve your salt with your water, then combine the water with the flour bit by bit\n\n* Knead for ~1 minute until everything comes together\n\n* Cover with a plate, rest for 30 minutes\n\n(note: in Western baking a ‘true’ autolyse is sans salt)\n\n---\n\n###Biang Biang Noodles\n\nSo ‘Biang Biang noodles’ ring a bell, it’s for good reason. Ever hear of the restaurant Xi’an Famous Foods? Began in the basement of a Flushing mall… adored by pretty much everyone including the late Anthony Bourdain… blew up with 15 locations throughout New York… spawned countless copycats throughout the Anglophone world? Biang Biang is the main offering on their menu. It’s a noodle that’s… easy to love. \n\nNow, [that recipe we shared previously?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/axyghr/recipe_biang_biang_noodles_with_chili_oil_topping/). It’s a good recipe. A lot of people’ve enjoyed it. Feel free to continue using that one if you’re already used to it. But by learning a couple basic hand pulled noodle techniques, the process can become even easier, I feel. \n\n**Ingredients, Biang Biang Noodles:**\n\n1.  *00 Pizza Flour, preferably, -or- AP Flour (中筋面粉), 200g.* If you do not use the 00 flour, do that autolyse beforehand.\n\n2. *Salt, ½ tsp.* \n\n3. *Water, 100g.* This dough is 50% hydration. Most pulled noodle doughs will be around that level.\n\n4. *Oil, 3 tbsp.* For coating the dough during resting. \n\n**Techniques, Biang Biang noodles:**\n\nAs befitting something with a grand total of four ingredients and made solely with your hands… pulled noodles are all about technique. Following a recipe for something like pulled noodles would be a little like reading a walkthrough for a game like DOTA 2. A great starting point no doubt, but somewhere along the way the onus falls on you to actually, like… get good.\n\nFor both this one and the following though, luckily that’s not going to be all that difficult. There’s just three techniques that you’ll need to know: hydrating, kneading, and pulling. \n\n**Technique #1: Cat Claw (猫抓手): A way to evenly hydrate your flour.**\n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/kc56k8).\n\nWhat you’re doing is adding water to flour bit by bit, then rubbing the flour between your thumb and the back of your fingers. What you’re looking for is a final result called ‘suizi’ (i.e. ‘wheat grains’), which looks something [like this](https://imgur.com/LM98kpj). \n\nThe reason evenly hydrating the flour is so important is because we don’t want to add too much water to the dough. This is also one of the reasons why finely 00 milled flour can be so helpful – simply by how well the stuff hydrates.\n\nLike, add 50 grams of water to 100 grams of AP Flour. Do a rough mix with a chopstick, and you’ll get something [like this](https://imgur.com/JLDyxhX). Compare that against those ‘suizi’ from above, which was made with some finely milled 00 with the *same amount of water*. If you’re anything like me, you might look at the first picture and think to yourself, ‘damn, needs more water!’ But it doesn’t need more water – it just needs to be hydrated better.\n\nCat claw + autolyse is a powerful way to make even the most ‘meh’ of AP flours the hydrate like they should.\n\n**Technique #2: Making the Abacus String (算盘子): Kneading and aligning the gluten into one long rope.**\n\n[Here’s](https://imgur.com/a/ajYMI2a) an imgur album detailing the process step-by-step. I know it looks like a lot – it’s not that bad, I promise.\n\nBasically, you’re just kneading this stuff by repeatedly curling the dough into itself until you get one long log. Then you fold it in half, punch it down, and start curling again. It’s not necessarily any harder that the standard kneading motion for bread, just different.\n\nWe’re doing this because we not only want to develop the gluten network in the dough, but also *align* the gluten strands. The idea’s somewhat similar to the slap-and-fold technique in Western bread-making, albeit with a different goal in mind. The slap-and-fold gets the gluten into a sort of criss-cross pattern, while here we’re aiming for one long rope.\n\nWhen we go over Lamian below, this process becomes both insanely important and incredibly tedious. Luckily, for both Biang Biang and Chenmian, you just need to do this for ~8 minutes or until the dough gets smooth.\n\n**Technique #3: Biang-ing and Ripping the Noodle:**\n\nThis noodle gets its name from the characteristic sound it makes as it smacks the table. Far too few food names are onomatopoeias.\n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/94ad9z).\n\nBasically, what you’re going to be doing when pulling is first rolling it out into a ~10 inch to ~2.5 inch sheet. Then, you’ll make a small indentation in the noodle with a chopstick – this will be your ‘ripping point’. Next you grab the noodle, smack it ~10 or so times against the table while pulling gently to lengthen it out.\n\nThe way you hold the noodle while pulling/smacking is quite important, however. If you pinch the dough at all, it can end up breaking. What you want to do is lay the noodle over your four fingers, and simply using with your thumbs to hold it in place- force shouldn’t really be applied. Here’s a picture of [what your hands should look like](https://imgur.com/EeI3XDK).\n\nOnce the noodles are about arms length, rip it in half at the indentation that you made your chopstick. We usually rip one end like we did in the above video, but you could rip both ends, or you could keep it in one big ‘loop’. Up to you.\n\n**Process, Biang Biang Noodles:**\n\n1. *Mix the salt with the ice water, then add water by ‘cat clawing’ the mixture into the dough. Press and knead for ~1 minute into a rough ball.* Refer to the ‘cat claw’ technique for detailed instructions. Once all the moisture’s absorbed into the dough, knead it real quick (as normal, like you usually would bread and such) to get it into a ball.\n\n2. *If using AP flour instead of 00 flour, cover and let rest for ~30 minutes.* \n\n3. *Move the dough to a work surface, knead using the ‘making the abacus string technique; 8-10 minutes.* Refer to the ‘making the abacus string’ technique for more information. What you’re looking for is the dough to have a smooth surface on both sides [like this](https://imgur.com/u10luQP).\n\n4. *Fold the dough length-wise twice; smack it into a rectangular box, toss in a bowl and rest for ~10 minutes.* From the previous step, you will have one long ‘rope’ of abacus string. Punch it flat. Fold it in half lengthwise twice to shorten it right up. Then smack it into a rectangle – it’s a bit tough to describe, so I’m going to [cheat with a streamable](https://streamable.com/jzv81k).\n\n5. *Roll the dough out into roughly a ~7x4 inch sheet.* No need to obsess over the exact measurements here, but that’s the size that we were working with.\n\n6. *Cut the dough into four long strips.* So each strip would be roughly ~1x7 inches.\n\n7. *Thoroughly oil a plate, toss on the dough strips, then oil them. Cover with plastic wrap in such a way that the plastic wrap is clinging to the strips themselves.* Remember – we usually use a few tablespoons worth of oil here for this step, so don’t be shy there. When you’re covering with plastic wrap, have the wrap cling to the noodles, to minimize air in the plate. That said, don’t go nuts - we’re not vacuum sealing.\n\n8. *Rest the dough strips for at least 3 hours and up to 8 (or overnight if need be).* We find 4 hours to be about ideal for resting. Going up to 8 is fine too – 24 hours is perfectly workable as well, but after that the dough will likely become a bit *too* soft and pull-y.\n\n9. *Remove a strip, patting slightly with a paper towel if overly oily. Roll it out into a ~2.5 to ~10 inch long sheet.* Exact size here’s nothing to obsess over, just what we find ourselves working with.\n\n10. *Biang the Noodle: Press down the middle of the noodle with a chopstick.* Refer to the ‘Biang-ing the Noodle’ technique for more details. The indentation in the noodle should [look something like this](https://i.imgur.com/ZHD06sW.jpg). After we slap the noodle longer, that indentation will be where we tear it open (to get an even longer noodle).\n\n11. *Biang the Noodle: Hold the noodle in your palm, lightly pressing with your thumb. Smack the noodle down against your work surface around ~ten times to lengthen the noodle.* Refer to the ‘Biang-ing the Noodle’ technique above for more details. You’re looking for [something about a meter long, like this](https://i.imgur.com/TVUKw9o.jpg). \n\n12. *Biang the Noodle: In the center of the noodle, push through the groove that you made with the chopstick and pull apart the noodle to get something even… longer. We break one end of it.* Tearing apart will look something [like this](https://i.imgur.com/TVUKw9o.jpg) – again, some people break both ends, and some keep the circular shape. \n\n13. *Boil for ~1 minute until it floats.* Work through your other noodles as each is boiling.\n\n---\n\n###Chenmian\n\nSo Chenmian are also referred to as Latiaozi, and – interestingly – in Xinjiang as ‘Laghman’. They’re basically going to be almost identical to our Biang Biang noodles from above, albeit in that long/round spaghetti-like shape.\n\nSo, this recipe is going to share a *lot* with the previous recipe. So I’m going to cheat and refer to the above recipe a bit. If you’re just perusing this post out of curiosity, the substantive differences are the “technique #3: pulling” and the process starting from step #6.  \n\n**Ingredients, Chenmian:**\n\nSame as the Biang Biang above.\n\n**Technique #1: Cat Claw (猫抓手)**\n\nAgain, [Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/kc56k8). \n\n**Technique #2: Making the Abacus String (算盘子)**\n\n[Here’s](https://imgur.com/a/ajYMI2a) that imgur album detailing the process step-by-step again.\n\nRemember, you’re just kneading this stuff by repeatedly curling the dough into itself until you get one long log. Then you fold it in half, punch it down, and start curling again.\n\n**Technique #3: Pulling the Noodles**\n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/yznx53).\n\nOverall, the pulling technique for this noodle’s pretty self-explanatory. What you’ll do it roll it out a touch by hand (until it’s, say, ~6 inches long), then pull it. Once you can start to feel the resistance in the noodle, stop. Then continue to thin/lengthen the noodle by repeatedly smacking it against the table, ala the Biang Biang noodles.\n\nNote that there *will* be a limit as to how thin you can get the thing. What you’re looking for is something a touch thicker than fresh spaghetti, or about the same thickness as Japanese ramen. If you’re staring at a noodle that’s still a little too thick, you’ve got two options. First, you can fold the noodle in half and continue to smack in against the table. This’ll help things get a bit thinner, but you do have to be careful – it’s very easy for the noodle to break when folded. Second, you’re still working with a stubborn noodle, you can leave it there and let it rest as you work through the remainder – picking up again after five minutes or so, you can generally get it a bit thinner.\n\n**Process, Chenmian:**\n\n[Video of making Chenmian is here if you’d like a visual](https://youtu.be/qzAdiOhaZJs).\n\n1. *Mix the salt with the ice water, then add water by ‘cat clawing’ the mixture into the dough. Press and knead for ~1 minute into a rough ball.* Once all the moisture’s absorbed into the dough, knead it real quick to get it into a craggily ball.\n\n2. *If using AP flour instead of 00 flour, cover and let rest for ~30 minutes.* \n\n3. *Move the dough to a work surface, knead using the ‘making the abacus string technique; 8-10 minutes.* Refer to the ‘making the abacus string’ technique. What you’re looking for is the dough to have a smooth surface on both sides [like this](https://imgur.com/u10luQP).\n\n4. *Fold the dough length-wise twice; smack it into a rectangular ‘box’, toss in a bowl and rest for ~10 minutes.* From the previous step, you will have one long ‘rope’ of abacus string. Punch it flat with your fists. Fold it in half lengthwise twice to shorten it right up. Then sort of smack it into a rectangle – [streamable is here, again](https://streamable.com/jzv81k).\n\n5. *Roll the dough out into roughly a 4x7 inch sheet.* No need to obsess over the exact measurements here.\n\n6. *Cut the sheet in half, but be sure to pay attention to which side the long side was, as that’s the direction that we’ll be cutting.* Cutting this sheet in half is actually optional, but especially if you’re just getting started out I’ll be easier to work with shorter noodles.\n\n7. *Cut into 1cm strips.* Or roughly 12 strips per half-sheet, for 24 noodles total.\n\n8. *Thoroughly oil a plate, toss on the dough strips, then oil them. Cover with plastic wrap in such a way that the plastic wrap is clinging to the strips themselves.* Don’t be shy with the oil. Also,  when you’re covering with plastic wrap, have the wrap cling to the noodles, to minimize air in the plate – something [like this](https://imgur.com/u10luQP) is perfect.\n\n9. *Rest for 3-8 hours, or up to 24.* To relax the gluten. Again, 3 hours is the minimum here, we generally like it at around the 4 hour mark. \n\n10. *Remove a noodle, slightly pat off some oil with a paper towel if needed.* Sometimes it can get a bit too oily to work with.\n\n11. *Pull the noodles.*  Pull the noodle according to technique #3 above – remember not to get too greedy re thinness!\n\n12. *Boil the noodles until a touch past al dente, ~45 seconds, then shock under running water.* \n\n---\n\n###Lamian\n\nAbandon all hope, ye who enters this recipe.\n\nBefore we do anything, let me pass on you the advice one dude at my local Lanzhou Lamian shop gave *me* a number of years back when I was badgering him for tips on Lamian technique: “Give up. Do not try. You’ll never know how to make Lamian.”\n\nAt the time, I took it as a sort of ‘oh you’re just a foreigner, you’ll never understand’ kind of thing (the closest thing a white dude in China can get to a microaggression lol). Now, I understand the wisdom in his words. I wish we’d listened.\n\nThis is by far the hardest recipe we’ve ever done on our channel. It’s so tough that it makes Har Gow look like a relaxed weeknight dish. The only thing I can think of that can even come *close* to it is the proper sourdough-starter smiling Char Siu Bao, and that’s a recipe where commenters reporting failures outnumber commenters reporting successes about 10:1.\n\nSo just… stop. Turn back. It’s not worth it. Scroll right on past this, move on with your life. You’ve got the above recipes for Chenmian, right? Those are fun. You can impress all your friends with those. It’s good enough for most people – an untelling eye probably couldn’t even tell the difference.\n\nMaking Lamian, you **will** fail your first time. And probably your second. And probably many times after that. But if you keep at it… one day, things’ll click for you. And you can be content in the knowledge that you’ll be one bad-ass noodle maker.\n\n**Why is Lamian so hard?**\n\nSo like, Chenmian wasn’t too bad. Pretty much any intermediate home cook can make Biang Biang noodles. And while the thinner spaghetti-like sort might have a couple more moving pieces, in the grand scheme of things they’re not so bad, either.\n\nWhat makes Lamian *so* difficult is the introduction of alkaline.\n\nFor those of you out there that don’t live and breathe the world of Asian noodles, alkaline noodles have this *fabulous* bite to them. In the mainland this texture’s referred to as ‘tanya’ (弹牙), though perhaps you might’ve heard it called by the Taiwan term ‘QQ’. You could think of it sort of like… *al dente*. What makes alkaline noodles so beautiful is that they retain that sort of ‘al dente’ texture, even after being fully cooked. Alkaline is what makes Japanese Ramen, Japanese Ramen; it’s what makes Cantonese Wonton Noodles, Cantonese Wonton Noodles.\n\nAnd in my personal opinion, alkaline ends up being increasingly important as the noodle itself gets thinner. Super thin noodles can easily end up much too soft if you’re not careful – while I don’t think Angel Hair pasta quite deserves its bad reputation, I do believe that it would be a much better product if they added alkaline to the mix.\n\nNow, for most alkaline noodles the process isn’t all that hard. You add a bit of sodium carbonate to the dough (or a solution of sodium carbonate/potassium carbonate called Kan Sui/Jianshui), and continue along your merry way… rolling things out thin and either cutting them with a knife of a pasta maker.\n\nMaking an alkaline noodle that can *pull*? Alkaline stiffens dough! It’s like… a counter-intuitive proposition. Would almost feel like magic. And unfortunately for everyone trying to replicate this stuff outside of China? It kind of *is* magic – or at least, uses a magic ingredient. That is… Penghui.\n\n**Penghui**\n\nLet’s get something out of the way at first. Go on Amazon. Search “Penghui”. Find anything?\n\nAt least sitting here in the Spring of 2020, I can’t find jack. The only way to find Penghui is by ordering industrial quantities from Alibaba or through specialty middlemen (e.g. a place like ChinaHao).\n\nSee, penghui, traditionally, is the ash of a specific soda plant called ‘Penghuicao’, or Halogeton Arachnoidius in English. The old school way of making the stuff would be to burn the plant, then when it’s at a specific temperature to splash water in it. Apparently, it then forms a rock [like this](https://imgur.com/NBqqgYE). I’m not sure how any of that makes sense (ash + water = rock? someone help me here…), but then to use the penghui… you’d chip some of that off, mix it with water, then apply it to your noodles.\n\nNow, like the ash of many other soda plants, traditional Penghui was undeniably alkaline - probably from either potash or sodium carbonate. But besides that, it must’ve had *something* else in the mix, something that helped the noodles pull. While I can’t seem to find **any** information on the chemical composition of traditional penghui (feels like a fun thesis for any anthropology grad students out there lol), luckily for us… it actually doesn’t really matter. Because basically no one’s using that old school Penghuicao ash these days, either.\n\nWhether for economic or food safety reasons (depends on who you ask), in 1989 food science researchers from the Lanzhou University in Gansu developed a mix of additives that could be used in place of the traditional Penghui. And while it’s a matter of debate as to whether the explosion of hand pulled noodle shops in China over the last few decades is *because* of that innovation, it’s undeniably true that the spread of Lamian noodle joints and manufactured Penghui happened in tandem. Sometimes I joke that all those noodle shops around the country are really just a massive Penghui sales operation – a joke with a shred of truth to it, because if you peek back into the kitchens at Lamian shops, you’re almost guaranteed to be greeted with [the same blue bag](https://imgur.com/eurEgph) at each one.\n\nWhat’s in that blue bag? Well, I’m glad you asked. It’s:\n\n* 50% sodium chloride (salt)\n\n* 45% sodium carbonate. Can be produced at home by baking baking soda in an oven for ~1 hour at 150C.\n\n*  4% sodium triphosphate, a.k.a. STPP. An emulsifier that’s totally available in the West – actually, often it’s used in American supermarkets in order to make fish/shrimp retain more water (looks more plump, while also allowing them to sell you more water and less seafood). Here, the sodium triphosphate acts as a dough strengthener, making the dough less likely to break when you pull it. \n\n* 1% sodium metabisulfite. A reducer which is used as a preservative in winemaking, and also totally available in the West. The function here is to help relax the dough, making it easier to pull.\n\nNow, given that all of these components are available in the West, the question of whether we could just mix all this shit together naturally follows. And the answer is… kind of.\n\nIn the linked video, I try my hardest to make my own ‘homemade Penghui’ using those component parts. The problem is that we totally use about two grams of Penghui in one batch of noodles, so that means one 200 gram serving of noodles uses something like 0.02g of sodium metabisulfite and 0.08g of STPP. With those kinds of quantities, accurate **mixing** of the powders become absolutely imperative (you can’t make a solution either, as sodium metabisulfite quickly oxidizes when in contact with water). So without an industrial screw mixer, it’s really easy to, say, have some batches have a bit too much reducer… and some have not quite enough.\n\nBut does it work? Sorta. By taking every precaution I could think of making the homemade Penghui, we were able to pull it to a roughly spaghetti-thin noodle, but no thinner. \n\nI *would* recommend the homemade Penghui to experienced noodle pullers abroad as a stopgap between Penghui shipments. I *would not* recommend the homemade Penghui to a beginner. When learning, when you confront a batch of failed noodles you want to be sure that it’s your technique that’s the problem, and not your Penghui. So if you’re actually serious about learning Lamian, go on ChinaHao (or a similar website), bite the bullet and just… drop the $70 and buy too much Penghui.\n\n**Ingredients, Lamian:**\n\n1. *Pizza Flour -or- Chinese Lamian Flour, 250g.* The finely milled flour for this one is non-negotiable. Again, for standardization purposes, we used Caputo’s Chef Pizza Flour.\n\n2. *Ice Water, 120g.* So traditionally in the Northwest they use ice water in summer and tap water in the winter. The basic idea is that the ideal Lamian kneading temperature is around 28C, but shouldn’t really exceed 30. Why that is I can really find a compelling answer for, but the advice seems to ring true from experience. Of course, most of our kitchens are temperature controlled these days, so we would personally opt to use ice water all year long.\n\n3. *Salt, ½ tsp.* 2 grams. To be mixed with the ice water.\n\n4. *Any dense oil, e.g. Olive oil, ~3 tbsp.* Dense oils seem to ‘cling’ better to the dough while working it. We used Sichuan Caiziyou (virgin rapeseed oil), but olive oil also worked well in our tests. While working the dough you’re going to be **constantly** oiling your hands and the dough to make sure things don’t dry out. I’m giving an amount because it’s certainly true that some of the oil ends up in the dough itself. It’s approximate because it changed from batch to batch for us – we found that it ended up ranging between two and four tablespoons.\n\n5. *Penghui (蓬灰/拉面剂), 2g; to be mixed with 10g of water.* Again, if first starting out, I’d strongly advise biting the bullet and just figuring a way to source some Penghui. If you would like to try a homemade Penghui, this is how I did it. In a mortar, I pounded 100g of salt until powdery (super annoying), then did a quick pound of 90g of sodium carbonate, 8g STPP, and 2.5g (3/4 tsp) sodium metabisulfite. Be careful with the sodium metabisulfite – while this minuscule amount is probably ok, it would be more responsible for me to advise using PPE and/or going outside when using it. It’s not overly toxic or anything, but do not smell it as if it’s inhaled directly it can temporarily make you unable to breathe for a spell. Then I passed that through a fine mesh sieve a couple times, then mixed in a stand mixer with the paddle attachment on speed three for 30 minutes to combine. In hindsight it might have been a good idea to bake my salt first to ensure that there’s not excess moisture there. But regardless, store your mixture with food safe dessicants (i.e. those little silica gel packs that help absorb moisture). \n\n**Techniques, Lamian:**\n\nOk, so I usually like giving these ‘high level overviews’ of what’s generally going on before I dive into the weeds. But if I try to give a high level overview here, you’ll think I’m speaking a different language:\n\n* Cat claw the water into the flour\n\n* Knead using the making the abacus string method\n\n* Apply the penghui by either the three-fold-two-wrap method or the abacus string method\n\n* Comb the gluten\n\n* Test for pullability\n\n* Pull\n\nFeels almost easy when I put it that way lol. Some of these techniques are the same as what we went over before, but (1) the abacus string method will be more involved and (2) \n\n**Technique #1: Cat Claw (猫抓手)**\n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/kc56k8).\n\nSame Cat Claw technique as above, nothing overly special going on. Just hydrate that sucker. \n\n**Technique #2: Making the Abacus String (算盘子)**\n\nOk, so this is probably the most complicated move on the list – it’s similar to what we covered above, only you’ll need to be a bit more paranoid throughout the process. [Here’s](https://imgur.com/a/24vympg) the imgur album detailing it step-by-step. \n\nJust like the above noodles, the basic idea is that you’re kneading it by continuously curling the dough. You get a long log of curled dough, then flatten the sucker out, then repeat. Getting the dough flat enough to be repeatedly curled up takes a bit of technique though. While you could theoretically crack that nut however you wanted (a pasta maker is one possible – but not necessarily easier - route), the common move is to (1) punch the dough down then (2) press it flat further by crossing your hands and smushing down the edges (3) repeating the hand cross flattening with your hands crossed in the *other* direction to make things totally even and flat.\n\nThis is the most important step in the entire process. At some Lamian schools, the final test is to make an entire batch of Lamian from start to finish in less than 20 minutes flat. Of those 20 minutes, this step right here takes about 15-18 minutes. \n\nYou’ll know you’re ready to move onto the next step when it can form a smooth hole if you tear it. [I like this visual right here](https://imgur.com/mppalAF). This was a batch of Lamian dough that was *almost* ready. The hole on the right is smooth, the hole on the left is jagged. You want the hole to look like the one on the right.\n\nThis might take you a long time to do it. The saying in Lamian making is that you need to do this “9 times 9 times” (i.e. 81 times). That’s ultimately just a saying though, because the number ‘nine’ sounds a lot like ‘a long time’ in Mandarin. But we’ve counted before. We tend to need 30-40 times of repeating this process to get to the point we need. This takes us about a half hour of kneading, but it’s very normal to knead for 40 or even 50 minutes when you’re just starting out. \n\n**Technique #3: Three folds, two wraps (三叠两包): Evenly apply your Penghui**\n\nWhen we add the Penghui, we’ll mix it with water first, then apply it bit by bit into the dough. \n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/ykp6n0).\n\nBasically, when you add the Penghui, it’s pretty important that it evenly gets incorporated into the dough. You don’t want bits of your Penghui water ‘spilling’ out of the though, so the three-folds-two wraps method helps keep all that inside.\n\nDon’t feel like learning yet *another* technique? No problem. You can also just continue to use the abacus string method from before – applying the Penghui when the dough is flat. You’ll just need to be good about only adding a *bit* of Penghui to the dough at a time.\n\n**Technique #4: Combing the Gluten/Testing for Pullability (拉条顺筋)**\n\nSo, there’s two ways to do this step. [This is a clip of the classic ‘twisting’ approach](https://streamable.com/dhlc7s) done in Lamian noodle shops, but let’s just set that one aside for now. We feel like it’s easier to use the following method of gluten combing, which also helps give a nice ‘test’ of sorts for pullability.\n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/zwn5bf).\n\nBasically, what we’re doing is repeatedly pulling and folding the dough over itself, slapping it against the table between each pull. This’ll not only help strengthen the gluten network, but it’ll also help give us a ‘test of sorts’ to ensure that the dough is ready for pulling. If you can pull and fold it over itself at least five times without breaking (six is ideal), you are ready to move onto the next step.\n\nBut what if it’s not quite there? Well, now’s the point where you need to trust your hands and your instincts, and veer off-recipe. You’ll need more Penghui and more time kneading. Mix another batch of Penghui water, but maybe only add, say, a fifth of it at first. Use the abacus string method, knead it for a few more minutes. Then try to gluten comb again.\n\nNote that for this step, you need to make sure everything is super oily. Your hands, the table, your dough, everything. \n\n**Technique #5: Pulling (拉面)**\n\nOk, so I want you to get your expectations straight here.\n\nYou might have visions in your head about wildly pulling these noodles and putting on a show for everyone. You are not a Lamian master: do not try to do this. Your Lamian will become uneven and break.\n\nThis is a game of applying force evenly. It is not easy. It is entirely possible that you will do everything up to this step perfectly, but screw up here – getting some noodles that look thinner than angel hair, and some that wouldn’t be out of place in a Biang Biang.\n\nWork slowly and deliberately. If you fuck up, you fuck up – no shame there. But don’t fuck up because you were overconfident. The noodle cares not for your ego.\n\n[Streamable of the pulling is here](https://streamable.com/iii5sh).\n\nNotice that we’ll be adding some flour on the table for this step. Each time you pull, toss the center of the noodle in your little ‘flour mountain’ as you do it.\n\nYou’ll need five pulls to get to a ‘normal thin’ Lamian. That’s be about the same size as spaghetti – those can either be good in soup or stir-fried. Six pulls gets you to a ‘whisker thin’ Lamian, which’s usually what’s served in the Lanzhou beef noodle soup. Seven pulls gets you to ‘dragon beard’ thin Lamian… which’s thin enough to thread a needle, is completely insane, and way beyond our skill level. \n\n**Process, Lamian:**\n\nOk, got all that? Remember, high level overview:\n\n* Cat claw the water into the flour\n\n* Knead using the making the abacus string method\n\n* Apply the penghui by either the three-fold-two-wrap method or the abacus string method\n\n* Comb the gluten\n\n* Test for pullability\n\n* Pull\n\nAs always, [there’s a video too if you’d like a visual](https://youtu.be/6DgITQSonv4).\n\n1. *Mix the salt with the ice water, then cat claw the mixture into the dough.* Refer to the cat claw technique for details.\n\n2. *Knead everything into a ball, ~1 minute, then cover and rest for 30 minutes.* At the Lamian shops they’ll generally move straight on to the next step here, but we find that kneading’s a bit less painless with a quick rest.\n\n3. *After 30 minutes, remove the dough and roll it out into ~1.5 ft log. Thoroughly rub your hands and work surface with oil.* Again, make sure that everything is good and well oiled though this entire process. Rub your hands and work surface obsessively. \n\n4. *Punch down to flatten the dough. Then continue the making the abacus string method for ~30-40 minutes.* Refer to the ‘making the abacus string’ technique for detailed instructions. And remember: 30-40 minutes is an *estimate*. The timing will depend on your skill in doing this. It would be almost unheard of to do this in less than 15 minutes. I’d guess that it’ll take 40 minutes for a beginner. The dough will be finished once (1) small bubbles begin to form as you’re flattening it and (2) it forms a smooth hole when torn.\n\n5. *Combine the two grams of Penghui with ten grams of water.* Make sure it’s completely dissolved.\n\n6. *Flatten the dough ala the abacus string technique, then wet your hands with the Penghui water and apply it to the top of the dough. Then follow the three-folds-two-wraps technique outlined above.* Refer to the three-folds-two-wraps technique for detailed instructions. To reiterate, you can also just continue to use the abacus string technique here if you prefer – simply add the Penghui a bit more conservatively.\n\n7. *Fold the dough in half, roll it into about a foot and a half log, then liberally apply oil to your dough, hands, and table.* A well oiled situation is important for the gluten combing.\n\n8. *Comb your gluten.* Refer to the gluten combing technique for more information. If you can fold the dough over itself 5-6 times without breaking, you are ready to move onto the next step. If you can’t, go back to step five but add only a fifth of the Penghui water, and knead using the abacus string method for another ~5 minutes. Loop through these until you’re at the correct consistency.\n\n9. *Flour your work surface, pull the noodles.* Pull according to the pulling technique outlined in technique #5 above. Remember, work slowly and deliberately. We'd recommend five pulls for fried noodles, six pulls for soup noodles. Tear off the very end of the dough – that bit’ll be garbage, unless you got a better idea.\n\n10. *Immediately toss in some boiling water to cook.* Until just past al dente, ~45 seconds. If not eating immediately, you can flour them up… but try to devour sooner or later.",

        "body": "##How to use these noodles\n\n---\n\nOk, so great. You’ve got some noodles. How to actually make use of them?\n\nWhile I’m probably blanking on some stuff, there’s three basic ‘categories’ of dishes you can make with these guys: (1) soup noodles (2) mixed noodles and (3) fried noodles. You can make pretty much any these three things with any of these three noodles (with the possible exception of fried Biang Biang noodles… but then again I’ve heard Xi’an Famous Food’s famed Cumin Lamb Biang Biang is actually fried?)\n\nSo because I’m starting to run out of breath here, I’ll choose one dish from each ‘category’ so you can at least get an idea.\n\n###Soup Noodle: Lanzhou Beef Noodle Soup:\n\nIf I were a better recipe writer, I’d follow up the Lamian recipe with an equally long and involved recipe for the beef soup that’s traditionally eaten with it. And listen, it’s a good soup.  But after all the blood, sweat, and tears of testing La Mian, we… didn’t feel like researching and testing the soup.\n\nSo I’m going to cheat, I guess. [Here’s a recipe for Lanzhou Beef Soup, courtesy of the blog ChinaSichuanFood](https://www.chinasichuanfood.com/lanzhou-beef-noodle-soup/). Elaine’s stuff’s excellent as a rule of thumb, and in her recipe she was… smarter than us and just used packaged Lamian haha (not the same thing, but… is 100x the pain worth 3x the deliciousness?). While we might have some of our own opinions here or there (e.g. the chili oil used up in the Northwest is usually made with a milder chili closely related to Kashmiri), her recipe is great and the broad strokes of it would also be how we’d approach it.\n\nIf you’d like, you can also use Elaine’s recipe for the soup together with the Chenmian. While the very best Lanzhou beef soups would probably opt for something thinner than the chenmian (i.e. the six-pull Lamian), it would still be very delicious.\n\n###Mixed Noodle: Youpomian (油泼面)\n\nFor Chenmian or Lamian, (if served unfried or without soup) it’s probably most common to see them with a saucy stir fry topping called *gaizhaomian*. One example would be something [like this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Uyghur_Lagman.jpg). We have no recipes for that kind of thing off the top of my head (apologies), but could give you an educated guess if you were curious and pressed us.\n\nFor Biang Biang, probably the most classic 'mixed' topping is a chili oil based sort called Youpo Mian. But   there’s *tons* of other toppings use for Biang Biang, some of which I covered in a separate [Biang Biang noodle topping post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/dmwmvz/recipes_how_to_top_a_northwest_chinese_biang/). For the sake of brevity though, let’s just cover the chili oil one.\n\n**Ingredients, Chili Oil Topping:**\n\n1. *Leek (大葱), ~3 inch section.* Minced.\n\n2. *Garlic, 2 large cloves.* Minced.\n\n3. *Chili flakes (辣椒粉), 4 tsp.* In the Northwest, they actually use a slightly milder chili for their chili oil. It’s closely related to Kashmiri chili, so making some chili flakes out of kashmiri chilis would have a pretty authentic flavor to it. That said, we used the bog standard Chinese chili flake, and you could also use the red pepper flakes y’all get in the West. Korean chilis might also be a solid direction here.\n\n4. *Sichuan peppercorn powder (花椒面), ½ tsp, optional.* You could go either way for this one.\n\n5. *Light soy sauce (生抽), 4 tbsp.*\n\n6. *Dark Chinese vinegar (陈醋/香醋), 1 tbsp.* If you’re rolling through this recipe and this is the only thing you can’t source… eh… hmm… I dunno, use half cider vinegar and half balsamic. I just made that substitution up on the top of my head though so please don’t hold me to that. Or maybe just buy some, it’s a good ingredient. \n\n7. *Salt, ¼ tsp.*\n\n8. *Peanut oil (花生油), 5 tbsp.* To be heated up and poured over the chili flakes/garlic. A sizable quantity of oil’s important here to keep things slippery.\n\n9. *Baby bok choy (上海青), ½ or 1, quartered.* Optional, use whatever blanched green or vegetable you want. Bean sprouts are also hyper common.\n\n**Process, Chili oil topping:**\n\n1. *Mince up the leek and the garlic.*\n\n2. *While you’re cooking the noodles, toss the quartered bok choy in with it to blanch. Blanch for 45 seconds.*\n\n3. *Nestle the vegetable in and put all the non-liquid toppings over the noodles. Spoon the soy sauce and the vinegar around the sides.*\n\n4. *Heat the oil up until it’s just starting to smoke, ~215C, then pour it over the noodles, aiming for the chili and the garlic.*\n\n###Fried Noodle: Chaolamian (炒拉面)\n\nThis fried noodle can be made with both Chenmian and Lamian (I doubt Biang Biang would work, but hey – if you wanna be experimental). There’s many types of fried pulled noodles of course – this is a classic version that you can find at noodle shops with a tomato/chili bean paste base.\n\n**Ingredients, Chaolamian:**\n\nFor this specific recipe, we opted to use egg as the protein, but that’s basically just because we had some on hand. You could alternatively use lamb, marinated beef… or really whatever.\n\n1.\t*Noodles, 300g.* Chenmian or Lamian are both great. If you want to give this one a whirl without making hand pulled noodles from scratch, feel free to try this with… whatever noodle you feel like. Japanese Ramen (the proper sort, not Top Ramen), Sichuan alkaline noodles, longevity noodles, etc etc. \n\n2.\t*Eggs, 2.* To be beaten and scrambled. Or, your protein of choice.\n\n3.\t*Garlic, 3 cloves.* Crushed.\n\n4.\t*Tomato paste (番茄酱), ½ tbsp.* A real thing in Northwest cooking, I swear.\n\n5.\t*Sichuan Chili Bean Paste (红油郫县豆瓣酱), ½ tbsp.* Something I’ve learned recently – most chili bean pastes that I’ve worked with here in China are actually a sub-category of chili bean paste called ‘chili bean paste in red oil’. No wonder some people’ve had problems with chili bean paste-based recipes. *Sigh.* You’re looking for the sort that comes in a big red plastic jar, [like this](https://www.amazon.com/Sichuan-Pixian-Boad-Paste-Chili/dp/B01M31VHNZ). It’s also available (super overpriced) online.\n\n6.\t*Baby bok choy (上海青), 100g.* Sliced horizontally. Or, your veg of choice.\n\n7.\t*Light soy sauce (生抽), 1 tbsp.* For seasoning/use while stir-frying.\n\n8.\t*Seasoning: ½ tsp salt, ¼ tsp five spice powder (五香粉), ½ tbsp of dark Chinese vinegar (香醋/陈醋).* One of the few stir-fries that we’ll season with five spice powder directly. For the dark Chinese vinegar, there’s two big varieties in China – Chinkiang (镇江香醋) and Shanxi Mature Vinegar (山西陈醋). Both are ok here, though Shanxi Mature would be slightly preferred (we used Chinkiang). If working with Western vinegars, our suggestion would be subbing it with a ratio of 2:2:1 balsalmic:white vinegar:water.\n\n9.\t*Other vegetables for the stir-fry: Red onion (洋葱), ¼ quarter; Green mild chili (青椒), ½; Red mild chili (红椒).*  All sliced. For if you don’t feel like grabbing different color chilis you can also just use solely green or red mild chilis. Anaheims are perfect, poblanos would be a little spicy but still work. Bell pepper would also be acceptable. Red onion is for looks, yellow onion is also totally cool.\n\n10.\t*Toasted sesame oil (麻油), 1 tsp.* For finishing.\n\nYou’ll also need ~2-3 tbsp of oil for cooking the egg, followed by ~3tbsp of oil for stir-frying.\n\n**Process, Chaolamian:**\n\n[Video of the frying of the noodles is here](https://youtu.be/qzAdiOhaZJs?t=243) if you’d like a visual to follow along.\n\n1.\t*Crush the garlic, slice the onion and chilis into slivers, chop the baby bok choy, beat the eggs.* For the baby bok choy, cut slice the bit that ‘holds it together’ at the end, then chop into ~1 inch sections across the stem. For the eggs, really beat the snot out of them until no stray strands of egg white remain.\n\n2.\t*Scramble the egg.* However you want, I guess. But if you want to follow us, first *Longyau*: get your wok piping hot, shut off the heat, add in your oil (here about 2-3 tbsp) and give it a swirl to get a nice nonstick surface. Swap the flame to medium, then heat the oil up until it’s bubbling around a pair of chopsticks. Pour in the egg, let it puff, then pull the cooked portions to the sides of the wok, letting the uncooked bits set in the center. Then once it’s ~80% not runny… flip it. Shut off the heat, quick scramble, and reserve.\n\n3.\t*Boil the noodles.* Boil the noodles as per the recipes above, or whatever sort of package you’re working with.\n\n4.\t*Stir fry the noodles.* As always, first longyau. Piping hot wok, flame off, ~3tbsp of oil, swirl. Flame on medium then, immediately:\n\n* Garlic, in. Fry for ~30 seconds til fragrant. Scooch the garlic up the sides of the wok.\n\n* Shut off the heat. Add the tomato paste and chili bean paste. Swap flame back to low. The reason we shut off the heat before adding the pastes is because those guys love to burn. \n\n* Fry for ~2 minutes until the pastes have stained the oil obviously red. Up the flame to medium.\n\n* Baby bok choy, in. ~30 second fry until slight wilted.\n\n* Noodles, in. ~30 second fry until it’s all basically mixed.\n\n* Swirl the tablespoon of soy sauce over your spatula and around the sides of the wok. Super brief fry.\n\n* Salt and five spice powder, in. Super brief fry.\n\n* Onion/peppers in. Quick ~15 second fry.\n\n* Add back in the egg. Super brief fry.\n\n* Swirl the half tablespoon of dark Chinese vinegar over the spatula and around the sides of the wok. Super brief fry.\n\n* Heat off, drizzle the toasted sesame oil. Another mix, then out.",

        "body": "##Quick note to fellow Lamian geeks re dough conditioners:\n\n---\n\nForgive me for getting into the weeds for a second here, and definitely skip this if you don't live-and-breathe noodles and such. See, there’s been a subset of us Lamian nerds online that’ve been arguing about how best to make pulled noodles outside of China for, like, the better part of a decade. I’m feeling a little lazy to bump the ol’ eGullet thread though, so forgive me for chiming in my two cents here.\n\nRecently, I’ve seen a lot of hype surrounding adding either L-cysteine or nutritional yeast to the mix in order to get a pullable noodle. The former seems to be from reports that certain noodle shops in southern Japan use it as a conditioner, the latter from Tim Chin’s recent (very cool) [SeriousEats article on the topic of Lamian](https://www.seriouseats.com/2020/04/homemade-hand-pulled-noodles-lamian.html).\n\nI do have my doubts that either of these two additives alone could make a pullable alkaline noodle – Tim’s SE recipe specifically states that it (i.e. the deactivated yeast) can’t. I certainly understand the desire to make a Lamian recipe that doesn’t call for minuscule quantities of weird shit like Sodium Metabisulfite – on that note, I think Tim’s deactivated yeast is bloody brilliant. But it *is* still missing something, of course, else it’d also be able to pull with the addition of Kan Sui.\n\nThe thing that I think these reducer-focused recipes are missing is the emulsifier. On a whim once we tried applying solely salt plus a sprinkle of sodium metabisulfite to the dough, just to see what would happen. Adding *that* much reducer undeniably turns the dough into puddy, but after a pull or two the noodle **still broke**. The effect is a little hard to describe, but it feels like the dough loses its integrity… like a Chenmian that’s been sitting in the back of your fridge for a week. You need a *stronger* noodle – and that’s where the emulsifier comes in.\n\nEmulsifiers function as dough strengtheners. How exactly they differ from oxidizing agents, and why they don’t seem to sacrifice extensibility are both good questions that are beyond my pay grade. There’s a pretty good 2019 article on the subject of STPP in noodles called “The effects of phosphate salts on the pasting, mixing and noodle-making performance of wheat flour”, [link here](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.01.049). Adding STPP, particularly between the levels of 0.05% and 0.1% (note: we were at 0.04%), caused “an enhanced resistance to successive mixing and an improved capacity to sustain shear force”. I could certainly be misreading the paper (I uh… majored in Finance lol), so definitely don’t take my word for it, but the fact remains that the emulsifier seems to be an important component.\n\nBecause you know that classic blue bag of Penghui? These days it’s not the only name in the game. There’s another mix from a company called QBR that’s relatively popular and also works like a charm. Their mix? 42% sodium chloride, 35% sodium carbonate, 8% potassium carbonate, and 15% acetylated distarch phosphate. \n\nWhat’s acetylated distarch phosphate? …an emulsifier. Why are they bonding phosphate to a modified starch instead of using a phosphate salt like STPP? No clue. But notice, **there ain’t a single reducer in that mix**.\n\nBecause really, relaxing a dough’s easy. As evidenced by Chenmian… all you need is time, really. Keeping an alkaline dough from breaking after multiple pulls? *That’s* the ballgame.\n\nIn the future, I hope someone can come up with a similarly brilliant solution to the emulsifier problem as Tim did for the reducer. I do wonder if lecithin (potentially in combination with the nutritional yeast) might do the trick – if it does, people could potentially bake some baking soda to get some sodium carbonate, then everything needed for Penghui could be available at supermarkets in the West. Purely speculation though.\n\n##Lamian: What to do if you fail\n\n---\n\nOh no! You failed your Lamian. C'est la guerre. You hungry? It’s ok. You can still eat dinner.\n\nIf you have a pasta maker… fold the dough a couple times then pass it through, I dunno, the third smallest setting. Then cut it using the 2mm setting. Now boil.\n\nIf you don’t have a pasta maker, roll the dough out thin, then fold it a few times until the whole thing is roughly the size of your knife. Then cut it into ~2mm strips. Now boil.\n\nWe ate a *lot* of failed test batches. They’re still pretty tasty noodles to be honest. It’s not ideal because these failed batches end of breaking kind of easy when boiling, so sometimes you can have these weird ~5-6 inch long noodles. They won’t impress anyone, but hungry people definitely won’t complain.\n\nNot hungry? Just want to practice a bit more? Press your failed noodle together, then apply a bit of penghui to the dough, starting from step five. The additional Penghui will bring the dough to life – often Lamian shops’ll keep some dough in the fridge, then add some additional Penghui, and start with the gluten combing step when people order a bowl of noodles. You can use this trick to practice repeatedly with one batch – that way, you can work on your skills repeatedly without wasting ~an hour of your life each time. At some point, the Penghui’ll get too much and you’ll need to toss the dough, but hey, these components are pretty cheap anyhow.",

        "body": "Thanks for in creating this informative essay! The hard work also showed in your videos and it inspired me to try an experiment (though much smaller scale than yours!) in seeing how freezing might affect the dough. So after making some lamian based on your video (the non-alkaline one), I put some of the pre-pulled dough and some pulled noodles (mainly used pulled ends off noodles to reduce waste) into the freezer to see how if it would work. \n\nThe pulled noodles cook well from frozen and although not perfect, are still pretty decent, having a nice \"chewyness\" to them. I found that if you cook a pulled noodle from frozen it had higher chance to snap in half in the hot water, however if you let it defrost a little first until more soft, then it stayed long. \n\nFor the pre-pulled dough, the outer edge had a dried skin, however to my surprise i was able to somewhat pull out the noodle, although had to be super delicate and ended up with an irregular thickness. Picture here (https://imgur.com/a/Kp2sAZP). The noodle cooked well and tasted fine as well. It kept its shape after coming out of the hot water and withstood a quick stirfry. \n\nSo in summary, it is possible to freeze the dough pre-pulled, however not a particularly uniform or long noodle. Freezing the noodles after they have been pulled and then cooking after leaving to defrost for short period of time is probably best approach if you had to freeze.",

Over the years have seen more and more westerners contributing to the English speaking elth of knowledge whereas most of the resources when I had first begun were in Chinese. I have only successfully pulled beautiful noodles once and it was such a surprise. Since then I've become very good at kneading but still have yet to replicate those thin noodles. I have to go to work and this is a huge post so I haven't finished reading, but I'll add some preliminary thoughts so excuse me if anything I mention is already in the post. \n\nI did not use any alkali in the one success story, so I'm convinced it's not 100% essential. However salt is absolutely necessary. This paper, [effects of salt on gluten formation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0733521014000769) shows that salt can strengthen the gluten bonds but only to a limit, before it becomes a hindrance. From memory there is also a paper on the effect of alkali substances but I forget where. \n\nI have also learnt that, (without an alkali solution at least) your dough will take a significantly longer time to knead before being pullable when using high gluten flour. I agree that 00 flour is a good alternative to any specific noodle flour but you should also be conscious about protein content. Low protein flour may be easier to knead (good for practice!) but I'm not 100% sure if it's possible for consistent results. Again, my one success story was with ~10.6% protein I believe.\n\nOften times, any lamian failures have been turned into biang biang noodles which are so much easier, but less rewarding haha\n\nI'll add anything I remember to this post later, and will continue reading this post throughout the day but thanks to everyone who wishes to spread the joy of hand pulled noodles.",

        "body": "Making your own 蓬灰 by evenly blending a mix of these solid chemicals certainly sounds challenging. The ratio of the different quantities is really too skewed to do so successfully with just household tools.\n\nThe standard answer would be that you should first make aqueous solutions and then manipulate those. Both salt (NaCl) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) have a pretty long shelf life even when in solution. The biggest challenge would be that right after you made Na2CO3 from baking soda, you most likely (?) had the anhydrous chemical, whereas if you let it sit it might have turned into the monohydrate. So, you cold run into difficulties measuring precise quantities. No idea how important it is to hit exactly 45%.\n\nSo, I'd suggest making fresh Na2CO3 and then immediately mixing it with salt. You can then either store it dry. In that case, the salt would help a little bit to minimize the amount of error you introduce by allowing the Na2CO3 to slowly hydrate. Or alternatively, you could store it in solution. That way, the ratios won't change any more. And from what I can tell, in a clean bottle, a solution of NaCl and Na2CO3 should be shelf stable for a couple of years.\n\nSTPP is more challenging. If exposed to acids, it'll react quite rapidly. But even in an akaline aqueous solution, it can degrade within a couple of days; this seems more likely, if you don't manage to keep the bottle sterile, as there are different ways that it can biodegrade. In other words, STPP solution should be prepared right when needed, and you otherwise store STPP as a solid. In solid form, it has a long shelf life.\n\nSodium metabisulfite is even more problematic that way. It is pretty shelf stable when stored in a clean dry containers. But in solution, it'll react with all sorts of things. Don't expect a long shelf life from an aqueous solution. This chemical definitely should be stored dry and used within a couple of hours of dissolving it in water.\n\nMeasuring quantities of less than a gram is very difficult to do with common household equipment. But fortunately, both STPP and sodium metabisulfite should be relatively cheap. So, we could measure out something on the order of one to ten grams (much easier to do), and then dilute with water to the desired percentages. Then it is relatively easy to measure a small number of milliliters of this solution and to discard the bulk of the solution. At home, a syringe from the pharmacy is probably the best tool to measure out the amounts that are needed.\n\nThat way, we get precise measurements. It is still possible to mess this up, as mixing a large quantity of liquid is not *quite* as easy as mixing a cup of coffee. But that's a relatively easy problem to solve. Just keep stirring longer. Overall evenly mixing liquids is much easier than blending solids.\n\nOh, and instead of grinding your own salt, buy unflavored popcorn salt. That saves you one tedious step.\n\nI haven't bothered doing the math to come up with a reproducible set of instructions yet. But I feel that with some care, mixing solutions of the chemicals would be the best approach to make penghui at home in the US. Having said that, I still hope to find a way to source the ready-made known-good powder. Much less messy. And the rest of the noodle recipe is already complicated enough; no need to add even more complexity.",

(To be fair, sitting in the back of a Lamian shop watching the chefs intently and taking notes sounds like a fun Saturday to me :D )\n\nI live in Japan so I have access to awesome fresh ramen, and a slightly thicker variant called Okinawa Soba. My go-to 15 minute healthy-ish dinner these days is ramen topped with a vegetable+egg stir fry, and then loaded with all the usual suspects for topping dry noodles: soy sauce, black vinegar (I could DRINK that stuff..) , zha chai/pickle of choice, blanched greens, chopped scallions/chinese chives, chilli oil/sesame oil, MSG, etc. It's fun to experiment with these! \n\nFor the eggy veg topping, I've noticed that in your videos and others, egg stir fries in China tend to be very much based around cooking the egg 'well done' - it's basically scrambled and very much fully cooked, whereas I like them super runny: I basically stir fry aromatics with green veggies super quickly and then add beaten eggs right at the end, mix and pour onto the noodles - they only have a few seconds of heat in the pan so they're still super runny and I love the way they mix into the noodles and other toppings. \n\nI wonder if you know of any recipes in China where runny eggs actually do appear? Here in Japan they're everywhere, raw too is super common. (Tamago Kake Gohan, Natto+Egg, Oyakodon, etc..)

That's the blue liquid. That blue liquid contains mostly copper and some silver, and, in smaller quantities whatever other metals may have been used to make the jewelry. \n\nWhat's left is the mostly purified gold (around 96-98% or so pure gold. It's these thin foils that used to be bonded to those other metals.Then, after it's rinsed real well, I add hydrochloric acid and nitric acid. These two acids together will dissolve the gold and leave any undesirable parts behind. That's the auric chloride (the yellow liquid). Literally liquid gold. This photo contains $2,000 worth of pure gold. History says Two scientists dissolved their 23k noble peace prizes to keep them out of the hands of the Nazis as they marched in Copenhagen. Being dissolved in solution made for a good hiding spot, so the metal could be recovered later. \n\nNow, this auric chloride solution is filtered, and then sodium metabisulfite is added which brings the gold, and only the gold out of solution.it leaves behind anything else that may have gotten through. What you're left with is this dark brown powder that is rinsed and turns a light cinnamon color. That's the pure gold. This is dried and melted down to make the metallic 999 gold we all love. \n\nWhat's important is safety, both personal and environmental. The ingredients used and the wastes created are highly toxic and can be lethal. One must know how to neutralize the toxic fumed and recover the waste heavy metals first, before even attempting. It's not easy and requires effort, knowledge, skill, a bit of luck, and specialized ingredients and equipment. But there are a lot of home refiners in this community and it can be very rewarding, so long as you remember to practice personal and environmental safety FIRST.\n\nWith this process I can get pure gold for about 30% below spot, not counting my time invested in the cooking and sourcing of the raw material. The ingredients are relatively cheap and most can be found at your local hardware store. AMA. Cheers.",

    "body": "I've been evangelizing DIY ECN-2 for quite a while, and realized I'm typing out the same somewhat long-winded explanation over and over for individual people who ask. So I'm making this post primarily to have a destination to refer people to if they ask.\n\nMandatory disclaimers: I am not a chemist. I understand how the chemistry side of things in film development works only at a very layman's level. If I get something wrong here, I hope someone with better chemistry knowledge can help correct me.\n\nWithout further ado:\n\nYou should consider developing your own color film at home using ECN-2 chemistry that you mix yourself instead of from a kit. Why? Here are a few reasons besides the obvious advantages of cost savings, turnaround times, and in-house control of your final results:\n\n1. Developing C-41 film in ECN-2 chemistry, in my opinion, produces better results than developing ECN-2 film (even with remjet removed like Cinestill) in C-41 chemistry. Obviously that's subjective, but having tried both, I strongly prefer the former. For me, it makes sense to keep ECN-2 ingredients on hand, as they can be used to develop ANY type of color film I care to shoot, including slide film. The obvious exception here is if you plan on optically printing your C-41 negs via RA-4 - just use actual CD-4 developer if that's your intended use case. But if you're scanning, any small color casts can be easily corrected in post.\n2. ECN-2 chemistry uses CD-3 as the color developer, while C-41 uses CD-4. As it happens. E-6 slide films also use CD-3. This means you can use your ECN-2 chemistry (including bleach and fix), in combination with a black & white developer (like HC-110) to [develop slide film](https://www.reddit.com/r/Darkroom/comments/197a1cz/test_2_with_ecn2_chems_for_processing_ektachrome/) with [excellent results](https://www.reddit.com/r/Darkroom/comments/19ejulm/its_official_i_dont_need_to_buy_real_e6_chemistry/) and a higher degree of color accuracy than you could achieve using C-41 chemicals.\n3. In the USA (can't speak for anywhere else in the world), the ingredients are easy to source and inexpensive enough that you can mix up 250ml of developer (enough to develop 3 rolls of film before chemical exhaustion) for about $1.50 USD, give or take. This is cheap enough that I don't feel bad mixing it up and using one-shot for a single roll of 24 exposures. I actually keep several pre-mixed quanities of powder on hand in film canisters. Only the CD-3 powder needs to be kept separate from the rest during storage. When it's time to develop, I just dump a canister into 250ml of water, shake it up for a minute, and stick it in the hot water bath to heat up to temp. Gone are the days of saving up 12 exposed rolls of film so I can justify buying a kit. I no longer have to worry about shelf life.\n\nI used [this article](https://grainy.vision/blog/ecn-2-processing) (which I did not write) to get my recipes. The person who wrote it did a lot of the leg work for testing out and adapting Kodak's published formulas for use in a non-industrial setting.\n\nThat said, I have further adapted the recipes on that site to make smaller quantities, and I have found substitutes for (or simply omitted) ingredients that were expensive, difficult to source, or hazardous. So all the proprietary \"Kodak Anti-Fog\" and whatnot are absent from my recipes. Here's what you need to know:\n\n**1. Remjet pre-bath**\n\nI mix this up 500ml at a time and use at the same 105°F as the developer. It has a virtually infinite shelf life, and can probably handle something like 20 rolls of film before losing effectiveness. Handle the lye carefully, use gloves. With actual Vision3 that doesn't have the remjet removed, I get better results and have a much easier time getting the film totally free of remjet when I use this recipe, compared to any of the simpler \"just use baking soda\" type recipes out there. YMMV. Obviously this pre-bath isn't needed for films without remjet.\n\n|Ingredient|Quantity|\n|:-|:-|\n|Borax|10g|\n|Sodium Sulfate|50g|\n|Sodium Hydroxide (lye)|0.5g|\n|Sodium Carbonate monohydrate (washing soda)|7.5g|\n|Distilled Water|Balance to 500mL|\n\n**2. Developer (250mL)**\n\nI use this one-shot. 250mL is enough for up to 3 rolls of 135-36 or 120 film (or sheets of 8x10 film). Even with just one roll of 35mm, 250mL is not enough liquid to cover the roll while at rest, which means you will need to use constant agitation to avoid uneven development. If you don't have a rotary developer or other automated solution, that just means you need to be inverting manually for the full duration of the developer step. The powders can all be pre-mixed and stored in a film canister, with the exception of CD-3, which will degrade if stored in contact with other ingredients. I keep my CD-3 in an airtight jar.\n\n|Ingredient|Quantity|\n|:-|:-|\n|Sodium Sulfite|0.5g|\n|Sodium Bromide|0.3g|\n|Sodium Carbonate monohydrate (washing soda)|7.5g|\n|Sodium Bicarbonate (baking soda)|0.675g|\n|CD-3|1g|\n|Distilled Water|Balance to 250mL|\n\n**3. Stop Bath (500mL)**\n\nI am not using the sulfuric acid-based stop bath from the linked article, despite Kodak's insistence that it's necessary. I have not seen any downsides. This amount of stop bath has virtually unlimited shelf life, and a conservative capacity estimate of 10 rolls. I keep it in liquid form and pour back into the bottle (recording the tally marks towards exhaustion) after each use.\n\n|Ingredient|Quantity|\n|:-|:-|\n|Kodak Indicator Stop Bath|4.7mL|\n|Water (distilled not necessary)|Balance to 500mL|\n\n**4. Bleach (500mL)**\n\nAgain, I have simplified the recipe here. The ferricyanide is what's doing the work. I haven't found a need to use sulfuric acid in this recipe either. Shelf life here is basically unlimited; capacity is about 20 rolls of film. I use in the same way as stop bath (track exhaustion and re-use until I hit it).\n\n|Ingredient|Quantity|\n|:-|:-|\n|Potassium Ferricyanide|20g|\n|Sodium Bromide|12.5g|\n|Borax|0.75g|\n|Water (distilled not necessary)|Balance to 500mL|\n\n**5. Fixer (500mL)**\n\nSame story - keeps long enough that I don't worry about shelf life. Capacity of 10 rolls of film. Re-use until exhaustion.\n\n|Ingredient|Quantity|\n|:-|:-|\n|Ammonium Thiosulfate (60%)|90.65mL|\n|Sodium Sulfite|5g|\n|Sodium Metabisulfite|4.2g|\n|Water (distilled not necessary)|Balance to 500mL|\n\n**6. Stabilizer (500mL)**\n\nColor stabilizer is a controversial topic. You can go read Photrio forums for a lively debate about whether it's needed, what substitutes for formaldehyde are most effective, which manufacturers did what cool tricks to avoid using formaldehyde, etc. As for me, I figure it's easy and inexpensive enough to mix a bit of formalin in with my final PhotoFlo rinse and just not worry about whether my films have been properly stabilized or not. All of my films (C-41, ECN-2, or E-6) get a final minute or two in the stabilizer, so I can be confident that the color dyes are as stable as possible. Do be extremely careful with formaldehyde (or formalin, as it's called when mixed in water). It's very nasty stuff.\n\nThis stabilizer has a shelf life of forever, and a capacity of roughly 20 films, to make a conservative estimate. Once nice benefit of mixing the formalin in with the final rinse is that it seems to kill anything that would otherwise try to grow in the PhotoFlo solution.\n\n|Ingredient|Quantity|\n|:-|:-|\n|PhotoFlo 200|2.5mL|\n|Formalin (37%)|5mL|\n|Distilled Water (ALWAYS use distilled here)|Balance to 500mL|\n\nThose are the recipes. The process I use is as follows:\n\n|Step|Temp|Time|Comments|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Pre-Bath|105°F|30s|Just use a few fills of 105°F water for C-41 films. The remjet-pre-bath for ECN-2. Vigorous agitation (I literally shake the tank) if handling remjet.|\n|Developer|105°F|3m for ECN-2, 5m for C-41|Constant agitation. Temperature is critical here, more than any other step.|\n|Stop Bath|95°F - 105°F|30s|No water rinse in between developer and stop - the stop much more quickly and effectively kills the developer action. Constant agitation preferred.|\n|Rinse|95°F - 105°F|3x tank fills|Agitate vigorously to get the stop bath off the film.|\n|Bleach|95°F - 105°F|3m|Constant agitation.|\n|Rinse|95°F - 105°F|3x tank fills|Agitatie vigorously to get the bleach off the film.|\n|Fixer|95°F - 105°F|3m|Constant agitation.|\n|Wash|I slowly decrease to room temp|6m|Wash in running water. If developing a film with remjet, use a latex/nitrile-gloved hand to carefully but very thoroughly rub off all traces of remjet under running water here. This can make or break the results - if you miss remjet during your final wash, it looks terrible in the scans.|\n|Stabilizer/Final Rinse|Room temp|1m|Very gentle agitation - you don't want bubbles if you can avoid them.|\n\nDespite the ways I've deviated from Kodak's published formulas and procedures, I have been getting excellent results. Hope you can enjoy the same benefits of doing this DIY! It's not as hard as it sounds.",

There is no rinse between the color developer bath and the pre-bleach, the formaldehyde is present in such a chemical form that the small amount of color developer that carries over will form the small amount of formaldehyde necessary to react with the film.",

    "body": "Hello everyone! This is my first time posting here, I hope I'm doing the review correctly. I purchased this product a few months ago in the hopes of clearing up my PIH and so far, I find quite efficacious. \n\n**Skin profile**: Type- Oily, sensitive and prone to acne\nTone- medium (I use Maybelline Fit Me 220)\n**Skin concerns**:hyperpigmentation, acne, clogged pores. \n**Climate and season**:Tropical, summer (very hot and humid) \n**Product**: Hada Labo Shirojyun Premium Whitening Lotion (light) \n**Ingredients**: Water, Glycerin, Methylpropaned Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Diglycerin, Glycera Betaine, Trehalose, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose E Alpha-Arbutin, Chlorphenesin, Polysorbate 20. Hydro Lecithin, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Metabisulfite, Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Ascorbic Acid, Resveratrol \n\n*Review*\n\n**Smell**: It is fragrance-free which is great for my sensitive skin. I can't detect any scent otherwise.\n**Texture**: Quite runny. It absorbs readily into the skin but leaves a very slight sticky feel.\n**Application**: I pour some into my palm, then spread it evenly on my skin, both on my face and body. \n**Length of use**: 3 months\n\nMy skin is recovering from acne, so I'm dealing with PIH and uneven texture. I thought this looks like it would help, seeing as it has niacinamide high up in the ingredient list, which has helped a lot with my hyperpigmentation before. I am quite pleased with the results. It definitely helped to fade my PIH. I had a huge pimple on my thigh which left behind a large purplish-brown spot. I applied the product every night on the spot and the discoloration has faded considerably. It's not completely gone but only 1-2 shades darker than my skin. The lotion also made my skin soft and overall brighter and smoother. \n\n Would definitely repurchase!",

    "body": "Another hack for you'll!! From Ayurveda before to chemical compounds now - life needs to have some balance 😀\n\nSo I've been looking for a scalp serum, have used 2 bottles of The Ordinary Multi-Peptide serum before, and was looking at the Inkey List Caffeine scalp serum, and the ingredient \"Redensyl 1%\" caught my eye, went down a rabbit hole of a few hours of Googling and discovered that the TO serum also uses it and the Mamaearth Onion oil! 😆Also discovered that the Inkey List Amino Acid Anti-Gray Scalp Treatment uses a compound called Darkenyl.\n\nNow - if both The Ordinary and Inkey List are using these compounds, they must be good. Whilst I can do product research am not good at explaining science-y stuff, so just going to link out to resources that explain better what &amp;amp; how they function! These are compounds made by Givaudan a Swiss company.\n\n**Redensyl for hair growth**: \n\n* [doc 1](https://thefitzroviacentre.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/REDENSYL-04-04.pdf), [doc 2](http://www.nardev.com/UploadSection/ProdCat-276-1446515551.pdf) (TLDR: a safer topical than Minoxidil that doesn't need to be taken lifelong but results expected after 3 months minimum usage). \n* **INCI:** Aqua (and) Glycerin (and) Sodium Metabisulfite (and) Glycine (and) Larix Europaea Wood Extract (and) Zinc Chloride (and) Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract. \n\n**Darkenyl for anti-gray:** \n\n* [doc](https://www.benevablack.ch/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Study_Darkenyl.pdf), [article](https://supplementclarity.com/darkenyl-anti-gray-hair-review/). \n* **INCI:** Glycerin (and) Water (and) N-Acetyl-Tyrosine (and) Sodium Metabisulfite (and) Glycine (and) Larix Europaea Wood Extract (and) Zinc Chloride (and) Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract.\n\nI've found 16 products (oils and scalp serums) containing Redensyl in India, and 1 containing Darkenyl (oil).  I've added the % of the compound used where I could find them, have messaged brands on IG wherever missing, and will update as and when they respond (if they do!). For these products, I'd recommend getting a scalp serum as am not sure how the penetration efficacy would be in an oil. There are a lot of men's products as male pattern balding is a common issue to address, my brief research on Saw Palmetto and DHT blockers is that it can be used unisex, though I went with a product without these myself, more below.\n\n**You can find my list of products here:** \n\n**UPDATE:** Doc now also contains other hair growth compounds Aminexil, Baicapil, Capixyl, Procapil \n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V2Q3GrImfb9zOogFCc8y9ovpYZVI7iO\\_ejbz8Vr1AZI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V2Q3GrImfb9zOogFCc8y9ovpYZVI7iO_ejbz8Vr1AZI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n* **For Redensyl:** I ended up buying the Escobar Beard Growth Serum (no beard here 😂, but will go on the scalp), with 3% Redensyl, Biotin and Keratin. Got 3 pieces for Rs.600 on Flipkart (received 2 beard serums and one oil which has Redensyl also but prefer the serum so now have to go through the long drawn out process of having it replaced, and have got really bad service from NutriGlow so avoid the brand or buy at your own risk). It's made by NutriGlow which also makes the exact same formulation for Satthwa which charges way more, they've also launched the Beard Growth serum as a Hair Growth serum 😆 I'd stopped using The Ordinary one as it was expensive and I'd run out of it every 10 days, so will share a review of these after a few months as I hope to stick to a 3 month course. \n\n***UPDATE***: am not a fan of the Escobar beard serum. Firstly got an oil in the pack of 3, and have been ghosted by both Flipkart and NutriGlow for the replacement. Secondly, the product has a strange masculine smell which is annoying and have realised I’ve been avoiding putting it because of the smell. So it’s a WNRP and will try the other products instead. When I do apply it use this Shiseido technique https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFEuwVrf28M\n\n* **For Darkenyl:** there is only one option of the Bombay Shaving Company oil, have enough hair oils for now so will get this later. \n\nWhilst the peptides in The Ordinary serum and caffeine in the Inkey List would have added benefits, we get to try the main compound for a fraction of the cost! And to add a disclaimer, this is my quick research, so request you'll to do your due diligence as well before trying these out. Hope this helps! 😀",

    "body": "\nHey all! 👋🏻I want to review hair growth serum from minimalist-\n\nSo i have straight fine hair(little below shoulder length)(30s/F), oily scalp. \n\nI have been suffering from hair loss for past two years. I haven't checked with my derm. I have lost some hair (in patches) because of my tight hairstyle. Then came humidity season and my hair were everywhere. Before taking an appointment I decided to try hair serum. I started on 29th june. \n\n\n29/6: Started with serum. First application was hassle free. No burning or warming of the scalp. I used 4 drops front of scalp(problem area) and 4 drops back of my head, everyday, in the AM(as i take shower in the PM). Rubbed into my fingers and then Massaged only on my scalp and not on length. It was non greasy.\n\n\n01/07: In just two days I started to feel my hair fall is less, like 3-4 strands in my comb. I thought its a placebo effect.\n\n\nI continued it for two weeks straight, every day and my hair fall reduced by 20%. I stopped the application on 14/7 for two weeks as i was traveling and wanted to see if hairfall return and to my luck it Did. But it wasn't alot. I think some people miss understand that after stopping hairfall doubles but it's just the same amount you used to get(at least for me)\nI restarted again and still using it and now i can say I definitely see hair looks bit thicker, have seen baby hair growth especially at the hairline and hair fall has reduced to 80%. \n\nI will keep using it as it dint have any side effects except one stubborn cc which always occurs on my forehead if apply regularly. Thus i now use it 4-5 times a week(depends on which day i ll shampoo and workout)\n\nIts non greasy if applied less but if you directly use the dropper on scalp you might end up using alot and it will give oily look. My scalp normally gets oily on 3rd day but with everyday application of serum hair looks oily on 2nd day. \n\n\nPROS: 1. It works.\n2. New hair growth. \n3. Hair seem thicker.\n4. Less hairfall.\n\n\nCONS: 1.Everyday application is a task for long hair and oily scalp as you need to shampoo.\n2. Give cc on forehead with regular use.\n3. Don't think its a permanent cure.\n4. Expensive.\n\nInci:\nButylene Glycol, Aqua, Dextran, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3, Trifolium Pratense (Clover) Flower Extract, Propanediol, Arginine, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Gluconolactone, Calcium Gluconate, Glycerin, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Apigenin, Oleanolic Acid, Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Sprout Extract, Isomalt, Sodium Metabisulfite, Larix Europaea Wood Extract, Glycine, Zinc Chloride, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Saccharide Isomerate, Sanguisorba Officinalis Root Extract, Serenoa Serrulata (Saw Palmetto) Fruit Extract, Capryloyl Glycine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Lactic Acid\n\n\nTL:DR- True to its claims, will repurchase it!\n------------------------------",

    "body": "Hello.\n\nMy name is Domirillo.\n\nIt’s a pleasure to meet you.\n\nWould you care for a drink?\n\nSince it’s a little chilly outside, I was thinking we could pretend to “get away” by making a margarita. How does that sound? \n\nExcellent.\n\nLet me go ahead and get the ingredients together here.\n\nFirst, lets fill a pint glass with ice and then pour 3-5 oz of mix into the gla...\n\nWhat? This?\n\nIt’s margarita mix.\n\nNo, I don’t know what’s in it. Who do I look like, Don Carlos Orozco?\nWho I think maybe invented the margarita.\n\nFine, I’ll read the ingredients: Water, high fructose corn syrup, citric acid, sodium citrate, sodium benzoate, cellulose gum, gum acacia, polysorbate 60, natural flavors, glycerol ester of wood rosin, sodium metabisulfite, yellow 5, blue 1. \n\n...yeah, now that you mention it. I don’t know what half of those words even mean. But look, it’s made by Jimmy Buffet’s own hands, and it says right on the bottle, “Pair the refreshing taste of Margaritaville Lime Margarita Mix with Margaritaville Tequila and get ready to enjoy a premium margarita with every spin of the blender.”\n\nSee, it says “premium” right there. So I think that must be what those words that I didn’t understand were. Those are the premium ingredients. Which explains why they’re so hard to spell. \n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nFuck, I can’t do this anymore. I feel gross just pretending to think that crap is ok.\n\nI guess I need to take a few steps back, and actually explain what the hell you’re reading right now, for those uninitiated. \n\nI’m Domirillo. I work on Archer. At one point during the making of season 2, I noticed that Adam Reed had put a lot of very specific cocktails and other kinds of alcohol into his scripts, and thought it might be fun to share the weekly cocktails on reddit, with a bit of history of the drink, how to make it, and any other esoterica that doesn’t really have to do with the show, because nobody likes spoilers.\n\nThe idea is simple: If you were Archer, you’d be drinking right now. So, when you’re watching Archer each week, you should probably be drinking then too. I’m trying to make that easy for you. Plus, if you stop drinking for too long, the cumulative hangover might literally kill you.\n\nOK, back to the margarita mix.\n\nI talked about the [history and possible origin of the margarita](http://www.reddit.com/r/ArcherFX/comments/klmop/the_tip_s3e02_heart_of_archness_part_ii/) back in Season 3, but I didn’t spend much time covering the fact that every grocery store on the planet has enough pre-mixed concoctions to drown every puppy that has ever lived on the planet of earth. Now, while I don’t need to belabor the point that most of these mixes are disgusting and filled with chemicals that are only needed because they’re using such terrible quality ingredients to begin with. Your margaritas don’t need to last through a nuclear winter. They just need to last you through the weekend. If that. \n\nOver at the [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/30/the-best-margarita-mixes_n_1459430.html), they make the argument that the only reason that you need to purchase a mix, is if you’re making a HUGE amount of these bad boys, for a party or whatever, and thus don’t feel like squeezing limes all day like a field hand. \n\nWhile I appreciate that this scenario might happen every now and then, and might happen every day at mexican restaurants around the world, how many times has it happened at **your** fucking house? I bet the answer can be counted on an amputee's hand. You have no reason to make 14 margaritas in one setting. Unless you’re... well, I guess unless you actually ARE Archer, in which case, you wouldn’t be making them anyway. You’d be having your valet make them, and he’d be squeezing every single margarita by hand from nothing but Boca Chita Key Limes.\n\nThere are only 5 things that need to be in your \n\n**MARGARITA**\n\n * 1.5 oz (45 ml) Tequila \n * .5 oz (15 ml) Cointreau (orange liqueur) \n * 1 oz (30 ml) Fresh squeezed lime juice\n * Large ice cubes\n * Kosher Salt for the rim of the glass\n\nPour some salt onto a small dish. Cut a lime in half, use one half to moisten the rim of your glass, then dip the rim in your salt. Juice the lime. One lime (depending on size) should get you a tad more than an ounce of juice. Pour lime juice, Cointreau, and tequila in a cocktail shaker, with ice. Shake vigorously. Pour over ice into your pre-salted glass. Garnish with a lime wedge if desired. (Hint: you desire it).\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**ALTERNATE**: Drink Irish Cream out of the bottle. \n\n**FOOD SUGGESTION**: Honestly, are you asking this? Seriously? \n\nIt’s a burger.\n\nIf you want to have a little cookout, and make your own, [this is a pretty solid direction.](http://www.shape.com/dinner/gorgonzola-burgers-cucumber-yogurt-sauce)\n",

    "body": "So I happened to be kegging a NEIPA (which I don't brew often) a week or so after reading the [Brulosophy article](http://brulosophy.com/2019/02/11/post-fermentation-oxidation-the-impact-adding-sodium-metabisulfite-at-packaging-has-on-beer-exbeeriment-results/) about using Sodium Metabisulfite to reduce oxidation while packaging. A lot of conversation in the comments was about how this technique would help bottlers, especially with oxygen sensitive styles like NEIPA. I felt it was the perfect time for a mini Xmbt so I bottled 2 bottles as I was kegging. Both were bottle primed and both were bottled with deliberately bad practice after I put the beer in a keg (before force carbing) so I knew there was oxygen exposure. In one bottle I added a pinch of SMB and priming sugar while the other only got sugar. I'll throw [these pictures](https://imgur.com/oQPFz4v) up front. These beers were bottled on 2-20-2019 and left room temp until I fridged them yesterday then cracked open tonight. The SMB beer was noticeably lighter colored and retained all the flavor I remember from the kegged version. Strangely, the non-SMB bottle was pretty good too. It definitely lost a lot over this time, but it didn't taste disgusting, just muted. Maybe something about [my recipe](https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/656294/frostcapped-citrus) was particularly suited to aging, or maybe I didn't give it enough time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst disclaimer: my scale isn't sensitive enough to properly measure out the SMB for a single bottle. I used a decent pinch. Reading the comments when Brulosophy posted their XMBT the worst that would happen is extra sulfur flavor. I must have hit a sweet spot because I don't get any extra sulfur from my SMB bottle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond disclaimer: I obviously have not way to directly compare the flavor of this bottle to how it was fresh from the keg. Right now I would swear it's just as good as it ever was from the keg. To be fair I've had several glasses of my Tripel and now this beer which isn't low ABV so I can't trust my opinions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would absolutely recommend that anyone bottling, especially oxygen sensitive styles, add some SMB to the bottling bucket. I would say that my small XBMT was a great success. I rarely bottle, but I'll probably add a bit of SMB into each when I do.",

I brew a lot of smaller batches - typically 2 gallons - and while I can keg those, bottles are the only real choice for a 1 gallon batch. \n\nFor hoppy beers, I ferment as normal, adding dry hops during peak fermentation. Post fermentation, I let yeast / hop matter settle with no cold crash (unless it's with some sort of CO2 capture system). On bottling day, I line up my sanitized bottles (despite the old \"don't fear the foam\" adage, I do like shake as much residual Star San as I can from the bottle. Star San foam is full of oxygen, and I do not want that in my beer) and add 1 Domino Dot sugar cube and a pinch of SMB to each bottle. Using a well sealed autosiphon, I siphon directly from the fermenter into the bottle, filling each bottle to the lip. After carbonation, I store the bottles in the fridge.\n\nThis method results in some pretty high losses - I'm usually looking at only 6 or 7 bottles for a 1 gallon batch, which may be too few for most people to even consider. \n\nMy last batch was a kitchen sink sort of IPA, as I just grabbed some hops that are taking up space in my freezer. A month after bottling, it seems to be holding up well. I can't compare it to a fresh-kegged version, and I'm sure that the best case scenario of this beer is brighter and more aromatic. But it's as good as any hoppy beer I've bottled. I saw the same results with a Zythos SMaSH bottled before kitchen sink IPA.",

Previously reviewed in a prior post about trying Muji travel size skincare. Milky texture. Its drying and smells like citrus due to the essential oil. WNR. Feels drying on my skin. Maybe someone with oily skin would like it more.\n\nIngredients: Water, 1, 3-propanediol, fine titanium oxide, talc, dimethicone, concentrated glycerin, sugar squalane, 2-pentanediol, lipophilic glyceryl stearate, behenyl alcohol, PEG stearate, POE (20) sorbitan oleate, PEG (80), lavender extract-1, chamomilla extract-1, calendula officinalis extract, tangerine peel extract, kiwi extract, oleoyl phytosphingosine, alanine, Arginine, sodium L-glutamate, serine, proline, sodium hyaluronate-2, dipentaerythrityl hexaoxystearate, POP methyl glucoside, BG, ethylhexyl glycerin, beeswax, polyhydroxystearic acid, isostearic acid, aluminum hydroxide, hydrated silicic acid, potassium hydroxide, xanthan gum, starch-sodium acrylate graft polymer, sodium alginate, citric acid, sodium citrate, natural vitamin E, fragrance\n\n**2. Rohto Mentholatum - Hada Labo Koi-Gokujyun Perfect Gel.** Travel size that I got at a random convenience store while in Japan. Soft gel-like texture. Good in humid weather. Not moisturizing enough for my dry skin. Its a decent moisturizer for me in the daytime in the summer. WNR. Again, maybe someone with oily skin may benefit more from this gel.\n\nIngreditents: Water, BG, glycerin, hydroxyethyl urea, pentylene glycol, PPG-10 methyl glucose, triethyl hexanoin, squalane, (acryloyl dimethyl taurine ammonium / VP) copolymer, behenyl alcohol, acetyl hyaluronic acid Na (super hyaluronic acid), hyaluronic acid Na, hydrolysed hyaluronic acid (nano-ized hyaluronic acid), hyaluronic acid hydroxypropyl trimonium (skin-adsorbed hyaluronic acid), hydrolyzed collagen, glucosylceramide (ceramide), suizenzino-polysaccharide (Sakuran), dimethicone, PPG-17 butes -17, triethyl citrate, cyclopentasiloxane, phenoxyethanol, succinic acid 2Na, dimethicone crosspolymer, agarten, EDTA-2Na, succinic acid, α-glucan, acrylate copolymer ammonium , Methyl paraben\n\n**3. Kansosan Medical Highly Moisturizing Cream.** A buttery and moisturizing cream. While shopping at Donki, I googled what is the best Japanese cream for dry and sensitive skin and Kansosan was suggested so I bought it to try. \n\nIts fantastic on my dry skin. It sinks in upon application but also coats my skin with a layer of moisturizing protection. Ive been using it for 2 days now and all I can think about is how amazing this would be for winters. Im gonna stock up when I go back to Japan. I think I found my holy grail moisturizer. I need to try other products from this brand. \n\nThis cream is like the better formulated version of the Kikumasamune sake cream and the Purito Dermide sleeping pack. Plus Kansosan doesnt smell bad. People who enjoy thick moisturizers like the Illiyoon and Aestura would like this cream.\n\nIngredients: Heparin-like substance\\*, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizinate\\*, Purified Water, Glycerin, Methylphenyl Polysiloxane, Cross-linked Methyl Polysiloxane, Decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, 1,3-Butanediol, Methyl Polysiloxane, Polyethylene Glycol-Methyl Polysiloxane Copolymer, 2-Ethylhexyl Dodecanol, 1,2-Pentanediol, Poly(Oxyethylene-Oxypropylene) Methyl Polysiloxane Copolymer, Isostearic Acid Hardened Oil, Anhydrous Magnesium Sulfate, α-Olefin Oligomer, Sodium Citrate, Glycerol Mono-2-Ethylhexyl Ether, Sodium Metabisulfite, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Citric Acid, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, dl-Alpha Tocopheryl Sodium Phosphate, Vaseline, Glycosyl Squalane, L-Arginine, Hydrogenated Soybean Phospholipid, Plant Sterols, N-Hydroxysuccinimide, Water Soluble Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Polyethylene Glycol Octyl Dodecyl Ether, Plant Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate (2), \n\n\\*denotes \"Active Ingredient\", no symbol denotes \"Other Ingredients\"  \n",

    "body": "Hello folks! So my Physicians Formula booster and Olay Luminous booster came in the mail today!\n\nI'm just really excited to share because I searched HIGH AND LOW for affordable niacinamide products that have a high % of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLINK TO MY PICTURES:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/7ab5NZ8](https://imgur.com/a/7ab5NZ8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe PF I have not used before. But it's the FIRST affordable product that I came across that has high % of niacinamide AND  Acetyl glucosamine ---- not just those, but a small amount of supposedly the most powerful vitamin c derivative!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Niacinamide and NAG work synergistically together](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/n-acetyl-glucosamine-nag) to be a brightening powerhouse as well as repairing your skin barrier. They help boost your ceramide production and NAG is skin-identical.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**PHYSICIANS FORMULA SKIN BOOSTER - BRIGHTENING**](https://www.target.com/p/physicians-formula-skin-booster-vitamin-shot-brightening-1-fl-oz/-/A-75569193)  **$7.99/1 oz or 30ml**\n\n*Water, Butylene Glycol,* ***Niacinamide***\\*, Glycerin,\\* ***Acetyl Glucosamine***\\*, Pentylene Glycol, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Disodium Edta, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Phenylethyl Resorcinol, Caesalpinia Spinosa Fruit Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Sodium Benzotriazolyl Butylphenol Sulfonate,\\* ***3-0-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid***\\*, Iron Oxides (Ci 77492), Tocopheryl Acetate, Phenoxyethanol, Vegetable Collagen, Agar, Calcium Alginate, Xanthan Gum, Kappaphycus Alvarezii Extract, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tropolone, Gluconolactone, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cynara Scolymus (Artichoke) Leaf Extract, Red 30 (Ci 73360), Sodium Benzoate.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like it's an \"inspired\" product of [**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**](https://www.paulaschoice.com/10pct-niacinamide-booster/798.html)**:**\n\n*Water (Aqua),* ***Niacinamide*** *(vitamin B3, skin-restoring ),* ***Acetyl Glucosamine*** *(skin replenishing/antioxidant),* ***Ascorbyl Glucoside*** *(vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative).*\n\nThe Paula's Choice obviously has more beneficial ingredients and higher % but still, it's **$44 for 0.67oz/20ml**. But if you have the money for it, go for it!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The OLAY Luminous Miracle Boost Concentrate  $33.49/1 oz or 30ml on** [**olay.com**](https://www.olay.com/en-us/skin-care-products/olay-luminous-miracle-boost-concentrate-face-booster)**, and  $15.59** [**@ Target.**](https://www.target.com/p/olay-luminous-miracle-boost-concentrate-1-0-oz/-/A-51169830)\n\n*Water, Cyclopentasiloxane,* ***Niacinamide***\\*, Hexyldecanol, Pentylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Xylitol, Nylon-12, Panthenol,\\* ***Ascorbyl Glucoside***\\*,\\* *Tocopheryl Acetate,* ***Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine***\\*, Zinc Gluconate, Magnesium Aspartate, Inositol, Phytosteryl/Octyldodecyl Lauroyl Glutamate, Polysorbate 20, Boron Nitride, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethanol, Peg-11 Methyl Ether Dimethicone, Polyacrylamide, Benzyl Alcohol, Aminomethyl Propanol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Disodium Edta, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Benzoate, Laureth-7, Fragrance, Copper Gluconate, Mica, Red 40.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Niacinamide works great together with undecylenoyl phenylalanine, or sepiwhite MSH (developer brand name) to be very brightening together.](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/sepiwhite-msh) Sepiwhite is not well-known and very rare to find in commercial products (besides Olay I mean). Probably because Olay developed it. But it works great on its own as a brightener, and even better combined with vitamin c (which is why you see ascorbyl glucoside here, a stable derivative of ascorbic acid). The miracle boost USED to contain n-acetyl glucosamine (which is the one I used) as well the other ones listed here. But I guess it got too expensive or whatever.\n\nThis also has some other great ingredients, like xylitol, gylcerin, panthenol, zinc and copper gluconate for soothing and healing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used this booster in conjunction with the Luminous cream, which has niacinamide and NAG. My skin looked so much brighter and prettier. The texture was really smoothed out and my skin started getting a more like.. translucent ?? quality? You DO need to give brightening ingredients *at least 3 months* to work their magic though, especially for things like arbutin/hydroquinone. (Arbutin breaks down into hydroquinone.) But for niacinamide, I saw results for skin texture/overall brightening before that.\n\nI honestly couldn't believe the price Target was selling it for, because I got it for a much higher price elsewhere before. I couldn't keep affording it so I let it go, sadly. :'(\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe [**Luminous Tone Perfecting Treatment ($24.99)**](https://www.olay.com/en-us/skin-care-products/regenerist-luminous-tone-perfecting-treatment) is a simpler formula, but still has the same active ingredients.\n\n*Water,* ***Niacinamide\\*****, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Dimethicone,* ***Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine***\\*, Silica, Boron Nitride,\\* ***Ascorbyl Glucoside***\\*, Polyglyceryl-2 Oleate, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Dimethiconol, Aminomethyl Propanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Oleate, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, \\*Vitamin B3\\*\n\nBut ironically, it costs more than the more complex booster if you purchase at Target online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DIY:**\n\nI have made DIY niacinamide NAG serums before. But because I'm too lazy to make it properly, they really lack penetration power. I'm really into cosmetic science and have read from professional cosmetic chemists that a simple DIY isn't effective if you don't do it right. You gotta keep the powders dissolved right and STAY dissolved instead of them recrystallizing on your skin and not penetrating your skin/being useless. I experimented for months with the DIY but I DEFINITELY noticed a difference as soon as I started using well-formulated, commercially available niacinamide serums.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy personal experience with certain products:\n\n\\- [**Eva Naturals 5% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-Niacinamide-Serum-Eva-Naturals/dp/B0147PDMYY/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=eva+naturals+niacinamide&amp;qid=1561763684&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3)**:** Pretty awesome, works well, you get 2 oz. But it has avocado oil and such, and may break some people out. (This is definitely a private-label product and you can find the same exact formula for cheaper on DIY sites - which is why you see like 324982394 bottles of the same formula of everything from niacinamide to vitamin c serums on amazon.) I get the same sort of overall brightening and translucency I get with Olay. Better results with my other products, Benton 0.5% salicylic acid (very gentle) aloe BHA toner, Purito green level centella buffet serum (also has niacinamide, like 2%), and Naturie Hatomugi gel essence. Bright, translucent skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Cerave PM:** Supposedly has 4% niacinamide. Loved this as a lightweight moisturizer, but did NOT see the results I got with other niacinamide products. Makes me feel skeptical. Or perhaps there's a pretty big difference for my skin with 4% and 5%. I doubt it, but you know. Maybe it's just cuz it's formulated for skin-replenishing and not for brightening. But you'd think same ingredient will have same effects, y'know?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.skinlex.com/product/10-niacinamide-serum-60ml/)**:** Ingredient list looks GREAT and some others seem to love it, but I saw absolutely zero niacinamide benefits for my skin. Penetration issue?\n\nI have other products I've used with niacinamide, but these are the main ones I can remember on the top of my head. La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ baume has it as well, but I do not know the %. Very good moisturizer for the body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther commercial products you can find SEPIWHITE in:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Black Opal skin care products**](https://blackopalbeauty.com/collections/skincare): They have multiple.

I'm used to it now though and have a completely unfragranced routine. If you're accustomed to fragranced products I think you'll definitely find this unbearably unpleasant.\n\nI will say the texture itself is quite pleasant. It's got a silky smooth texture that spreads easily. You don't need a lot which is good but I'm definitely using it up more quickly than I was expecting.\n\nI'll probably stick with it for 3 months to see if there's any improvement but at the moment I'm seeing a small improvement in overall skin tone but not much improvement on sun spots that I wanted this product to fade.

Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid. Shelf life is no indication of the stability of actives and doesn't say anything about it's stability on skin. Ascorbic acid is simply notoriously unstable, it's more likely to degrade on skin and be irritating.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water. The key here is to make it fresh every 1-3 days I guess.\n  * [€5.80/20g TO Powder](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g?redir=1)\n  * [€89 /20mL Philosophy Turbo C booster](https://www.sephora.com/product/turbo-booster-c-powder-P204606)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Anhydrous formulas**: best stability, but not much research on penetration\n\n* [€9.60/50mL - The Ordinary C23](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)\n  * **Pros:** Cheap, anhydrous (stable), together with TO Ferulic+Resveratrol a very affordable good combo\n  * **Cons:** No other actives,  no vitamin E, relatively unpleasant texture, stinging, for me too thick/greasy for daytime use.

It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

I plan to reference this post as a link and hope it can help others learn to make enjoyable mead while lowering the learning curve and clearing up common questions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaking Mead\n\nA beginner’s guide to my approach\n\nBy Kevin Miller\n\n4/15/2020\n\nMaking Mead should be easy. Maybe not simple, but not difficult. Like all crafts, true mead making artisans pour their energy into creating the best product they can. And because of this, the process can be very complex, time consuming, involved, and tedious. But it doesn’t have to be.\n\nWhat is mead (in simple terms)?\n\nMead is an alcoholic drink made from water and honey. And the best part is, it can be that easy. Honey naturally contains bacteria that will ferment it when dissolved in water. It will ferment itself and doesn’t even need to be heated. Easy right?\n\nHow complicated is mead?\n\nMead is a wine with a very delicate flavor and aroma that can be tailored as much as grape wine. It can be aged, be given realistically any additive like spices, oak aging, yeast nutritional supplements, acids, tannins, even special strains of bacteria.  It can be carbonated, and can be improved through several years of aging. Mead can be as complicated and complex as any other wine. \n\nSo how much work is worth a beginner’s time?\n\nObviously this question’s answer will differ from person to person. One must decide for themselves how much time, focus, and money they are willing or able to dedicate to the craft. But with that said, plain honey and water isn’t very enjoyable to drink; there are some things that really need to be done to create a great beverage. \n\nVery bare essentials:\n\nWater - clean, dechlorinated\n\nHoney - any kind\n\nYeast - preferably a mead, wine, cider, ale, or lager yeast\n\nYeast nutrition - we’ll come back to this\n\nA container - Carboy, jug, demijohn, bucket\n\nSome basic brewing equipment\n\nAgain, there can be so much more involved in the process but I have around 20 batches of mead (of all sizes half to 5 gallon) with this list.\n\nLet’s tear into the details of what you’ll need to begin!\n\nWater.\n\nThere are books, even college degrees on the subject. If you want to get serious about the craft you will eventually need to learn more about your water. It’s source, it’s contents, how to get the best water and what to do with it. To begin with, however, you can simply use store bought spring water or boil the water the day before to sterilize it and evaporate the chlorine and chloramine. I’ve had good results with both. Store bought is my recommendation because you can get a fairly consistent product for cheap. If you go this route, stay with the same brand so you can learn how to tailor your recipe to the water’s characteristics.\n\nHoney.\n\nOh boy! This is a fun one! Honey suppliers, bee keepers, bee keeping supply stores, grocery stores. The reality of honey is that it’s never consistent and the smaller the supplier is, the more variation there will be from batch to batch. And one flavor or style or supplier may not be always available. Don’t worry too much about that, but know that if you buy specialty honey, you may not be able to get it again.\n\nWhat type of honey is the best?\n\nI can’t tell you what honey you’ll like best, but I can say that almost any honey is good enough to use. In the beginning, avoid using only one light bodied honey because, if there isn’t any flavor to begin with, the brewing fairies aren’t just going to add it to your mead while it’s fermenting. For a solid start, I recommend mixing half clover and half wildflower for a medium body and slightly buttery flavor.\n\nHow much should you pay?\n\nUntil you have made several successful batches, pay as little as possible. Buy in bulk to save money if you are able. Consider places like Costco, Walmart, Smart and Final for the best prices. Honey doesn’t go bad as it naturally seals spoiling bacteria so buy enough for a few batches. You’ll use it. For a quick starting guide you will want around 2 lbs per gallon of semi-strong mead (10%) 3 lbs per gallon for strong mead (15%)\n\nYeast!\n\nThis is another topic that can become a whole education. The yeast’s life cycle starts with coming out of hibernation once they’ve been rehydrated. First they shit themselves, then they have an orgy, replicate, and die. Each subsequent generation will feed on the old dead yeast as well as the simple sugars in the mead, excreting esters (flavors), CO2, and ethanol as they go. As the mead becomes more alcoholic, it also becomes more toxic to the yeast. When the mead reaches this point they clean up their mess and begin to go dormant.\n\nThe simple facts are that yeast are living bacteria. They live in the air, on every surface, and all over you. They also exist in the honey you’re using. But, not all “wild yeast” make a tasty mead. Some folks don’t pitch yeast, they just let mother nature take over. This is risky but can lead to some really fun brews because every strain will impart their own flavor and ferment at different speeds and at different temperatures.\n\nHere’s my advice: buy quality yeast (not baking yeast-it tastes terrible in wine). Buy a few different types and play with it as you learn. My favorite brand of wine yeast are Lalvin and Redstar. I mostly use Red Star Premier Blanc since it ferments nicely at room temperature. I also like their Cote des Blanc. Most people start with Lalvin D47 but it adds flavors I don’t prefer (yeah, yeast adds flavor. More than you’d guess!) I do like the K1-V116. This is another thing you’ll want to buy extra since you’re not going to only brew once.\n\nMany new brewers will just rip open the yeast and pitch it right in the mead. Don’t be a jerk. Hydrate your yeast first. Usually the instructions are on the back but in essence you want to warm up some water to room temp and stir in the yeast. Cover it loosely with plastic wrap and put it out of any light. Do this before you start making your mead and it should be ready by the time everything’s mixed up.\n\nYeast Nutrients?\n\nRemember how I said that yeast are living organisms? Well, that means they need food and vitamins, even air, to thrive just like everything else. You can buy lots of products to keep your yeast healthy. “Fermaid K” and DAP are big ones that can be purchased at a local home brew shop or online. Ferm k is basically vitamins and yeast hulls (that’s right, feed them dead bodies) and DAP (diamonium phosphate). Those products aren’t absolutely necessary but they will keep the yeast healthier and improve the flavors that the yeast give off. Stressed yeast produces bad flavors. \n\nIf you’re on a tight budget, you can add a small handful of raisins and some acidic fruit like orange or lemon (juice and skin). Just be sure to wash and sanitize the fruit before adding. Keep in mind that natural ingredients like these will add to the flavor for better or for worse.\n\nContainers…\n\nThere are as many options as there are people who like mead. The easiest way to start is with clean, new, plastic buckets. They should be food safe HDPE (high density polyethylene) and can be found a home depot, grocery outlets, and you local brew shop. I don’t recommend them because they are easy to scratch and bacteria can and will hide in the scratches. All of my plastic gear gets VERY thoroughly washed with a microfiber cloth but I try not to use it if I can avoid it.\n\nA good cheap place to start is by buying a gallon jug of cheap wine. Drink it, cook with it, pour it out, whatever. Make sangria and share with cute girls. You can usually get them for around $10 and you get some wine with it :)  Realistically, you’re going to end up with just over a half gallon of mead if you start with a gallon container. But, the perks to these are that they’re easy to clean, you can see the fermentation action, you can easily find bungs and airlocks for them. As soon as you think you’re going to make bigger batches, you’ll want to upgrade to glass carboys. They are the thick glass 3 or 5 gallon containers that most home brewers use. Carboys are a standard size and you can find accessories like bags, straps, and handles that make them easier to carry.\n\nI’ve used all of the above and more. You can ferment in anything, so find whatever fits your budget and needs. If you want to go with single gallon containers you might even know someone with one or two laying around. Whatever you pick, buy at least two so you can rack your mead. I’ll explain later.\n\nBASIC BREWING EQUIPMENT\n\nOk, there are lots of ways to do this. Here’s what I use:\n\n* Sanitizer (I prefer Star San)\n* Racking Cane and vinyl tubing\n* Bungs (it’s nice to have extra)\n   * One gallon jugs use either #6 or #6 ½ \n* Air locks (I prefer the three piece style)\n* Hydrometer (for measuring sugar levels and ABV%)\n* Big ass spoon\n* Food scale\n* Big bottle brush\n* Bottles (swing tops are the best for beginners\n* Cleaning buckets\n* Funnel\n\nReady to know how to brew?\n\nBefore you start brewing you need to know something. Most of brewing is cleaning. Seriously. Like 90%\n\nNow pay attention: Washing is not the same as sanitizing. Read that sentence again.\n\nWashing is done with hot water and dish soap. It is the process of manually removing oils and solids. Washing always happens first. Sanitizing is the process of chemically neutralizing any living bacteria that could cause spoilage. Sanitizer can only reach the outside of anything and soaking a mold colony in sanitizer will not kill it. That’s why we wash first. Home brewers usually use acid sanitizers like Star San that can be left on the equipment without affecting the flavor of the mead. Professional wineries use sulfites to sanitize but that must be rinsed off and requires some knowledge of chemistry. Also, sulfites can kill yeast.\n\nI always start my brew day with lots of cleaning. Grab a drink, crank the tunes, wipe everything down, sweep the floors, clean and sanitize the ALL equipment and you’re good to start. When you are finished brewing, it is good practice to clean equipment before putting it away. I also sanitize mine before putting it away because you can’t be too careful.\n\nNow the fun part, brewing! First, rehydrate your yeast. Then, mix your honey and water together with your big ass spoon, take a gravity reading, and add any additions. Then, put it in the fermentation container and shake for eight to ten minutes. Pitch the yeast and add a sanitized airlock filled with sanitizer. Store it in a closet on top of a towel and also covered with a towel. Add nutrients according to the directions. \n\nThat’s it!\n\nOkay so that’s pretty simple right? But here are some tips:\n\n1. Put down towels. Keep extra towels at the ready.\n2. Remember, the container will have to hold the yeast, the honey, and the water. You’re probably not gonna nail this the first time and you may even occasionally forget to leave room for the yeast. To help yourself out, draw a fill line on the container’s outside with a sharpie around 75% full. You can fill to that line, then add your hydrated yeast and have enough room for fruit and the bubbling that happens during fermentation.\n   1. I like to do two batches at once to make it worth my time!\n3. Fill a bucket with sanitizer and use it all day while brewing. At the end of the day, use it to fill a spray bottle. Sanitizer keeps for a long time and you will want it down the road, trust me.\n4. When buying a hydrometer, look for one that’s easy to read. The ones designed for beer are good.\n5. You can warm the honey to make it easier to mix but don’t exceed 110f or it will kill off the beneficial bacteria. Also, yeast can only tolerate a tight range of temperatures. Check the yeast before heating and keep below the max.\n6. Shaking a gallon of mead for eight minutes sucks, but shaking five gallons is much harder. I bought an aquarium pump and stainless steel air stone to aerate the mead. It’s great. If you don’t want to buy one then you can place the container on a towel and rock it back and forth. If you rock or shake it, plug that thing up so it doesn’t spill out. And be careful when you take the bung out, there will be pressure inside.\n7. Bungs! Since we’re on the topic, you’re going to want some bungs. I’d recommend buying bungs with holes for an airlock and a small bung pin that can fit inside that hole. Otherwise you will need solid bungs as well. Best to buy extra! If you are using one gallon jugs, buy both #6 and #6 ½ because each just is a little different. If you use carboys, the manufacturer can tell you the bung size.\n8. When you are storing the mead, keep it out of sight and out of harm’s way. You don’t want it to be moved around or exposed to light.\n9. Your mead will likely take three to four weeks to ferment. You can tell when it’s done when the airlock burps only once per minute. Alternatively, you can pull a sample and check it with your hydrometer. Honey is totally fermentable so you can achieve a final gravity reading of 1.000 (I’ve gotten as low as 0.997).\n\nWhat’s a hydrometer (and what is gravity)? A hydrometer is a long glass tube that measures the density of sugar in a liquid and gives you a “gravity” reading when dropped into a cylinder. The ABV is calculated from the difference of the Final Gravity (FG) and Original Gravity (OG). Any reading is also considered a specific gravity (SG) and is recorded in points measured to thousands. What the heck does that all mean? Well, if you measure clean water without any sugar it should give a reading of 1.000, if you add a pound of honey to a gallon of water, you should have added somewhere around 35 points (or 35 thousandths) and get a reading of 1.035 (which would give you about 4.59% ABV)\n\nSo when can you drink it??? Literally whenever you want. But it’s not gonna taste good right away. Lots of things happen to the mead over time. Once fermentation is done, it should be moved to another container with a racking cane (a two part siphon that won’t transfer all the gunk at the bottom) and a vinyl hose to a sanitized container. It can sit there indefinitely. The higher the alcohol, the longer you should wait. At 10% the flavor will begin to mellow at three months and continue to improve for the next four years. Good luck. Once it goes into the second container you can stop the yeast completely with a sulfite addition. More on that later. I would let it sit in the second container for at least a month before bottling.\n\nBottling!\n\nOkay, you’ve made it this far, congratulations! I hope you don’t feel too bogged down with all this info. The good news is that it doesn’t get much more complex unless you want it to. So you want to bottle this stuff and share it with your fellow vikings?! \n\nBottling bucket:\n\nThis is the few places that I like to use plastic containers. Home brew stores sell bottling buckets that are great for this. If you buy one, don’t use it for anything else and always clean it before and after with a microfiber cloth to keep from scratching it. Transfer your mead in with a racking cane or siphon and let it rest at least half an hour before bottling.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, Swing tops are really the best option for small batches. I have a capper and a corker and I still use swing tops for batches under five gallons. \n\nI recommend buying a case of EZ Cap swing top bottles but there’s nothing wrong with collecting bottles from friends or buying beers and sodas that come in a swing top and reusing them. I’ve done both, both work, but EZ Cap bottles are thicker and will last longer. Yes glass gets chipped, sometimes they explode.\n\nJust like brewing equipment, bottles need to be washed well, scrubbed with a brush, and sanitized. I have a bottle tree for drying and it’s well worth the money. Alternatively you can use a sterilized dishwasher to dry sanitized bottles. Now that you’re a home brewer you will want to reuse bottles. TAKE MY ADVICE, rinse or wash bottles as soon as they’re empty. You don’t want to fill a bottle up just to find a clump of mold at the bottom that the scrubber missed. When I finish a bottle I give it 3 good rinses before I leave it on the counter. And I try to make sure it makes it into the washer that night.\n\nSo fill your bottles with pride knowing they are clean and free of contaminants! But don’t fill them to the brim! Leave half the neck for head-space. Also, if there is any sugar left in the mead, know that it will continue fermenting and become carbonated. I’ve had bottles explode. It’s a mess you don’t want to deal with. If you want to carbonate your mead we can talk about that but it’s not easy to do safely. I recommend getting the basics down first.\n\nTIP! I have found I can usually fill ten 12oz bottles per gallon (1 gallon = 128 oz)\n\nI know that was a lot to read, but hey, you did it!! Don’t stop your research here. Go brew a couple batches and continue learning while they ferment!\n\nNow I’ll leave you with my favorite recipe:\n\nKevin’s Spiced Mead (not an official name)\n\nIngredients\n\n* 1 lb Clover Honey\n* 1 lb Wildflower Honey\n* 1 Gallon clean water\n* 1 pack Côte Des blancs yeast\n* 1 lemons, squeezed and zested\n* 1 Tbsp coriander\n* 1 tsp peppercorn\n* 1 tsp whole cloves or ½ tsp ground cloves\n\nOptional\n\n* 6-8 oz any honey\n* 0.32 grams KMBS (Potassium metabisulfite) or ground up campden tablet\n\nSteps\n\n1. Start Yeast 30 minutes early!\n2. Boil 1 cup of water and remove from heat. Add coriander, peppercorns, cloves and steep for 3-5 minutes.\n3. Mix 1 lb of each honey, lemon, spices and water\n4. Aerate and add yeast\n5. Ferment to SG of 1.000\n6. Rack into a clean and sanitized secondary container\n7. Age for 2 months\n\nThe mead is dry but drinkable at this point but most meads can benefit from aging one to four years (sometimes more). Most people prefer a little sweetness in their mead but because all of the sugars in honey are completely fermentable, you can't just add sugar without the yeast starting back up. Adding more sugar after the fermentation is called \"back sweetening\" and can be tricky.  If you want to sweeten it up, there are a few ways to do it.\n\n1. Cold crashing\n2. Filtering\n3. Pasteurization\n4. Chemical additions\n\nCold crashing a mead is a process of bringing it to near freezing temperatures and allowing the yeast to fall out of suspension, then racking the mead off the yeast. This approach takes several iterations and is not fool proof as any yeast left behind can restart fermentation. Use this for meads that will be served very soon and not stored.\n\nFiltering is the use of 1-5 micro filter. This can be done in conjunction with cold crashing to effectively remove the yeast but will require time and some extra equipment.\n\nPasteurization is the process of killing the yeast by bringing the mead to 140 Fahrenheit and holding it there for at least 20 minutes. This can be done in a kettle or after the mead is boiled. There is some danger to boiling bottles as they can explode if there is already pressure in the bottle. Use great care with this method.\n\nChemical additions are the easiest and safest method in my opinion. Typically, potassium sorbate and potassium metabisulfite (KMBS) are the chemicals of choice for stopping bacterial growth in wine. You can use commercially available products like campden tablets or easily buy powdered chemicals. KMBS is the wine industry's standard but sodium metabisulfite can work just as well. Aim for a target of 1/2 tsp sorbate and 492 mg KMBS (75 ppm) per gallon to stop yeast dead. Your wine will need to sit for about 2 months to allow the chemicals to degrade so as to not be tasted. Extensive research has gone into the saftey of these chemicals and have been approved for use up to 350 ppm and are detectable by taste at 100 ppm.\n\nSteps to stop fermentation and backsweeten:\n\n1. Add sorbate, and KMBS or ground campden tablet to a clean and sanitized third container\n2. Add extra honey (there is some math and personal flavor involved here but I aim for a FG of 1.015 - 1.010 usually)\n3. Age for at least one month to mellow\n4. Bottle or serve\n\nHopefully your head isn't spinning with all this info and very dense ending. Please reach out if you have questions about my writing and keep learning about your craft.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck!\n\nSKÅL",

Even though I followed their method exactly minus the copper chiller I'm sure I did everything wrong. In my opinion this beer tastes like SMB and it's entirely undrinkable.

        "body": "Disclaimer: I have not tried the LoDO process, though I have read the document and would be interested in giving it a try some time.\n\nProbably going to catch some flack for this, but here we go.\n\nThis is the second of this type of post that I've seen where someone attempted LoDO, but \"cut corners\" and is posting about their negligible results.  All throughout the paper on LoDO there are warnings that even the slightest bit of dissolved oxygen ruins the process.  Brewing in this manner is VERY dependent on adherence to the guidelines put forth in the document.  Then, in posts here there will always be some note along the lines of \"I didn't follow the process exactly, buuuut....\"  In this instance, the paper specifically warns against using copper chillers, as they will alter the results.  You used a copper chiller and had shitty results.  Does that make the process inherently bad?  Absolutely not.\n\nFor a brewing methodology which is so dependent on the process, it seems incredibly rude to draw conclusions about LoDO when the process hasn't explicitly been followed.",

Basically any lotions that are manufactured here in the SEA has a different formula now. \n\nI was quite devastated at first as I have been a loyal consumer of the Premium Shirojyun Whitening Rich Lotion for 5 years. After the news got out, I found myself a way to get the ones with the OG formula, since they are still manufactured with the same formula from other countries outside of SEA(mainly china or japan).\n\nThe hada labo Mild Peeling Lotion which used to have a very minimal ingredient, now has a long list of them. It did amazing for my dry dull sensitive skin as the exfoliating ingredients were only a PHA and tranexamic acid. And knowing that they changed the formula is breaking my heart. I also found a post in this sub somewhere saying that this particular lotion(or rather the whole range, im not sure) is only being sold in SEA, which means they do not sell it anywhere else? I hope this is not true. \n\nDoes anyone know a dupe to this? I basically in need a toner with PHA and brightening ingredients. I’m not a fond of BHA since I found it could be a bit too drying on my skin. I will list out the ingredients before and after they changed it for the Mild Peeling Lotion.\n\nbefore: \nWater, Gluconic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Tranexamic Acid, Polyquaternium-51, Sodium Metabisulfite, Phenoxyethanol\n\nafter:\nWater, Niacinamide, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Butylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Fomes Officinalis (Mushroom)\nExtract, Triethanolamine, Salicylic Acid, PEG-12\nDimethicone, Chlorphenesin, Amylopectin, Glycolic Acid, Lactobionic Acid, Hydroxyethy|piperazine Ethane Sulfonic Acid, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Disodium EDTA, Dextrin, Xanthan Gum, Styrene/VP Copolymer, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Urea, Trehalose, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide, Serine, Pentylene Glycol, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydrolyzed Sodium\nHyaluronate, Hydroxyethy|cellulose, Olea Europaea (Olive)\nLeaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Pullulan, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Disodium Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Algin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbic Acid, Potassium Phosphate",

Paula's Choice also has a [20% off antioxidant serums deal currently](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/antioxidants/), which makes it a great time to pick it up if you're interested!\n\n[The product](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/antioxidants/_/RESIST-C15-Super-Booster/).\n\n**Claims**: \n\nRESIST C15 Super Booster is a concentrated, light-as-water liquid treatment product designed to supercharge your Paula's Choice serum, or it may be used alone. A blend of 15% stabilized vitamin C (l-ascorbic acid) at a pH of 3.0, antioxidant vitamin E, ferulic acid, and peptides repairs visible signs of aging and stimulates collagen production for smoother, brighter, and firmer skin. \n\nVitamin C also helps protect skin from environmental damage as it evens your skin tone. You'll see dramatically younger, healthier, and more radiant skin in weeks!\n\n**Who is this product for?**\n\nRESIST C15 Super Booster is for anyone who wants to boost the results from their Paula's Choice serum or who wants to experience the benefits of vitamin C when combined with other proven anti-aging ingredients. The formula is suitable for all skin types and also appropriate for breakout-prone skin.\n\n**Ingredients**: \n\nWater, Ascorbic Acid (vitamin C/antioxidant), Ethoxydiglycol (slip agent/penetration enhancer), PPG-26 Buteth-26 (emulsifier), PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil (thickener), Tocopherol (vitamin E/antioxidant), Ferulic Acid (antioxidant), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin-repairing ingredient), Acetyl Octapeptide-3 (cell-communicating ingredient), Glycerin (skin-repairing ingredient), Panthenol (skin conditioning agent), Sodium Metabisulfite (stabilizer/antioxidant), Triethanolamine (pH adjuster), Phenoxyethanol (preservative).\n\n**My skin type, in detail**: \n\nSensitive, very irritation-prone, dry-combination (dry cheeks, oily t-zone), very small pores, easily congested skin, stubborn acne spots. Responds well to BP spot treatments. Responds well to BHA and anti-inflammatories. Responds well to lactic acid (AHA). Responds okay to glycolic acid (AHA), can be irritating. Responds very poorly to tretinoin (retin-a, renova, adapalene). Many ingredients break me out (cetearyl, cetyl alcohol; natural oils; some fillers/thickeners).\n\n**My current routine as of Dec. 3, 2013**:\n\n* AM - Cleanse with [PC Hydralight Cleanser](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/collections/Hydralight/_/Hydralight-One-Step-Cleanser/)\n* AM - Tone with [PC Hydralight Toner](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/collections/Hydralight/_/Hydralight-Healthy-Skin-Refreshing-Toner/)\n* AM - Pat on 3-5 drops [PC C15 Super Booster](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/antioxidants/_/RESIST-C15-Super-Booster/). Allow to absorb 5-10 minutes.\n* AM - Pat on pea-sized amount of [Elta MD PM Therapy](http://eltamd.com/product/pm-therapy-facial-moisturizer/) if feeling dry.\n* AM - Apply [Skinceuticals Physical Fusion](http://www.skinceuticals.com/_us/_en/category/physical-fusion-uv-defense-spf-50.htm) is going out for extended periods of time (15m or more).\n* PM - Remove makeup or sunscreen with [Albolene](http://www.albolenecleanser.com/) or [Clinique TTDOB](http://www.clinique.com/product/1673/6424/Skincare/Cleansers_Makeup_Removers/Take-The-Day-Off-Cleansing-Balm/index.tmpl). If no makeup or SS, skip step.\n* PM - Proceed with normal AM cleanse/tone routine.\n* PM - Apply 2 drops of C15 to nose, cheekbones, under eyes.\n* PM - Mix 3 drops C15 with 1 squirt of BHA 9. Apply all over trouble areas (forehead, below cheekbones, jaw). Let absorb 10-15 minutes if possible.\n* PM - Pat on pea-sized amount of Elta MD PM.\n* PM - Pat on tiniest amount of Vaseline on driest spots, if needed.\n\n**Other skincare habits and details**:\n\n* I have taken Ortho Tri Cyclen for about 5 years now.\n* My diet isn't anything to write home to mom about. I enjoy fatty foods and red meats. I drink very little soda and consume virtually no sweets. \n* I sleep on a silk pillowcase.\n* I do not wash my pillowcase every night. I'm lucky if I remember to wash it once a week. Gross, I know.\n* I rarely talk on the phone, and when I do, you can bet my phone hasn't been wiped down with alcohol in the past week. Sorry, y'all.  \n\n**Review**:\n\nI have been using this product for roughly 1.5-2 months now. I first picked up a sample with my 2% BHA liquid re-order out of sheer curiosity. I had heard many good things about the product, from people like [Goss](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaKI15KTTes) to [Veronica Gorgeois](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKOvcV6nnM) (who I do really like and feel gives pretty solid skincare advice, if you want an educated YouTuber). The sample is a bit larger than a normal sized perfume sample and lasted me about 7-10 days at 5 drops per day. \n\nAs a background, I have been using NuFountain 10% Vitamin C serum for roughly 6 months (20% was consistently too irritating for my skin and broke me out in tons of angry, red bumps). NuFountain's formula is very light and basic, consisting of essentially water, 10% L-AA (form of vitamin C), and glycerin. It feels a lot like water, but needs to be refrigerated due to the lack of preservatives and the unstable form of vitamin C. \n\nBy comparison, the Paula's Choice serum is a bit thicker than water, but not entirely gel-like. It is also a bit tacky once it is applied to the skin. Since I apply it after toning and before a moisturizer, it hasn't bothered me. It also becomes less tacky over time.\n\nThe packaging is also excellent. It comes in a box with the bottle dropper separate from the bottle itself (which is sealed, obviously). Inside the bottle is a bit of a seal so the product remains air-tight when not in use, which is excellent for an antioxidant serum where the antioxidants can become unstable and/or ineffective if exposed to oxygen too long. \n\nAlso, at $45 USD, this is a great dupe or replacement for the famous [$153 Skinceuticals CE Ferulic](http://www.skinceuticals.com/_us/_en/category/c-e-ferulic.htm) serum.\n\nNow, I cannot compare this product to the Skinceuticals product, since I have not used it myself. However, I can say that I have achieved much better results from this product as opposed to my NuFountain. While I like the NuFountain, it hasn't been a complete game-changer like the PC C15 has been. \n\nWithin my first 3 days of usage of the sample (in place of my NuFountain serum), I noticed I had bouncier, supple, healthier looking skin. My skin also felt a bit more moisturized -- a big deal for a dry skinned lady like myself that can't use a majority of fatty alcohols. \n\nMy glowy skin remained all while I used the product. It also became a bit more even-toned and my acne less inflamed. \n\nEventually, I ran out of the sample and went back to my NuFountain serum. Within 3 days or so, my skin returned to it's less glowy, less refined, drier, and not-quite-as-healthy-looking state. I ordered a bottle of the C15 and began using it as soon as it came in.\n\nWithin 3 days my skin's state while using the sample had returned. Healthy, vibrant, less angry looking. \n\nI'm almost 2 months in of consistent usage and my skin is still very healthy and glowy looking. Definitely a HG product for me. \n\n**Bottom line**: \n\nDo I recommend this? Yes, especially if you are looking for a good C serum without the enormous price tag and are not sensitive to tocopherol (vitamin E). \n\n**Other notes relating to this serum**:\n\n* [Ferulic acid and why you should consider adding it to your skincare routine](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1oovij/ferulic_acid_and_why_you_should_consider_adding/)\n\n---\n\nEdit: Paula's Choice now has a Refer-a-Friend program -- someone refers you, you save $10 on your first purchase. If you're interested in purchasing anything from PC, just contact someone in this sub or myself and we can send you a referral link. This stacks with free shipping offers and offer codes.",

    "body": "Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm\n\nYeesh...this review has been a really hard one to put together. \n\nIn my own head I feel like “If I see one more post proclaiming the amazing power of this product I am going to scream!”\n\nAnd I have totally been part of that group...maybe not so much the overt praise...but the Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm has popped up a number of times on my social media when showing my current evening routine.\n\nAll that being said and even with the overabundance of hype, the thing is...this is a damn good cleansing balm.\n\nFeaturing Apricot Kernel Oil, Camellia Seed Oil, and Papaya Seed Oil...the Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm has a smooth texture and dispenses from the jar without becoming chunky.\n\nOn the skin the product melts down incredibly well and turns into a heavy but manageable oil. I find myself really taking my time to massage the product in and enjoy the slightly fruity scent. This balm breaks through sunscreen (I am not a makeup wearer) very well. \n\nUpon rinsing though, I noticed that this product does take a bit more work to completely remove. This is especially true around the eye area or anywhere there was a heavier layer of product. \n\nIt still emulsifies like other cleansing balms...it just takes a bit more work than I am used to.\n\nBut once it is rinsed the Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm leaves behind a wonderfully soft yet thoroughly cleansed feel to the skin. I’ve also noticed some mild smoothing and texture balancing over time that I don't think I can say any other first step cleanser has provided.\n\nBecause of the lack of synthetic fragrance, PEG (in their most commonly known forms), and essential oils...I can see why this product has been an instant hot item. It plays into everything today’s skincare area is focusing on.\n\nI really think the issues I had with rinsing/removing could have been avoided had Glow Recipe left in some of the more common emulsifying ingredients. That is 100% personal preference, I know you may feel different, which is why I still think this is an excellent product for some.\n\nWhen it comes to an effective cleansing balm that rinses beautifully and leaves my skin feeling soft, non-irritated, and generally looking awesome...the crown still goes to the Then I Met You Living Cleansing Balm.\n\nI adore that product for its lovely/creamy/buttery texture, smooth application, and wonderful scent. Nothing else I have used has quite met the same bar (although several have come really close).\n\nThe Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm is a masterclass in taking what consumers are asking for...and creating something really special and results driven. While I do like nearly everything about it, the Living Cleansing Balm is still where my heart (and my wallet) remain.\n\nFull Ingredients List: Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Sorbitan Oleate, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Polyethylene, Aqua/Water/Eau, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Seed Oil, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Papain, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Ananassa (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Alkanna Tinctoria Root Extract, Capsicum Annuum Fruit Extract, Maltodextrin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Levulinic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Metabisulfite\n\nWhere To Buy (Glow Recipe Site $32.00 USD): [https://www.glowrecipe.com/collections/papaya/products/papaya-sorbet-enzyme-cleansing-balm](https://www.glowrecipe.com/collections/papaya/products/papaya-sorbet-enzyme-cleansing-balm) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/79jphcm9vfi51.jpg?width=5216&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=17013139413be2982c0414b35a019f535fbd0362",

    "body": "I picked this product up quite by accident. I actually meant to grab the regular gold bottle to try but I was super sleep deprived (just flew from NYC to Singapore), forgot which color the regular sunscreen that everyone raves about was, and picked this up instead. I couldn't find many reviews about it so I thought I'd do my part and leave one because I ended up really liking this product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCost:\n\n\\- SGD $24.72/25ml from Watsons\n\nFor comparison, the regular gold bottle Anessa Perfect UV Sunscreen Skincare Milk is listed at SGD $27.93/60ml \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIngredients: \n\nDIMETHICONE･ALCOHOL･ZINC OXIDE･WATER (AQUA)･METHYL METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER･ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE･DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE･CAPRYLYL METHICONE･TITANIUM DIOXIDE (CI 77891)･BUTYLENE GLYCOL･OCTOCRYLENE･HDI/TRIMETHYLOL HEXYLLACTONE CROSSPOLYMER･DEXTRIN PALMITATE･SILICA･TRIFLUOROPROPYLDIMETHYL/TRIMETHYLSILOXYSILICATE･DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE･PETROLATUM･TITANIUM DIOXIDE･ISODODECANE･PEG-9 POLYDIMETHYLSILOXYETHYL DIMETHICONE･PPG-17･IRON OXIDES (CI 77492)･MICA･BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE･ALUMINUM HYDROXIDE･ISOSTEARIC ACID･IRON OXIDES (CI 77491)･DISTEARDIMONIUM HECTORITE･STEARIC ACID･TRISODIUM EDTA･PEG/PPG-14/7 DIMETHYL ETHER･POLYSILICONE-2･LITHIUM MAGNESIUM SODIUM SILICATE･FRAGRANCE (PARFUM)･BHT･TOCOPHEROL･LIMONENE･GLYCERIN･SODIUM METABISULFITE･IRON OXIDES (CI 77499)･LINALOOL･SODIUM ACETYLATED HYALURONATE･\n\n(list taken from watsons website)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUV filters:\n\n\\- Zinc Oxide, Octinoxate, Titanium Dioxide, Octocrylene, Uvinul A Plus, Tinosorb S\n\n&#x200B;\n\nClaims:\n\n\\- supposed to be good for sports\n\n\\- non-sticky and shine-free look\n\n\\- sweat and water resistant\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinish:\n\nSatin, though depending on what you layer underneath it can be quite dewy. On it's own it's quite a natural finish but I usually layer it over Stratia liquid gold and the Soon Jung 2x barrier cream, both of which are fairly dewy. Even so the end result with this bb base was a glowy look that didn't cross the line to oily. It sets pretty well on its own, but I found that I needed to powder it a bit mainly due to what I was layering underneath. Without powdering it did crease a little bit on my eye area though again, I believe that's mainly due to my layers underneath. Also, creasing of products on my eye area is also fairly normal for me due to my lid shape.\n\nI was also worried about this being drying due to the alcohol but found it to be ok. I recently started tret so my skin has been SUPER dry but this didn't dry me out more, which I really appreciated.\n\nAlso, I was really happy that this was not streaky at all even when applied with my fingers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsistency:\n\nFairly watery, though it's not running off my hand or anything. It's very thin and spreads easily. This is more oily than sticky on initial feel, but once it dries down a bit it just feels like moisturized skin to the touch. It's very light and I don't feel like I'm wearing anything at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCoverage:\n\nThis had surprisingly high coverage. I was expecting it to be fairly sheer just going off the consistency but this was actually more high coverage than my usual tinted moisturizer (Laura Mercier oil-free). I have a fair amount of scarring on my cheeks from cystic acne and I would say this covered up about 90% of it. It was enough coverage that I don't find myself reaching for any additional concealer or foundation products. I also didn't get any weird texture or patchiness on my nose area which tends to be an issue for me. [Here](https://imgur.com/qpbc7lB) is a picture of my cheek scarring with just moisturizer. [Here](https://imgur.com/wq3ZpDl) is the same cheek with the Anessa. In the pictures, my face appears to have a bit of a whitecast, but if you look at the \"bare skin\" pic my face is already slightly lighter than my neck, probably because I don't always bring my sunscreen down on my neck like I'm supposed to 😬\n\n&#x200B;\n\nColor:\n\nI bought the shade natural.\n\nSo my closest foundation match is the non-AB shade Punjab from NARS. It's described as \"medium with golden undertones\". My closest AB match is the Missha M Magic Cushion in #27. This bb cream was nearly a perfect match for me. I'm not too sure how it would look on people significantly lighter or darker on my skintone though given that the coverage is fairly high. [Here](https://imgur.com/T7q5tQp) is what the Anessa looks like right out of the bottle. I was pretty surprised by how dark it looks. [Here](https://imgur.com/SkxJdCE) is what it looks like spread out on the back of my hand. You can kinda see it did make my hand look the slightest bit orange, which I think is because the dot amount was too much for the back of my hand, but it makes me think this could work for someone who may even be a couple shades darker than I am.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStaying Power:\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by how well this sunscreen kept up throughout the day. I was a little worried about transferring (especially since I had it layered over the Soon Jung barrier cream which is somewhat greasy) but was pretty pleased by how little it transferred. [Here](https://imgur.com/moXVdEf) is a picture of a transfer test I did. This was about 30 min after applying. I pressed the paper towel firmly to each section of my face twice (cheeks, nose, forehead, chin). Even though a bit of color does come off on the paper towel there weren't any noticeable patches missing on my face. Even after a long day in very humid and hot Singaporean weather the coverage looks really good. When I sweat and dab my face off I do get a tiny bit of transfer, but nothing crazy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther things to note:\n\n\\- this does have a bit of a floral fragrance to it. It fades after application but is noticeable when you first apply, so that's something to take note of if you are averse to fragrance. I will say though that despite the fragrance and despite alcohol being fairly high in the list I didn't experience any irritation or breakouts. I started tret a week or so ago and am currently experiencing a fair amount of stinging even with basic moisturizing products so I was really surprised that I didn't experience any stinging from the Anessa.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall:\n\nI am a huge fan of this product. The color, coverage, and finish are all perfect for me and I really appreciate the UVB/UVA ratings as well as the water and sweat resistance. I do wish it was a bit cheaper, but tbh this one product has replaced my usual combo of sunscreen + tinted moisturizer so I'll really be saving money in the long run. I haven't even reached for my concealer anymore so that's one more product I may (potentially) be able to cut out. Plus it's one less step for me to do in the morning which is always great. 10/10 will be buying again and this has replaced my previous holy grail sunscreen which was the Biore UV watery essence. I plan on getting the regular gold bottle Anessa sunscreen when this runs out just to see how similar they are, but for now I'm really happy with the bb base.\n\n[Picture album](https://imgur.com/a/mImohya) with demonstrations of coverage, color, and transfer test.",

        "body": "Ok, for those of you who have never worked in formulating let me tell you how the skincare industry typically works. Vitamins are the cheapest ingredients, not unique, everyone can use them cheaply. They are great and we know they work but many vitamins carry risk of irritation.\n\nBotanical ingredients are a little harder to create but also very cheap. Peptides are the expensive part. Your skin is made from water, oil and protein. \n\nPeptides are chains of amino acids that can work in the skin through receptors on the cell membrane. That are the most high tech ingredients, but they also have almost no risk of irritation but can give huge gains in dermal density and age management. They literally signal the cell to work in different ways. You can have peptides that carry other ingredients. You can have peptides trigger growth factors and stimulate lots of regenerating actions of the skin. \n\n The major laboratory’s that sell peptides to brands (Lipotec in Spain for example) have sales reps that visit brands and most brands are all buying from the same suppliers which is why we see trends.  Research and development of peptides is very expensive but these labs can sell them at cheaper prices because they sell in bulk and push them out to mass market. \n\nAlso most brands use peptides in such low percentages, like 0.05%, because of the cost. It’s on the inci list but not at effective levels.  BR always use peptides at high percentages so you actually get the benefit. The formula is short to increase the % of active ingredient. It’s not coloured water, that’s an insult to the PhD scientists at BR that work to create products that are different and deliver ingredients at meaningful percentages and not fill the formula with silicones and emollients only for sensory value. \n\n Biologique Recherche literally translates to biological research and it was the name of the lab as Biologique Recherche originally functioned as an ingredient lab and formulated blank label products for many brands. Now days Biologique Recherche  still research and develop their own unique peptides, this is expensive and they have a very niche market. This is why there is cost because you are getting unique expertise, they have been at the forefront of peptide research for fifty years. And they use the peptides in insanely high percentages compared to other brands. The peptides in Progeskin were researched and developed for over 5 years and are extremely effective. If you are not incorporating high percentage peptides now you will be doing your future self a disservice.",

    "body": "I’ve seen a couple of posts with questions from other amateur cider producers. I’m an amateur, but I suspect a relatively serious one. I ferment in 300L batches or 1000L batches between 8 and 10 batches a year, all for our personal consumption.\n\nFirst, we have cider orchards whose 760 trees vary in age from 5 to 125 years old. There are 57 varieties (like Heinz!), mostly cider or cooking, but a few eaters. We harvest and press those apples when they fall - I do not pick any except the Dabinett.\n\nSince harvest times vary per variety, as does acidity, sugar and tannin, we check the acidity and OG when we press. A September apple is usually pH of 4 (or more!!) so we stabilise that (chemically, with sodium metabisulfite) and store it for later. I do not acidulate.\n\nBy now (early December) there are very few apples left. Acidity is about 2.8, OG is 1.065, and the Dabinetts will be pressed so we’ll have a good source of tannin.\n\nI add extra tannin if the tannin isn’t high enough. We test tannin levels in the time honoured fashion of trying the juice and making a call. We find this the best way now, but up until maybe two years ago we would both taste and titrate.\n\nPotassium permanganate and indigo carmine can’t tell the difference between hard and soft tannins, and some apples grow here with great tannins that we don’t want to change. Your tongue knows. Keep making cider and you’ll gain this skill.\n\nWe don’t keeve (yet), but after trying some of Tom Oliver’s ridiculously good keeved cider, we’re going to give it a bash.\n\nFerments are spontaneous. We don’t add yeast.\n\nI’ve never had a stuck fermentation in our cider. I frequently let it freeze and restart after a thaw with no ill effects.\n\nWe don’t oxygenate or add a nutrient anymore, but years ago we did experiment with them, and they made less good cider, but finished faster.\n\nInstead of accelerants, we let the ferment run all winter. The cidery isn’t heated. We’re in the Scottish Highlands, so it gets chilly, -13 C in Feb but it is usually between 12 C and 16 C. If it gets too warm, we chill. We don’t like temperatures above 22 C because it produces off notes.\n\nWe have installed warmers but never used them.\n\nOnce fermentation is complete, we sterilise with potassium sorbate and barrel age in used Bourbon barrels from the US for six months to two years.\n\nThe cider is very sour when unaged. Sometimes, we backsweeten a bit with fresh juice and bottle it for a few bottles of early cider, but honestly that’s for the young, impatient lads, not for me. I just wait.\n\nWe have done malolactic fermentation, but can’t get bacteria right now because of Brexit. Malolactic fermentation is pretty good for balancing acidity without destroying the structure like chalk can, but time on oak works too.\n\nMost of what we’re making ends up dry and about 7%, varies from year to year, and some years are pretty good, but never as good as Tom Oliver.\n\nI hope this helps some people, and I’m happy to answer questions.",

Then you go online, give it a quick google, and’re greeted an absolutely bewildering mix of discussion on the topic: everything from people that say it’s impossible to makes outside of China, to people playing around with adding nutritional yeast or L-cysteine to mix, to Buzzfeed videos claiming an easy foolproof version.\n\nSo with this post, I want to (1) try clear the air a bit, and clarify what a hand-pulled noodle actually is (2) teach you three different ‘hand-pulled noodles’, for three different skill levels and (3) teach out a couple ways to actually enjoy them. It’s… a lot of ground to cover. This is a novella of a post, I know – I’ve actually had to put parts of it in the comments below because I hit reddit’s character limit (40k for a post, who knew?). Save it for later if you’re not in the reading mood. But I hope by the end of it all, you’ll understand – or at least appreciate - Chinese hand pulled noodles a little better.\n\n###What is a hand-pulled noodle?\n\nSo one of the things that makes it awkward to give a ‘recipe’ for hand-pulled noodles is that hand-pulled noodles aren’t really a ‘dish’ per se. They’re a technique. And to make things even more complicated, that English translation of ‘hand pulled’ really refers to **two separate techniques**: *Lamian* and *Chenmian*. \n\nThis distinction’s important. It’s why tried and failed mightily at hand pulled noodles, while Igna Lam over at Buzzfeed seem to make them without a hitch – because Babish was trying to make Lamian (infamously difficult) and Lam was making Chenmian (common enough in home kitchens in China). Some other similarities/differences:\n\nLamian (拉面) | Chenmian (抻面)\n:--|:--|\nMade in restaurants | Made at restaurants or at home\nOften learned by going to special schools or apprenticing | Easy to pick up \nAlkaline Noodles | Non-alkaline Noodles\nRequires a finely milled flour (more on that later) | A finely milled flour is nice, but AP Flour can also be used\nRequires a special type of alkaline called penghui (more on that later) | All you need is flour, water, and salt\nRequires many fancy movements to get it to a pullable consistency, as alkaline stiffens dough | Only needs a long rest (three hours or more) to get to a pullable consistency\nOriginates from the Northwest, Lanzhou specifically, popularized throughout China by the noodle shops that bear its name | Can be found all across north China and even out into other spots in Central Asia\nDelicious | Delicious\n\nNow, both Lamian and Chenmian can come in different shapes. Likely the most classic version of both would be those spaghetti-looking sort, the kind that you’d probably immediately recognize as ‘noodles’. In this shape, Lamian is still called… Lamian. Easy enough. But perhaps confusingly, Chenmian in this shape can also be called Latiaozi (or, in some parts of the country, also Lamian… ugh).\n\nBut besides that, another common shape is wide-and-flat. If following the Lamian method, those flat sort are generally called *kuanmian* (宽面, literally ‘wide noodles’); if following the Chenmian method, they’re called… Biang Biang noodles.\n\nNow, we’ve already covered Biang Biang noodles, but I’ll include them too because they make a *great* introductory pulled noodle. So the way I’ll organize this post is by going over:\n\n1. *Biang Biang Noodles*. Wide-and-flat Chenmian that make for a great ‘my first pulled noodle’.\n\n2. *Chenmian, a.k.a. Latiaozi*. Spaghetti-like Chenmian that’re slightly more involved than Biang Biang (they’re at slightly more risk to break, and are a touch tougher to get thin).\n\n3. *Lamian.* Spaghetti-like alkaline noodles that are… a beast. The mount Everest of Chinese cooking. \n\nBefore we jump in with though, a quick word on flour.\n\n###What flour to use for pulled noodles?\n\nWhenever we do any sort of dough related thing, we end up getting a lot of questions on the subject of “Chinese flour”. Is it bleached? Is it lower gluten? Etc. There seems to be this nagging misperception out there that flour here is somehow materially different than flour in the West.\n\nIn truth, there’s nothing overly different about Western flour and Chinese flour. That’s not to say that everything’s 100% the same – it’s just that that there’s an equally large difference between, say, King Arthur and Gold Metal as there is among those and Chinese brands.\n\nAs always, there’s a few different variables that’re important when picking out flour:\n\n1. *Gluten/Protein content.* For this, we want a high gluten flour. Gives the noodle more bite. For Lamian you want a flour that’s more than 12% protein. For Chenmian, anything over 10% protein should work ok.\n\n2. *Age.* Flour changes as it ages. Fresher flour is stretchier than older flour. In an ideal world, your flour would be less than 6 months old. Matters much more for Lamian than Chenmian (notice a trend?)\n\n3. *Fineness.* The best flour for noodles and dumplings is quite finely milled, akin to an Italian 00 flour. Nice to have for Chenmian, but critical for Lamian.\n\nFor making Lamian, there’s actually a certain brand of flour most of the noodle shops tend to reach for called ‘塞北雪’ – [this is what it looks like, if you’re curious](https://imgur.com/TpccLTw). It’s 12.2% protein, usually used within a couple months of milling, and is extremely finely milled. But while that brand of flour is certainly a beaut to pull noodles with, extremely similar flours *do* exist in the West… in the form of Italian 00 flours.\n\nSo the TL;DR on flour is:\n\n* For Lamian, use an Italian 00 Pizza Flour. In the videos we used Caputo’s Chef Pizza Flour, which’s available online and popular among home pizza makers. It’s finely milled, pretty fresh, and is 13% protein. Works like a charm.\n\n* For Chenmian, 00 Pizza Flour is preferable but not required. All purpose flour is ok, just make sure that it’s not *too* low in protein. Our AP we usually use is 10.8% protein. \n\n**Wait, so for Biang Biang/Chenmian I can use AP Flour?**\n\nYes, that’s right. But you’ll make your life much easier if you do an autolyse first. In both bread and noodle making, this will develop gluten and make for a stretchier end result (hey, just what we want in a pulled noodle!)\n\n* Dissolve your salt with your water, then combine the water with the flour bit by bit\n\n* Knead for ~1 minute until everything comes together\n\n* Cover with a plate, rest for 30 minutes\n\n(note: in Western baking a ‘true’ autolyse is sans salt)\n\n---\n\n###Biang Biang Noodles\n\nSo ‘Biang Biang noodles’ ring a bell, it’s for good reason. Ever hear of the restaurant Xi’an Famous Foods? Began in the basement of a Flushing mall… adored by pretty much everyone including the late Anthony Bourdain… blew up with 15 locations throughout New York… spawned countless copycats throughout the Anglophone world? Biang Biang is the main offering on their menu. It’s a noodle that’s… easy to love. \n\nNow, [that recipe we shared previously?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/axyghr/recipe_biang_biang_noodles_with_chili_oil_topping/). It’s a good recipe. A lot of people’ve enjoyed it. Feel free to continue using that one if you’re already used to it. But by learning a couple basic hand pulled noodle techniques, the process can become even easier, I feel. \n\n**Ingredients, Biang Biang Noodles:**\n\n1.  *00 Pizza Flour, preferably, -or- AP Flour (中筋面粉), 200g.* If you do not use the 00 flour, do that autolyse beforehand.\n\n2. *Salt, ½ tsp.* \n\n3. *Water, 100g.* This dough is 50% hydration. Most pulled noodle doughs will be around that level.\n\n4. *Oil, 3 tbsp.* For coating the dough during resting. \n\n**Techniques, Biang Biang noodles:**\n\nAs befitting something with a grand total of four ingredients and made solely with your hands… pulled noodles are all about technique. Following a recipe for something like pulled noodles would be a little like reading a walkthrough for a game like DOTA 2. A great starting point no doubt, but somewhere along the way the onus falls on you to actually, like… get good.\n\nFor both this one and the following though, luckily that’s not going to be all that difficult. There’s just three techniques that you’ll need to know: hydrating, kneading, and pulling. \n\n**Technique #1: Cat Claw (毛抓手): A way to evenly hydrate your flour.**\n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/kc56k8).\n\nWhat you’re doing is adding water to flour bit by bit, then rubbing the flour between your thumb and the back of your fingers. What you’re looking for is a final result called ‘suizi’ (i.e. ‘wheat grains’), which looks something [like this](https://imgur.com/LM98kpj). \n\nThe reason evenly hydrating the flour is so important is because we don’t want to add too much water to the dough. This is also one of the reasons why finely 00 milled flour can be so helpful – simply by how well the stuff hydrates.\n\nLike, add 50 grams of water to 100 grams of AP Flour. Do a rough mix with a chopstick, and you’ll get something [like this](https://imgur.com/JLDyxhX). Compare that against those ‘suizi’ from above, which was made with some finely milled 00 with the *same amount of water*. If you’re anything like me, you might look at the first picture and think to yourself, ‘damn, needs more water!’ But it doesn’t need more water – it just needs to be hydrated better.\n\nCat claw + autolyse is a powerful way to make even the most ‘meh’ of AP flours the hydrate like they should.\n\n**Technique #2: Making the Abacus String (算盘子): Kneading and aligning the gluten into one long rope.**\n\n[Here’s](https://imgur.com/a/ajYMI2a) an imgur album detailing the process step-by-step. I know it looks like a lot – it’s not that bad, I promise.\n\nBasically, you’re just kneading this stuff by repeatedly curling the dough into itself until you get one long log. Then you fold it in half, punch it down, and start curling again. It’s not necessarily any harder that the standard kneading motion for bread, just different.\n\nWe’re doing this because we not only want to develop the gluten network in the dough, but also *align* the gluten strands. The idea’s somewhat similar to the slap-and-fold technique in Western bread-making, albeit with a different goal in mind. The slap-and-fold gets the gluten into a sort of criss-cross pattern, while here we’re aiming for one long rope.\n\nWhen we go over Lamian below, this process becomes both insanely important and incredibly tedious. Luckily, for both Biang Biang and Chenmian, you just need to do this for ~8 minutes or until the dough gets smooth.\n\n**Technique #3: Biang-ing and Ripping the Noodle:**\n\nThis noodle gets its name from the characteristic sound it makes as it smacks the table. Far too few food names are onomatopoeias.\n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/94ad9z).\n\nBasically, what you’re going to be doing when pulling is first rolling it out into a ~10 inch to ~2.5 inch sheet. Then, you’ll make a small indentation in the noodle with a chopstick – this will be your ‘ripping point’. Next you grab the noodle, smack it ~10 or so times against the table while pulling gently to lengthen it out.\n\nThe way you hold the noodle while pulling/smacking is quite important, however. If you pinch the dough at all, it can end up breaking. What you want to do is lay the noodle over your four fingers, and simply using with your thumbs to hold it in place- force shouldn’t really be applied. Here’s a picture of [what your hands should look like](https://imgur.com/EeI3XDK).\n\nOnce the noodles are about arms length, rip it in half at the indentation that you made your chopstick. We usually rip one end like we did in the above video, but you could rip both ends, or you could keep it in one big ‘loop’. Up to you.\n\n**Process, Biang Biang Noodles:**\n\n1. *Mix the salt with the ice water, then add water by ‘cat clawing’ the mixture into the dough. Press and knead for ~1 minute into a rough ball.* Refer to the ‘cat claw’ technique for detailed instructions. Once all the moisture’s absorbed into the dough, knead it real quick (as normal, like you usually would bread and such) to get it into a ball.\n\n2. *If using AP flour instead of 00 flour, cover and let rest for ~30 minutes.* \n\n3. *Move the dough to a work surface, knead using the ‘making the abacus string technique; 8-10 minutes.* Refer to the ‘making the abacus string’ technique for more information. What you’re looking for is the dough to have a smooth surface on both sides [like this](https://imgur.com/u10luQP).\n\n4. *Fold the dough length-wise twice; smack it into a rectangular box, toss in a bowl and rest for ~10 minutes.* From the previous step, you will have one long ‘rope’ of abacus string. Punch it flat. Fold it in half lengthwise twice to shorten it right up. Then smack it into a rectangle – it’s a bit tough to describe, so I’m going to [cheat with a streamable](https://streamable.com/jzv81k).\n\n5. *Roll the dough out into roughly a ~7x4 inch sheet.* No need to obsess over the exact measurements here, but that’s the size that we were working with.\n\n6. *Cut the dough into four long strips.* So each strip would be roughly ~1x7 inches.\n\n7. *Thoroughly oil a plate, toss on the dough strips, then oil them. Cover with plastic wrap in such a way that the plastic wrap is clinging to the strips themselves.* Remember – we usually use a few tablespoons worth of oil here for this step, so don’t be shy there. When you’re covering with plastic wrap, have the wrap cling to the noodles, to minimize air in the plate. That said, don’t go nuts - we’re not vacuum sealing.\n\n8. *Rest the dough strips for at least 3 hours and up to 8 (or overnight if need be).* We find 4 hours to be about ideal for resting. Going up to 8 is fine too – 24 hours is perfectly workable as well, but after that the dough will likely become a bit *too* soft and pull-y.\n\n9. *Remove a strip, patting slightly with a paper towel if overly oily. Roll it out into a ~2.5 to ~10 inch long sheet.* Exact size here’s nothing to obsess over, just what we find ourselves working with.\n\n10. *Biang the Noodle: Press down the middle of the noodle with a chopstick.* Refer to the ‘Biang-ing the Noodle’ technique for more details. The indentation in the noodle should [look something like this](https://i.imgur.com/ZHD06sW.jpg). After we slap the noodle longer, that indentation will be where we tear it open (to get an even longer noodle).\n\n11. *Biang the Noodle: Hold the noodle in your palm, lightly pressing with your thumb. Smack the noodle down against your work surface around ~ten times to lengthen the noodle.* Refer to the ‘Biang-ing the Noodle’ technique above for more details. You’re looking for [something about a meter long, like this](https://i.imgur.com/TVUKw9o.jpg). \n\n12. *Biang the Noodle: In the center of the noodle, push through the groove that you made with the chopstick and pull apart the noodle to get something even… longer. We break one end of it.* Tearing apart will look something [like this](https://i.imgur.com/TVUKw9o.jpg) – again, some people break both ends, and some keep the circular shape. \n\n13. *Boil for ~1 minute until it floats.* Work through your other noodles as each is boiling.\n\n---\n\n###Chenmian\n\nSo Chenmian are also referred to as Latiaozi, and – interestingly – in Xinjiang as ‘Laghman’. They’re basically going to be almost identical to our Biang Biang noodles from above, albeit in that long/round spaghetti-like shape.\n\nSo, this recipe is going to share a *lot* with the previous recipe. So I’m going to cheat and refer to the above recipe a bit. If you’re just perusing this post out of curiosity, the substantive differences are the “technique #3: pulling” and the process starting from step #6.  \n\n**Ingredients, Chenmian:**\n\nSame as the Biang Biang above.\n\n**Technique #1: Cat Claw (毛抓手)**\n\nAgain, [Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/kc56k8). \n\n**Technique #2: Making the Abacus String (算盘子)**\n\n[Here’s](https://imgur.com/a/ajYMI2a) that imgur album detailing the process step-by-step again.\n\nRemember, you’re just kneading this stuff by repeatedly curling the dough into itself until you get one long log. Then you fold it in half, punch it down, and start curling again.\n\n**Technique #3: Pulling the Noodles**\n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/yznx53).\n\nOverall, the pulling technique for this noodle’s pretty self-explanatory. What you’ll do it roll it out a touch by hand (until it’s, say, ~6 inches long), then pull it. Once you can start to feel the resistance in the noodle, stop. Then continue to thin/lengthen the noodle by repeatedly smacking it against the table, ala the Biang Biang noodles.\n\nNote that there *will* be a limit as to how thin you can get the thing. What you’re looking for is something a touch thicker than fresh spaghetti, or about the same thickness as Japanese ramen. If you’re staring at a noodle that’s still a little too thick, you’ve got two options. First, you can fold the noodle in half and continue to smack in against the table. This’ll help things get a bit thinner, but you do have to be careful – it’s very easy for the noodle to break when folded. Second, you’re still working with a stubborn noodle, you can leave it there and let it rest as you work through the remainder – picking up again after five minutes or so, you can generally get it a bit thinner.\n\n**Process, Chenmian:**\n\n[Video of making Chenmian is here if you’d like a visual](https://youtu.be/qzAdiOhaZJs).\n\n1. *Mix the salt with the ice water, then add water by ‘cat clawing’ the mixture into the dough. Press and knead for ~1 minute into a rough ball.* Once all the moisture’s absorbed into the dough, knead it real quick to get it into a craggily ball.\n\n2. *If using AP flour instead of 00 flour, cover and let rest for ~30 minutes.* \n\n3. *Move the dough to a work surface, knead using the ‘making the abacus string technique; 8-10 minutes.* Refer to the ‘making the abacus string’ technique. What you’re looking for is the dough to have a smooth surface on both sides [like this](https://imgur.com/u10luQP).\n\n4. *Fold the dough length-wise twice; smack it into a rectangular ‘box’, toss in a bowl and rest for ~10 minutes.* From the previous step, you will have one long ‘rope’ of abacus string. Punch it flat with your fists. Fold it in half lengthwise twice to shorten it right up. Then sort of smack it into a rectangle – [streamable is here, again](https://streamable.com/jzv81k).\n\n5. *Roll the dough out into roughly a 4x7 inch sheet.* No need to obsess over the exact measurements here.\n\n6. *Cut the sheet in half, but be sure to pay attention to which side the long side was, as that’s the direction that we’ll be cutting.* Cutting this sheet in half is actually optional, but especially if you’re just getting started out I’ll be easier to work with shorter noodles.\n\n7. *Cut into 1cm strips.* Or roughly 12 strips per half-sheet, for 24 noodles total.\n\n8. *Thoroughly oil a plate, toss on the dough strips, then oil them. Cover with plastic wrap in such a way that the plastic wrap is clinging to the strips themselves.* Don’t be shy with the oil. Also,  when you’re covering with plastic wrap, have the wrap cling to the noodles, to minimize air in the plate – something [like this](https://imgur.com/u10luQP) is perfect.\n\n9. *Rest for 3-8 hours, or up to 24.* To relax the gluten. Again, 3 hours is the minimum here, we generally like it at around the 4 hour mark. \n\n10. *Remove a noodle, slightly pat off some oil with a paper towel if needed.* Sometimes it can get a bit too oily to work with.\n\n11. *Pull the noodles.*  Pull the noodle according to technique #3 above – remember not to get too greedy re thinness!\n\n12. *Boil the noodles until a touch past al dente, ~45 seconds, then shock under running water.* \n\n---\n\n###Lamian\n\nAbandon all hope, ye who enters this recipe.\n\nBefore we do anything, let me pass on you the advice one dude at my local Lanzhou Lamian shop gave *me* a number of years back when I was badgering him for tips on Lamian technique: “Give up. Do not try. You’ll never know how to make Lamian.”\n\nAt the time, I took it as a sort of ‘oh you’re just a foreigner, you’ll never understand’ kind of thing (the closest thing a white dude in China can get to a microaggression lol). Now, I understand the wisdom in his words. I wish we’d listened.\n\nThis is by far the hardest recipe we’ve ever done on our channel. It’s so tough that it makes Har Gow look like a relaxed weeknight dish. The only thing I can think of that can even come *close* to it is the proper sourdough-starter smiling Char Siu Bao, and that’s a recipe where commenters reporting failures outnumber commenters reporting successes about 10:1.\n\nSo just… stop. Turn back. It’s not worth it. Scroll right on past this, move on with your life. You’ve got the above recipes for Chenmian, right? Those are fun. You can impress all your friends with those. It’s good enough for most people – an untelling eye probably couldn’t even tell the difference.\n\nMaking Lamian, you **will** fail your first time. And probably your second. And probably many times after that. But if you keep at it… one day, things’ll click for you. And you can be content in the knowledge that you’ll be one bad-ass noodle maker.\n\n**Why is Lamian so hard?**\n\nSo like, Chenmian wasn’t too bad. Pretty much any intermediate home cook can make Biang Biang noodles. And while the thinner spaghetti-like sort might have a couple more moving pieces, in the grand scheme of things they’re not so bad, either.\n\nWhat makes Lamian *so* difficult is the introduction of alkaline.\n\nFor those of you out there that don’t live and breathe the world of Asian noodles, alkaline noodles have this *fabulous* bite to them. In the mainland this texture’s referred to as ‘tanya’ (弹牙), though perhaps you might’ve heard it called by the Taiwan term ‘QQ’. You could think of it sort of like… *al dente*. What makes alkaline noodles so beautiful is that they retain that sort of ‘al dente’ texture, even after being fully cooked. Alkaline is what makes Japanese Ramen, Japanese Ramen; it’s what makes Cantonese Wonton Noodles, Cantonese Wonton Noodles.\n\nAnd in my personal opinion, alkaline ends up being increasingly important as the noodle itself gets thinner. Super thin noodles can easily end up much too soft if you’re not careful – while I don’t think Angel Hair pasta quite deserves its bad reputation, I do believe that it would be a much better product if they added alkaline to the mix.\n\nNow, for most alkaline noodles the process isn’t all that hard. You add a bit of sodium carbonate to the dough (or a solution of sodium carbonate/potassium carbonate called Kan Sui/Jianshui), and continue along your merry way… rolling things out thin and either cutting them with a knife of a pasta maker.\n\nMaking an alkaline noodle that can *pull*? Alkaline stiffens dough! It’s like… a counter-intuitive proposition. Would almost feel like magic. And unfortunately for everyone trying to replicate this stuff outside of China? It kind of *is* magic – or at least, uses a magic ingredient. That is… Penghui.\n\n**Penghui**\n\nLet’s get something out of the way at first. Go on Amazon. Search “Penghui”. Find anything?\n\nAt least sitting here in the Spring of 2020, I can’t find jack. The only way to find Penghui is by ordering industrial quantities from Alibaba or through specialty middlemen (e.g. a place like ChinaHao).\n\nSee, penghui, traditionally, is the ash of a specific soda plant called ‘Penghuicao’, or Halogeton Arachnoidius in English. The old school way of making the stuff would be to burn the plant, then when it’s at a specific temperature to splash water in it. Apparently, it then forms a rock [like this](https://imgur.com/NBqqgYE). I’m not sure how any of that makes sense (ash + water = rock? someone help me here…), but then to use the penghui… you’d chip some of that off, mix it with water, then apply it to your noodles.\n\nNow, like the ash of many other soda plants, traditional Penghui was undeniably alkaline - probably from either potash or sodium carbonate. But besides that, it must’ve had *something* else in the mix, something that helped the noodles pull. While I can’t seem to find **any** information on the chemical composition of traditional penghui (feels like a fun thesis for any anthropology grad students out there lol), luckily for us… it actually doesn’t really matter. Because basically no one’s using that old school Penghuicao ash these days, either.\n\nWhether for economic or food safety reasons (depends on who you ask), in 1989 food science researchers from the Lanzhou University in Gansu developed a mix of additives that could be used in place of the traditional Penghui. And while it’s a matter of debate as to whether the explosion of hand pulled noodle shops in China over the last few decades is *because* of that innovation, it’s undeniably true that the spread of Lamian noodle joints and manufactured Penghui happened in tandem. Sometimes I joke that all those noodle shops around the country are really just a massive Penghui sales operation – a joke with a shred of truth to it, because if you peek back into the kitchens at Lamian shops, you’re almost guaranteed to be greeted with [the same blue bag](https://imgur.com/eurEgph) at each one.\n\nWhat’s in that blue bag? Well, I’m glad you asked. It’s:\n\n* 50% sodium chloride (salt)\n\n* 45% sodium carbonate. Can be produced at home by baking baking soda in an oven for ~1 hour at 150C.\n\n*  4% sodium triphosphate, a.k.a. STPP. An emulsifier that’s totally available in the West – actually, often it’s used in American supermarkets in order to make fish/shrimp retain more water (looks more plump, while also allowing them to sell you more water and less seafood). Here, the sodium triphosphate acts as a dough strengthener, making the dough less likely to break when you pull it. \n\n* 1% sodium metabisulfite. A reducer which is used as a preservative in winemaking, and also totally available in the West. The function here is to help relax the dough, making it easier to pull.\n\nNow, given that all of these components are available in the West, the question of whether we could just mix all this shit together naturally follows. And the answer is… kind of.\n\nIn the linked video, I try my hardest to make my own ‘homemade Penghui’ using those component parts. The problem is that we totally use about two grams of Penghui in one batch of noodles, so that means one 200 gram serving of noodles uses something like 0.02g of sodium metabisulfite and 0.08g of STPP. With those kinds of quantities, accurate **mixing** of the powders become absolutely imperative (you can’t make a solution either, as sodium metabisulfite quickly oxidizes when in contact with water). So without an industrial screw mixer, it’s really easy to, say, have some batches have a bit too much reducer… and some have not quite enough.\n\nBut does it work? Sorta. By taking every precaution I could think of making the homemade Penghui, we were able to pull it to a roughly spaghetti-thin noodle, but no thinner. \n\nI *would* recommend the homemade Penghui to experienced noodle pullers abroad as a stopgap between Penghui shipments. I *would not* recommend the homemade Penghui to a beginner. When learning, when you confront a batch of failed noodles you want to be sure that it’s your technique that’s the problem, and not your Penghui. So if you’re actually serious about learning Lamian, go on ChinaHao (or a similar website), bite the bullet and just… drop the $70 and buy too much Penghui.\n\n**Ingredients, Lamian:**\n\n1. *Pizza Flour -or- Chinese Lamian Flour, 250g.* The finely milled flour for this one is non-negotiable. Again, for standardization purposes, we used Caputo’s Chef Pizza Flour.\n\n2. *Ice Water, 120g.* So traditionally in the Northwest they use ice water in summer and tap water in the winter. The basic idea is that the ideal Lamian kneading temperature is around 28C, but shouldn’t really exceed 30. Why that is I can really find a compelling answer for, but the advice seems to ring true from experience. Of course, most of our kitchens are temperature controlled these days, so we would personally opt to use ice water all year long.\n\n3. *Salt, ½ tsp.* 2 grams. To be mixed with the ice water.\n\n4. *Any dense oil, e.g. Olive oil, ~3 tbsp.* Dense oils seem to ‘cling’ better to the dough while working it. We used Sichuan Caiziyou (virgin rapeseed oil), but olive oil also worked well in our tests. While working the dough you’re going to be **constantly** oiling your hands and the dough to make sure things don’t dry out. I’m giving an amount because it’s certainly true that some of the oil ends up in the dough itself. It’s approximate because it changed from batch to batch for us – we found that it ended up ranging between two and four tablespoons.\n\n5. *Penghui (蓬灰/拉面剂), 2g; to be mixed with 10g of water.* Again, if first starting out, I’d strongly advise biting the bullet and just figuring a way to source some Penghui. If you would like to try a homemade Penghui, this is how I did it. In a mortar, I pounded 100g of salt until powdery (super annoying), then did a quick pound of 90g of sodium carbonate, 8g STPP, and 2.5g (3/4 tsp) sodium metabisulfite. Be careful with the sodium metabisulfite – while this minuscule amount is probably ok, it would be more responsible for me to advise using PPE and/or going outside when using it. It’s not overly toxic or anything, but do not smell it as if it’s inhaled directly it can temporarily make you unable to breathe for a spell. Then I passed that through a fine mesh sieve a couple times, then mixed in a stand mixer with the paddle attachment on speed three for 30 minutes to combine. In hindsight it might have been a good idea to bake my salt first to ensure that there’s not excess moisture there. But regardless, store your mixture with food safe dessicants (i.e. those little silica gel packs that help absorb moisture). \n\n**Techniques, Lamian:**\n\nOk, so I usually like giving these ‘high level overviews’ of what’s generally going on before I dive into the weeds. But if I try to give a high level overview here, you’ll think I’m speaking a different language:\n\n* Cat claw the water into the flour\n\n* Knead using the making the abacus string method\n\n* Apply the penghui by either the three-fold-two-wrap method or the abacus string method\n\n* Comb the gluten\n\n* Test for pullability\n\n* Pull\n\nFeels almost easy when I put it that way lol. Some of these techniques are the same as what we went over before, but (1) the abacus string method will be more involved and (2) \n\n**Technique #1: Cat Claw (毛抓手)**\n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/kc56k8).\n\nSame Cat Claw technique as above, nothing overly special going on. Just hydrate that sucker. \n\n**Technique #2: Making the Abacus String (算盘子)**\n\nOk, so this is probably the most complicated move on the list – it’s similar to what we covered above, only you’ll need to be a bit more paranoid throughout the process. [Here’s](https://imgur.com/a/24vympg) the imgur album detailing it step-by-step. \n\nJust like the above noodles, the basic idea is that you’re kneading it by continuously curling the dough. You get a long log of curled dough, then flatten the sucker out, then repeat. Getting the dough flat enough to be repeatedly curled up takes a bit of technique though. While you could theoretically crack that nut however you wanted (a pasta maker is one possible – but not necessarily easier - route), the common move is to (1) punch the dough down then (2) press it flat further by crossing your hands and smushing down the edges (3) repeating the hand cross flattening with your hands crossed in the *other* direction to make things totally even and flat.\n\nThis is the most important step in the entire process. At some Lamian schools, the final test is to make an entire batch of Lamian from start to finish in less than 20 minutes flat. Of those 20 minutes, this step right here takes about 15-18 minutes. \n\nYou’ll know you’re ready to move onto the next step when it can form a smooth hole if you tear it. [I like this visual right here](https://imgur.com/mppalAF). This was a batch of Lamian dough that was *almost* ready. The hole on the right is smooth, the hole on the left is jagged. You want the hole to look like the one on the right.\n\nThis might take you a long time to do it. The saying in Lamian making is that you need to do this “9 times 9 times” (i.e. 81 times). That’s ultimately just a saying though, because the number ‘nine’ sounds a lot like ‘a long time’ in Mandarin. But we’ve counted before. We tend to need 30-40 times of repeating this process to get to the point we need. This takes us about a half hour of kneading, but it’s very normal to knead for 40 or even 50 minutes when you’re just starting out. \n\n**Technique #3: Three folds, two wraps (三叠两包): Evenly apply your Penghui**\n\nWhen we add the Penghui, we’ll mix it with water first, then apply it bit by bit into the dough. \n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/ykp6n0).\n\nBasically, when you add the Penghui, it’s pretty important that it evenly gets incorporated into the dough. You don’t want bits of your Penghui water ‘spilling’ out of the though, so the three-folds-two wraps method helps keep all that inside.\n\nDon’t feel like learning yet *another* technique? No problem. You can also just continue to use the abacus string method from before – applying the Penghui when the dough is flat. You’ll just need to be good about only adding a *bit* of Penghui to the dough at a time.\n\n**Technique #4: Combing the Gluten/Testing for Pullability (拉条顺筋)**\n\nSo, there’s two ways to do this step. [This is a clip of the classic ‘twisting’ approach](https://streamable.com/dhlc7s) done in Lamian noodle shops, but let’s just set that one aside for now. We feel like it’s easier to use the following method of gluten combing, which also helps give a nice ‘test’ of sorts for pullability.\n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/zwn5bf).\n\nBasically, what we’re doing is repeatedly pulling and folding the dough over itself, slapping it against the table between each pull. This’ll not only help strengthen the gluten network, but it’ll also help give us a ‘test of sorts’ to ensure that the dough is ready for pulling. If you can pull and fold it over itself at least five times without breaking (six is ideal), you are ready to move onto the next step.\n\nBut what if it’s not quite there? Well, now’s the point where you need to trust your hands and your instincts, and veer off-recipe. You’ll need more Penghui and more time kneading. Mix another batch of Penghui water, but maybe only add, say, a fifth of it at first. Use the abacus string method, knead it for a few more minutes. Then try to gluten comb again.\n\nNote that for this step, you need to make sure everything is super oily. Your hands, the table, your dough, everything. \n\n**Technique #5: Pulling (拉面)**\n\nOk, so I want you to get your expectations straight here.\n\nYou might have visions in your head about wildly pulling these noodles and putting on a show for everyone. You are not a Lamian master: do not try to do this. Your Lamian will become uneven and break.\n\nThis is a game of applying force evenly. It is not easy. It is entirely possible that you will do everything up to this step perfectly, but screw up here – getting some noodles that look thinner than angel hair, and some that wouldn’t be out of place in a Biang Biang.\n\nWork slowly and deliberately. If you fuck up, you fuck up – no shame there. But don’t fuck up because you were overconfident. The noodle cares not for your ego.\n\n[Streamable of the pulling is here](https://streamable.com/iii5sh).\n\nNotice that we’ll be adding some flour on the table for this step. Each time you pull, toss the center of the noodle in your little ‘flour mountain’ as you do it.\n\nYou’ll need five pulls to get to a ‘normal thin’ Lamian. That’s be about the same size as spaghetti – those can either be good in soup or stir-fried. Six pulls gets you to a ‘whisker thin’ Lamian, which’s usually what’s served in the Lanzhou beef noodle soup. Seven pulls gets you to ‘dragon beard’ thin Lamian… which’s thin enough to thread a needle, is completely insane, and way beyond our skill level. \n\n**Process, Lamian:**\n\nOk, got all that? Remember, high level overview:\n\n* Cat claw the water into the flour\n\n* Knead using the making the abacus string method\n\n* Apply the penghui by either the three-fold-two-wrap method or the abacus string method\n\n* Comb the gluten\n\n* Test for pullability\n\n* Pull\n\nAs always, [there’s a video too if you’d like a visual](https://youtu.be/6DgITQSonv4).\n\n1. *Mix the salt with the ice water, then cat claw the mixture into the dough.* Refer to the cat claw technique for details.\n\n2. *Knead everything into a ball, ~1 minute, then cover and rest for 30 minutes.* At the Lamian shops they’ll generally move straight on to the next step here, but we find that kneading’s a bit less painless with a quick rest.\n\n3. *After 30 minutes, remove the dough and roll it out into ~1.5 ft log. Thoroughly rub your hands and work surface with oil.* Again, make sure that everything is good and well oiled though this entire process. Rub your hands and work surface obsessively. \n\n4. *Punch down to flatten the dough. Then continue the making the abacus string method for ~30-40 minutes.* Refer to the ‘making the abacus string’ technique for detailed instructions. And remember: 30-40 minutes is an *estimate*. The timing will depend on your skill in doing this. It would be almost unheard of to do this in less than 15 minutes. I’d guess that it’ll take 40 minutes for a beginner. The dough will be finished once (1) small bubbles begin to form as you’re flattening it and (2) it forms a smooth hole when torn.\n\n5. *Combine the two grams of Penghui with ten grams of water.* Make sure it’s completely dissolved.\n\n6. *Flatten the dough ala the abacus string technique, then wet your hands with the Penghui water and apply it to the top of the dough. Then follow the three-folds-two-wraps technique outlined above.* Refer to the three-folds-two-wraps technique for detailed instructions. To reiterate, you can also just continue to use the abacus string technique here if you prefer – simply add the Penghui a bit more conservatively.\n\n7. *Fold the dough in half, roll it into about a foot and a half log, then liberally apply oil to your dough, hands, and table.* A well oiled situation is important for the gluten combing.\n\n8. *Comb your gluten.* Refer to the gluten combing technique for more information. If you can fold the dough over itself 5-6 times without breaking, you are ready to move onto the next step. If you can’t, go back to step five but add only a fifth of the Penghui water, and knead using the abacus string method for another ~5 minutes. Loop through these until you’re at the correct consistency.\n\n9. *Flour your work surface, pull the noodles.* Pull according to the pulling technique outlined in technique #5 above. Remember, work slowly and deliberately. We'd recommend five pulls for fried noodles, six pulls for soup noodles. Tear off the very end of the dough – that bit’ll be garbage, unless you got a better idea.\n\n10. *Immediately toss in some boiling water to cook.* Until just past al dente, ~45 seconds. If not eating immediately, you can flour them up… but try to devour sooner or later.",

You can still eat dinner.\n\nIf you have a pasta maker… fold the dough a couple times then pass it through, I dunno, the third smallest setting. Then cut it using the 2mm setting. Now boil.\n\nIf you don’t have a pasta maker, roll the dough out thin, then fold it a few times until the whole thing is roughly the size of your knife. Then cut it into ~2mm strips. Now boil.\n\nWe ate a *lot* of failed test batches. They’re still pretty tasty noodles to be honest. It’s not ideal because these failed batches end of breaking kind of easy when boiling, so sometimes you can have these weird ~5-6 inch long noodles. They won’t impress anyone, but hungry people definitely won’t complain.\n\nNot hungry? Just want to practice a bit more? Press your failed noodle together, then apply a bit of penghui to the dough, starting from step five. The additional Penghui will bring the dough to life – often Lamian shops’ll keep some dough in the fridge, then add some additional Penghui, and start with the gluten combing step when people order a bowl of noodles. You can use this trick to practice repeatedly with one batch – that way, you can work on your skills repeatedly without wasting ~an hour of your life each time. At some point, the Penghui’ll get too much and you’ll need to toss the dough, but hey, these components are pretty cheap anyhow.",

        "body": "##Quick note to fellow Lamian geeks re dough conditioners:\n\n---\n\nForgive me for getting into the weeds for a second here, and definitely skip this if you don't live-and-breathe noodles and such. See, there’s been a subset of us Lamian nerds online that’ve been arguing about how best to make pulled noodles outside of China for, like, the better part of a decade. I’m feeling a little lazy to bump the ol’ eGullet thread though, so forgive me for chiming in my two cents here.\n\nRecently, I’ve seen a lot of hype surrounding adding either L-cysteine or nutritional yeast to the mix in order to get a pullable noodle. The former seems to be from reports that certain noodle shops in southern Japan use it as a conditioner, the latter from Tim Chin’s recent (very cool) [SeriousEats article on the topic of Lamian](https://www.seriouseats.com/2020/04/homemade-hand-pulled-noodles-lamian.html).\n\nI do have my doubts that either of these two additives alone could make a pullable alkaline noodle – Tim’s SE recipe specifically states that it (i.e. the deactivated yeast) can’t. I certainly understand the desire to make a Lamian recipe that doesn’t call for minuscule quantities of weird shit like Sodium Metabisulfite – on that note, I think Tim’s deactivated yeast is bloody brilliant. But it *is* still missing something, of course, else it’d also be able to pull with the addition of Kan Sui.\n\nThe thing that I think these reducer-focused recipes are missing is the emulsifier. On a whim once we tried applying solely salt plus a sprinkle of sodium metabisulfite to the dough, just to see what would happen. Adding *that* much reducer undeniably turns the dough into puddy, but after a pull or two the noodle **still broke**. The effect is a little hard to describe, but it feels like the dough loses its integrity… like a Chenmian that’s been sitting in the back of your fridge for a week. You need a *stronger* noodle – and that’s where the emulsifier comes in.\n\nEmulsifiers function as dough strengtheners. How exactly they differ from oxidizing agents, and why they don’t seem to sacrifice extensibility are both good questions that are beyond my pay grade. There’s a pretty good 2019 article on the subject of STPP in noodles called “The effects of phosphate salts on the pasting, mixing and noodle-making performance of wheat flour”, [link here](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.01.049). Adding STPP, particularly between the levels of 0.05% and 0.1% (note: we were at 0.04%), caused “an enhanced resistance to successive mixing and an improved capacity to sustain shear force”. I could certainly be misreading the paper (I uh… majored in Finance lol), so definitely don’t take my word for it, but the fact remains that the emulsifier seems to be an important component.\n\nBecause you know that classic blue bag of Penghui? These days it’s not the only name in the game. There’s another mix from a company called QBR that’s relatively popular and also works like a charm. Their mix? 42% sodium chloride, 35% sodium carbonate, 8% potassium carbonate, and 15% acetylated distarch phosphate. \n\nWhat’s acetylated distarch phosphate? …an emulsifier. Why are they bonding phosphate to a modified starch instead of using a phosphate salt like STPP? No clue. But notice, **there ain’t a single reducer in that mix**.\n\nBecause really, relaxing a dough’s easy. As evidenced by Chenmian… all you need is time, really. Keeping an alkaline dough from breaking after multiple pulls? *That’s* the ballgame.\n\nIn the future, I hope someone can come up with a similarly brilliant solution to the emulsifier problem as Tim did for the reducer. I do wonder if lecithin (potentially in combination with the nutritional yeast) might do the trick – if it does, people could potentially bake some baking soda to get some sodium carbonate, then everything needed for Penghui could be available at supermarkets in the West. Purely speculation though.",

        "body": "##How to use these noodles\n\n---\n\nOk, so great. You’ve got some noodles. How to actually make use of them?\n\nWhile I’m probably blanking on some stuff, there’s three basic ‘categories’ of dishes you can make with these guys: (1) soup noodles (2) mixed noodles and (3) fried noodles. You can make pretty much any these three things with any of these three noodles (with the possible exception of fried Biang Biang noodles… but then again I’ve heard Xi’an Famous Food’s famed Cumin Lamb Biang Biang is actually fried?)\n\nSo because I’m starting to run out of breath here, I’ll choose one dish from each ‘category’ so you can at least get an idea.\n\n###Soup Noodle: Lanzhou Beef Noodle Soup:\n\nIf I were a better recipe writer, I’d follow up the Lamian recipe with an equally long and involved recipe for the beef soup that’s traditionally eaten with it. And listen, it’s a good soup.  But after all the blood, sweat, and tears of testing La Mian, we… didn’t feel like researching and testing the soup.\n\nSo I’m going to cheat, I guess. [Here’s a recipe for Lanzhou Beef Soup, courtesy of the blog ChinaSichuanFood](https://www.chinasichuanfood.com/lanzhou-beef-noodle-soup/). Elaine’s stuff’s excellent as a rule of thumb, and in her recipe she was… smarter than us and just used packaged Lamian haha (not the same thing, but… is 100x the pain worth 3x the deliciousness?). While we might have some of our own opinions here or there (e.g. the chili oil used up in the Northwest is usually made with a milder chili closely related to Kashmiri), her recipe is great and the broad strokes of it would also be how we’d approach it.\n\nIf you’d like, you can also use Elaine’s recipe for the soup together with the Chenmian. While the very best Lanzhou beef soups would probably opt for something thinner than the chenmian (i.e. the six-pull Lamian), it would still be very delicious.\n\n###Mixed Noodle: Youpomian (油泼面)\n\nFor Chenmian or Lamian, (if served unfried or without soup) it’s probably most common to see them with a saucy stir fry topping called *gaizhaomian*. One example would be something [like this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Uyghur_Lagman.jpg). We have no recipes for that kind of thing off the top of my head (apologies), but could give you an educated guess if you were curious and pressed us.\n\nFor Biang Biang, probably the most classic 'mixed' topping is a chili oil based sort called Youpo Mian. But   there’s *tons* of other toppings use for Biang Biang, some of which I covered in a separate [Biang Biang noodle topping post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/dmwmvz/recipes_how_to_top_a_northwest_chinese_biang/). For the sake of brevity though, let’s just cover the chili oil one.\n\n**Ingredients, Chili Oil Topping:**\n\n1. *Leek (大葱), ~3 inch section.* Minced.\n\n2. *Garlic, 2 large cloves.* Minced.\n\n3. *Chili flakes (辣椒粉), 4 tsp.* In the Northwest, they actually use a slightly milder chili for their chili oil. It’s closely related to Kashmiri chili, so making some chili flakes out of kashmiri chilis would have a pretty authentic flavor to it. That said, we used the bog standard Chinese chili flake, and you could also use the red pepper flakes y’all get in the West. Korean chilis might also be a solid direction here.\n\n4. *Sichuan peppercorn powder (花椒面), ½ tsp, optional.* You could go either way for this one.\n\n5. *Light soy sauce (生抽), 4 tbsp.*\n\n6. *Dark Chinese vinegar (陈醋/香醋), 1 tbsp.* If you’re rolling through this recipe and this is the only thing you can’t source… eh… hmm… I dunno, use half cider vinegar and half balsamic. I just made that substitution up on the top of my head though so please don’t hold me to that. Or maybe just buy some, it’s a good ingredient. \n\n7. *Salt, ¼ tsp.*\n\n8. *Peanut oil (花生油), 5 tbsp.* To be heated up and poured over the chili flakes/garlic. A sizable quantity of oil’s important here to keep things slippery.\n\n9. *Baby bok choy (上海青), ½ or 1, quartered.* Optional, use whatever blanched green or vegetable you want. Bean sprouts are also hyper common.\n\n**Process, Chili oil topping:**\n\n1. *Mince up the leek and the garlic.*\n\n2. *While you’re cooking the noodles, toss the quartered bok choy in with it to blanch. Blanch for 45 seconds.*\n\n3. *Nestle the vegetable in and put all the non-liquid toppings over the noodles. Spoon the soy sauce and the vinegar around the sides.*\n\n4. *Heat the oil up until it’s just starting to smoke, ~215C, then pour it over the noodles, aiming for the chili and the garlic.*\n\n###Fried Noodle: Chaolamian (炒拉面)\n\nThis fried noodle can be made with both Chenmian and Lamian (I doubt Biang Biang would work, but hey – if you wanna be experimental). There’s many types of fried pulled noodles of course – this is a classic version that you can find at noodle shops with a tomato/chili bean paste base.\n\n**Ingredients, Chaolamian:**\n\nFor this specific recipe, we opted to use egg as the protein, but that’s basically just because we had some on hand. You could alternatively use lamb, marinated beef… or really whatever.\n\n1.\t*Noodles, 300g.* Chenmian or Lamian are both great. If you want to give this one a whirl without making hand pulled noodles from scratch, feel free to try this with… whatever noodle you feel like. Japanese Ramen (the proper sort, not Top Ramen), Sichuan alkaline noodles, longevity noodles, etc etc. \n\n2.\t*Eggs, 2.* To be beaten and scrambled. Or, your protein of choice.\n\n3.\t*Garlic, 3 cloves.* Crushed.\n\n4.\t*Tomato paste (番茄酱), ½ tbsp.* A real thing in Northwest cooking, I swear.\n\n5.\t*Sichuan Chili Bean Paste (红油郫县豆瓣酱), ½ tbsp.* Something I’ve learned recently – most chili bean pastes that I’ve worked with here in China are actually a sub-category of chili bean paste called ‘chili bean paste in red oil’. No wonder some people’ve had problems with chili bean paste-based recipes. *Sigh.* You’re looking for the sort that comes in a big red plastic jar, [like this](https://www.amazon.com/Sichuan-Pixian-Boad-Paste-Chili/dp/B01M31VHNZ). It’s also available (super overpriced) online.\n\n6.\t*Baby bok choy (上海青), 100g.* Sliced horizontally. Or, your veg of choice.\n\n7.\t*Light soy sauce (生抽), 1 tbsp.* For seasoning/use while stir-frying.\n\n8.\t*Seasoning: ½ tsp salt, ¼ tsp five spice powder (五香粉), ½ tbsp of dark Chinese vinegar (香醋/陈醋).* One of the few stir-fries that we’ll season with five spice powder directly. For the dark Chinese vinegar, there’s two big varieties in China – Chinkiang (镇江香醋) and Shanxi Mature Vinegar (山西陈醋). Both are ok here, though Shanxi Mature would be slightly preferred (we used Chinkiang). If working with Western vinegars, our suggestion would be subbing it with a ratio of 2:2:1 balsalmic:white vinegar:water.\n\n9.\t*Other vegetables for the stir-fry: Red onion (洋葱), ¼ quarter; Green mild chili (青椒), ½; Red mild chili (红椒).*  All sliced. For if you don’t feel like grabbing different color chilis you can also just use solely green or red mild chilis. Anaheims are perfect, poblanos would be a little spicy but still work. Bell pepper would also be acceptable. Red onion is for looks, yellow onion is also totally cool.\n\n10.\t*Toasted sesame oil (麻油), 1 tsp.* For finishing.\n\nYou’ll also need ~2-3 tbsp of oil for cooking the egg, followed by ~3tbsp of oil for stir-frying.\n\n**Process, Chaolamian:**\n\n[Video of the frying of the noodles is here](https://youtu.be/qzAdiOhaZJs?t=243) if you’d like a visual to follow along.\n\n1.\t*Crush the garlic, slice the onion and chilis into slivers, chop the baby bok choy, beat the eggs.* For the baby bok choy, cut slice the bit that ‘holds it together’ at the end, then chop into ~1 inch sections across the stem. For the eggs, really beat the snot out of them until no stray strands of egg white remain.\n\n2.\t*Scramble the egg.* However you want, I guess. But if you want to follow us, first *Longyau*: get your wok piping hot, shut off the heat, add in your oil (here about 2-3 tbsp) and give it a swirl to get a nice nonstick surface. Swap the flame to medium, then heat the oil up until it’s bubbling around a pair of chopsticks. Pour in the egg, let it puff, then pull the cooked portions to the sides of the wok, letting the uncooked bits set in the center. Then once it’s ~80% not runny… flip it. Shut off the heat, quick scramble, and reserve.\n\n3.\t*Boil the noodles.* Boil the noodles as per the recipes above, or whatever sort of package you’re working with.\n\n4.\t*Stir fry the noodles.* As always, first longyau. Piping hot wok, flame off, ~3tbsp of oil, swirl. Flame on medium then, immediately:\n\n* Garlic, in. Fry for ~30 seconds til fragrant. Scooch the garlic up the sides of the wok.\n\n* Shut off the heat. Add the tomato paste and chili bean paste. Swap flame back to low. The reason we shut off the heat before adding the pastes is because those guys love to burn. \n\n* Fry for ~2 minutes until the pastes have stained the oil obviously red. Up the flame to medium.\n\n* Baby bok choy, in. ~30 second fry until slight wilted.\n\n* Noodles, in. ~30 second fry until it’s all basically mixed.\n\n* Swirl the tablespoon of soy sauce over your spatula and around the sides of the wok. Super brief fry.\n\n* Salt and five spice powder, in. Super brief fry.\n\n* Onion/peppers in. Quick ~15 second fry.\n\n* Add back in the egg. Super brief fry.\n\n* Swirl the half tablespoon of dark Chinese vinegar over the spatula and around the sides of the wok. Super brief fry.\n\n* Heat off, drizzle the toasted sesame oil. Another mix, then out.",

I started using this into my third week of tret and oh boy, i had super dry skin!\n\nWhen you apply this, you get a cooling sensation and it blends into the skin very nicely and doesn’t leave you looking super shining. (You might not like this if you have dry skin and want some glow from your moisturizer.) This product has a hight amount of dimethicone and if you’re prone to clogged pores, I would say avoid this even though it claims to be “non-comedogenic”. The instructions on the box also say to massage until fully absorbed into the skin. \n\nNo pilling issues with sunscreens which was surprising because I was expecting it for some reason lol😆\n\nIt definitely kept my skin moisturized for good 5-6 hours and after that, my skin wasn’t like super dry but I still felt that I needed some hydration. What I observed though, I think this baby might have repaired my barrier which may have been a teeny bit compromised from tretinoin use at that time but I am not entirely sure. My skin now is no longer very dry. Either the product works really well or my retinization process is complete. I think this’ll work well for most skin types except maybe super dry and super oily folks. \n\n\n**Rating**: 4/5 Might repurchase only because I rarely repurchase stuff and always on the hunt for the next best thing. Also, the quantity you get is depressing😭😭 and the packaging was very inconvenient (feeble plastic tub container)",

I’m still using it right now because I haven’t had time to return it and buy another moisturizer. I have skin on the drier side, not eczema type, probably combo skin and it didn’t work for me. My sister has an oily skin type and it works for her just fine so everyone’s different. I don’t think it gives me enough moisture since my skin still gets dried and flakey-looking around my nose and chin aside from breaking me out. It’s been 2-3 weeks on this thing so far. It also leaves my skin looking matte, so prolly better for oily skin. I like the dewy look better. \n\nBefore buying this, I had a trader joe’s gel moisturizer, that broke me out too since it had coconut. I used to have the cosrx snail mucin cream moisturizer and that seemed to work much better than either of these for me, and bonus points for that dewy look (if I recall, I think it did started breaking me out slightly towards the end of the jar likely bc of contamination). I’m done with gels. They don’t give me enough moisture. But also, too much moisture breaks me out so idk 😭. \n\nNow I’m looking for a light cream, not in a jar. Any suggestions?",

        "body": "So off-flavor training is great, and there is a long history of DIY due to the expense. I have some opinions:\n\n- The DIY versions and recommendations online are often off-base.\n- Dosing makes a big difference -- be sure you try it at lesser dosages.\n- To me the highest value is in doing this with other serious tasters -- I learned the most doing sensory tests with my homebrew club because it helps me detect and calibrate the off flavors. How do my peers perceive the off-flavor? Can I detect it that way? Or do I detect something but to me it's totally different. For example, there is a certain flavor (not an off flavor) in IPAs that is almost universally described on way, but that's not the way I perceive it and for me it brings to mind a certain childhood food. Now I know what to say so others understand what I mean.\n- If you do it as a group, the Siebel kit is not as expensive per person.\n\n\nSome opinions on your DIY standards:\n\n- Think about the sensory threshholds.\n- Diacetyl: as the craft beer girls blog says, only McCormick® Butter Extract was accurate of the ones they tried (also replicated the slick mouthfeel), and even it added a sweetness not present in beer.\n- DMS: You're looking for the liquid. I think 5 ml / 100 ml is the amount I used (following craft beer girls blog) and it was spot on.\n- Acetaldehyde - there is no substitute. Most people do NOT experience it as apple. The apple extracts are too candy-like. But once you explain it, most people can detect it without a spiked beer: it is literally the smell of a drunk person's breath, who is literally exhaling acetaldehyde. You could use germinating seeds (see below), but it would take trial and error to get that right.\n- Light-struck: weather cooperating, 5 min in the sun is all you need. Try a few bottles with your method so it is not overpowering.\n- Oxidation: standard is to open a can of beer, leave it on counter with a paper napkin rubber banded over the top for 18-24 hours, and then refrigeate.\n- H2S: tough one. I don't think metabisulfite is going to work, and some people may not want to consume it at the dosage needed. Maybe this is one that you don't need sensory training to identify. Also it doesn't help differentiate between DMS (always an off-flavor), hydrogen sulfide (always an off-flavor), and sulfur dioxide (sometimes acceptable or desirable up to a certain level).\n- Sour/Acidic - As someone said, vinegar would be used for infection, not sour. Use lactic acid.\n\n> Any other pointers would be appreciated.\n\nIn case it helps you, here are the ASBC's additional flavor references (these are not necessarily \"spikes\" for beer) that I lifted from the beer sensory science blog a few years ao :\n\n* Acetaldehyde (green apple, solvent, paint) – germinating barley\n* Acetic (vinegar, sour) –  Heinz distilled white vinegar\n* Alcohol (fusel, solventy) – Brandy heads (distillation by-products; be careful) 8ml into 355ml\n* Astringent – 1% alum / water solution\n* Bitter – Sigma-Aldrich Caffeine (FCC) 1g/L\n* Brown sugar – C+H brown sugar, 8g into 40ml light beer, mix\n* Chlorophenol (antiseptic) – Chloroseptic throat spray, non-flavored\n* Citrus – Lemon zest, Langers Ruby Red GF Juice, 0.25g and 6.5ml into 12oz beer, respectively\n* Coffee/Roasted – Tully’s Roasted ground coffee, 1.3g into 50ml water, boil, filter, 7ml of filtrate into 12oz beer.\n* Diacetyl (butter) – McCormick’s Imitation Butter Flavor\n* DMS (corn, canned veggies) – canned creamed corn or black olives\n* Ethyl acetate (solvent) – Fingernail polish remover, on cotton ball in jar.

    "body": "I meant to put i made a 2% BHA exfoliant not toner, but I can't edit the title TT\n\nHey y'all!\n\nFor the longest time I've seen and heard from people struggling with dissolving salicylic acid and keeping it dissolved. So I did a bunch of research and even helped someone fix a there formula and they gave me feedback saying the SA had not recrystalized so far (YAY!) [This should be it](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/comments/ibfy8b/need_help_simple_questions_basic_beginners_help/g20l949?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3). If I linked the wrong thread just tell me. I also shared this somewhere don't remember where.\n\n\nAnyway, I came here to share my thought process and see if anyone had any extra ideas so that others could benefit. I didn't really know how to start with this because while I got the idea from Paula's choice I didn't really make te formula from that... but I'll start with Paula's choice.\n\n\nPaula's choice 2% BHA Exfoliant:\nWater (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n\nPaula's choice Regular Strength Anti-Redness Exfoliating Solution With 2% Salicylic Acid Ingredient list:\nWater (Aqua), Dipropylene Glycol (hydration), Pentylene Glycol (hydration), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Glycerin (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Panthenol (hydration), PEG/PPG-17/6 Copolymer (texture-enhancing), Methyl Gluceth-20 (hydration), Glycereth-26 (texture-enhancing), Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane (hydration), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer), Sodium Metabisulfite (stabilizer).\n\nAs you can see I linked two ingredient lists for 2 bha products but formula is more based on the first one. I linked the second one as a reference due to the fact that it used way more glycols and that plays into my dupe?\n\n\nAnyway: the Paula's choice 2% BHA exfoliant ingredient overview:\n\nWater: water\n\nMethylpropanediol: humectant, solvent, helps with absorption of Salicylic acid. \n(I have no earthly idea where to get this ingredient, so I'm not including it at all)\n\nButylene Glycol: humectant, solvent\n(I used Propylene glycol instead of this)\n\nSalicylic Acid: the reason were here\n(This is going to be dissolved in the propylene glycol)\n\nPolysorbate 20: helps stabilize the Salicylic acid and keep it from recrystalizing\n(Gonna use this anywhere from 2 to 5%)\n\nCamellia Oleifera Leaf Extract: Green tea extract\n(Not necessary, but nice. You could use the powdered at 0.5% or the liquid at like 1 to 2%)\n\nSodium Hydroxide: ph adjuster\n(I would use this at the end to adjust the ph)\n\nTetrasodium EDTA: stabilizer, chelating agent\n(You could leave or keep this in. The Paula'schoice BHA doesn't have a preservativebecause of the high amount of humectant/glycols in their formula I believe)\n\nNow you are starting to see why this isn't exactly a dupe.\n\n\nNow let's start explaining. Making cosmetics says that SA is 3 to 6% soluble in Propylene glycol. That means you need to make a salicylic acid solution in Propylene glycol at 6%. This 6% SA solution in Propylene glycol (were just gonna say PG cuz I'm tired of typing this out) needs to be used at 33% of the total formulation to get 2% salicylic acid in our formula. Does this make sense?\n\nNow here is the formula that's not really a dupe that I posted in the thread link I shared earlier.\n\n2% Salicylic acid\n\n31% propylene glycol\n(Or 33% of a 6% salicylic acid solution)\n\n1% Sodium citrate\n\n5% Polysorbate 20 (you might have to lower this depending) (you could also replace this with poly 80, peg 40 hydrogenated castor oil)\n\nAnd then use water to 100 (or 61% in this case)\n\n\nThe sodium citrate is used to help make sure the SA doesn't recrystalize and could also function as a ph adjuster. The polysorbate was used at 5% cuz I was terrified it would recrystalize, you could lower this, but definitely use at least 2%). I did not mention a preservative in the formula i gave her because I forgot. I would put one in because I don't trust my formulation skills or sanitation. Replace some of the water with a preservative of your choice. \n\nThe original person a made this formula for said it had a greasy feel. This is definitely due to the high amount of PG and may be partly due to the polysorbate 20. But it didn't recrystalize so that's a win??? The skin feel can definitely be improved upon though lol.\n\n\nNow here is a version I've been trying to work on that is slightly more like a dupe (if you squint): I have yet to try this.\n\n2% Salicylic acid\n\n31% propylene glycol\n(Or 33% of a 6% salicylic acid solution)\n\n1% Sodium citrate\n\n3% Polysorbate 20 (I lowered this)\n\n0.5% powdered green tea extract (or 1 to 2% liquid)\n\n0.2% Tetrasodium EDTA \n\nAnd then use water to 100 (or 62.3% in this case)\n\n\nA really important tip is to make sure the Exfoliant is above 3 in ph. The Paula's choice one has a ph between 3.2 and 3.8. If the ph of it is too low the SA will recrystalize. Please remember this. In fact I remember reading somewhere at ph lower than 3.5 you often get SA precipitating out of the solution...\n\nNow can adjustments be made? Absolutely 💯. Please play with this. I really want to olimprove the skin feel of this product. Now that I've found that it doesn't recrystalize with this, I plan on trying to slowly lower the amount of propylene glycol to see how low I can take it before the formula starts hating me 😆. \n\n(And I want to make a gel out of it. Like a thicker serum type with more good skin feeling ingredients. Maybe use something like sepigel 305 so I can add silicones and get a gel cream. Can it even handle acids... Hmm)\n\n[Here is a link to a chemists corner thread](https://chemistscorner.com/cosmeticsciencetalk/discussion/comment/20464#Comment_20464) that helped me a lot.\n\nYou could add other humectants too. This could be very helpful with hydration and helpful in keeping SA solibulized. I wanna see if I can add glycerin and socium lactate. Allantoin, other extracts, and etc!!! THE WORLD IS YOUR OYSTER ( absolutely wrongnuse of this quote...)\n\nYou can buy pre solubulized SA from making Cosmetics if you don't wanna go through all this trouble ( I'm currently stuck with 100g of SA so...) you could say flip it all and use alcohol. Or you could use octyldodecanol (i think that's what it's called) also sold at making cosmetics. Better than PG worse than alcohol. \n\nFeel free to share, give advice, but please point back to his thread so we can get some knowledge 😉. I will be posting an updated formula with more goodness added and a better skin feel... in the near future.... honestly I remember....\n\nNext on my list? Urea. It shall be conquered. I will make a basic formula out of you that I can share. I will. Once you come in the mail 😀",

Here was my process for anyone interested:\n\n1. Bought all the ingredients and made a DIY airlock with stuff I had around the house\n2. Mixed it all together, spiced it, and added a sachet of bread yeast (I didn’t have anything better at the time), and some chopped raisins and sliced banana.\n3. Degassed every day for first five days\n4. Let it ferment for four weeks. Had various issues with the DIY airlock leaking, but I made it through.\n5. Racked it into a big container I had, cleaned out the jar, then siphoned back into the jar (I know, allows for too much oxidation, but it’s what I had).\n6. Let clarify and do secondary for about 2 weeks\n7. Stabilized with potassium sorbate and sodium metabisulfite\n8. 4 days later it had clarified nicely and there weren’t any residual bubbles.\n9. Bottled today!!\nI’ll let it age for about 6 months, as when I’ve tasted it it’s been good but the spices are a bit harsh and it’s slightly bready, so hopefully some aging will improve it.",

I didn't have an extra ball locks to do a closed transfer and i also didn't have very much Co2 left to do as many purges as i should've. I only ended up doing 3 purges at 20psi and siphoning in through the top onto a 100g dryhop. \n\n A couple days after carbing it wasn't tasting very good. i couldn't quite put my finger on it but it had a very off-tasting, aggressive bitterness and very low aroma and flavor than what it should've had for all the hops in it. i decided to wait a few more days and long story short, it just tasted worse. But after a post on another forum, it was unanimous that it was slight oxidation from how i packaged. \n\nI was about to dump it when i remembered the [Brulosophy SMB experiment](http://brulosophy.com/2019/09/23/cold-side-oxidation-impact-of-dosing-beer-with-sodium-metabisulfite-smb-at-packaging-exbeeriment-results/). I figured i'd give it a shot. Their experiment was done at packaging, but i figured what's the difference if it's a week after carbing. \n\nSo i just set up a [simple keg to keg transfer](https://imgur.com/kqYGmUV), Filled up the receiving keg with sanitizer and pushed it all out with Co2, then I dosed it with 0.3g of Sodium metabisulfite and purged another 5x with Co2 at 30psi. \n\n24 hours later it was tasting noticeably different. It wasn't magic, It didn't exactly bring back all the missing flavors or aromas, but the oxidized flavors and aggressive bitterness seemed to have disappeared and it's pretty drinkable now. No 'new' detectable off flavors seem to be coming from it either. I didn't dry hop it again, but i'm convinced that another ounce of something fruity during the transfer would've really helped 'bring it back'. Oh and word to the wise [Transfer slowly](https://imgur.com/MOWuom4).",

I realized it contained alcohol and have since switched to Lait U. I did enjoy Lait VIP o2 but I don’t believe in using products with alcohol for extended periods of time so that’s why I decided to switch and Lait U is very gentle. \n\n- I was recommend complexe iribiol for pimples I get from time to time. Yes, it clears it up very quickly, but the second ingredient is alcohol denat and I would get rough patches on my skin if I used it multiple days in a row. \n\n- I do love Masque Vivant although it also contains denatured alcohol. Since I only use it about 3 times a week for about 30 min I have decided it’s of low risk to my skin since the alcohol is a little bit lower on the list. \n\n- Masque vip o2 does seem to make the skin around my eyes a little brighter but I have a pimple right near my eye that won’t seem to go away. After looking at the ingredient list and seeing mink oil as the 5th ingredient it makes sense since mink oil is very comedogenic. \n\n- I love lotion MC 110 N*1, and since I doesn’t contain any alcohol I will continue to use. It really plumps my skin and gives me a glow. It is meant to be used after your P50 lotion (toner). \n\n- I was recommended P50 PIGM400 for my skin and it does lighten my skin and make it feel super balanced. After looking at the ingredients though, it also contains denatured alcohol and therefore after I finish this bottle I will move on to the regular P50 (without phenol) since it doesn’t contain alcohol. \n\n- The placenta serum is probably my favorite. It hydrates and heals my skin and I also use it on my eyes during the day. \n\n- The PIGM400 serum is just ok. It also contains alcohol and I feel like my other products have lightened my dark spots from recents acne more than this serum. It also contains some ingredients that can cause acne. \n\n- Creme Dermopurifiante makes my skin glow when I use it and it does great with skin that is acne prone but it also contains alcohol so for me, using it long term is a no go. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "Hi guys, I thought I’d post a quick quide to dechlorinating your water supply for brewing purposes. There’s a lot of discussion on this sub on how best to achieve this and I thought I’d throw in my two cents as someone who has run these kind of experiments in a lab.\n\n**Edit: As gestalt162 mentioned overuse of campden will halt fermentation and retard yeast activity. Use the ammounts reccomended below. If you don't want to do multiplication then a half tablet per 10gallons is ample.**\n\n**First the boring background:**\n\nWhy do we want to de-chlorinate anyway? Chlorine is used in water for a reason  (disinfection and inactivation of pathogens), it violently reacts with organic compounds, which is why it kills things (including you; if you inhaled it). It also reacts violently with the dissolved organic compounds in beer and will create a variety of chlorinated organic compounds including chlorophenols, which is nasty shit. Chlorophenols like 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T are the primary components of [agent orange]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_orange#Health_effects). Along with most of the chlorinated organics family these things are bad, you don’t want them in your beer. They also impart flavours that are pretty undesirable and will be seen as a flaw. Luckily they’re easily removed. What chlorine is in the water to react with organics anyway? There’s many ways to remove water borne pathogens from a source water for human consumption, the most common being chlorine derived. *Warning chemistry*\n\n* Chlorination: chlorine gas is dissolved in water Cl2 + H2O → HOCl + HCl\n\n* Then under mildly alkaline pH (drinking water) HOCl → H+ + ClO-\n\nChloramination is used in systems that have pipe networks with large residence time. Free chlorine decays fairly rapidly and chloramine is stable in dilute solution for much longer (lower redox potential), but retaining it’s (albeit slightly weaker) pathogen killing power. Although not as effective for removal of bugs it’s stability is more important. If you live in a big city and you’re way out in the burbs, or at the end of a long network, you’ve probably got chloraminated water. \n\n* Chloramination NH3 + HOCl → NH2Cl + H2O\n\nThe ClO- is what kills things. This can be very effectively removed by a number of compounds at hand. Potassium sufite, Potassium metabisulfite (Campden) Ascorbic acid, SO2 gas, UV light, Calcium thiosulfate.... I could go on.\n\nThe important one for homebrewers is [Campden]( http://www.byo.com/water/item/902-it-was-suggested-that-adding-sodium-metabisulfite-to-the-water-would-clear-the-chloramine), otherwise known as potassium or sodium metabisulfite.  (PMBS or SMBS)  This reacts with HOCl very quickly, effectively neutralising the disinfectant\n\n* Na2S2O5 + 2HOCl + H2O →2NaHSO4 + 2HCl\n\nNa2S2O5 is the campden you add. It doesn’t really matter if you use sodium in preference to the potassium version as you are adding such a small amount. Most supplies are chlorinated/chloraminated to between 2-5mg/L also called parts per million (ppm). You need about 1.34 ppm of campden to inactivate 1ppm of chlorine/chloramine, essentially 1.34 *thousandths of a gram* (mg) in 1L of water. So essentially fuck all for a drinking water supply. If you weigh half a gram of campden you’re probably adding an excess of about 100x what is necessary, but as it will impart no flavour, go for it. The excess speeds up the reaction kinetics too and you will dechlorinate in seconds for chlorinated water and maximum of a few minutes for chloramine as the reaction involves de-amination first and is longer and less favourable. Don’t add too much though if you’re a brewer that does a top off with tap water as SMBS is a DO (dissolved oxygen) scavenger and will reduce the amount of oxygen in your wort, which as we know is not ideal for the initial phase of yeast growth. If you can get your hands on it ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) will dechlorinate just as effectively and doesn’t DO scavenge.\n\n**The long point is, there’s no need to filter 10 gallons through a Brita filter or let campden dosed water sit overnight, you’re good to go pretty much immediately.** I’ll update with an edit if anyone has any q’s comments or I got something blatantly wrong and someone calls me out (likely)\n\nCheers.\n\nDrunk (on homebrew) edit: If you're from the Netherlands, none of this applies to you as your treatment is so good you don't even disinfect *bastards*. \n",

    "body": "So Marzen, or an Americanized Oktoberfest, is one of my favorite styles. Of the commercial styles available, Troegs Oktoberfest and Victory Brewing’s Festbier are THE examples I look at. I’ve tried to replicate them, but can never get that bright, toasty flavor. Most come out good, but more of a malty amber lager with some toasted notes.\n\nAny O’fest experts that have achieved what I’m looking for? Before anyone asks, I’m a pretty experienced brewer, get really great reviews at my homebrew club, have honed in on my process, so I don’t believe it has anything to do with my process, sanitation, etc. Oxidation, yeast management, and pH levels should not be an issue. I always use sodium metabisulfite in my strike water, and have started trying ascorbic acid as well.\n\nFor recipes, I’ve tried many. Including many different malt varieties such as the Barke malts, floor malted pils, etc. Troegs and Victory only use Pils, Munich, and Vienna malts, so I’ve typically stuck to those, with the odd recipe that included Caramunich and Melanoiden. Tried Many different yeast strains. Also tried pressure vs. non-pressure. Decoction and no decoction. I just can’t replicate those beers. Starting to think it’s something on the commercial level that can’t be replicated on the homebrew scale, or it’s something in their process I’m missing. Any help??\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the responses everyone! Starting to think it could be water profile related, selecting the right yeast, and likely the addition of Victory Malt and or Special Roast.\n\nI’ve always done a higher chloride-to-sulfate ratio. Typically around\n\n50ppm Ca; 75-90ppm Cl; 50-70ppm SO4\n\nthink I’m going to try to emphasize the crispness of the malt by going with a higher SO4 to Chloride ratio.\n\nThe one that’s gotten the closest to what Ive wanted had roughly equal parts chloride and sulfate, around 80ppm each. All the others, the chloride ratio was higher.\n\nUPDATE: I reached out to Troegs, and their response was:\n\n“The key step in our Oktoberfest is decoction, where we boil a portion of the mash to create a bright, dry maltiness that's rich and complex.“\n\nI did a single decoction on my first attempt to replicate the beer, and it was closest I’ve gotten. Maybe tweaking the water profile and recipe, finding the correct yeast, and maybe adding some Victory might get me closer. Although Troegs apparently only uses mostly Pilsner with some Munich, so if thats true, it must be the decoction. ",

All Weyermann malts, not that I think the brand matters but Munich I and II seem to be different with different maltsters. \n\nThe thought process behind this recipe are that the Vienna and Munich malts are important for the malt flavors, and Melanoidin is because I don't decoct. If I did a decoction mash, I'd leave out the Melanoidin malt. The pilsner is to balance it out and keep it from becoming too malty (I use ~27 IBU of magnum at 60 and 0.5 oz of Tettnang at both 15 and 5 to further balance it).\n\nIf you're looking at making it more American, kick up the hops. You may want to try decoction - I know some American breweries do, but I don't know how many do. If you're specifically trying to get close to Troegs or Victory, it might be worth reaching out and asking them about their process and recipe.",

Some serious credit goes to CaCl2 for pointing me to a lot of information as well as input from GeneJocky. \n\nManganese blue can be best described as manganese (V) doped barium sulfate. Unlike many other inorganic pigments it is thus not a mixed oxide and the process of making it requires wet chemistry as well as high temperature calcination. \n\nA serious safety warning before a quick rundown of the procedure: Barium nitrate is poisonous, an explosive grade oxidizer and releases toxic NO2 when heated. Don't try this in your kitchen. \n\nThe pigment is created by heating barium sulfate in the presence of a manganese source under basic and strongly oxidizing conditions. The easiest way to do this is mixing cheap barium sulfate with barium nitrate and potassium permanganate and heating it up to somewhere between 600-800 degrees in air, ideally with the addition of a bit of barium carbonate to achieve a deeper color. Alternatively (as done for the most successful experiment on my end) barium sulfate is precipitated in the presence of potassium permanganate from a solution of barium nitrate and sodium sulfate. Mixed with a bit of additional barium nitrate, this is then heated similar to before. The heating process is very quick, some recipes call for only 20 minutes at the target temperature, so some adventurous people might be able to pull it off with a burner. A big hazard from this process is NO2 release, which itself is very toxic and also corrosive in combination with water, as the solution forms nictric acid. \n\nIn any case, the resulting substance is very impure and is purified with dilute hydrochloric acid and sodium metabisulfite. This doesn't take more than a few seconds, which gives a satisfying transition from a grey/green/blue suspension into beautiful azure. \n\nAs you can see in the water color test, the result holds up quite well against commercial manganese blue. \n\nFeel free to ask, if you'd like to read more detailed instructions. I am also writing up something longer and detailed. If you read the conversation under my previous post on the topic, you might know some of it already. \n\nNext step is to produce a larger sample, maybe 10g or more and put it to good use in painting.",

Even though it's more challenging than a simple mixed metal oxide pigment to make, having a lab scale protocol to make small quantities of manganese blue is a tremendous boon to watercolor artists in particular.\n\n'Maybe try making some if I can work out the heating while protecting equipment and investigator from the NOx.  From what I heard, it was the cost of complying with the factory upgrades needed to scrub NOx emissions that made the company give up production.  For people making this without a tube furnace and fume hood venting, you'll need to think about how you will protect yourself. There are some nitric oxide filters for full face respirators that will do fine along with very good/outdoor ventilation.\n\nCongratulations!",

I'd like to age this for as long as I can resist the urge to drink it so I was planning on making a solution with a single campden tablet (sodium metabisulfite) and put it in the cider for preservation. What I'm not sure about is should the cider be left covered but open to the air for the first 24 hours so any SO2 can dissipate and maybe even shaken up before sealing the jug? Or maybe this should be done after I'm done aging just to get any SO2 out of the wine that doesn't need to be there after it does its job.

I've been googling around for a while and can't really find a good answer.\n\nI'm not really concerned about sodium vs potassium metabisulfite.

If you off-gas it or expose it to oxygen, well, it's no longer going to be an antioxidant, sort of ruining the point.\n\nOne tablet is not particularly much for 5 gallons.  There are calculators which tell you how much metabisulfite you should add to achieve a desired level of free SO2 per you wine's pH (I can't think of a canonical calculator, but I'm sure you can search for one and pick your favorite).",

    "body": "Last month I made a post here while my brew was fermenting. My wine is finally done fermenting and carbing. Not being able to wait for ageing, I opened a bottle and this is the result. \n\nLychee wine \nBrew date: 29 July \nBottle date: 9 Aug \nCarbonation: 3.0 vol \n\nKept the recipe real simple. \n\nPeeled, juiced and squeezed 12kgs of fresh Vietnamese lychee, and added 5.9g of malic acid as an antioxidant. As I did not use any sodium metabisulfite to kill off wild yeast, I overpitched with a whole pack of Premier Blanc, pitched at 23c and fermented at 20c. \n\nI had an original brix of 15.5, with an estimated abv at 8.2%. \n\nWith the advice in the past post, I did not add sugar to raise the ABV. \n\nFG turned out to be 0.994 giving an ABV of 9.1%. \n\nDuring bottling,the brew had a fresh fruity flavour, and was very similar to white wine, except that it had lychee flavour. It tasted no longer like fresh lychee, but had matured…. Into what I can only describe as a canned tuna smell!!? Weird, but it was not exactly unpleasant. But definitely weird. \n\nOn another surprising note, this lychee wine has very pronounced residual sweetness and is probably as sweet as Riesling. Finishing at 0.994 I was really surprised at the sweetness of this wine. I did not expect that there would be any residual sweetness left, as I was under the impression that a champagne yeast will just chow down any fruit wine down to perfect dryness. This is a pleasant surprise indeed and gave the lychee wine a more fruity character. \n\nGiven that it’s less than a month old from fermentation and not aged at all, I can taste a bit of harsh fusel alcohol, and it also has a light bitter aftertaste which was not expected. It is also a little hazy, as I did not use pectin enzyme. \n\nOverall, it’s a solid 7 pointer and I am excited to see how it tastes after ageing. I live in the tropics and ambient temperature is 27-28c. How long do I need to wait before this wine gets much better? 😄",

Please to enjoy.\n\n---\n\nAn obscure piece of trivia that only chemists [and precious metals enthusiasts] know: A mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, called aqua regia (\"kings' water\"), can dissolve gold and keep it in solution, resulting in a clear, orange-colored liquid called chloroauric acid.\n\nI tell you that to tell you this: On April 9th, 1940, Hitler's army and air force stormed into Denmark, and received the surrender of King Christian X some six hours later. It was the shortest battle of World War II.\n\nEnter George de Hevesy, a chemist at the University of Copenhagen's Niels Bohr Institute. He heard the commotion - if not precisely the gunfire, as Copenhagen was taken without firing a shot - and knew the Nazis were there to stay. And he had a problem.\n\nTwo of his German physics buddies, Max von Laue and James Franck, had sent the Institute their Nobel Prizes for safekeeping, in direct violation of a German law that forbade any gold from leaving Germany. To compound matters, von Laue was an outspoken anti-Nazi; Franck was a Jew. If the Germans were to find the medals, which were immediately identifiable as Nobel prizes, von Laue and Franck would pay for their transgressions with their lives.\n\nDesperate not to let that happen, he took the Nobel Prizes and dissolved them in aqua regia, then hid the jar in plain sight on a shelf with other chemicals.\n\nHis gambit worked. The Germans thought nothing more of it than any other jar on the shelf when his lab was later searched for spoil.\n\nIn fact, it worked so well that after the war, de Hevesy returned to his lab and found the jar completely undisturbed for the five years since he fled. He took the chloroauric acid and mixed it with sodium metabisulfite, which caused the gold to drop out of solution and be recovered.\n\nHe returned the gold powder to the Nobel Institute, who used it to cast new medals and present them back to von Laue and Franck with sufficient pomp and circumstance.\n\nThus with a little quick thinking - and his knowledge of obscure chemistry trivia - de Hevesy was able to both preserve their lives and restore their honor.",

    "body": "Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm\n\nYeesh...this review has been a really hard one to put together. \n\nIn my own head I feel like “If I see one more post proclaiming the amazing power of this product I am going to scream!”\n\nAnd I have totally been part of that group...maybe not so much the overt praise...but the Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm has popped up a number of times on my social media when showing my current evening routine.\n\nAll that being said and even with the overabundance of hype, the thing is...this is a damn good cleansing balm.\n\nFeaturing Apricot Kernel Oil, Camellia Seed Oil, and Papaya Seed Oil...the Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm has a smooth texture and dispenses from the jar without becoming chunky.\n\nOn the skin the product melts down incredibly well and turns into a heavy but manageable oil. I find myself really taking my time to massage the product in and enjoy the slightly fruity scent. This balm breaks through sunscreen (I am not a makeup wearer) very well. \n\nUpon rinsing though, I noticed that this product does take a bit more work to completely remove. This is especially true around the eye area or anywhere there was a heavier layer of product. \n\nIt still emulsifies like other cleansing balms...it just takes a bit more work than I am used to.\n\nBut once it is rinsed the Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm leaves behind a wonderfully soft yet thoroughly cleansed feel to the skin. I’ve also noticed some mild smoothing and texture balancing over time that I don't think I can say any other first step cleanser has provided.\n\nBecause of the lack of synthetic fragrance, PEG (in their most commonly known forms), and essential oils...I can see why this product has been an instant hot item. It plays into everything today’s skincare area is focusing on.\n\nI really think the issues I had with rinsing/removing could have been avoided had Glow Recipe left in some of the more common emulsifying ingredients. That is 100% personal preference, I know you may feel different, which is why I still think this is an excellent product for some.\n\nWhen it comes to an effective cleansing balm that rinses beautifully and leaves my skin feeling soft, non-irritated, and generally looking awesome...the crown still goes to the Then I Met You Living Cleansing Balm.\n\nI adore that product for its lovely/creamy/buttery texture, smooth application, and wonderful scent. Nothing else I have used has quite met the same bar (although several have come really close).\n\nThe Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm is a masterclass in taking what consumers are asking for...and creating something really special and results driven. While I do like nearly everything about it, the Living Cleansing Balm is still where my heart (and my wallet) remain.\n\nFull Ingredients List: Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Sorbitan Oleate, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Polyethylene, Aqua/Water/Eau, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Seed Oil, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Papain, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Ananassa (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Alkanna Tinctoria Root Extract, Capsicum Annuum Fruit Extract, Maltodextrin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Levulinic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Metabisulfite\n\nWhere To Buy (Glow Recipe Site $32.00 USD): [https://www.glowrecipe.com/collections/papaya/products/papaya-sorbet-enzyme-cleansing-balm](https://www.glowrecipe.com/collections/papaya/products/papaya-sorbet-enzyme-cleansing-balm) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gjq6r33zufi51.jpg?width=5216&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=017f1ce44e4b47be5af362fd00fbd51cecf0c57d",

    "body": "Good Skin Days - C’s The Day Serum\n\nIt feels like just a few days ago when I was sitting in on a Zoom call hosted by Charlotte Cho...where she revealed/announced the Good Skin Days line. \n\nI was so happy and excited for her and this next step in the Soko Glam journey. Needless to say, I picked up the three initial product launches as soon as I could and got my hands on the fourth (the Prime Time Cleansing Toner) last week.\n\nBut, I’ll save my thoughts on the new line as a whole for the full brand review. Right now I want to focus on one product (the first that I’ve incorporated into my routine)...the C’s The Day Serum.\n\nWhen Charlotte first brought this serum up during her presentation I thought “Wait, you already have a vitamin c serum...and it’s one of my favorites!” The Cosrx Triple C Lightning Liquid was one of the very first K-Beauty products I purchased and it was the one that kind of sold me on vitamin c.\n\nThat product contained a powerful concentration of L-Ascorbic Acid that, for the first time, really started to fade my hyperpigmentation and acne scars. Issues I had been dealing with for literal decades finally started to show improvement and I was hooked. At that point, Soko Glam and Charlotte Cho could do no wrong in my eyes (I guess that is still the case LOL)!\n\nNow that the Triple C Lightning Liquid has been discontinued (which hurts my heart but I understand given some of the stability and storing issues) we have this new serum to take its place...to a certain extent. Let’s dive in.\n\nThe C’s The Day Serum is a lightweight/fluid product featuring 10% Ascorbic Acid, Camu Camu Fruit Extract (for added vitamin c power), Licorice Root Extract, Niacinamide, Japanese Goldthread Extract, Ginseng Berry Extract, Hibiscus Flower Extract, and Cocoa Extract.\n\nThis blend of ingredients claims to not only provide the brightening/antioxidant boost of vitamin c but the other extracts heighten the antioxidant abilities even more. These ingredients can be great to fight against free radicals and block potential damage from sun exposure (not in a sunscreen protection manner however).\n\nI love the clean/simplistic packaging and printed testimonials on the boxes. I’ll cover packaging and marketing in the brand review but let’s just say I’m left feeling impressed by Good Skin Days in an aesthetic and “purpose” perspective.\n\nThe actual serum comes out in a dropper format and applies/smoothes onto the skin really easily. It’s not quite as fluid as the Cosrx Lightening Liquid meaning you have a few seconds of “play” before the product drips off of the face. However, I found it to be easier to just apply a few drops to my hands...and then pat the product into my skin.\n\nIt had been quite some time since I had a vitamin c product in my routine...so I did experience some slight tingling on my skin. This was a bit more intense on areas that I shave (jawline and cheeks). But, after a few uses (I use this every AM) this effect totally went away and the C’s The Day Serum was just as comfortable as any other serum in my routine.\n\nOne of the things I really appreciated about this formula was the lack of tackiness or sticky feeling after application. This was something I had come to accept with concentrated vitamin c serums but this one was much more comfortable/approachable. I’ve never found it to be a real issue as I am usually applying several “steps” over my vitamin c...but those that dislike the feeling have little to worry about here.\n\nAfter the first week or so of use I really noticed an improvement in overall skin brightness and tone-evening. While this serum wasn’t quite as potent as to really diminish specific acne marks...it did a really nice job with general “maintenance mode” brightening. I’d have to say this is probably the biggest difference between it and the Triple C Lightning Liquid.\n\nThose that are hoping to find a direct replacement to that classic vitamin c serum from Cosrx...I really don’t think this is it. Don't get me wrong, I really like the C’s The Day Serum. But, it just doesn't have that super high concentration (and the volatility that comes with it) to really get in there and lighten the darkest of hyperpigmentation. \n\nFor me, the C’s The Day Serum is something that is more geared towards those just starting with vitamin c or who have previously experienced sensitivity to the ingredient. It does the job of moderate/overall brightening really well...but would point to the By Wishtrend Vitamin C 21.5% Advanced Serum as a more direct replacement for the Cosrx Triple C Lightning Liquid. That one is much more “intense” and suited for spot treatment use.\n\nBut, what is lost in regards to potency over the Cosrx product is made up for by how easy it is to “care” for this vitamin c. No refrigeration, no clogged pipettes, no off color (at least in the month that I’ve had mine open) are to be seen here. This is a really well formulated and stabilized vitamin c in my opinion that once again lends itself to a wider customer base (aka people like me that dont want the hassle).\n\nI wouldn’t be providing a proper comparison without mentioning my all-time favorite vitamin c serum...the Glow Recipe Pineapple-C Bright Serum. That product uses a blend of Ascorbic Acid alongside Pineapple Fruit Extract and Lactic Acid to not only brighten the skin long-term...but also give an immediate “glow”. I love the versatility and instant results of that product so, so much. \n\nThe C’s The Day Serum offers similar results over time but is missing that instant “hit” of brightening and glow. But, coming in at nearly half the cost...it is a fine and affordable option that I think so many people are going to fall in love with (I certainly have)!\n\nThis is a total win from the Good Skin Days line and one that is worth picking up if you are in the market for a nice, easy to get along with, easy to care for, relatively affordable, and effective vitamin c serum. I can’t wait to get the rest of the line into my routine!\n\nFull Ingredients List: Aqua (Water, Eau), Butylene Glycol, Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Bicarbonate, Myrciaria Dubia Fruit Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Niacinamide, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Arbutin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Coptis Japonica Extract, Panax Ginseng Berry Extract, Crocus Sativus Flower Extract, Tuber Magnatum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Glycereth-25 PCA Isostearate, Hydroxydecyl Ubiquinone, Sodium Metabisulfite, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Dextrin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Hydrogenated Lecithin\n\nWhere To Buy ($26.00 USD on Soko Glam): https://sokoglam.com/products/good-skin-days-cs-the-day-serum\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ewclzg23kue51.jpg?width=3524&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9c97871e668fc7d13167aea6c1ad33f2dbed209",

    "body": "Good Skin Days - C’s The Day Serum\n\nIt feels like just a few days ago when I was sitting in on a Zoom call hosted by Charlotte Cho...where she revealed/announced the Good Skin Days line. \n\nI was so happy and excited for her and this next step in the Soko Glam journey. Needless to say, I picked up the three initial product launches as soon as I could and got my hands on the fourth (the Prime Time Cleansing Toner) last week.\n\nBut, I’ll save my thoughts on the new line as a whole for the full brand review. Right now I want to focus on one product (the first that I’ve incorporated into my routine)...the C’s The Day Serum.\n\nWhen Charlotte first brought this serum up during her presentation I thought “Wait, you already have a vitamin c serum...and it’s one of my favorites!” The Cosrx Triple C Lightning Liquid was one of the very first K-Beauty products I purchased and it was the one that kind of sold me on vitamin c.\n\nThat product contained a powerful concentration of L-Ascorbic Acid that, for the first time, really started to fade my hyperpigmentation and acne scars. Issues I had been dealing with for literal decades finally started to show improvement and I was hooked. At that point, Soko Glam and Charlotte Cho could do no wrong in my eyes (I guess that is still the case LOL)!\n\nNow that the Triple C Lightning Liquid has been discontinued (which hurts my heart but I understand given some of the stability and storing issues) we have this new serum to take its place...to a certain extent. Let’s dive in.\n\nThe C’s The Day Serum is a lightweight/fluid product featuring 10% Ascorbic Acid, Camu Camu Fruit Extract (for added vitamin c power), Licorice Root Extract, Niacinamide, Japanese Goldthread Extract, Ginseng Berry Extract, Hibiscus Flower Extract, and Cocoa Extract.\n\nThis blend of ingredients claims to not only provide the brightening/antioxidant boost of vitamin c but the other extracts heighten the antioxidant abilities even more. These ingredients can be great to fight against free radicals and block potential damage from sun exposure (not in a sunscreen protection manner however).\n\nI love the clean/simplistic packaging and printed testimonials on the boxes. I’ll cover packaging and marketing in the brand review but let’s just say I’m left feeling impressed by Good Skin Days in an aesthetic and “purpose” perspective.\n\nThe actual serum comes out in a dropper format and applies/smoothes onto the skin really easily. It’s not quite as fluid as the Cosrx Lightening Liquid meaning you have a few seconds of “play” before the product drips off of the face. However, I found it to be easier to just apply a few drops to my hands...and then pat the product into my skin.\n\nIt had been quite some time since I had a vitamin c product in my routine...so I did experience some slight tingling on my skin. This was a bit more intense on areas that I shave (jawline and cheeks). But, after a few uses (I use this every AM) this effect totally went away and the C’s The Day Serum was just as comfortable as any other serum in my routine.\n\nOne of the things I really appreciated about this formula was the lack of tackiness or sticky feeling after application. This was something I had come to accept with concentrated vitamin c serums but this one was much more comfortable/approachable. I’ve never found it to be a real issue as I am usually applying several “steps” over my vitamin c...but those that dislike the feeling have little to worry about here.\n\nAfter the first week or so of use I really noticed an improvement in overall skin brightness and tone-evening. While this serum wasn’t quite as potent as to really diminish specific acne marks...it did a really nice job with general “maintenance mode” brightening. I’d have to say this is probably the biggest difference between it and the Triple C Lightning Liquid.\n\nThose that are hoping to find a direct replacement to that classic vitamin c serum from Cosrx...I really don’t think this is it. Don't get me wrong, I really like the C’s The Day Serum. But, it just doesn't have that super high concentration (and the volatility that comes with it) to really get in there and lighten the darkest of hyperpigmentation. \n\nFor me, the C’s The Day Serum is something that is more geared towards those just starting with vitamin c or who have previously experienced sensitivity to the ingredient. It does the job of moderate/overall brightening really well...but would point to the By Wishtrend Vitamin C 21.5% Advanced Serum as a more direct replacement for the Cosrx Triple C Lightning Liquid. That one is much more “intense” and suited for spot treatment use.\n\nBut, what is lost in regards to potency over the Cosrx product is made up for by how easy it is to “care” for this vitamin c. No refrigeration, no clogged pipettes, no off color (at least in the month that I’ve had mine open) are to be seen here. This is a really well formulated and stabilized vitamin c in my opinion that once again lends itself to a wider customer base (aka people like me that dont want the hassle).\n\nI wouldn’t be providing a proper comparison without mentioning my all-time favorite vitamin c serum...the Glow Recipe Pineapple-C Bright Serum. That product uses a blend of Ascorbic Acid alongside Pineapple Fruit Extract and Lactic Acid to not only brighten the skin long-term...but also give an immediate “glow”. I love the versatility and instant results of that product so, so much. \n\nThe C’s The Day Serum offers similar results over time but is missing that instant “hit” of brightening and glow. But, coming in at nearly half the cost...it is a fine and affordable option that I think so many people are going to fall in love with (I certainly have)!\n\nThis is a total win from the Good Skin Days line and one that is worth picking up if you are in the market for a nice, easy to get along with, easy to care for, relatively affordable, and effective vitamin c serum. I can’t wait to get the rest of the line into my routine!\n\nFull Ingredients List: Aqua (Water, Eau), Butylene Glycol, Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Bicarbonate, Myrciaria Dubia Fruit Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Niacinamide, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Arbutin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Coptis Japonica Extract, Panax Ginseng Berry Extract, Crocus Sativus Flower Extract, Tuber Magnatum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Glycereth-25 PCA Isostearate, Hydroxydecyl Ubiquinone, Sodium Metabisulfite, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Dextrin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Hydrogenated Lecithin\n\nWhere To Buy ($26.00 USD on Soko Glam): https://sokoglam.com/products/good-skin-days-cs-the-day-serum\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1nr2age9kue51.jpg?width=3524&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ace06607c81b775d90d641e684200f1ddc1681ed",

I find myself really taking my time to massage the product in and enjoy the slightly fruity scent. This balm breaks through sunscreen (I am not a makeup wearer) very well. \n\nUpon rinsing though, I noticed that this product does take a bit more work to completely remove. This is especially true around the eye area or anywhere there was a heavier layer of product. \n\nIt still emulsifies like other cleansing balms...it just takes a bit more work than I am used to.\n\nBut once it is rinsed the Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm leaves behind a wonderfully soft yet thoroughly cleansed feel to the skin. I’ve also noticed some mild smoothing and texture balancing over time that I don't think I can say any other first step cleanser has provided.\n\nBecause of the lack of synthetic fragrance, PEG (in their most commonly known forms), and essential oils...I can see why this product has been an instant hot item. It plays into everything today’s skincare area is focusing on.\n\nI really think the issues I had with rinsing/removing could have been avoided had Glow Recipe left in some of the more common emulsifying ingredients. That is 100% personal preference, I know you may feel different, which is why I still think this is an excellent product for some.\n\nWhen it comes to an effective cleansing balm that rinses beautifully and leaves my skin feeling soft, non-irritated, and generally looking awesome...the crown still goes to the Then I Met You Living Cleansing Balm.\n\nI adore that product for its lovely/creamy/buttery texture, smooth application, and wonderful scent. Nothing else I have used has quite met the same bar (although several have come really close).\n\nThe Glow Recipe Papaya Sorbet Enzyme Cleansing Balm is a masterclass in taking what consumers are asking for...and creating something really special and results driven. While I do like nearly everything about it, the Living Cleansing Balm is still where my heart (and my wallet) remain.\n\nFull Ingredients List: Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Sorbitan Oleate, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Polyethylene, Aqua/Water/Eau, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Seed Oil, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Papain, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Ananassa (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Alkanna Tinctoria Root Extract, Capsicum Annuum Fruit Extract, Maltodextrin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Levulinic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Metabisulfite\n\nWhere To Buy (Glow Recipe Site $32.00 USD): [https://www.glowrecipe.com/collections/papaya/products/papaya-sorbet-enzyme-cleansing-balm](https://www.glowrecipe.com/collections/papaya/products/papaya-sorbet-enzyme-cleansing-balm) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b7kjld35vfi51.jpg?width=5216&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a406da03f65bc98760d93eb963d0a0d8a29f5b39",

The bars are 1 ozt each.  I can also melt down and repour into a round, bar (multiple styles), or hand hammered replica 8 Reales piece in whatever weight you want.\n\nI refined the gold myself using the Aqua Regia/Sodium Metabisulfite method and have sold quite a bit through PMsforsale.  I've acid tested it myself, had a jewelry store assay it and have sold it to a user here whose family runs a jewelry shop who tested it and even cut it in half to further test it.    I'd prefer to sell it in one sale but will break it up if I get no interest. \n\nPrice is $100/ozt under spot (Kitco) at the time of sale.  I will pay for shipping but insurance up to the buyer and once I drop it off at the post office and provide a tracking number the buyer assumes responsibility if they do not want insurance. \n\nI can accept payment through Paypal F&F, Venmo or Zelle \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/JRA0gf7",

I really enjoyed my most recent batch of ACV and want to get deeper into vinegars. \n\nFor Christmas, we make an awesome green olive soup and it calls for cooking sherry (aka salted). The bottle doesn’t list the salt %, but it also contains two preservatives (potassium sorbate and sodium metabisulfite). \n\nI have a crowded fridge and don’t use cooking sherry in anything else I regularly make so the idea is born from using it up. I know that I can make great sherry vinegar from unadulterated sherry, but I’m curious if any of the aforementioned will a) effect the vinegar brew or b) produce a brew too salty to enjoy. \n\nAlso, my ACV mother is very loose, much like the mother at the bottom of Bragg bottles. Am I good to strain it out and use it as a starter culture in other vinegars? Is it beneficial?\n\nThanks all! ",

The “mother” is actually present in the liquid as much as the residue. You don’t need the residue to make vinegar as the bacteria is in the liquid. \n\nLong term, I’d try capturing a wild vinegar or buy one that forms the frisbee like disk on the surface.

I was following directions from a website that was talking about SODIUM metabisulfite (campden tabs) not potassium metabisulfite. I didn’t have enough campden tabs, but instead of adding 2oz of KMS, I added 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons of KMS. I also added 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons of citric acid. I let that stand at 140F or so for a good hour, then rinsed with preboiled distilled water (160F), then dumped a full bottle of bourbon in there and sloshed it around (not particularly thoroughly though).\n\nSo yeah….am I in for an infected barleywine?

Once you know it’s infected, you can try using it as a sour barrel.  I rinsed the barrel until it no longer smelled of the solution and it began its next life as a solara method sour barrel.

They have come out with 5 products which include their \n\n1. Skin renew peptide anti pollution facewash\n2. Skin renew peptide hydrating toner with peptides and hyaluronic acid\n3. Skin renew ABC peptide exfoliator serum\n4. Skin renew peptide retinol serum-cream\n5. Skin renew barrier repair peptide moisturiser\n\nOut of these what fascinates me is their peptide retinol serum and moisturiser.\nThe serum claims 3% peptides, 0.2% encapsulated and 1% alpha arbutin, similarly, moisturiser has 1% ceramides, 0.5% peptides as star ingredients. The reason this intrigues me is this is something new in the Indian market I mean I don’t think we have 1% ceramides in an affordable range and 3% peptides that too with encapsulated retinol. Despite the fact that Dr Vanita is shady af these ingredients are attractive enough to ignore that.\n\nRetinol-peptide serum Ingredients :\nAqua, C13-15 Alkane, Diethylhexyl Carbonate, Behenyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Alpha-Arbutin, Retinol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Retinaldehyde, Pentaerythrityl Distearate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate,\nPentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, 4-t-Butylcyclohexanol, Xanthan\nGum, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Ethylhexylglycerin,\nTrisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Metabisulfite, Sodium\nLactate, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nMoisturiser ingredients :\nAqua, Propanediol, Coco Caprylate/Caprate, Ceto Stearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, Betaine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate,\nIsododecane, Squalane, 3-0-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Ceramide NP, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylgylcerin, Glycerl Mono\nStearate, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Glyceryl Sterate Citrate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantion, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, Sodium Gluconate\n\nHere comes my doubts\nI thought dr Vanita will formulate these products according to US guidelines by which first 10 ingredients should be above 1% and in descending order after which they can have any order. So the serum really confuse me. Retinol is above peptides which are 0.2 and 3 percents respectively and retinol is at number 7\nThere are two peptides which claimed to be higher are at number 12 and 13\n\nSimilarly star ingredient of the moisturiser, ceramides (1%) are at number 12 that too only one ceramide (ceramide NP)\n\nWhat you guys think? Will these productsbe effective? \n\n",

In return I got to keep 10 ozt of the recovered gold.  Basically, I processed 20 stainless steel rings that were coated in 24 it gold that they use to flash gold onto boards using plasma.  I used hot Muriatic Acid baths to seperate the gold, Aqua Regia to dissolve the gold and Sodium Metabisulfite to precipitate the gold and then melted it into shot before melting and pouring into bars/rounds.  \n\nNow I have a trip to Vegas next week.  It has been rescheduled 3 times due to Covid-19 and need a little extra cash for spending money.  I purchased a custom coin die in the form of a 18th century Spanish 8 reale and hammered a round.  It is 1 inch in diameter a weighs 1 ozt. \n\nI am putting it up for $1700 (about $80 under spot).  If there is no interest, I will consider all offers.  I will pay for overnight shipping, insurance is up to the buyer and will use a middleman if requested.  I have sold/traded some of this gold to members and if requested will ask those members to verify the product to buyer.\n\nI will also consider melting the round into shot and selling in 1/2 ozt pieces.  I do have to work early in the morning so if I do not respond immediately, I will in the morning.  \n\nPayment: PPFF, Venmo, Zelle\n\nPlease use PM's as Chat can be a little iffy.\n\nThe first imugr link is the round for sale.

    "body": "I've been brewing for 20+ years. I have my process pretty much nailed down at this point, but that also means I may have some bad habits so I'm hoping someone will recommend something I haven't thought of when trying to solve this problem.\n\nFour years ago I made my first NEIPA. It's not a style I drink too often, but that's what the neighborhood wants! First batch turned out okay, but not perfect. It was met with \"pretty good\" reviews by friends. Second batch was miraculous-- everyone who sampled it raved. One guy said it was a spot-on clone of Treehouse Doppleganger. Amazing aroma and juiciness. Looked gorgeous in the glass. But every batch since then (we're talking several attempts) have failed miserably. The same problem: out of the fermenter it tastes amazing. A day or two later in the keg it's starting to fade already. Day 3, most aroma and hop flavor are gone. One time it was so bad it tasted like grain-flavored water.\n\nI do some research and identify oxygen as the most likely culprit, even though the good and bad batches were done the same way as every other batch I've made and oxygen doesn't cause any issue with any other batch I have made. Since it tastes good out of the fermenter, my assumption was it was getting oxygenated between there and the keg. So the last two times I tried to brew it I did something different in my process and used an almost completely closed system:\n\n* I fermented in the corney keg instead of my usual brew bucket (the good batch was fermented in a bucket.)\n* Two days after fermentation really gets going, I open the keg to drop in the dry hop addition and seal it up again. (for the good batch, I did this in the bucket as well.)\n* When it came time to transfer to the serving keg, I purged the empty keg with CO2. I use a CO2 pressurized transfer process in a closed system: gas forces the beer out of the fermenter keg, through a tube, and into the now mostly sealed (valve held open or else the beer won't flow) purged serving keg.\n* Seal it, turn on the gas, and purge the head space just in case.\n* (Note: I always use sodium metabisulfite in all my batches for oxygen control.)\n\nBoth times, same result: shortly after, no hop flavor, no hop aroma. I need to figure this out. Maybe it isn't even oxygen. Could be something else. I'll take any suggestions.  Here's the recipe (same one that gave me the amazing batch, and all subsequent bad ones)\n\n* 5.25 gallon batch: 10# pale malt, 1# flaked oats, 1# White wheat malt\n* Hops (all citra): 2oz boil 10, 4oz whirlpool 20 minutes starting at 170F, 4oz dry hop 2 days after fermentation gets going.\n* WLP007 or Wyeast 1318, properly-sized starter.\n\nA few batches I did try to mix up the recipe a little bit but no luck-- same basic result.\n\nI'll listen to any ideas people have on this.",

Unless you're doing a lot of purges at 30PSI, you're probably better off doing the fill-with-liquid-and-push-out-with-co2 method.\n\nHave you tried doing everything exactly the same as your miraculous batch to see if the magic returns?",

For Ten gallons I usually add something like 8 ounces into the boil. For the whirlpool I aim for 8-10 ounces for a 30 -40 minute whirlpool. I calculate zero IBU for whirlpool. \n\nFor dry hopping I start at 6 ounces per keg. Sometimes 8 \n\nHow are you adding your hops? My above rough hop rates are using strainer bags in the kettle and muslin bags in the fermenters. So if the hops are all free you could drop the rate a little. Or not! I use paint strainer bags in the kettle and don't let them get too full, I usually use two bags one for boil additions and one for whirlpool\n\nWhen your whirlpooling use a sanitized brewing spoon to squeeze the bag to release all the oils. Get em out!!\n\nNext. Water and PH. Some if it is above my head and I don't know your water profile. If it's hard water lower the PH, remove temp hardness. Add a LB of acid malt to the mash, aim for a mash PH in the low 5s I believe. Good friend of mine owns a brewery and brews some of the best juicy beers around and swears by PH.\n\nYeast. Lose the WLP007\nUse a Vermont ale or a London ale that is less flocculent. \nI usually use a Vermont ale or a London ale (local yeast lab calls theirs foggy London) or Voss Kviek (crank it up hot!)\n\nI'm fairly lazy about transferring, I do take care to eliminate oxygen, and my beers will fade but it takes a good 3 weeks. \n\nAnd lastly not all hops are equal. I play around sometimes with varying success. But for a sure thing you can never go wrong with any of Citra Mosaic Simcoe Azzaca. Lots of other great hops too. But keep in mind your alpha acids and oil content is important too!\n\nSorry for the long rant and I hope some of this helps!",

Rather, it has a strong affinity for oxygen and inhibits microbial growth by starving them of oxygen. It doesn't directly kill them. \n\nIn large concentrations, like 1tbsp per L of water, sodium metabisulfite will provide sulphites that react with water to create an acidic solution that can work to sanitize, but this is not the intended use. Some drawbacks will be weaker sanitizing power, so you will require long contact time, probably at least 10 minutes. It will also off gas and smelling the fumes can knock you off your feet! I would also recommend rinsing with boiled water after sanitizing, another step which unfortunately reduces the efficacy of the sanitation.\n\nYou can use it, but there are better options. If Star San and Iodophor aren't available at all, I would use bleach mixed with water at 1 tbsp per gallon. It has similar drawbacks: long contact time and you have to rinse it, but it will properly sanitize and won't knock you out.",

It's a generic (e.g. not a \"name brand\") sanitizer and is extremely effective, but maybe not as safe and convenient as Star San.  If you find a local small brewery, they may be able to direct you to their source for it.  I'd almost guarantee you'll find PAA manufactured in the PI, so no tariff/import duty or extreme shipping costs.\n\nPotassium metabisulfite can be used, but it's a crappy sanitizer.

I have started following a skincare routine 11 days ago. It was a joyous Thursday for my face that, over the course of past 30 years, has been exposed to the winds, low temperatures, a late onslaught of chicken pox, persistent hormonal acne, and results of a poor diet. I also happen to have PCOS, which makes the challenge to have clear skin extra challenging.\n\nThis is our starting point. After reading through [the Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index) on r/SkincareAddiction, I had come up with the following routine to improve the condition of my skin:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# ROUTINE\n\n**MORNING**\n\n* Cleanser \\(Step I\\): **Bioderma Sensibio H2O micellar water** \\(applied with a cotton pad\\)\n   * *Ingredients:* Water, PEG\\-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Propylene Glycol, Cucumis Sativus \\(Cucumber\\) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Disodium EDTA, Cetrimonium Bromide.\n* *Moisturiser \\(Step I\\):* **Lumene Hydration Recovery Oxygenation** **gel** **mask**\n   * *Ingredients:* Water, Propanediol, Betula Alba \\(Birch\\) Juice, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth\\-20, Phenoxyethanol, Rubus Chamaemorus \\(Cloudberry\\) Seed Extract, Acrylates/c10\\-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Peg\\-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Trehalose, Urea, Eriophorum Spissum Flower/Stem Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium Edta, Copper Gluconate, Magnesium Aspartate, Zinc Gluconate, Pentylene Glycol, Serine, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Algin, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium Phosphate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Pullulan, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sorbic Acid, Potassium Phosphate, Linalool, Benzyl Salicylate, Alpha\\-Isomethyl Ionone, Limonene, Citronellol, Parfum \\(Fragrance\\), \\(Ci 42090\\) Blue 1, \\(Ci 60730\\) Ext.

Other concerns include enlarged pores, rosacea in the nose area, closed comedones, and a selection of pimples.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that my face must be as dehydrated as Gobi desert out of rain season, and so my first action was to moisturise, moisturise, moisturise! At the same time, I wanted to include products meant for sensitive skin, to decrease the risk of a breakout or adverse reaction. I also tend to avoid perfumed skincare, and that was another factor when I was picking the jars and bottles.\n\nAny critique of my routine would be most welcome! Do these products work together? Is there something crucial missing? \\(I am planning on incorporating exfoliation and sunscreen next. Also, please, don't panic — I have not seen the sun in months. Years. Or so it feels.\\) Is there something I should stop using? Am I truly a happy victim of clever marketing and a corporate\\-friendly whore? \\(You betcha.\\)\n\nSo far, the result has been a more even \\(texture, not colour\\) skin with smaller pores, but, of course, this is early days.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# QUESTION\n\nA crucial point of my morning routine, and not something normally suggested for beginners, is a mask. I apply it just before I sit down to meditate. It makes sense that, while I imagine 'a steady stream of liquid sunlight' pouring through my body, I am also using that time to take care of my skin. I have found that one action triggers the other and, altogether, that is a very happy combination.\n\nI have been using the Lumene Hydration Recovery mask for the past few days, and I want to hear your suggestions for alternatives. While I did not dislike that mask, I did not feel like it was doing much for me either. Plus, it was a gift from Finland and I am in Britain, and that does not work very easily. Lastly, I would like to try a number of masks \\(and continue to discover new awesome products\\), rather than settle on a single 'meh' option.\n\nCan you help me find the mask\\(s\\)? To sum it up, I'm looking for a mask that...\n\n* Has a 10\\-15 minute application period\n* Comes in a tube or a jar \\(i.e. not a sheet mask\\)\n* Is suitable for frequent use\n* Fits my routine \\(see above\\)\n\nSuggestions of mask combinations \\(alternating masks\\) are also welcome!",

My love for masks makes me always be on the lookout for a new one and I’ve tried many out there. \n\nI’m not really a fan of sheet masks, or I haven’t tried any that has impressed me so I won’t mention those. They feel nice and are relaxing, but that’s about it. \n\nI really love Freeman’s Apple Cider Vinegar Clay mask. You can use it as a cleanser scrub or use it as a mask, I’ve only used it as a mask. I think it can be used about 2-3 times per week, so it can be used to alternate with other masks. What I like: it’s inexpensive, makes my skin feel extra soft and clean, my skin tone looks brighter even after just one use. \n\nI got this face mask kit from [Fresh at Sephora] (https://m.sephora.com/product/picture-perfect-mask-set-P424612?SKUID=1998459&om_mmc=ppc-GG_1165716881_53825939660_pla-420369839425_1998459_257731947998_9007386_m&country_switch=us&lang=en&gclid=CKnR1YzD3toCFYPIswodzf8JcQ&gclsrc=ds) and I absolutely love every mask that comes in it. \n\nThe Umbrian Clay Mask I find really improves the appearance of pores, blackheads/white heads. It feels good and relaxing to have it on. It says to use for up to 5 minutes, but I always start doing stuff and end up using it for longer. I find this mask is nice to use as a “premask” for the Rose or Black Tea mask. I only do this about once a week, when I’m feeling fancy. \n\nThe Rose mask feels like heaven on your skin. It has this nice cooling feeling and I find it to be very hydrating, and it makes my skin look supple and radiant. \n\nThe Black Tea mask says to use 2-3 times per week. It tingles very intensely for the first minute, but after that it feels fine.  I find this mask seems to even the texture of my skin somewhat (I’ve only used it once so far). \n\nI’ve also tried FAB Ginger Turmeric Jelly Mask. I like this one better as I love the cooling jelly on my skin. I find that it gives my skin a nice radiant glow. You can use it up to 3 times per week. I tried FAB’s bouncy mask too (a sample) and I wouldn’t buy it because I didn’t see any difference and it didn’t feel as good as the other masks I love. \n\nClinique Pep Start Bubble Mask. This is a fun mask to use in the morning as you don’t have to leave it on for long. I like the bubbling effect, it makes my skin feel extra clean and revitalized. I’ve only used this 2 times in some samples I got. \n\nBoscia Luminizing black masks. I really love this one as I find it to be very clarifying, and helps with the appearance of pores. I love peeling it off, it’s so fun and i feel like it takes so much with it. \n\nI have a few others in my cabinet that I haven’t tried yet, but I’ll report back when I do.",

Here's a rundown of the stuff, and [here is an album](http://imgur.com/a/jhGwW). All prices are OBO. \n\n1 ozt gold ingot: My pet project for the past few weeks, this is 1 ozt (31.1263 g actual) of gold that I refined and re-refined. I'm a chemist, and precious metals are my particular interest. The first precipitation used sodium metabisulfite, after which the gold was washed using boiling hydrochloric acid, followed by boiling water, then concentrated ammonia, and then water again. The gold was redissolved in aqua regia then precipitated using oxalic acid while adjusting pH using dropwise sodium hydroxide. These two reductions are capable of producing up to 99.999% pure gold. I have an XRF spectrum of the sample, but my calibration file won't allow me to determine a purity that high. I'm hoping to hear from Bruker tomorrow with some results. Asking $1450 for this piece. \n\nEdit: I heard from Bruker and they analyzed my spectrum and confirmed it to be 99.999% pure. If you're interested in this ingot, I can send you my spectrum and tell you about the XRF process for assaying the metal. \n\nAlfa Aesar Premion 99.99% pure platinum: This is a 0.2313 g piece of pure platinum. The sample was originally sold as a 25x25mm square, but some of it has been used. The sample comes with the assay sheet, showing 21 ppm iron, 9 ppm copper, and 1 ppm nickel. The rest of the elements were below the detection limit. Asking $60.\n\nAlfa Aesar Premion 99.999% pure silver powder, ~120 mesh: I have two bottles of this ultrapure silver. One bottle has been opened and contains 23.85 g of the powder and the other has not been opened. The assay sheets indicate 3 ppm gold. Every other element was below the detection limit. Asking $220 for the open bottle and $240 for the unopened. \n\nAlfa Aesar 99.9% silver shot: This bottle contains 8.1626 g of 1-5mm silver shot. Asking $30. \n\nAlfa Aesar 99.999% copper powder: I have two bottles of this ~100 mesh copper powder. One bottle has tape on it and the other appears to have never been taped. Both bottles weight the exact same (62.8 g), so I'm assuming both are unopened. $200 each.\n\nAlfa Aesar 99.5% copper shot: This bottle weighs 453.2 g including the container. The shot size is 0.6-0.8mm. Asking $50.\n\nAlfa Aesar 99.99+% tin shot: This bottle is about half full. I forgot to weigh it, so I'll get a more accurate weight tomorrow. The shot size is 3mm. Asking $280.\n\nAlfa Aesar 99.999% tin powder: I have 3 bottles of this ~100 mesh tin powder. They all appear to be unopened. Asking $250 each.\n\nAlfa Aesar 99.999% low oxide bismuth shot: This bottle contains 20.2 g of bismuth shot. The shot is spherical, 1-2mm. Asking $180.\n\nAlfa Aesar 99.999% bismuth powder: I have two of these bottles and both appear to be unopened. Each bottle weighs 86.1 g. The powder is ~200 mesh. Asking $110 each. \n\nAlfa Aesar 99.95% silver foil: This tube contains an unused 150x600mm sheet of silver foil. It is 0.025 mm thick and weighs 24.3359 g. Asking $280. \n\nAlfa Aesar 99.8% copper foil: This tube contains an unused 30x30cm, 0.025mm thick sheet of copper foil. It weighs 21.5 g. Asking $25. \n\nAlfa Aesar 99+% tin foil: This tube contains an unused 150x270mm, 0.33mm thick sheet of tin foil. It weighs 105.5 g. Asking $120. \n\nAmmonium hexachloropalladate, palladium salt: This is some refined palladium salt. I wanted to see if anyone was interested in the salt, else I will convert it to the metal sponge and maybe melt it. I'll get a more accurate weight tomorrow, but it's roughly 7 grams of the salt which ammounts to just over 2 grams of the metal. There may be trace amounts of platinum mixed with it. Asking $60.\n\nTantalum sheet: This is a 1.7x2.3 inch, 0.02 inch thick piece of tantalum. When I analyzed it using XRF, no significant other peaks were noticed, so it can be assumed to be quite pure. It weighs 21.9819g. Asking $75.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions regarding these metals, as well as inquiring about the chemistry that went into refining the gold and palladium. Expect to see some significant quantities of silver, as well as a little bit more gold and platinum for sale soon. PM me if you are interested in these metals, or if you're looking for something in particular. I've been making gold nanoparticles recently, so if anyone is interested in buying some samples of those I'll see what I can do. \n\nPaypal friends and family works best for me, but if you want to use normal Paypal, just add 3% to the price. Shipping will be whatever you prefer, with however much insurance you want. USPS is easy for me. Thanks for looking. ",

I've found an excellent brown ale and Oktoberfest for my malty tap and a good IPA and juicy pale for my hoppy. I've been having a lot of trouble brewing a good, clean, crushable yellow beer though.\n\nI've tried a Munich Helles (turned out OK), Japanese lager (again, OK but a little too much hop character), and just today tapped a Kolsch. BUT... it has a really funky phenolic (I think) almost Belgian taste to it and is too boozy (the second part is my fault. Boiled too much and drove the OG up). So I'm really not a fan. I used Lallemand's Koln yeast at 64 degrees for two weeks, then two weeks at 68 to try and clean it up.\n\nI've got a small get together tomorrow which I'm bringing it to, and I hope someone there has a pallette for it and loves it so they can help me work through the keg! \n\nI have two thoughts for the phenolic taste. One is I underpitched. I typically use a single packet of US-05 of S-04 which has munched through all the beers I've thrown at them. Looking at Lallemand's website though, I definitely should have used two. The second is my water and the bisulfite I use. I started using potassium metabisulfite in powder form instead of the campden tablets (which I assume are sodium metabisulfite) I'd used for a couple of years. After that switch I started having more off flavors but chalked it up to not using enough PMB, but I'm going to switch back to campden to see if that solves it for me.\n\nSo, in closing, I ask: does anyone have a good, clean fizzy yellow beer recipe? I don't have great access to a homebrew shop so I'd prefer dry yeasts but that may also be my problem. I need a good liquid yeast (maybe...).\n\nThanks and cheers!",

I've used both the sodium and potassium variants for chloramine treatment, and didn't notice any difference.\n\nI like saisons and witbiers, fermented cool enough to keep the yeast in check.

I am using some enzymes (amylase, cellulase) to break down the fibers of banana peels and see how much sugars I can get in the hydrolysate water phase. I first deactivate enzyme with heat, and then reduce the water content by simple boiling (I can do rotovap but i m too lazy and it takes too much damn time). Then, I add absolute ethanol so that the ehtanol is around 90% v/v of the mix, which then precipitate the sugars (or it should, based on what I know about mono/disaccharide solubility in organic solvents). The problem is that because the banana peels brown really fast, the sugar precipitates are also brown. I am sure this is enzymatic browning (melanoidin most likely) at work, and I m trying to see what I can do to debrown the hydrolyzed peel masses and the sugars. Perhaps I can put sodium metabisulfite at the very beginning of the process but is there any other method you can recommend?",

        "body": "Is this even still available? As far as I was aware, Stemm was discontinued a couple of weeks ago, and the parent company Deciem was selling off their remaining stock at a discounted rate. They’re apparently going to somewhat reformulate the products and bring them back under another brand heading, but idk if they’ve done that yet.\n\nStill, if they have any left and you’re thinking about getting it, here’s my experience so far. I just got the density stimuli like a week ago, after buying it when it became discounted. I use it every night, and the instructions say to use it on a dry scalp, and not to wash it off - so don’t use it directly before or after a shower.\n\nIt’s fairly easy to massage into my head, but it’s definitely a very wet serum, and it takes time to dry, almost an hour if I’ve been liberal with it. The top of my head definitely looks like I’ve just taken a shower after I use it. Its consistency is only slightly thicker than water and it kind of trickles down your head if you don’t immediately massage it in. But at the same time, it’s sticky?! Even after it dries, even in the morning, it feels a bit sticky, which is frustrating if you’ve just washed your hair. But if I brush through the stickiness, it dissipates and my hair looks normal. That’s my biggest complaint about this product - the stickiness makes my hair feel unclean.\n\nIt also has a very natural earthy but medicinal type of smell that doesn’t bother me and that I quite like, but I completely understand if someone else would be bothered by it. The first night I used it, the smell lingered for a while, but on subsequent nights I noticed it less and less, probably because I got used to the scent.\n\nIn terms of effectiveness, this is a serum that’s supposed to increase density of growing, so it needs time to take effect. As I understand it, it probably won’t have much effect on already grown strands of hair. So I need to wait about 3 months before I actually compare before and after. But so far there has been a very strong placebo effect where the morning after, I feel like my scalp is less visible through my hair. Again, probably just a placebo effect, but I like feeling like something is actually working, so that’s why I’ve kept it up.\n\nIn terms of ingredients, I’m most interested in the fact that it has a highly soluble version of caffeine, which has been proven to stimulate hair growth. As for oils, it says in the ingredients list that it has castor oil (which explains the stickiness to me, castor oil is notoriously sticky) so maybe not the best product for you? But also, it’s very low down on the ingredients list, so maybe you can tolerate it??\n\ntbh I’m 50/50 on it so far. I might be more upset if I’d actually paid the original $30+ for it, but since it was about $13 when I bought it, I’m ok with what it’s been doing so far.\n\nHope this helps!",

Added above ingredients to must and 12 hours later freaked out because everything was everywhere and quickly learned how to use a blowoff tube, thanks to the kind people of this subreddit. I then realized I was in over my head and researched the wiki (truly beautiful) for a few hours. Learned what gravity readings are, how the yeast/nutrient relationship works, what oxidation, stabilization, back sweetening are etc. \n\napprox 6 weeks later, racked to secondary where I learned I should’ve invested in a second carboy, but found some old growlers to do the job in the meantime. They were beer bottle brown so I didn’t really know the clarity for the rest of the process which was equally frustrating and exciting. \n\nAt about the 2.5 month mark, in my excited state, I took some to try at my parents house for thanksgiving and it was drinkable but definitely still needed some aging. \n\nI ordered potassium sorbate and SODIUM metabisulfite (mistake) which I luckily did not add to the mead and instead took the course of “time is your friend” and just let it sit for about a year. \n\nBecause of the brown bottles, I had no clue what was going to come out when I bottled the finished product but voila! A clear drink! I’m a bit concerned at the small bubbles which appear to be slight carbonation and am keeping them away from people and pets just in case, but the secondary bottle has been sealed for months and there was just the tiniest fizz noise when I popped it to bottle, so not overly concerned. \n\nI know I have made many errors, probably a couple of dangerous ones even, but I have learned and will correct on the second batch which I just started today! \n\nThanks everyone!

The mead's been in primary for 18 days and I've now got my hands on some more stuff from my LHBS. Cyser is only young. Degassed and SNA for first 4 days.

My plan is to leave the original mead as a dry/traditional, but add Christmas flavours (allspice, nutmeg, vanilla, cinnamon, (pre-frozen) orange, any other recommendations?) to the tea mead.\n\nSo plan is:\n\n1. Prepare each secondary demijohn with 1 crushed campden tablet\n2. Prepare (1/2 teaspoon each) K-Sorbate in small amount of the mead it's going in, then add to each secondary demijohn\n3. Rack mead with siphon into secondary\n4. Leave traditional to rest until step 9/Bentonite addition\n5. Wait 24 hours for additives to take effect\n6. Add flavouring additions to bag and add to Christmas mead\n7. Wait for flavour to develop nicely\n8. Remove flavouring additions\n9. Prepare Bentonite slurry 24 hours beforehand\n10. Add slurry to tertiary demijohn and rack onto slurry (or can I just add to secondary and mix gently? What risks less oxygen entering?)\n11. Wait for clarity / couple weeks\n12.

Then draining and collecting the fallen gold foils.\n\nThen you would dissolve the gold into chloroauric acid by using Aqua Regia (3:1 Hydrochloric acid and nitric acid) and precipitate it out with Sodium Metabisulfite. Then you could collect the gold dust and melt it into a bead.\n\nAll that said, I've now found this [video from Sreetips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdXkUuqGF8c&ab_channel=sreetips) on Youtube that uses the Hydrogen Peroxide mixture to dissolve his gold dust and it comes out the same color as if he had used Aqua Regia. My question is, if the Hyrdogen Peroxide can dissolve the gold, why use Aqua Regia at all? Should I be suspicious that the green mixture that my eWaste is soaking in contains dissolved gold?\n\nOnce it's all done, should I try added SMB to the mixture and see if I get any gold to precipitate?",

You want to separate out all your different PM-bearing materials into separate batches with as little extra material (particularly metals) included as possible.\n\nYou don't technically need the peroxide part of AP, that just kick-starts it.  The actual reaction is (I'm not checking my stoichiometry, in case this doesn't quite balance):  \nCu + H₂O₂ → CuO + H₂O  \nCuO + 2HCl→CuCl₂ + H₂O  \nCuCl₂ + Cu → 2CuCl  \n2CuCl + 2HCl → 2CuCl₂ + H₂\n\nNotice the peroxide is only used in the first reaction (and in Earth's atmosphere, unprotected copper will *always* have an oxide layer, making that step optional but a lot faster).  So the real \"AP\" reaction is just the last two or three (you'll get some CuO formation just from the air) lines looping.  To your 2nd-to-last question, though, unless you used an extreme excess of peroxide, any gold dissolved at the beginning will precipitate out as a black or dark brown powder.  It may not be caught by cheap filters, though, so be aware that's one way you can lose PMs.\n\nYou can use the peroxide/hypochlorite (bleach) method rather than AR to dissolve gold if you're starting with fairly pure material like RAM or PCI fingers.  If you want to use AR anyway (it tends to give better results on dirtier mixes, but *not* if there's tin included - And on any ROHS board, there will be), you can skip the AP step.  AP is orders of magnitude safer, though; not that AR can't be used safely, but there are a lot more ways to casually hurt yourself, including death from NOx.\n\n/ Edit: Yeah, I butchered the reactions even with my disclaimer.  I think I have them correct, now.",

So I am really looking for a way how I can minimise the effect with the tools I have now.\n\nThis started to be an issue for me since I brewed my last Wheat IPA, and 7% IPA with 7 g/l whirlpool hop at 80°C and 7 g/l dryhop. To reduce oxigen I did the following things since I noticed my NEIPAs were turning darker and started reading about cold side oxidation on the web:- I attached a tube with a plastic bag after primary fermentation so the remaining CO2 will be blown into the bag, causing the vessel to suck back CO2 when cold crashing instead of air.- My (one big) dry hop addition was at high krausen to limit the oxigen exposure- I transferred through the bottom valve from my fermentation vessel to the bottom bottling bucket while trying to avoid splashing- Capping the bottle directly after filling with a bottling wand\n\nRegardless of these security measures this beer was the most darkened hazy IPA I've seen this far. It was already amber color before bottle conditioning was done !! The difference in this beer was the big amount of Wheat (38% wheat malt, 8% flaked wheat) I used compared to the my previous hazy IPAs (20%oats, 8% wheat malt).\n\nCould it be that large amounts of wheat are making the beer more vulnerable for discolouration?\n\nI've found a few other causes that I would like to ask your opinion about and I am looking for all tips that can help me with my *current* setup (I will make the switch to fermenting under pressure, closed transfer and kegging in the future).Please find them below:- Can aerating the wort of a beer that has a massive whirlpool addition oxidise in the time fermentation is kicking off?- The bottling wand causes oxidation? *I would think this would only be with the first and last bottle because afterwards the tubing will contain beer right?*\\- Long steeps (20mins) after the whirlpool addition causes oxidation?- Are there any other things I should consider while brewing hazy, heavily late- and dry hopped, high & wheat/oats IPAs?\n\nIt seems that my first even NEIPA was the best until now, and I really would like to find out how I can keep my NEIPAs as bright as possible and reduce the time the hop character fades (and changes in a cherry/candy like taste).\n\nAll help in improving my current brewing situation is much appreciated!Thanks\n\n**EDIT**Thanks for all the tips everyone, please see below a summary on the tips I am going to put to practise in my next hazy hoppy brew:\n\n1. Bottle from the fermenter with the bottling wand directly attached to the spigot and use carbonation tablets \n2. Don’t cold crash\n3. Don’t aerate the wort after the whirlpool, rack directly on top of yeast in the fermentor\n4. Fill balloon with CO2 and attach to the top of the fermentor while bottling\n5. Sprinkle some Sodium Metabisulfite (SMB) in the bottles\n6. Make sure there are no bubbles in the bottling wand\n7. Add a small dose of mash hops to reduce maganese\n8. Bottle with very little headspace in the bottle (+/- 5mm)\n9. Condition the beer for 1 week then try it : as soon as it's carbed and tastes good immediately transfer it to a fridge.\n10. Cut down the wheat and oats, or even replace with Chit Malt\n\nFor the future:\n\n1. Switch to kegging\n2. Switch to a stainless steel fermentor\n3. Ferment under pressure\n4. Do a closed transfer",

        "body": "Bottling NEIPAs can be done successfully. Most of the points have already been made, but just to emphasise - DO NOT transfer to a bottling bucket. That will be an instant fail. I bottle straight from primary using a spring loaded bottling wand that fills from the bottom. I prime with carb drops. Also, don’t crack the fermenter after fermentation has finished - I do the entire dry hop no later than 48 hours after pitching. This will prevent hop creep too, which can be a big problem for us poor bottlers. I don’t cold crash as I have no facility for it, but I believe it would be detrimental as well - you want lots of suspended yeast so conditioning happens fast. \n\nOther things - bottle as soon as possible. Most NEIPA yeasts do their thing in a few days. You need to get to know your yeasties, as you don’t want to be pulling off a sample to see if fermentation is done. I generally have a fair bit of sediment in every bottle. Have to be careful pouring, but if it’s been chilled for a couple of days it is no issue. \n\nWhen bottling, cap every bottle as it is filled - an assistant is super helpful. Taste them after five days - mine are generally drinkable but not super flash by then. Keep tasting. Get them all in the fridge when you can, but don’t be afraid to let 5(3: condition as long as they need - it won’t be long.",

I have never tested the difference, and doubt it would be very detectable especially at 10ppm, but that's what I do. (Has anyone tested this, and what were the findings? It could be groupthink wisdom.)\n\nPotassium Metabisulfite tastes better than Sodium Metabisulfite, which is perceived by some people as \"salty\". I exclusively use Potassium MBS now but have used Sodium MBS in the past for wines at much higher rates than 10ppm without complaints, but K does taste better so I switched. But again at 10ppm I doubt anyone would pick it out in a blind taste test.\n\nGood luck!\n\nEDIT: just a thought, 10ppm is also the amount of sulfite generally recommended as a minimum \"top-up\" for every racking in winemaking just because racking itself consumes about that much. So if you want to end up with 10ppm in the bottle, 20ppm may be a better idea. But I never add so little SO2 for a sole addition so take this with a grain of salt. I pretty much only use SO2 in beer when I'm using fruit, for up-front sanitization. I use it in every wine and mead that I want to be able to age.",

I always brewed on kegs and had no way to get hops in without oxygen ingress.\n\nMany reasons got me into buying a Fermzilla (batches big enough to completely fill keg, minimal oxygen ingress dry-hopping, collecting yeast, easier to dump hops, easier to add anti-oxidants, finings, etc post fermentation).\n\nI recently re-brewed a Session IPA and after 10 days conditioning, this beer turned out AMAZING, finally got that \"pro\" fresh/sweet fruit hops aroma that got me goosebumps. I know I can be biased towards my new investment but the day I finally tasted it I completely forgot about it, I had to take a moment to understand what made that beer so different from other batches.\n\nAll my previous beers had a very generic pineapple rind aroma/taste, ESPECIALLY that damn NEIPA, it tasted horrible. I'm aware many people have great success with buckets, kegs and other fermenters without access for dry-hopping, but I wasn't one of them even:\n\n- dry hopping during fermentation\n- purging head after closing keg\n- transfering to a new keg to avoid opening the one that was fermented, purging oxygen in the new one with iodophor\n\nThe only thing that I never tried was sodium metabisulfite because I was a bit scared of it ruining my beer with SO4, I'll start using it a bit to ensure I'm completely O2 free.\n\nNothing fixed this generic result on my hopped beers. I was kinda getting desperate and almost completely gave up on styles that required DH, everything tasted and smelled the same. But at the end of the day, dry hopping without adding much oxygen fixed everything, I feel like I turned the saturation knob to 11 on this hop aroma.\n\nHas anyone else had a similar experience? I can't wait to rebrew that NEIPA and see what that trully was supposed to be.",

Continue on the journey of cold-side LODO, it’s one of the best ways to improve beers.\n\nYou mention generic hoppy flavor. The other major factor that doesn’t get talked about enough is hop choice and focusing flavor. The only way to do that(that I’ve found in 8 years of NEIPA brewing -I’m a Treehouse local too) is to use ratios that aren’t 1:1. I like 2:1 to start, going heavier on the “showcase hop”. For me these are: Citra, Mosiac, Galaxy, and Nelson Sauvin. Then using half the amount of the accent hop: Centennial, Azacca, Motueka, CTZ, Rakau, Strata, HBC-586, Amarillo, Eldorado, HBC-1019, Zappa, Elani. Basically anything described as fruity.\n\nI flip the ratios in the whirlpool, going 2:1 Accent to Showcase, then 2:1 Showcase to Accent in the DH. [Here’s a recipe](https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/1500771/don-t-crimp-your-bangs) for an NEIPA that I just brewed so you can see what I’m talking about.\n\nGood luck and Happy Hopping!",

Some hops are very tropical fruit forward and have a pineapple flavor, and some are super strong pine resin and bitter. Picking the right hops for the flavor you want is worth looking into as you experiment. A west coast IPA with fruity hops isn't going to taste right, nor is a NEIPA with a lot of pine. \n\nAnother important thing to consider is the water chemistry and making sure you select a chloride/sulfate ratio that favors hop flavor over malt. It is a minor thing, but it can really help favor the flavors you want.",

I've done a variety of experiments/synthesis ranging from distillation of nitric acid to using sodium rhodozimate to test for lead. I wouldn't call myself \"experienced\" but I've got a pretty wide range of chemicals and glassware that I've collected. Anyway, recently I've encountered a problem in reduction of gold. I'm trying to recycle old computer parts to pay for some more equipment. But on my first run, after dissolving the gold in Aqua Regia, I noticed that the chloro auric acid was a greenish black instead of a bright red/orange, I figured this wouldn't be a problem, and I figured it was just some copper/silver nitrate impurity. Then I tried reduction of the gold with sodium metabisulfite, but nothing happened, so I tried another method and added strips of magnesium one by one. This produced a brown precipitate that I assumed was gold. So the next morning i filtered and tried my product then melted it down with an oxyacetylene torch. What was left was a small glob of copperish looking gold. It weighed less then a gram, so I assumed no profit could be made off it. So I sealed it in an ampoule for my element collection and it stayed on my desk for close to a month. But every time I looked at it it looked less like gold and more like copper. So I broke it out and re-dissolved it in Aqua Regia, the chloro auric acid was again a blackish green. I did some small scale experiments with it anyway though. First I added some sodium metabisulfite, like I did when I first wanted to reduce the gold,this time however it fissed and gradually turned a different color. In the end I had some apple juice looking liquid. I got exited at this, and I thought it was the pure chloro auric acid I was after! I put a small amount of the liquid on a watch glass and added a strip of magnesium to see what would happen. It produced a light brown precipitate, and I did this for the rest of my chloro auric acid. And now I'm confused. Does anyone know what is happening and if I have any gold? Also please tell me if I'm using any terms wrong or if there is any advice that I should have!",

How dilute are those liquids/solutions you end up with? Do they need to be concentrated by boiling?\n\nGold recovery by enthusiasts from computer parts is never going to be profitable. You are always going to spend more on reagents. Although you are 14, it's true there is also a \"time-value\" component, where you could've made more money doing something else with your time.\n\nModern CPU's have very little gold in them too. Most \"gold\" you see is actually gold plating, so it's only a few nanometers thick. There are websites that estimate recoverable gold % from different CPUs. It's usually a few milligrams or less (eg 1-3%) for \"modern\" CPU's eg. anything made in the last 10 years.\n\nIn any case gold is going to be the minority metal present. You're going to have a lot more copper, for example, and perhaps this is one of the problems you're facing with your extraction/recovery process. Your description of the color changes suggests to me you have high copper content that is tarnishing (oxidizing).",

LA is an AHA and [they are known to photosensitize](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/productsingredients/ingredients/ucm107940.htm) and be harsher than others. Retinol (retinyl palmitate) is a potent resurfacer and anti-age. I'd recommend you to either start with something a little milder or try something with PHA/LHA/BHA. Search here on reddit some suggestions of chemical exfoliants for rosacea (I use CosRX's BHA). If you're willing to try this one, wear sunscreen everyday.\n\nThe second one has Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid). Some people claim it helps treat redness because it's anti-inflammatory. I was not fortunate trying any kind of vitamin c, but i think that's just me. The problem here, in this formula, is [the orange extract](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/plant-extracts/citrus-aurantium-extract.html).\n\nThe No BS hyaluronic cream looks fine. But, as a pro tip, try to look for harsh ingredients in [EWG database](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/) or analyzing in in [COSDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ingredients.php).\n\nHope this helps! :)",

If that’s something that hasn’t been in your skincare products before perhaps it might be to blame. Cystic acne is a pretty severe reaction in any case.

    "body": "Hey guys, I'm about a week and a half into brewing my first ever batch of cider and i have a BUNCH of questions. If any of you could help answering some of my questions, i would be greatly appreciative.\n\n**My Plan**\n\nMy first attempt consists of 5 gallons of store bought juice with over 3 kilograms of brown sugar, raising the SG from about 1.050~ to 1.091. Sweet as hell, and the brown sugar has added an intense flavor to the juice which im hoping ends well in the final batch. \n\nI'm planning on Na-Metabisulfiting and K-Sorbating it and diluting it back down with some fresh pressed apple juice from my sisters apple trees, giving it a final ABV of around 5-6 percent whilst still maintaining a very apply flavor. (I'll also be kegging it to try and force carbonate)\n\nThe yeast i used was a Mangrove Jack cider dry yeast, which i'm starting to regret using as opposed to a good White Labs or Wyeast yeast.\n\nhttp://mangrovejacks.com/collections/craft-series-yeasts/products/craft-series-cider-yeast\n\n**Questions**\n\n1. Is it possible to use K-Sulfite and K-Sorbate before racking to secondary fermentation and still get the flavor smoothening effects that secondary is supposed to provide. The reason I ask is that my secondary carboy (better bottle) might be have a bit of headroom at the top and I was thinking I could kill the fermentation and add juice to decrease the surface area and still have a proper secondary fermentation.\n\n2. When sterilizing my gear, I was using sodium metabisulfite. On the bottle it says to use two teaspoons per litre of water (approx 8 teaspoons per gallon) and soak equipment for 5 miniutes. Yet a few YT videos I saw mention just spraying it on with a spray bottle and rinsing it off straight after... So I'm not sure really what to believe, just spraying and rinsing would save a lot of time. \n\n3. ~~Are sodium metabisulfite and potassium metabisulfite interchangeable for both sterilizing equipment AND for killing yeast in juices? And if so, to they both take the same dose for both usages? (Ie: two teaspoons per litre of cider when i need to kill off the yeast). The reason I ask is that it sounds like a lot... and I don't want to make a batch of toxic cider that ends up hospitalizing me.~~ [EDIT] It seems campden tablets are equal to 1/16 teaspoon of K/Na-Metabisulfite, so if when it comes time to kill the yeasts, i use 1/16 teaspoon of my tub of Na-Metabisulfite per gallon along with K-Sorbate, would that work for what I intend?\n\n4. I see a lot of people talking about having their cider foam up during fermentation, though mine hasn't had that at all during fermentation (currently back down to a SG of 1.022, almost done) so I'm not sure if something bad is happening or not. But i've heard that some dry yeasts don't foam up, is that correct?\n\n5. When i checked my SG about 5 days after starting fermentation, I took a cup out and had a taste. It was pretty fizzy and tasted rather strange (Like cider yes, but with an unpleasant taste). Will this change after the yeast drops out and racked to secondary?\n\n**---**\n\n\nI think that's it, I might be forgetting something so i'll update this post if I remember. But anyway, I know this is a lot of questions, thanks in advance for anyone who answers any of my questions!",

        "body": "> Is it possible to use K-Sulfite and K-Sorbate before racking to secondary fermentation and still get the flavor smoothening effects that secondary is supposed to provide. The reason I ask is that my secondary carboy (better bottle) might be have a bit of headroom at the top and I was thinking I could kill the fermentation and add juice to decrease the surface area and still have a proper secondary fermentation.\n\nSeveral things here.  First, you only need to K/Na Meta about 24 hours before bottling.  Longer doesn't hurt, but a minimum of 24 hours.  Second, only kill off your yeast when it's got the right flavor/sweetness/alcohol/dryness ratio that you're after.  Third, headroom is not that big a deal.  Sanitize your gear, rack slowly to avoid air exposure, and you should be good.  A lot of things that infect beer can't do much to cider due to the acidity.  The big worry here (and why you should avoid air exposure) is acetobacter, which is airborne and turns alcohol to vinegar.  Lastly, if you stop fermentation, don't bother with a secondary because it (extremely unlikely) won't spontaneously referment.\n\nA note on stopping fermentation and secondaries:  if you stop fermentation early, via a sulfite compound or some other method, it will not \"ferment\" again in secondary.  If your gravity starts dropping in secondary after you've stopped the fermentation, you've got a problem.  Also, some (not all) of the functions of the secondary are to allow the yeast to \"clean up\" after themselves, which involves removing some off-compounds and some other stuff.  They can't do that when they're dead.  \n\nSince you're looking to backsweeten it anyway, I wouldn't bother with stopping fermentation early.  Just let it go all the way dry, rack to secondary for a month or two (or longer), THEN dope it with the K-meta.  Wait 24 hours after sulfiting before bottling/kegging to make sure the yeast is all dead.  Backsweeten to taste.  Wait 24 to 48 hours to let the flavors meld and make sure your fermentation doesn't restart (happens sometimes if you didn't use enough K-Meta), then bottle or keg it.\n\nAnother note about K-sorbate:  sorbate is not a sanitzer or sterilizer, so don't use it in that manner.  It helps prevent yeast and other things from reproducing, but it doesn't actually kill anything.  Also, it's practically useless if there's a healthy yeast or other colony already present.  In fact, you can ferment store-bought juice that has sorbate by making a really solid starter.  It doesn't hurt to throw in sorbate alongside a sulfite (which IS a sanitizer) if you want to hedge your bets.  Personally, I don't bother with the sorbate.\n\n>When sterilizing my gear, I was using sodium metabisulfite. On the bottle it says to use two teaspoons per litre of water (approx 8 teaspoons per gallon) and soak equipment for 5 miniutes. Yet a few YT videos I saw mention just spraying it on with a spray bottle and rinsing it off straight after... So I'm not sure really what to believe, just spraying and rinsing would save a lot of time. \n\nI've never used a sulfite to sanitize equipment, but i'd imagine the principles are similar to starsan, iodine, and others.  Soak everything first.  The spray bottle is more for re-sanitizing things that have had incidental contact with un-sanitized things.  If unsure, follow the manufacturer's directions.\n\n> I see a lot of people talking about having their cider foam up during fermentation, though mine hasn't had that at all during fermentation (currently back down to a SG of 1.022, almost done) so I'm not sure if something bad is happening or not. But i've heard that some dry yeasts don't foam up, is that correct.\n\nSome ciders foam, some don't.  I've made dozens of gallons and only had a couple foam.  If it's going to, it will foam during the first few days.  It depends a lot on the yeast strain, ambient temperature, nutrient balance, and original gravity.\n\n>When i checked my SG about 5 days after starting fermentation, I took a cup out and had a taste. It was pretty fizzy and tasted rather strange (Like cider yes, but with an unpleasant taste). Will this change after the yeast drops out and racked to secondary?\n\nSome of the taste will change as fermentation progresses, some with aging.  Especially while a vigorous fermentation is ongoing, it will probably taste yeasty/bready, possibly with some sulfur or other off flavors.  Nothing to worry about here, as long as it doesn't taste like vinegar, and as long as it doesn't look moldy or have an oily film on top.  \n\nPrimary usually runs a couple weeks, longer for very high OG.  Once the yeast has quit or you have killed them, sitting in secondary will allow a lot (not all) of the yeast to settle out of suspension, so that will improve the flavor some.  Aging in secondary will also improve the flavor some as some compounds are volatile and will break down over time.\n\n\nIf you have other questions, feel free to PM me.  I definitely do NOT consider myself an expert on the matter, but I have read a few books and made a bunch of drinkable cider.",

        "body": "Ditch the sodium metabisulfite, Fermaid K, and DAP. Add some potassium bicarbonate. \n\nThe sodium metabisulfite will make your mead salty, which can be amazing, but it’s better to just add salt if that’s what you’re looking for. \n\nFermaid K and DAP are both sources of inorganic nitrogen. There’s nothing inherently wrong with that, but outside a few specific circumstances, Fermaid O is all you need. Using DAP, and nutrients that contain DAP, like Fermaid K, can be a bit like pouring gasoline on a fire. It can make the fermentation burn hot and fast, causing yeast stress leading to off flavors. \n\nPotassium bicarbonate is used to buffer acidity. It’s probably not something you will need or use regularly, but it’s good to have on hand on the chance you over do it on the acid, or attempt to ferment acidic adjuncts like pineapple. \n\nI’m not a big fan of the generic powdered wine tannin, and starting out, I’d argue it’s not something you need. The quality difference between whatever generic stuff your home brew shop has, and say, tannins from Scott Lab is immense. I don’t have a source for home brew size portions of tannin, but I’m sure one of the online shops has some good options. \n\nThere are a lot of different yeast strains out there. D47 is great, but make sure it’s temp range matches where you’ll be doing your fermenting. One of the most common flaws I see from home brewers is yeast stress from poor temp control. There is definitely a yeast strain that will be happy with whatever your temp range is. \n\nOne last note, avoid recipes that have you adding acid upfront( or just ignore that part). Any recipe that contains that is likely calibrated to the recipe makers water profile (or just copied from other recipes that have the same step), and can cause issues with your fermentation if it drops the pH too low. Acid adjustments should be done by taste as one of the last steps before packaging. There are plenty of exemptions to this rule, but chances are you won’t run into them starting out. There aren’t that many common alkaline adjuncts that you might need to adjust for, and your mead will ferment fine without it.",

I know There is microscopic gold in here and the guy who had it had a stroke and his kids didn’t want to bother it. I did an inventory of all he had. The only thing I went out to buy was a respirator and hydrochloric acid. The guy has a 55 gallon drum of acid in here making everything corroded. And I can’t work in here without the respirator. I took an inventory of all he has as far as chemicals. \n\nAmmonium sulphate \nCopper sulfate \nCaustic soda beads\nAmmonium chloride \nOxalic acid \nSodium metabisulfite\nZinc dust\nCoconut shell activated charcoal \nHydrogen peroxid 35%\nSodium sulfite \n\nI’m familiar with some but not much else. No nitric acid but the hydrogen peroxide and hcl I brought I know can put au into solution. But this is above my pay grade. I have an idea to get the gold out the ore. To put it in the furnace and melt the gold out, however the furnace is badly corroded due to the 55 gallon drum of acid so I do not want to use it because I do not trust the integrity of it. Inside the unit, he had broken crucibles, which told me that inside of the furnace there was spilled material, so I removed manually the slag that was at the bottom of the furnace. I found what would be copper and gold but they’re together I can learn everything about getting the gold out of The ore later. this post is how to separate the gold from the copper without melting it, using the assets that I mentioned above if possible. I was thinking about just getting a propane torch and melting it down agin but I’m not sure if that would just mix it more. I don’t like making rose gold jewelry but I would like to control how much Gold is in it. So can someone one please help me separate gold from copper I think a good idea of what I’m looking at is the last picture I have. ",

Fermentation temperature could be as much as 10F over ambient.\n\nYou can control temperature better in a basement by using a water bath, which will act as a sort of heat-sink to keep the beer closer to room temp. You can then monitor the temperature of the water and add a frozen water bottle of the temp gets too high.\n\nThe type of metabisulfate you use shouldn't matter. Has your water changed at all? Do you have a water report which shows calcium content for your water?\n\nAre you checking the manufacture date on the yeast you're using?

It's coming into summer here and will be very humid, but my skin is still dry. So looking for light but hydrating as well as skin barrier support & calming/soothing.\n\nI've tried 2 mineral SPFs (Naked Sundays and Neutrogena Sheer Zinc so far) but I think they break me out - not flaring rosacea but breaking out in areas I don't usually. So any recs for a lightweight mineral SPF for summer, or even looking at a Kbeauty one?\n\nI'm thinking a combo of *ceramides*, *panthenol, glycerin, centella, maybe oats*. I'm unsure whether to avoid HA & niacinamide for now having seen so many people react to it.

Guess it’s actually a Melomel; anyway here are the ingredients:\n- 2.5 lbs frozen mulberries \n- 18 lbs fresh figs\n- 12 lbs honey\n- 1 cup cranberry sauce\n- 2.5 tbs of tartaric acid\n- 3 tsp pectin\n- Epernay II yeast\n- Est. Starting Brix = 25 (didn’t realize it should be taken at start, then started reading this Mead subreddit)\n\nPoured 2 gallons boiling water over over honey & fruit mixture in a large stock pot.  When cool enough to handle (and with sanitized gloves) squeezed hydrated honey and fruit mixture thru cloth strainer bag into fermentation bucket. Diluted up 5 gallons with water then added pectin, tartaric acid and 1/4 tsp of Sodium metabisulfite.\n\nMixed and let sit till next day (24 hrs) then added yeast.  Tasted after 1.5 weeks into fermentation and it tasted awful, like the worst sour nasty cough medicine ever.  Allowed to ferment for about 3 weeks total - considered it done when there was no more airlock activity.  \n\nAfter it was done added 1/4 tsp yeast inhibitor and left alone for a day.  Measured Sp. G prior to adding sweetener = 0.990.  Transferred into new bucket with sweetener and added sparkolloid.  Allowed to clear up for another week then bottled.\nAfter sweetening and a little settling (2 days) really like taste, sweet and tart with a light mouth coating, although feeling some of the other flavors hadn’t fully developed yet.  A week later it’s still clearing up nicely.\n\n\nWondering if it was sweetened or bottled too early?  Also, was three weeks enough time to ferment?\n\nWill try to add photos in replies.",

    "body": " Recently my father and I have decided to pick up mead brewing as a hobby due to the quarantine. Not only because it seems like an interesting and calm thing to do but also because it seems like the easiest type of alcohol to make. After watching this video; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTudpZD3uLo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTudpZD3uLo) , that was really when the decision was made. Since this would just be for my immediate family I am planning on doing this on a smaller scale with these supplies.\n\n* Two 1 gallon glass jugs with a #6 rubber stopper and three-piece airlock for each. One is for primary fermentation and the other is meant for secondary fermentation.\n* Lalvin dry yeast EC #1118, which from what I understand produces a dry mead with a higher alcohol content (about 18%). In addition to being able to survive in a variety of temperatures.\n* A North mountain supply food-grade yeast nutrient\n* Star San high foam sanitizer\n* Campden Tablets (sodium metabisulfite)\n* Fermtech 3/8\" Mini Deluxe Siphoning Kit, Mini Auto - Siphon, Pro Wine Bottle Filler, Clamp and Tubing by UbrewUsa\n* Brewer's Elite Hydrometer & Test Jar Combo, Hardcase, Cloth - Triple Scale Specific Gravity ABV Tester- for Wine, Beer, Mead and Kombucha\n* And of course local honey\n\nI am planning on doing a warm-weather recipe with higher alcohol content (somewhere around 18%) that quite dry. In terms of flavoring, I am hoping on adding coriander seeds and blood orange. I am trying to hit a target volume of 1 gallon. I used The Mead Calculator to calculate the amount of honey, water, blood orange, and coriander seed I would use and it came out to this: 0.326 gallons of honey, 1/2 pound of blood orange, 1 cup of coriander seeds, and 0.5628 gallons of water. **My first question actually comes up here how much of my EC #1118 yeast should I use? Half a packet a full packet?** \n\nNext, there is my abridge process: put honey, water, and activated yeast in the jug. After primary fermentation (2-3 weeks) add the blood orange, coriander seeds, and the brew into the second jug. After secondary fermentation (at least 3 weeks) transfer brew into the cleaned out first jug for storage. I am planning to add a little more yeast during secondary fermentation to eat at the sugars of the blood orange and remaining sugars of the mead to make a really dry mead. My questions are as followed. \n\n* **Is it even possible to make an even dryer mead by adding yeast to the secondary fermentation? If so how much yeast would be required?**\n* **If I add more yeast would the wait time be longer for secondary fermentation?**\n* **Overall with all specific steps that need to be taken in-between how is this process?**\n* **Is blood orange and coriander seed even a good warm weather mix or would you suggest another recipe?**\n* **Is there too much coriander seed and blood orange or too little?**\n\nThanks for any help in advance.",

        "body": "Plan is pretty good for a beginner. \n\nYour nutrient is just DAP, which the yeast love, but as they get very active from gobbling it up, may cause some off flavors. A mead with only DAP for nutrient is also prone to stalling at higher abv. More info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mead/wiki/ingredients/nutrients). \n\nTo the questions:\n\n- alcohol tolerance is a function of yeast strain. 1g of well treated 1118 will tolerate 18% (ish) alcohol. 20g of 1118 will also. You can push the alcohol tolerance with techniques like step feeding (more in the wiki) but I’d save that until you have a few successful meads completed. \n\n- no, as long as the original pitch was healthy and large enough, additional yeast won’t change the speed of the ferment. \n\n- need other nutrients in addition to your DAP for this high abv. Also, Orange isn’t great dry. Might want it to finish at least a little sweet. When adding your oranges, use the flesh or juice and use the zest. Do not include the white pith. Take a bite of orange pith if you’d like to know why (it’s gross and bitter.) You will lose some volume when going in to secondary, and excess air contact when aging can make the mead oxidize and taste worse. It’s common to use a bucket and aim for a little more than a gallon, so that when you rack to your 1G carboy, it fills up. If you use two carboys, think about ways to mitigate that headspace. Some people use finished mead they already have to top it off, others use sanitized marbles or something to take up space, or you can try to purge the headspace with CO2 or wine preserver or something. A bucket is cost comparable to a carboy and probably the easiest solution. (Though they tend to leak gas at the seal, so just keep that in mind if your airlock activity seems low.)\n\n- blood orange and coriander sounds great \n\n- but a cup of coriander is a shitton. 1/2tsp to 2Tbsp is plenty. Probably two-four blood oranges worth of zest and juice/flesh.",
