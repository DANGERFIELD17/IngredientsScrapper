    "body": "I've copy/pasted this text multiple times now and decided to just make a separate post about it (and I admit I want to be lazy and just post a link instead of repeatedly copy/pasting a comment). Some of you may recognize a good portion of this, but I've added some points because I'm trying to make this post as comprehensive as possible.\n\nIn order to determine whether a product is water-based or silicone-based, you have to look at the ingredients. -Cone/-methicone, and -siloxane words near the top of the list tend to signal a silicone-based product. Water will be at the top of the list for any liquid product because water makes it liquidy. It doesn't mean that a product is water-based. Without water, the product would not be spreadable/blendable. For example:\n\nMAKE UP FOR EVER HD Microperfecting Primer Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Aqua (Water), **Dimethicone**, **Trisiloxane**, PEG-12 **Dimethicone**, **Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone** Crosspolymer, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Squalane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18 Methicone, Phenoxyethanol, Ceteth-10, Laureth-4, Ethylglycerin, Panthenol, Potassium Sorbate, Polysorbate 60, Parfum (Fragrance), Argania Spinosa Extract (Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract), C12-14 Pareth-12, Hydrolyzed Algin, Dodecene, Sorbitan Isostearate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Tromethamine, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. [CI 19140 (Yellow 5 Lake), CI 75470 (Carmine), CI 77007 (Ultramarines), CI 77288 (Chromium Oxide Greens), CI 77289 (Chromium Hydroxide Green), CI 77491 (Iron Oxides), CI 77492 (Iron Oxides), CI 77499 (Iron Oxides), CI 77742 (Manganese Violet), CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide)].\n\nSee the bold words? Definitely silicone-based! Again, the water keeps it a more liquid-y consistency so it's easily spreadable. It doesn't mean that the product is water-based. Particularly with primers, I can always tell because it has that \"silicone\" feeling. Now let's look at a water-based primer:\n\nLaura Mercier Foundation Primer - Oil Free Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Isodecyl Isononanoate, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, C22-20 Alcohols, Squalane, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Esters, Phenoxyethanol, Boron Nitride, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin Tocopherol Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hamaelis Viginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Cucumis sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Retinyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Polyamino Sugar Condesate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Chlorphensin, Benzoic Acid, Polysorbate 60, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Saccharomyces/Xylium Black Tea Ferment, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Potassium Sorbate, Green 5 (CI 61570), Yellow 5 (CI 19140).\n\nSee how there are no -cone/-methicone or -siloxane words near the top of the list? That means that it's water-based. This primer does contain dimethicone, which is a silicone, but it's relatively low on the list, which means that it contains a very small amount of silicone (ingredients are typically listed in order, beginning with what is in there most and ending with what is in there the least). Thus, because this primer contains much more water (and other ingredients) than silicone, it is water-based.\n\nOil-based foundations are exceptionally rare. After much searching, I finally found one: Alexandra de Markoff Countess Isserlyn Cream Makeup (another is NARS Balanced Foundation, which has been discontinued, so I could not find an easily copy/paste-able ingredients list). Let's look at the ingredients:\n\nWater (aqua), **Decyl Oleate**, **Lanolin Oil**, Propylene Glycol, Talc, Isotearic Acid, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetyl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Fragrance (parfum), Emulsifying Wax NF, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, PPG-12-PEG-65 Lanolin Oil, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben. May contain Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI77492, CI 77499, Ultramarines (CI77007)\n\nYes, water is listed as the first ingredient, but that is to keep the product more blendable. The second and third ingredients (in bold) are definitely oils. Phew! You don't know how many ingredients lists I went through to find that! I swear unicorns are easier to find! ANYWAY, they should play well with silicone-based primers. However, this is unlikely to be of concern to you because chances are you're not using an oil-based foundation (if you are using an oil-based foundation, check your closet for a herd of unicorns).\n\nIn general, you want water-based primers with water-based foundations (or tinted moisturizers, BB creams, CC creams, concealer, or any other base products; I'm just going to keep typing \"foundations\" for the sake of brevity), and silicone-based primers with silicone-based foundations. The two different bases (water and silicone) can cause your foundation to pill when layered on top of each other. In particular, using a silicone-based primer with a water-based foundation on top of it often causes the foundation to pill because the primer creates a silicone barrier. When you try to apply a water-based foundation on top of that, the silicone repels the water in the foundation, and the water in the foundation does not absorb properly into your skin, resulting in unevenness.\n\nPlease remember to moisturize well underneath your makeup (and to give your moisturizer time to absorb fully, meaning your skin should no longer have that \"tacky\" feeling that you have right after applying moisturizer). If you use sunscreen (which you should, especially with summer coming up), you need to let that absorb as well. The base of your moisturizer/sunscreen is irrelevant, because if you allow them to absorb completely, they will not affect makeup application at all. If you begin applying primer and foundation before your moisturizer and/or sunscreen has fully absorbed, they can cause your makeup to break up sooner, which is the opposite of what you want.\n\nAlong the same line, your powder is irrelevant to the base of your foundation/primer. There is no such thing as a water-based powder (it then wouldn't be a powder). If your powder isn't working with your foundation/primer and giving you the look that you want, it is not related to the base of your foundation/primer. Also, not everybody needs to use powder on top of their foundation, so if you're not liking the look, you may consider skipping powder altogether.\n\nAdditionally, you only need a small amount of primer for your face (a very thin layer is sufficient... your face should not feel too slippery). Do not apply too much primer. Water-based primers will absorb into your skin better, but silicone-based primers tend to sit on top of it. Using too much will create a slick film that causes your foundation to slide off much sooner. Remember that it is easier to add more (and I recommend that you add more gradually, little by little) than to take primer off of your face. Over time, you'll get used to the amount you need for your face.\n\nWhile pore-filling primers, such as Benefit Porefessional, NYX Pore Filler, and Too Faced Primed and Poreless, are designed specifically to fill in your visible pores, you can also use any primer to do this (though in my experience, they do not do as well at filling in pores as pore-filling primers, and silicone-based primers work best for filling in pores). Just make sure that you tap the primer into your pores rather than rubbing. Tapping gets the product into your pores to fill them in. Rubbing does not do the same (though you can rub afterward to make sure the surface is smoothed out) and will not give you the same pore-filling results.\n\nFinally, please remember that just because you are using two products with the same base, it doesn't necessarily mean that the products will work for you. Not every product works for every person. You may need to experiment to find the right combination for you. I highly recommend asking for samples, as they are a much cheaper (i.e. FREE) method of trying out a product. You can ask for samples of any product that can be sanitized and put in a small sample jar, such as primer and foundation.\n\nI hope this post has been helpful.

As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

I understand AHAs loosens skin cells and retinoids increase cell renewal, but don’t they end up having pretty much the same benefit? My logic has been that I don’t need to add an AHA to my routine, if I need more exfoliation I’ll just up my adapalene percentage, but please correct me if I’m wrong!

I use Pixi toner day and night, it's given me a really nice glow but it might've been too much use. I'm also using HA (unrelated to this post) but I think due to my dehydrated skin, it's becoming even more dehydrated. I will try TO's Mandelic and maybe alternate it with Pixi day to day.  I have just read a blog entry about TO Mandelic vs Stratia Mandelic and found it very informative.

Can you recommend any cleansers or toners to bring your skin's PH down to the appropriate level before applying HAs? \n\n2) Is there any issue with using two different HAs at the same time? Can I use some stridex pads and then throw some TO Glycolic Acid on top? Or do I want to wait 20 minutes in between each HA?\n\n3) If we are to wait in between HAs, then I wash my skin down to a good Ph to apply my first HA..but then 20 minutes later my Ph is going to be back to a 6. I wouldn't want to wash again, what do I do to repeatedly drag down my Ph??",

    "body": "Hiya,\n\nI hope you enjoy the below reviews. I'm just a regular consumer buying everything with my own money - i.e., nothing sponsored, etc. Note, I've bought all of them on sale for around AUD$15-20 because I like sales haha.\n\nProducts:\n\n1. PKY - essence toner;\n2. PKY - mist toner;\n3. Secret Key - fresh nature toner - milk brightening one;\n4. Benton - Aloe BHA Toner;\n5. Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner; and\n6. Purito - Centella Green Level Calming Toner & the unscented version (Purito Unscented Centella Toner)\n\nMy skin used to be severely dry but is now slightly dry on the cheek areas and slightly oily on the t-zone during summer and slightly dry on the whole face in the winter.\n\nAlso note that the below two PKY products have different 'actives'/hero ingredients notwithstanding them seemingly being quite similar! I've bolded the plant extracts under the ingredient headers below.\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Essence Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495), *Australian* websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. *Note, this one is generally recommended for people with drier skin whereas the mist version is generally recommended for those with oilier skin* Friends with eczema have also used this with success. *.* I can use both year round without breaking out. I've had friends with oilier skin who've used this one and have broken out. YMMV.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** LOVE THIS. May repurchase this for the rest of my life. I've used this after breaking my moisture barrier, after chemical peels, after active masks, and also *after getting my face ablatively lasered (after the the initial few days of only using an ointment)*. It's REALLY benign in a godly way. If you want it to do anything other than hydrate or increase the penetration of your other actives, this isn't the product for you (note, it doesn't claim to do anything else apart from hydrate & calm really).\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a little bit thicker than water but not as thick as the Purito centella toners. Won't run off your hand/face like water will but will eventually run off.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** None at allll, even when I broke my moisture barrier.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? Yes**/I have rebought this 4 or so times so far.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Mist Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance. This is in a spray bottle and is better suited to oily skinned persons.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1060395517?cpid=1060395516&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1060395517%3Fcpid%3D1060395516%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=876677637398885328), and Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/pyunkang-mist-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. This one is more for people with slightly oilier skin too. It's a lighter formula than the essence one.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Decent hydration, I prefer to use this in the toner stage instead of after my skincare but I have enjoyed using it as a 'refreshing' spray during the day.\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a nice mist, doesn't run on the face. Feels like a spray of water?\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a spray bit on top. I've had no issues with it but one mate had a couple that didn't spray properly.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** Unsure. I've rebought it once but haven't gone to use this one as much as I have the PKY essence toner or the Purito Unscented Centella Toner. I also don't like mists a whole bunch as they can go onto your clothes (if you're out) or jewellery if you're wearing any. But, I did go through a phase of keeping it in my handbag and using it when out and about for a bit of hydration.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Coptis Japonica Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Secret Key - Fresh nature Toner (Milk Brightening)**\n\n**What is it:** Hydrating toner that's meant to brighten your skin.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx.

Couldn't use it long enough to notice anything.\n\n**Smell:** A very strong scent that I could barely use it. I think I used it around 5-10 times before binning it - I couldn't even put up with the scent of this to use it on other parts of my body.\n\n**Feel:** really watery.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Fortunately (given the high fragrance), no reactions to this. If you had any irritation though, I'd expect some sort of reaction.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? No**, given I threw mine out.\n\n**Ingredients:** Not a comprehensive list given there's a generic list on yesstyle then a list below it for the main ones in the milk one but here -\n\n700ppm) \\[**sic**\\], 1, 2-Hexandiol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata Extract, Nonoxynol-12, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Tremella Fuciformis Extract, Allantoin, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Cucumber Extract, Propylene Glycol, Tomato Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Rice Extract, Lanoline, Tea Tree Leaf Water (9, Sciadopitys Verticillata Root Extract, Pumpkin Extract, Papaya Fruit Extract, Oleth-10, Viola Tricolor Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Ethanol, Glyceryl Stearate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Chamomilia Recutita Flower Extract, Morus Alba Bark Extract, Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Lemon Extract, Oleth-5, Sodium Hyaluronate, Potato Extract, Pomegranate Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Sap Extract, Bean Extract, Aloe Vera Leaf Water (9, Broccoli Extract, Glycerin, Green Tea Extract, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Hollyhock Root Extract, Witch Hazel Extract (9, Phenoxyethanol, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Mineral Oil, Ulmus Campestris Extract, Carrot Extract, Polysorbate 80, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rose Damascena Flower Water (9, Korean Raspberry Extract, Milk Protein Extract (9, White Willow Bark Extract, Psidium Guajava Fruit Extract, Witch Hazel Extract, 4-Terpineol, Algae Extract\n\nand then it says the main ones in the milk version are -\n\ngalactomyces ferment filtrate, pomegranate extract, physalis alkenkengi extract, milk protein concentrate, raspberry extract, pasque flower extract, potato extract, carrot extract, pumpkin extract, rice extract, usnea extract, broccoli extract\n\nso who really knows what's in it...\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Benton Aloe BHA Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating toner which is meant to gently exfoliate with 0.5% salicylic acid.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$23. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/benton-aloe-bha-skin-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1053033537), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** people with sensitive and dry skin as it's quite rich.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** on and off since mid 2020, still using it randomly to just use it up.\n\n**My thoughts:** Per Google (may not be accurate), it has a pH of 5.5 which is too high for there to be any noticeable exfoliation with 0.5% BHA present. I've not noticed any calming effects. It is definitely hydrating but given it's advertised as a BHA toner I'm quite disappointed at the lack of BHA efficacy here. I would much rather use the purito centella toner to hydrate and calm my skin as the centella has other benefits such as helping to stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** Similar to the PKY essence toner. Not as thick as the purito centella toners.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a pump on top. No issues with it, but it can come out a bit forcefully sometimes.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **No**, almost threw it out but am trying to use it up.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nAloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Water (80%), Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Beta-Glucan, Polyglutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea (Green Purslane) Extract, Psidium Guajava (Guava) Fruit Extract, Salicylic Acid (0.5%), Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract (200mg), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice (200mg), Arginine, Pentylene Glycol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Polysorbate 20, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** **Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 relief toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$25 for 180mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/etude-house-soon-jung-ph-5-5-relief-toner-180ml-180ml/info.html/pid.1058586258), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone. It adds light hydration with benign ingredients - akin to the PKY toners but very minimally more expensive. It'd be good if you have irritated and/or dry skin.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** I used it once/twice a day until I used it up. Bought it in December 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Pretty decent. I'd recommend this to the same group of people who'd use the PKY essence toner. Nothing ground breaking. I prefer the calming nature of the Purito Unscented Centella Toner or even the PKY essence toner if you want zero actives (if you consider centella an 'active').\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** A watery toner.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** No but for no fault of the product. I just prefer using the Purito Unscented Centella one as it's just as benign, a bit cheaper, and has the benefits of centella.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, Propanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Madecassoside, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Polyglycerin-3, Disodium EDTA\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**Centella Green Level Calming Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804) **& the** [**Centella Unscented Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380)\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating and calming toner - may also stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$30 but I've always bought it on sale for approx. AUD$20-25 for 200mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380), [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml)\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone however this is best suited to those with any sort of irritation, acne, or redness. That is, if you have basically perfect skin you're probably not going to notice much of a difference but if you have irritation etc then you'll likely fall in love. Also good if you're wanting to help stimulate collagen production especially for the low price point - target ages for this is probably mid twenties and up.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** religiously since April 2020, sometimes twice a day.\n\n**My thoughts:** *BLOODY EXCELLENT*. I'm on my second bottle of this. My first bottle was the first listed one (scented) and then they released the unscented one so I bought that! It's incredible. I love it. In my opinion, it's partially why my skin is able to tolerate me using actives so much. It's excellent to use before actives as it doesn't interact with anything and really good to use after an 'active' mask or a clay mask etc. I switched to the unscented one to just reduce the risk of irritation.\n\n*also studies, which I haven't read but have seen derms I trust on insta etc, say that* ***centella can help stimulate/produce collagen... a big yes from me given it's a calming ingredient that shouldn't purge you or break you out*** *(unless you're allergic/sensitive to it)!*\n\n**Smell:** The scented one smells herbaceous (akin to Asian herbal medicine - I don't mind it but others may). The unscented one doesn't really smell like anything / I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** thick/fat/heavy water. Not a watery toner. Enjoyable.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Neverrrrrr, this helps me reduce the side effects from using actives such as retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, etc.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **Yes** & I have. Will probably rebuy for life.\n\n**Ingredients:** 4 variants as they've got the scented and unscented versions, and then those with and without witch hazel\n\nnon-witch hazel unscented version -\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract (strengthens skin barrier), Butylene Glycol (humectants), Pentylene Glycol (skin-conditioning agents), Dipropylene Glycol (humectants), 1,2-Hexanediol (stabilizers), Trehalose (humectants), Sodium Hyaluronate (natural moisturizing factor/ humectants), Hamemelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiaticoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiatic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Madecassic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Panthenol (strengthens skin barrier), Carbomer (viscosity increasing agents), Allantoin (skin protectants), Arginine (skin-conditioning agents), Portulaca Oleracea Extract (skin-conditioning agents), Ethylhexylglycerin (skin-conditioning agents), Disodium EDTA (stabilizers)\n\nI hope these reviews were useful :)",

A lot of skincare is based on “it *should * work” theoretically, but unless it’s tested with real outside factors (not done only in a lab) like does it penetrate the skin, does it work on skin pH, does it work with other products, and many other factors, I wouldn’t trust claims like increasing collagen production. I would only trust claims I can see after using a product. \n\n\nAs far as I know, topical creams cannot generate collagen production. Collagen is created from the foods you eat. I’m not even sure you can take collagen supplements to increase collagen production because everything in your body is broken down in the same way and your body will direct the amino acids to where the body needs it most and not where you might want it.",

    "body": " Sorry in advance for how wordy this is!!\n\nSince I got a UV camera, I’ve been really interested in using it to gather some qualitative information about my sunscreen application and UVA protection and see how different sunscreens wear over time *(more info in a comment)*. I purchased mostly inexpensive options, including brands I never see discussed plus a few that I’ve seen discussed or recommended, and now I have 15 sunscreens I'm testing.  I want to share my thoughts so far of the 5 I've tested currently (full day wear test with one reapplication, 8 hours of wear after reapplication, and no makeup on top), alongside the UV imaging I’ve gathered and ingredient analysis *(more info in the comment).*  I’m also sharing where I purchased it from, when, size and price, and expiration (or manufactured) date, just in case that's relevant!\n\nNOTE: There are so many photos to go through and caption and get just right in imgur albums. Albums are kind of clunky right now, but I wanted to get most of this up while I work on the albums. I'll be first putting caption on each picture and then (hopefully) making more \"collage\" photos to help with comparisons.\n\n**My skin:** Dry to normal; more normal right now. My current routine AM leaves my skin pretty dewy when it’s humid out (micellar water, Hada Labo Shirojyun Premium, Cos de BAHA AZ, SeoulCeuticals Day Glow, Cos de BAHA CH, an TO’s Niacinamide + Zinc, then a Sephora eye cream + Vanicream Daily Moisturizer). I get itchy super easily.\n\n**My climate:** I live in a Koppen Dfb climate (humid continental or hemiboreal). Humid just means high relative humidity; it gets so cold in the winter that inside air is dry. However, Mid-May to mid-June (like, now) is particularly a warm-wet season (“warm” being subjective here, but in general, it’s a comfortable temperature that is close to inside temps). We don’t have humidity control in our home, so it can get more humid inside when it's humid outside. I think this is relevant to how skincare sits, so I’ve included weather data each day too.\n\n**How I test sunscreens for first impressions:** \n\n* **Initial swatch + wash test:** UV photo of initial swatch on my arm (as close to 2mg/cm\\^2 as I can using tape to block off a section to estimate area which isn’t perfect and then a milligram scale to dispense the right amount), comparing to other sunscreens applied in the same way. Once they all feel mostly dry, I run them under tap water while scrubbing with my hands for \\~15 seconds, then wipe a few times with a towel. Before + after image to compare. \n* **Wear test:** After my regular skincare, I apply \\~1-1.2g of product, which should be *around* 2mg per square cm (I don’t know my exact facial area, but this correlates with the rec 1/4 tsp amount). No products with additional SPF. I take photos/videos during the day of its wear as I’m able to so I can see how it wears both *cosmetically* and *under UV imaging* with my lifestyle. Will reapply once during the day to see how it reapplies, with 8 hours of wear from second application. *I intentionally leave my ears, neck, and oftentimes chest uncovered for comparisons and keep my hair down and UPF hats and jackets to help. I do not endorse leaving these areas unprotected*\n* **Facial Wash test:** I use a micellar water on the right side of my face to see how well micellar water alone works, then I’ll go in with my regular second cleanser (currently Peach + Lily Power Calm Hydrating Gel Cleanser) If I’m not satisfied after that, I’ll do a double cleanse (UV photos at each step).\n\n# #1: Innisfree Intensive Triple-shield Sunscreen SPF50+ / PA++++\n\nStylevana April 2022 |10mL/ $3.99 | Exp. 2024.07.18 | [Ingredient analysis](https://skinsort.com/analysis/orj3lja) (brand site) | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/VhPvhN5)\n\n**Testing weather:** Overcast, high of 55F, relative humidity started \\~48% and ended \\~90% with low \\~40% (3-4 hours in).\n\n**UV Filters:**  Titanium dioxide (nano), zinc oxide (nano)\n\n**Swatch + Wash***:* Initial swatch looked so light compared to other PA++++ products. I’m not sure if this is because mineral screens do reflect some UV light- I could see the little bit of reflection causing an issue, but how much of an issue would be based on algorithm. It washed somewhat away, but it seemed to wash off less than some other sunscreens (compared to initial swatch).\n\n**Wear test (cosmetic):** First application, I used 1.044g. It had a light fragrance I couldn’t place and found unobtrusive. It spread easily although it was thick, almost greasy, and didn’t really rub in. Out the tube, it is a fair flesh toned color. I thought it matched my skin okay at first, but when rubbed onto my skin, it left a subtle pink and white cast that got into my hair. This cast went away within 30 min, and it started to dry down and become tolerable.  I got itchy soon after and found the product pilled with some friction. I **reapplied** with 1.254g 2 hours in, before walking Pug. It was very difficult to rub in, getting all over my palms. About 4 hours in, I wouldn’t say it looked particularly greasy, oily, or “matte,” but you could see some product bunched up around my nose and around my peach fuzz hair. It felt like I had a heavy layer of an emollient on my face, but it wasn’t hydrated or oily; it just had a FEEL and sunk into more pores. It still pilled a little around 7.5 hours in, but mostly, it transferred when rubbed. I don’t think I could reapply a third time without feeling especially gross.\n\n**Wear test (UV Imaging):**  *note: could not get UV LED to work; all UV from outside and not consistent.*\n\n* · Initial: even though it was pretty light on UV imaging, it was darker than my non-freckled skin and covered my damage/freckling. \n* · Two hours: some of the freckling came through. **Reapplication** didn’t darken UV imaging much but increased coverage of the freckling. After the walk, some coverage started to fade but it held decently.\n* · 4 hours: it was still holding up very similarly. \n* · 6 hours: Went grocery shopping wearing a mask in the rain. I didn’t notice much difference on UV imaging.\n* · 7.5 hours: Took a nap. The freckling on my nose and cheeks showed through, including on the side I didn’t lay on. \n* · 9.25- 10 hours: a significant amount of freckling showed through, but there was still *some* darkness? So it wasn’t totally rubbed off.\n\n**Facial Wash Test:** Micellar water was able to clean a bit of it, but not enough or me to feel comfortable doing this while camping. A gel cleanser seemed to get most if not all of it. I used an oil cleanser after just to see if there was anything left- not sure, but I think I just missed washing it off my eyes initially. I think a regular gel cleanser with some more friction would be enough to get this one off, but I’d prefer oil for ease.\n\n**Final Thoughts:** Although it held up decently throughout the day and didn’t seem to wear off unevenly, I want to see other all-mineral sunscreens under the UV camera and research UVA absorption of typical higher-titanium-than-zinc mineral sunscreens before I determine my comfort about UVA protection. At the amount I used, it doesn’t look or feel cosmetically elegant for a while. I wouldn’t want to reapply more than once in the day, hard stop (I wouldn’t even want to reapply once, tbh) Additionally, it advertises as being reef safe, but there is competing thoughts about whether nano zinc is actually reef safe. The full size is cheaper per mL than the mini (50mL/$13.99), but I definitely wouldn’t repurchase for me. I don’t think I’ll use again.\n\n# #2: Bellflower Avocado Moisture Sunscreen SPF50+ / PA++++\n\nStylevana April 2022 | 50mL/$8.99 | Exp 2024.01.14 | [Ingredients analysis](https://skinsort.com/analysis/lpicp1u) | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/XKnEBeZ)\n\n**Testing weather:** Sunny, high of 72F, relative humidity started \\~60% and ended \\~56% with low \\~30% (5-9 hours in)\n\n**UV Filters***:* Uvinul A Plus (3.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150, 2.4%), Tinosorb M (2.0%), Iscotrizinol (1.2%) *(concentrations found on brand site, not listed on package, but ingredients matched up between site and package)*\n\n**Swatch + Wash:** Seemed to fair decently- nicely dark to begin with, and while definitely washed away a bit, that was as expected but not significantly more than the others in its test batch. \n\n**Wear test (cosmetic):** Initially used 1.165g. Didn’t notice a scent, felt mostly like a face cream- like too much face cream, actually, but it didn’t pill, and no cast. Once settled, my skin felt soft and smooth. Started to itch while I was at the park with Pug, possibly from my hair or allergies, but no sweat. Husband and I went to lunch and bathed Pug after, and I didn’t notice anything skin-wise. I **reapplied** 4 hours in with 1.162g. Reapplication was significantly more difficult- like trying to put more cream on a face that is already very well moisturized. It pilled a bit around my mouth, perhaps due to my lip balm. Took about 30 min to settle in. It does leave a bit of glow on my face throughout the day, but I didn’t feel *oily.* When I scratched my face for whatever reason, I noticed product underneath my nails. It balled up on itself in the folds of my upper eyelid and a bit near my nose. At the end of the day, my skin felt great.\n\n**Wear test (UV imaging):** *note: most from outside UV.*\n\n* · Initial: content with coverage (matched UV filter in my glasses), looks lighter than some of the others\n* · Two hours: some overall coverage loss with particular patchiness around cheeks and nose where glasses rub, but difficult to tell due to higher UV index and glare. \n* · Four hours: significant wear on cheeks and nose, esp on left side. **Reapplied**. \n* · Six hours: Touched my face a lot which during the interim, which was noticeable in imaging especially around jawline and chin with some freckling showing through. \n* · Eight hours: Coverage around the whole face seemed consistent with six hours, but increased freckling shown around jawline, cheek, and nose (esp left side). The sunscreen seemed to stay on actually where my glasses hit my nose- maybe it stayed on my glasses? I also noticed some freckling show up on my forehead. \n* · Ten hours: Just a little more rub off in same pattern. \n* · Twelve hours (8 hours post-reapplication): further wear on cheeks, jawline, nose, forehead, esp temples. Wear is not totally even.\n\n**Facial Wash Test:** Micellar water was able to get a lot but there was still a noticeable amount left. Gel cleanser was able to get most if not all off. My face felt sticky after, though, so I did use an oil; maybe some benefit to that.\n\n**Final Thoughts:** In general, I like this one, especially because it doesn’t pill and feels moisturizing. However, it’s hard to use the recommended amount and reapply throughout the day. It wasn’t hard to remove, with nearly all of it being removed with a gel cleanser. Although its coverage under UV imaging faded noticeably over 2-4 hours, I personally would be comfortable with this being a “one and done” sunscreen if I was just inside at home, in the shade, not getting wet or sweaty. I’d like to do a longer test to see how if it sits well under makeup, can work as daytime moisturizer, and doesn’t cause comedones.\n\n# #3: Frudia Ultra UV Shield Sun Essence SPF 50+ / PA++++\n\nStylevana April 2022 | 50g/$8.99 | Mfg. 2022.04.07 | [Ingredients analysis](https://skinsort.com/analysis/eglitvw) | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/FJzzDHR)\n\n**UV Filters:** Octinoxate, Uvinul A Plus, Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150)\n\n**Testing weather:** Partly cloudy to raining/thunderstorms, high of 72F, relative humidity started \\~77% and ended \\~74% with low \\~40% (7 hours in)\n\n**Swatch + Wash:** I was comfortable enough with how dark it is via UV imaging, but the wash test made me wrinkle my nose a bit as most of it seemed to wash away, so I was worried it would fade quickly with any friction.\n\n**Wear test (cosmetic):** Initially applied \\~1.06g. It felt thick and a bit greasy- like a cream I’d want to use maybe a third of the amount for my whole face. It spread easily but did not “rub in” or settle quickly, which left my face a little white. It has a familiar spring-summer feminine fruity scent that I can’t place. Glow was still noticeable 4 hours post-application. No tackiness, but it had a weight on the skin. I **reapplied** with 1.09g after 4 hours, and it was very difficult, barely rubbed in which looked *weird* and white, and just made my whole face feel *heavy*. I kept trying to rub it in because it felt so bad. I had to take some of it onto my neck to make it tolerable. For the first time ever, I felt *grease trap oily*. Although it got better over time, manageable about 4 hours after reapplication, and pleasant enough 5-8 hours after application, overall, I felt like my usually dry skin was transformed into “glazed donut gone wrong” for too long. No pilling on my hands, but the product did ball up a little during wear, especially around my eyes.\n\n**Wear test (UV imaging):** (this is when I figured out how to make sure my UV LED always works, so UV is more consistent)\n\n* · Initial: Fantastic coverage, easily covering all my freckling. \n* · Two hours: some rubbing off along left cheek + jawline as typical, can see some minor freckling on right cheek and near my hairline. \n* · Four hours: more coverage loss esp. around the left cheek and jawline, more freckling on forehead and nose. **Reapplied** at this point, which brought it right back up to amazing coverage. \n* · Six hours: Some wear in my usual pattern + around my hair line, but less visible wear than from 2 hours post initially application. Less face touching + starting with a thicker layer anyway. \n* · Eight hours: Was out with husband but hadn’t eaten yet. General wear with some freckling starting to peek out, mostly around temples, cheek and jawline and a bit around my mouth and nose. \n* · Ten hours: A little rain exposure, a greasy burrito, and pug kisses. More visible wear on cheeks and forehead, much more visible wear on the chin, around mouth, and nose. \n* · Twelve hours: More pug kisses and face touching. Freckling very noticeable all over, especially on forehead. More friction on left side obviously shown. Still some coverage in general.\n\n**Facial Wash Test:** Micellar water clearly took off some, but even after two passes, it was far from clean. My gel cleanser, washed with my hands and then gone over with a washcloth, seemed very effective; I only initially missed a couple spots near my inner canthi. I did not feel the need for oil.\n\n**Final Thoughts:** Like the Bellflower, Frudia holds up well enough through normal day friction for my own comfort. It’s easy to wash off with a gentle gel cleanser, which combined with a poor wash test result makes me question it’s sweat and water resistance. Cosmetically, Frudia failed for me. Maybe it was just the high relative humidity? It felt heavy and oily, even hours post-application. Reapplication feels very gross because of this. I don’t even want to try it under makeup because I cannot see *anything* layering well over it in this amount. I’d be interested in how it would look with less product, but I don’t want to have to reduce my sunscreen use to make a sunscreen tolerable when I could just use a better product. \n\n# #4: Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun : Rice + Probiotics SPF0+ / PA++++\n\nStylevana April 2022 | 50mL/$13.19 | Exp 2024.09.20 | [Ingredients analysis](https://skinsort.com/analysis/wivm8vc) | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/MVXwljP)\n\n*(note: brand site’s ingredient list has camellia sinensis leaf extract, which was not on my package)*\n\n**UV Filters:** Uvinul A Plus, Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150), Tinosorb M, Iscotrizinol *(note: same as Bellflower, in same order on packaging)*\n\n**Testing weather:** Sunny, high of 71F, relative humidity started \\~69% and ended \\~49% with low \\~25% (10 hours in)\n\n**Swatch + Wash:** Swatched dark enough for my own comfort. I had issues with my UV camera with it though- a lot of glare and settings reset after washing - so it’s more difficult to see in the pics. Some of my skin showed through after the wash test, and where I didn’t scrub as much was actually visible. I think it washed off more than most others in its group.\n\n**Wear test (cosmetic):** Initial application was fairly easy with \\~1.10g of product. It spread well, only needing a bit of additional rubbing without pilling. I did not notice a scent. Dried down in 5-10 min. Skin had a glow but did not feel heavy or oily. I did get a little itchier than usual after dry-down, and my skin felt a bit tight, but this could be environmental. Skin was tacky to touch. Pilling was noticeable with any friction an hour in, and there was minor visible pilling near my ears. **Reapplied** 1.07g after four hours, which was harder and greasier, but settled within 10-15 min. It felt tacky and left a noticeable glow. Pilling was visible around my eyes and a little in my hair. Four hours after reapplication, I felt like it looked good, just a bit dewy, and by 6 hours I definitely felt like my skin looked like “normal” skin.\n\n**Wear test (UV imaging):** \n\n* · Initial: very easy to cover all my freckling, although coverage was patchier.\n* · 2 hours: touched my face a lot due to the itch. Freckling showed through basically everywhere with a significant loss of coverage where I usually touch + even where I touch less.\n* · 4 hours: More wear especially under my eyes and forehead. Uneven wear. Less freckling noticed than with the Frudia overall, but it wore off more in spots I generally touch. **Reapplied** to good overall coverage.\n* · 6 hours: Wear pattern particularly noticeable on left cheek with visible finger marks, but less wear from 4-6 hrs than from initial to 2 hours. More wear above left brow, but in general sunscreen has held well over forehead.  Patchiness on the right side, but little freckling shown.\n* · 8 hours: Larger/deeper freckles more noticeable on my left jawline, lower cheek, chin, forehead (near hairline especially), and tip and bridge of nose. I can see a clear scratch line.\n* · 10 hours: Freckling significantly more prominent all over. Area on my right mouth/chin/jaw area where I had my tongue out briefly has significant more wear\n* · 12 hours: Not much difference from the left side, but freckling much more visible on the right side, chin, and forehead.\n\n**Facial wash test:** One pass with micellar water cleaned most off, but I couldn’t get more off with additional passes (same round). Gel cleanser cleaned nearly if not all of it, and I didn’t need oil cleanser.\n\n**Final thoughts:** Compared to the other 3 I’ve tested thus far, it is less moisturizing than the Bellflower or the Frudia, which means it actually dried down without feeling overly greasy, but it was still moisturizing and dewy. For me, this is a good thing, although I think the dew is at least in part related to relative humidity. However, it wore off more throughout the day, particularly with touch, with more freckling showing through, and it noticeably pilled. It might work better under makeup that the other two, though,  because it's so much less dewy, and I’m interested in trying it that way.\n\n# #5: Innisfree Hyaluron-Moist Sunscreen SPF50+ / PA++++\n\nStylevana April 2022 | 20mL/ $6.99 | Exp. 2024.08.23 | [Ingredients analysis](https://skinsort.com/analysis/sj-ouqu) | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/IXJnnF8)\n\n*(note: no ingredients on packaging, could not find on Innisfree website, taken from YesStyle)*\n\n**UV Filters:** Uvinul A Plus, Ethylhexyl triazone (Uvinul T 150), Tinosorb M, Iscotrizinol \n\n**Testing Weather:** Overcast, high of 68F, relative humidity started \\~52% and ended \\~51% with low 25% (7 hours in)\n\n**Swatch + Wash:** Out of its swatch group, this one excited me the most. It definitely looked dark in initial swatch, and while I don’t think it held up the best with the wash test, it still held onto some protection.\n\n**Wear test (cosmetic):** Initial application of 1.05g was easy enough to apply. It sunk in nicely within 5 min of application, although it left a somewhat tacky, dewy finish. It smelled *strongly* of lavender (which I *hate*). I wanted to vomit. After dry down, any friction led to pilling, but the tackiness did go down soon I spent the whole day working (literally nearly 10.5 hours), so I was too busy to pay close attention to appearances. It itched slightly in the morning for the first few hours, but this did go away eventually (or maybe I just got too preoccupied?). Five hours in when I was able to take a break, and there was still some dewiness particularly on my forehead, cheekbones, and nose, although my face didn’t *feel* greasy. I **reapplied** \\~1.20g five hours in. Reapplication was not too difficult, needing just a bit of extra rub in and wait time, and it mostly sunk in within 5 min, although it stayed pretty dewy. I noticed a little more pilling after reapplication dry down, but particularly where my face was *not* as dewy. 12 hours post initial application (7 hours post reapplication), I still had a bit of a healthy glow.\n\n**Wear test (UV imaging):** \n\n* · Initial: Some difficulty spreading it around- cosmetically it was fine, but with UV imaging it was hard to spread the right amount. Although it looked dark, it was difficult to get an even application and some areas, such as my hairline, forehead, and under my right eye still had some freckling show through. I even initially missed a whole section between my right eye and root of nose. I was able to rub in a little more after I took photos to remedy this (but it did lead to pilling)\n* · 2 hours: Noticeable freckling along both lower cheeks and jawline. Pretty significant freckling noticed on nose. Some wear visible near hairline. Some loss of coverage under eyes.\n* · 5 hours: Significant freckling on right cheek, sides of nose, nasal root, and chin. Increased noticeable wear on the left cheek. Significant wear at temples. Freckling started to be noticeable at the forehead, but there was still significant darkness. **Reapplication** brought it back to great coverage\n* · 7 hours: Most wear around mouth with some freckling noticed on cheeks, chin, and nose. Finger lines around jawline.  Roughly the same amount of wear from reapplication as 2 hours post initial application. I rubbed my forehead around and got some pilling which did not show changes on UV imaging.\n* · 9 hours: Significant wear on my nose especially with a lot of freckling coming through. Interesting wear pattern on the left hollow of my cheek. Not a lot more wear around my right cheek, but the finger lines were still present. More wear around temples and freckling noted on chin. A little wear on mid forehead.\n* · 11 hours: Overall loss of coverage indicated by general lightening in imaging. Freckling noticed all over with the most significant on my nose.\n* · 13 hours: Strong freckling visible basically everywhere, though oddly, right seemed worse than left. Wear was pretty significant at this point.\n\n**Facial wash test:** I could definitely get a lot off with my micellar water, but there were still some patches where it was difficult to remove. My gel cleanser appeared effective to remove the rest. The overall image after removal was darker than some of my other sunscreens, but I think this is more to do with the UV LED light having a smudge on it, distance from the camera, etc. I was fine with not using an oil cleanser.\n\n**Final Thoughts:** I think it looked the best on my skin, and I think it was subject to a little less coverage loss with touch specifically than the BoJ throughout most of the day, but it pilled quite terribly. I could maybe overlook that, but the *smell!* I absolutely abhor lavender scents, so this is entirely not the sunscreen for me. I should’ve realized this before purchasing, but I’m dumb. Also, the full-size is more expensive than the mini I got (50mL for $17.99, 0.360/mL). I would pay that much for a good sunscreen I want to use, but I don’t want to use this ever again. It’s also not listed on Innisfree’s website, so I wonder if it’s being discontinued (I wouldn’t be mad).\n\n# Parting Thoughts\n\nAfter I finished testing these, I estimated my facial area using blotting paper to determine how much sunscreen I *really* need to use, since 1-1.2g felt like major overkill with every sunscreen. Long story short, I only need about 0.78g of sunscreen for my face. Based on this knowledge, I think use and reapplication of all the sunscreens I test will be easier and more cosmetically elegant aiming for about 0.8-0.9g (erring on caution). Going forward, I’ll be using this much instead (obviously, both Innisfree ones were total busts for me and I won't be using those again). I also want to be more consistent with UV imaging and rely more on the UV LED on the camera than on natural UV.\n\nI tested these all out in succession over 5 days, and we had a pretty “wet” week with higher humidity. Higher humidity days typically correlated with greasier feeling sunscreens, which I think is something worth exploring. In drier months, I can especially see the dewy sunscreens working better, so I'm not tossing the Frudia yet.\n\nI tried the Bellflower at this lower yesterday, and I found it felt better to apply, easier reapply once in the day, and overall felt better on the skin, though it was still pretty moisturizing and dewy.  I still think I will try it without moisturizer underneath as well. I also tried the BoJ again using the smaller amount and without my typical moisturizer underneath it (currently wearing, \\~5 hours post-reapplication). Cosmetically, it is wearing a little better and seems to be wearing off less. I am liking it a lot more than I did initially.\n\n**Upcoming sunscreens:**\n\n* Round 2: Farm Stay Cica Farm Nature Solution, Farm Stay Oil-Free UV Defence, CosRx Aloe Soothing, Sun Bears Strong Cool Plus, and Kose Suncut Tone Up UV Essence in the mint color\n* Round 3: Neogen Dermalogy Day-Light Airy, Elizavecca Milky Piggy Sun Cream, Etude UV Double Cut, Sunkiller Perfect Water Essence, and Purito Daily Go-To.\n* Currently considering purchasing to test (\\*means they have suggested by other AB users): Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Sun Cream\\*, Etude Sunprise Watery Light\\*, Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel\\*, romand Zero Sun Clean\\*, Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence, Kose Suncut UV Perfect Gel Super Water Proof, Allie Facial Gel UV EX, Anessa Prfect UV Sunscreen Skincare Milk, Dear Klairs All-day Airy Sunscreen (releases in 6 days).\n\nIf you have any recommendations, I'm all ears!",

        "body": "**A note on the UV imaging:** \n\n* **Camera info:** Fenchilin UV Test Camera for iOS, purchased on Amazon, with the UVLOOK app. The only problem I’ve had is sometimes the UV LED is too weak to use (it related to my battery case I think\n* **Camera UV detection:** Unable to find info from Fenchilin, but based on what I’ve read online, UV cameras like this one detect UVA, from 320-400nm. Thus, it does not detect UVB, and it doesn’t quantify UVA at different wavelengths. Algorithm to convert UVA amount into shade depth is unknown, so we can’t assume that something that is twice as dark = twice as good UVA protection. Generally, the lighter something is, the more UVA light is being reflected into the camera. How bright it can look depends on how much UVA light there is possible which depends on many factors, such as location, time, season, weather, shade coverage, etc. How a photo or video actually looks will also depend on settings.\n* **Camera settings:** I can adjust iso, contrast, brightness, and saturation. Not really sure what saturation does since it’s black/white. I try not to fiddle with these too much, especially on same-day tests, but sometimes the app crashes and resets the settings I prefer. \n* **Data I take from this:** Subjective, qualitative data to get some idea how UVA protection compares and how it wears off/washes. It’s possible that UVB filters could wear or wash off differently from UVA. \n* **What I look for:** Mostly comparing my bare skin vs where the sunscreen is (contrast between the two) and how much “deep freckling” (sun damage) shows through\n\n**About ingredient analysis:**\n\n* **Ingredients list:** Taken from packaging. If no English list is available, I find a source online and use Google translate to compare and adjust as needed. However, some don’t have info on the packaging so I can only go off of online lists. Brand website preferred for this. \n* **Ingredient analysis:** SkinSort, which analyzes ingredients like cosdna or incidecoder, but it gives a quick, visual representation of some properties (eg, alcohol free or fungal acne safe). It’s not perfect but good for quick scanning. No comedogenicity rating though, so copy/paste the list into cosdna for that if needed. I intentionally did not save them in SkinSort as specific products because I was worried about the verification process.",

    "body": "Part 2 based on u/winwinnwinnie’s comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/Hair/comments/t82slz/mending_split_ends_part_2_with_castor_oilsebacic/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nYou can temporarily mend split ends together with the ingredients polyquaternium-28 and PVM/MA copolymer. Most products that claim to mend split ends don’t have these two ingredients. Also, both ingredients are required for the mending to work and withstand other stresses like combing. \n\n#Here’s the study done on these two ingredients showing the semi permanent mending effects: \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/6111412_Semi-permanent_split_end_mending_with_a_polyelectrolyte_complex\n\n##Brief explanation:\n\nThe cationic, anti static ingredient **polyquaternium-28** is attracted to the anionic ingredient **PVM/MA copolymer**. The idea is that damage and split ends are anionic so the polyquaternium-28 is attracted to them and will bind them together until it is washed out. In the study, these two ingredients were shown to bind together split ends and also withstood the stress of combing.\n\n#Here are some products I FINALLY found that have these two ingredients:\n\n#[Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum 4 oz ($20)](https://www.frendsbeauty.com/kim-kimble-healed-ends-serum-4oz.html)\n\nIngredients: \n\nWater (Aqua), **Polyquaternium-28**, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Arctium Majus Root (Burdock) Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail Extract, Malva Sylvestris (Mallow) Flower Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Saccharum Officinaru (Sugarcane) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Lactic Acid, Ethylhexyglycerin, Betaine, Hexylene Glycol, **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Dimethicone PEG-8 Meadowfoamate, Hexapeptide-11, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nThis one has **polyquaternium-28** as the 2nd ingredient, then some oils, a bunch of extracts, then the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 17th ingredient. Phenoxyethanol as the preservative is fine here since it is being used on the ends, not on the scalp.\n\n#[Color Proof SuperRich Split Ends Mender 3.4 oz ($11)](https://www.beautyplussalon.com/color-proof-superrich-split-ends-mender)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Glycerin, **Polyquaternium-28**, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Fragrance (Parfum), **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Polysorbate 80, Caprylyl Glycol, Linalool, Citric Acid, Limonene, Sorbitan Oleate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Citronellol, Citral, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Quaternium-95, Propanediol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Hydrolyzed Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Lentinus Edodes Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Benzoate, BHT, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate.\n\nThis ingredients list is interesting, **polyquaternium-28** as the 3rd ingredient is awesome, but the 4th, 5th, and 6th ingredients are two preservatives and a fragrance. That’s fine, as xanthan gum is also a thickener. Then the 7th ingredient is the **PVM/MA copolymer**. Then there’s a bunch of emollients and extracts and another preservative that is annoying to see in products. \n\n##This one contains Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, a **formaldehyde releasing preservative**. This is fine, as the formaldehyde is how it preserves the product, but it is always good to be aware of these things, so you don’t let the bottle sit for a very long time, as this ingredient **releases formaldehyde slowly over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[White Sands The Cure 24/7 Serum 3.38 oz ($20)](https://sleekshop.com/products/white-sands-the-cure-24-7-serum.html?sku=whs09-3-38-oz)\n\nIngredients:\n\nDeionized Water, **Polyaualerium-28**, **PVMMA Copolymer**, Xanthan Gum, Caprylic/Capric Acid, Triglyceride, Cyrribidium Grandilorioum Flower, Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate, Fragrance.\n\nThis one has a much more simple ingredients list! **Polyquaternium-28** is the second ingredient and the **PVM/MA** copolymer is the third ingredient. Then there is xanthan gum to thicken and preserve. \n\n##However, again, at the end of this list we have **formaldehyde releasing preservatives**: **Diazolidinyl Urea and Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate.** Again, this is fine, but good to be aware of so you don’t let the bottle sit for a year, as these preservatives **slowly release formaldehyde over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[OGX Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream 6 oz ($9)](https://www.ulta.com/p/locking-coconut-curls-air-dry-cream-pimprod2005306)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater (Aqua), Tapioca Starch, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Polyquaternium-37, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Polyquaternium-28**, **PVM/VA Copolymer**, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Lecithin, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nHere we have tapioca starch to reduce any heavy oily feel. Then some emollients and oils. Then **polyquaternium-28** as the 7th ingredient and the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 8th ingredient. Then there’s some more emollients and then the preservative and a fragrance. Phenoxyethanol is a fine because this is for use on the end of the hair, not the scalp. \n\nSo there you have it. You can semi-permanently mend your split ends. It took a LONG time for me to find products that actually had the *combitnation* of BOTH of these ingredients. \n#So if anyone else finds more products that contain polyquaternium-28 and PVM/MA copolymer, please share here!\n\nAlso, for those that can’t tell, the links are imbedded in the title of the product. So, for example, you can click on the title Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum at the top of the post and it will take you to the website. The links are imbedded in every title",

        "body": "So I was looking into [Physiogel Calming Relief AI cream](https://incidecoder.com/products/physiogel-calming-relief-ai-cream) in more depth, and I'm so confused about the ingredient Palmitamide MEA aka PEA aka Palmitoylethanolamide. Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

    "body": "For the purposes of this review of multiple products, I’ll be *categorizing items by routine placement* rather than when it was introduced.  These items are very much YMMV but I thought it may be helpful for some who are newer to AB (seen with the large influx of newbie questions I’ve seen in the DHT) or even those wondering about products generally.  Also **this isn’t a particular look at my routine(s)** or how my routine has transformed as I’ve learned more about my skin; rather, this review is of products used to target particular concerns.  This mega-review really came about after a response comment from /u/theCuriousAmerican (whom I thank for keeping me and much of the board in the loop regarding newer products/ lesser known brands in Korea).  I am over 30 but I haven’t started picking out my coffin lining just yet (rose gold silk, plz) so be aware this isn’t really an anti-aging post as I don’t consider myself having “mature” skin (whatever that means).  As I go through reviews, I’ll also include my rational as to why I purchased a product if it wasn’t impulse and link any relevant posts from the sub that informed my purchase. \n\nI've decided to break up this review and present categories like a series.  This post will be centered around 1st cleansers, hydrating toners, and serums.  The second post will be centered around oils, moisturizers/occlusives, and masks. *Also, I will only discuss AB/ sub-related products*. While I went through a smattering of samples, they will not be discussed. All products discussed were used for at least 2-3 months, if not longer. \n\nAbout my skin prior to developing a skincare routine: \n\n- extremely oily\n\n- flaky under makeup (my makeup would separate in hours and have dry patches)\n\n- riddled with closed comedones (whiteheads)\n\n- bumpy skin texture (under the skin pimples)\n\n- uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation (PIH)\n\n- icepick scars\n\n\n**1st Cleanser**:\n\n\n*Heimish All Clean Balm*\n\n- Ingredients: [Posted from CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2186231803.html) so take with a grain of salt as anyone can add or delete ingredients. \n\n\nI've been using this balm since February. My initial impression was satisfaction. It melted well (not as well as Clinique's Take The Day Off), a slight herbal/citrus smell which didn't bother me, and a lower price point than TTDO. The price is really the main positive of this product. I don't find it cleans as well as TTDO so I have to use more product to make sure everything is eliminated. Nowadays I don't even wear a full face or any makeup at all really except Heroine waterproof mascara and Beauty People Lip Tattoo. I usually let this balm sit on my face for a minute or two before going at it and it does remove most of these products. Into May, I'm still satisfied with this product. Sometimes I only use this cleanser at night if I wasn't wearing anything but sunscreen since it does the job and I've worn a full face and it does remove base makeup well enough (even though I need to use more of it). It'll also last a bit longer, I'm thinking 2-3 more months, so at least 6 months of use for me. I also like that this comes in travel size (I got a few from a Ohlolly.com promo).\n\n\nRepurchase? I'd likely repurchase TTDO if choosing between the two, yes TTDO is more expensive but I liked that it removed makeup easier, it melted better as well. \n\n\nFor my next 1st cleanser, I'll likely repurchase TTDO or make my own cleanser as a way to dupe Tatcha's oil cleanser (beautiful cleanser, only had a sample but loved the feeling). \n\n\n**Hydrating Toners**\n\n\n*Kikusamusane High Moist Lotion* (30 mL decant)\n\n- Ingredients: [From CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_5173202878.html)\n\n\nRemember mid-2016 when kikumasamune was on everyone's lips? I purchased a decant of this hydrator partially on the [buzz](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3tgula/a_letter_to_kikumasamune_high_moist_lotion/?st=j2jobol7&sh=17239e4e) created by the sub and other blogs.  This product seemed like a good way to target PIH and increase hydration for my dehydrated skin.  It took me about 2 months to get through my decant. I'm not gonna go through my use of this product because it's been discussed by this sub so much (do a google search). \n\n\nRather, I'll discuss why I ended up not purchasing a full size of this product. I ended up not purchasing a full size because by then I felt my skin didn't need what the Kiku was offering. I didn't get any significant lightening of PIH, brightening yes but I felt I could get brightening from other products. I could get hydration from other products as well.  And I suppose I just wasn't *impressed* enough to want to purchase it. This was also when I realized I get bored of products and the thought of purchasing a 500 ml product seemed so daunting to finish. LOL. \n\n\n*Hada Labo Albutin Lotion Moist*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Arbutin, Disodium Succinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Methylparaben, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose Ether, Sodium Hyaluronate, Styrene/VP Copolymer, Succinic Acid, Tremella Fuciformis Polysaccharide (from hadalabousa)\n\n\nI recently finished this product (mid-April) and I'm so happy I never have to use this product again. LOL. I purchased this product in December on ABX. I primarily purchased it because of its ingredient list and was interested in using a product with MAP and Arbutin to see if it could attack my PIH in anyway. Also, I felt it would be another good addition for my skin that leans perma-dehydrated. Little to no smell, watery texture, and economical. \n\n**Performance**: Overall, I was significantly disappointed by this product and the longer my time away from this product the more I'm able to realize why I'm disappointed.  It just didn't do anything. It felt like I was throwing cloudy water on my face most of the time. Cloudy water that wasn't even showing a difference in my skin. I would take days off from using this product and saw no difference in brightness to my face. I also saw no lightening of PIH. I expect my toners to hydrate *at least* and it seemingly failed on this front as well. I added another toner to back up this one but I don't like wasting product so I finished it. I found it as a good way to give myself lotion masks and to hydrate my legs. Essentially, this may be the most boring product I've ever tried. \n\n\n*Meishoku Extra Moisturizing Lotion Moist* \n\n- Ingredients: [From cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f35b176780.html)\n\n\nI purchased this toner around December from the r/abx with the Hada Labo moist.  I didn’t know what to expect purchasing this product but I did based on the ingredients. I was searching for a product that had ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. I should also add that I was searching for a product that had the 3-1-1 ratio because my face does best with a pretty constant use of acids and I needed something that would deliver on the moisture front. \n\n\n**Performance**: I can't actually say much about this product which I don't know if that's good or bad. It's slightly thicker than the HL moist, it's more moisturizing than HL and I feel like it does more than HL ever did. I still enjoy using it after all this time and I may even repurchase. It absorbs quickly, has no discernible smell, and is pretty economical for the amount you receive vs how long it lasts. If the product ingredient listing is correct and I understand how each ingredient fits, this product may have the 3-1-1 ratio (plz, correct me if I'm wrong as I'd love to know for sure!).\n\n\n*PyunKyang Yul Essence Toner*\n\n- Ingredients: Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\nMy newest toner purchase.  I’ve been using this toner for about 3 weeks so I can only give a first impression.  My main interest in this toner was sparked by [Gothamista’s YT review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9_mJoK4gr4) of this product when she covered the 7 skin layer method.  I was interested in finding another hydrating toner to try out the method as I felt that HL was too thin and really felt more like I was patting ‘cloudy water’ on my face every day. \n\n\nAbout the PKY line: The PKY line was developed by the Pyunkang Oriental Medicine Clinic (info provided by Ohlolly.com).  It boasts a list of ingredients commonly found in these types of products but I was especially interested in milk vecht root extract, which is an extract that I haven’t come across much in products. (NOTE: I've been searching high and low for any clue of what this ingredient does topically, can't find anything.) I’m a bit of a lover for simpler aesthetics.  I like it when bottles are plainly labeled and look like they belong in an apothecary.  In this sense, PKY hits all my wants; sleek and simplistic design, electric blue bottle (hard plastic), and **no** dropper. \n\n\n**Performance**: What I expected from this product was hydration and I can say this toner delivered.  The liquid is slightly thicker than HL lotion moist but not too much.  I live in a high humidity area and we’re going into summer but I don’t expect to rotate this toner out of my routine.  I tend to only need 2-3 layers for the skin method when I’m using this toner. I’ve tried doing up to 7 but my skin calls it quits in absorption around layer 5. But I'm also wondering if this product just isn't as easily absorbed as meishoku. I think this product would be a great skin soother, since it comes across as so ...mild and inoffensive (if that makes sense). \n\n\nHave I seen a discernible difference in my skin using this product?  I don’t think so. I would notice more if my skin didn’t get the proper hydration it needed from this product but I haven’t seen that. \n\n\nMISC: There is no discernible smell but I’m not sensitive to smells.  The bottle is 6.7 oz which is a lot of product and likely this bottle will last me at least 8 months, making the price ($19) very economical. \n\n\nIf I didn’t think I’d have another toner waiting to be purchased, I’d say I’d repurchase this but I already have my sights set on toners by kyotosilk and swanicoco.  \n\n\n**Serums**\n\n\n*OST20*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Ascorbic Acid, Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Butylene Glycol, Glucose, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Xanthan Gum, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Flower Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Glycerin, Zinc PCA, Panthenol, Niacinamide, t-Butyl Alcohol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ubiquinone, Diisopropyl Adipate (from Wishtrend)\n\n\nI'm going to be honest, I won't say much about this product because this sub seems to have a love+hate relationship with it. But I feel like a complete *sucker* for using this product when Timeless's Vit C formula exists. Reviews by [Holysnails](http://www.holysnails.com/2015/03/a-rant-on-osts-c20-and-c215-serums-and.html) and [Fiddy](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2017/01/04/vitamin-c-serum-101-timeless-vitamin-c-serum-review/) and [sub reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4edywb/timeless_vitamin_c_e_ferulic_serum_review_with/?st=j2joba2v&sh=f554f12e) should have had me clicking to Timeless's site. \n\n\nBut no, I tried OST20 first (at least I don't have to wonder) came away disappointed (easily oxidized, serum-like feeling, faint smell, and a bit tacky on the skin). If I regretted purchases this would likely be the ONE I regret most, especially after using Timeless (water-like feel to the skin, subtle scent, stabilized with vit E and ferulic acid, great pricing). NOTE: Please purchase from Timeless's site, while offered on Amazon I can't say for sure that is Timeless's vendor. \n\n\n*Stratia Rewind*\n\n- Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, 2-Dimethylamino Ethanol (DMAE), Panthenol, Hydrolized Rice Protein, N-Acetyl Glucosamine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Tamarindus Indica (Tamarind) Seed Extract, Hydrocotyl (Centella Asiatica) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA\n\n\nAgain, this is another product that is known enough in the sub that I don't really feel like I need to say much. I purchased this product based on the ingredients. I wanted something with niacinamide + nag and licorice. Also, I wanted to support an independent maker who I know was knowledgeable about skincare. I was really interested to see what this product would do for my skin. NOTE: I purchased before stratia dropped the use of biokelp ferment so I've never tried the newest formulation. \n\n\nFor skin feel, this product was slightly oily but sank in well enough. I found it slightly hydrating/moisturizing but not heavy. It really did help with providing a boost of moisture to my skin while being soothing. \n\n\n**Performance**: Overall, I didn't see any significant change in my skin except for moisture/hydration. My PIH was not lightened and I didn't see significant brightening and really that's what I wanted. \n\n\n*Hungarian Water Essence*/*Mizon Hyaluronic 100 Serum*\n\n- Ingredients (BELIF): Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Officinalis(Sage) Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Peucedanum Graveolens (Dill) Extract, Alchemilla Vulgaris Extract, Rose Extract, Poncirus Trifoliata Fruit Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, *Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, *Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, *Nepeta Cataria Extract, *Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Leaf Extract, *Baptisia Tinctoria Root Extract, *Stellaria Media (Chickweed) Extract, +Alchemilla Vulgaris Leaf Extract, **Equisetum Arvense Leaf Extract, **Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Leaf Extract, **Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Triethylhexanoin, Tromethamine, Sclerotium Gum, Ammonium Acryloyldimethltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Trisodium EDTA, ***Fragrance, Citronnellol, Limonene. *Napiers Original Formula. **Napiers Aqua Formula. ***Fragrances of Natural Origin.\n\n- Ingredients (MIZON): Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Copper Tripeptide-1, Butylene Glycol, Sclerotium Gum, 1,2-octanediol, Ethylhexyl-glycerin, Tropolone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Carppyl/capric Triglyceride,Hydrogenated Lecithin, Stearic Acid, C12-c20alkyl Glucoside, C13-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholesteryl Hydroxystearate, Cholesterol, Ceramid 3, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Betula Platpyhlla Japonica Juice, Portaluca Oleracea Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, Amica Montana Flower Extract, Artemisia Absinthium Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Gentiana Lutea Root Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Rasberry) Fruit Extract, Beta-Glucan, Adenosine, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA\n\n\n**Performance**: I'm putting these two together because I felt like they acted as similar products. Very inoffensive serums with little to no scent. I couldn't pinpoint to their overall effect but I will say that when I started mixing them together before application I saw a def increase in the ...bouncy-ness of my skin. I can't explain it and I'm little miffed that separately they didn't perform but together I loved the effect. I refuse to purchase extract water as I got a deluxe sample size from Sephora (Belif got me on the moisturizer train already) and Mizon did very little for my skin alone so both were a dud in my opinion. \n\n\n******\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nI suppose I should discuss my skin now. Overall, I'm pretty happy with where my skin is although I think I'm gonna need laser work for some PIH or start on tret. I don't get flakes even in the face of all the actives I through at my skin. I barely purge (except for retinol) and I don't break out really. When I do breakout, it's usually from products/ environmental, not hormonal. I guess I have a semi-glow, although IRL I just look semi-sweaty or really shiny with makeup on. I'm not as oily and I usually don't get oily until about 4PM now and my makeup no longer separates. \n\n\nI think what's made the largest difference is introducing a hydrating toner. Before this I cleansed and moisturized but hydration was a key element that I wasn't getting. Adding hydration was such a wonderful step towards aiding my skin and I really think that in those who are new to AB, learning the importance of hydration is critical in understanding your skin. ",

What I have found to work the most for me  has been a monthly Glycolic peel (20%) coupled with regular (2-3 times a week) exfoliating and of course niacinamide and Alpha arbutin and sunscreen that blocks against HEV and IR  to stop new pigmentation from forming. It's a nightmare to maintain  but it was the only thing that works. I did try tret, the 0.5 one but it was really really drying on my skin and darkened my pigmentation unless I exfoliated which made it more dry. Such a pita.",

I have issues with my makeup separating/flakes becoming more visible as well :( and I have yet to find a satisfying solution for it. \n\nI'm normal, but lean dry and I feel like I've never seen my moisture barrier fully restored, which is probably leading to the separation of my makeup.. Do you think the hydrating toner made the difference for your makeup as well? Have you been using the same face makeup throughout the usage of these products?",

All of these do not have fragrance. Both Isntree creams are great for daytime use (gel cream in the summer and moist cream in the winter). The Illiyoon Ato Lotion is for the body and even face if you prefer a little more occlusivity with a balanced moisture and has been a great all-arounder and extremely economical. Innisfree Ato Cream is a great choice is you really want to lock it all in overnight.***\n\n**My Skin: c-c-c-c-c-COMBO.

It is extremely hydrating, but  in the winter, it really lacks in the 'locking in water' department. I'd say this texture and performance is really similar to the cult-fave Belif Aqua Bomb and is a lot cheaper. It gives a burst of hydration with a hint of moisture, does not have any stickiness, and does not pill with sun protection layer. Has not caused any breakouts for me, but of course, avoid if you have a HA sensitivity or live in dry climate. People with pure oily skin will have more longevity in using this throughout the year. I probably will not repurchase because I love to try new products, but I have enjoyed using it and it practical price. Overall a great no-frills gel-cream.*\n\n***Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Moist Cream:***\n\n* Store: Jolse\n* Price: $10 (sale)\n* Size: 100 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_d36c550998.html) Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Dipropylene Glycol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Betaine, Behenyl Alcohol, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Water, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Cynara Scolymus (Artichoke) Leaf Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Eclipta Prostrata Leaf Extract, Pteris Multifida Extract, Beta-Glucan, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Methylpropanediol, Fructooligosaccharides, Raffinose, Ceramide NP, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Pentaerythrityl Distearate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Cholesterol, Folic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Polyquaternium-51, Tromethamine, Ammonium-Acryloyldimethyltaurate-Vp-Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA\n* **Review:** *I also used this cream for 6 months, and this is a great daytime cream for the winter. The texture here is more reminescent of Belif Moisturizing Bomb and is even more economical! This cream gives alot of moisture and balances a little bit of hydration and emollience. It takes in a bit more time to rub in and it is slightly sticky after application but that feeling goes away fast especailly when layering with sun protection. I have had zero breakouts using this cream and I recomend this for combination skin that gets drier in the winter. I have also used this at night, but I prefer a little more occlusiveness. It may be good for oily or combo skin at night if you prefer a lighter cream. I probably will not repurchase because I love to try new products, but I have also enjoyed using it and it practical price. Overall a great no-frills moisturizer and I look forward to try other products from Isntree.*\n\n***Illiyoon Ato Ceramide Lotion***\n\n* Store: Olive Young\n* Price: $37 (1+1 deal)\n* Size: 2x 528 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2f20551004.html) Purified Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Shea Butter, Cyclopentasiloxane, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Hydrogenated Poly (C6-14 Olefin), Clohexasiloxane, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Perilla Frutescens Sprout Extract, Magnolia Kobus Flower Extract, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA (Ceramide PC-104 32.75ppm), Mannitol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Caprylate, Dimethicone, Diisostearyl Malate, Lauric Acid, Myristic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Stearic Acid, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Alcohol, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cholesterol, Palmitic Acid, Propanediol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Disodium EDTA\n* **Review:** *I have used this for a month on both my body and my face, and I think out of all of these this is my favorite. I think some may not like that it leaves thin film of occlusiveness, but for me that is a plus. Locking in moisture is critical for me. It truly excels as a body cream because it does not feel sticky. This lotion is filled with so much goodness such as ferments, ginseng (korean antiaging plant), shea butter, and a bit of ceramide. It melts in to your skin and moisturizes it well. In the winter, I also enjoy it as a both a day and night face cream too since it is more emmolient and occlusive than the Isntree HA Moist Cream. Out of all the purchases, this has been a must purchase forever for my body and has an added bonus that I can use it on my face when I want to mix up routine.* \n\n***Innisfree Ato Soothing Cream***\n\n* Store: Jolse \n* Price: $23 (sale)\n* Size: 150 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_bdc7551007.html) Purified Water, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Glycerin, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Panthenol, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, C14-22 Alcohols, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Bislauramide MEA, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Arachidyl Alcohol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Cholesterol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Xanthan Gum, Sorbitan Isostearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA, Madecassoside, Glucose, Arachidic Acid, Myristic Acid, Acorus Calamus Extract, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Tocopherol.\n* **Review:** *I have also been using this cream for a month, and it is a very impressive barrier cream. It is buttery and harder to rub in, but this will 100% lock in your routine. Judging by its formulations and comparing to Innisfree Derma Formula Green Tea Probiotics Cream, I can guess that it is about 3% cermamide. This cream does not give much moisturzation, but if you are using a layering a routine it will seal all of the steps in, especially layering an emulsion before it. I feel like with this cream, it has an antiaging effect because my fine lines has redued probably due to its effectiveness as a barrier cream formulated with the ceramide and centella antioxidants! This one will be loved by those with dry, sensitive, or combo skin that loves a good barrier cream. I will probably repurchase, but I know there are other products to try in a similar catagory!*\n\nEdit: Added details addressing fragrance :)",

    "body": "**Liquid Gold Review, or: How I learned overexfoliation is a bad thing**\n\n**TL;DR:** If your moisture barrier is damaged, this stuff will seriously change your life. Support an up-and-coming indie shop and repair your moisture barrier, all without breaking your wallet.\n\n**Background:** I recently upped my skincare game considerably through the infinite wisdom and patience of r/SkincareAddiction and r/AsianBeauty. I’ve always been both a science nerd (currently working myself through a Masters program to be a physician assistant) and a product junkie, and those two things have gloriously collided over the last few months to the benefit of my skin! The AB side bar has an excellent list of blogs, one of which I fell way down deep into is The Acid Queen. Alli, who runs the blog, is a seriously impressive DIY’er, which allowed me to get involved in her guinea pig pool for testing product formulations she was currently tinkering with. I’ve spent the last five weeks testing her moisture barrier repair moisturizer, Liquid Gold, and here are my thoughts! The formatting of these sections is shamelessly ripped from bloggers whose reviewing formats I admire: Fiddy Snails, Skin & Tonics, Fan-B, Snow, and of course, Her Majesty The Acid Queen Herself ;)\n\n**What it’s supposed to do:** Liquid Gold is a moisture barrier repair moisturizer/emulsion. (For more info on what a moisture barrier is, see Skin & Tonics excellent moisture barrier post linked in the sources.) Liquid Gold takes your thinned out, red, overexfoliated, stinging, weakened skin and makes it supple, bouncy, strong, and able to tolerate some serious heavy-lifting from acids and actives. It accomplishes all this with the magic of CERAMIDES *oooh ahhhh*\n\n**How to use it:** We’ve got two recommended options here. The first is a thin layer all over your face as the first occlusive step of…well, however many of those you have. The second is a thicker layer as a deeper moisturizing sleeping pack of sorts. I’ve been going with option 1, twice a day every day, AM and PM. Its consistency is slightly thicker than a serum, but not as thick as a gel cream or oily despite the ingredients list (more on that in a moment). It’s BRIGHT yellow-orange from the sea buckthorn, but spreads pretty easily and only leaves the tiiiiniest yellow cast after I’ve spread it in. However, my paleness makes Casper the ghost look like a tanning bed addict, so I imagine on most other skin tones it wouldn’t be visible at all. One of the things I love about this product is how quickly it dries down. I’m (gleefully) looking down the barrel at 15+ steps in my PM routine, so anywhere I don’t have to wait for dry time, I’m a happy camper. I don’t wear makeup often, but I’ve brought it out a number of days to see how Liquid Gold plays under makeup. I’m pleased to say it holds up just fine, without makeup settling into fine lines, caking, or otherwise disintegrating throughout the day.\n\n[**Here's some photos of it in action!**](http://imgur.com/a/knjp4)\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (Aqua), Propylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Polyglyceryl-3 Methyglucose Distearate, Rosa Mosqueta (Rose) Hip Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Seed Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Fruit Oil, Panthenol, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Squalane (olive-derived), Cetyl Alcohol, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA.\n\n**Notable Ingredients:** Oh, man…all of them?! This ingredients list is STRAIGHT FIRE if we are talking moisture barrier repair. Let’s break that down, shall we? I’m going to limit my highlights because otherwise I will literally never finish this review.\n\n**Ceramide Complex** (Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP; Phytosphingosine; Cholesterol): The Beauty Brains, another fabulous “science of skincare” blog, has a great discussion of ceramides (see sources for link) and describes them so: “Ceramides form a kind of water-proofing barrier in the upper layers of skin. They’re not only critical for helping skin retain water but they also help repair the skin’s natural barrier and regulate cells. Ceramide production dwindles with age which can result in dry skin, wrinkles and even some types of dermatitis.” The other important thing to know about ceramides is that they are team players. Ceramides without fatty acids and cholesterol won’t get you very far. Specifically, ceramides penetrate best with a mixture of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% fatty acids. So maybe you’ll find a product with ceramide floating around in the ingredient list, but good luck finding one with all three players…and if you do, cross your fingers they’re in the optimal ratio. Except that’s exactly what we have in Liquid Gold. Hell yes.\n\n**Niacinamide:** Why hello, my old friend! I’ll let the Queen herself explain the wonders for niacinamide: “One of the most studied skincare ingredients, niacinamide does everything: smooths fine lines and wrinkles, increases ceramide and fatty acid synthesis, regulates skin cell turnover, fades hyperpigmentation, evens skin tone, and has powerful anti-inflammatory properties.” Naturally then, it seems like niaciamide is in errything these days, but who knows how much is in there? Niacinamide is most effective at 3-5%, so unless the percentage is disclosed, we’re left stacking niacinmide products to reach that threshhold. Liquid Gold has 4%, which happens to be the same amount you’d get if this ingredient was included in a Curology prescription. Jackpot.\n\n**Sea Buckthorn:** Again, from The Beauty Brains: “[Sea buckthorn is] known for being rich in a number of bioactive compounds, including the following: vitamins A, B1, B2, C, D, K, and P; omega 3, 6, 7, and 9; 43 lipids, organic acids, amino acids, folic acids, tocopherols, flavonoids, phenols, terpenes, tannins, [and] 20 mineral elements.” Okay…but what does all that do for your skin? Well, we’ve got some studies that show all that goodness adds up to improved wound healing, protection from UV damage, and increased collagen production (see sources for link).\n\n**Rose Hip Oil:** High in oleic and linoleic acids, both of which are polyunsaturated fatty acids important for the integrity and regeneration of skin cell membranes. More moisture barrier magic going on here, my friends.\n\n**Okay, but seriously…**everything in this ingredients list is AMAZING. And rightly so, that’s the whole idea behind DIY in the first place: if you make it yourself, you know everything is there for a reason without any fluff or fillers.\n\n**How it worked:** And here’s where the other part of the title of this post comes into play. I have a long and glorious history of overexfolating my skin because…well, basically because that’s what I thought I was supposed to do. Physical exfoliants, all sorts of acids, inappropriately high strength retinoids…I would throw them all at my face at once every single day until literally my whole top layer of skin peeled off in sheets in the shower and I was shiny and red as a cherry. Even normally gentle products would sting like the devil, and I never questioned it because I honestly thought that’s how it was supposed to work. I’d fry the life out of my skin until I couldn’t handle it (so like 3-4 straight days of all this), then take a break for a week, maybe less, and then I’d start all over again. It was a roller coaster, let me tell you, and I did this for years. \n\nThen I found this post on FutureDerm that totally blew my mind about setting a schedule for building tolerance to retinoids (see sources for link). So I mapped out my schedule for all 24 weeks and promised myself I would be patient. I went without actives for over a month, then took another crack at one night with lower strength Tazorac, my drug of choice. Disappointingly, I still peeled like a snake for the next three days, despite babying my skin before and after the Tazorac. The next week, the same thing. I was beginning to doubt the wisdom of the retinoid tolerance schedule.\n\nEnter Liquid Gold.\n\nI got on Alli’s testing list and got a bottle in the mail soon after. I am not exaggerating when I say this is literally the most amazing shit I have ever put on my face in my life. Redness starting receding within days. A night with retinoids was no longer followed with peeling, pain, redness, or stinging — all of my hallmarks of a compromised moisture barrier. I tentatively and slowly moved through increasing the frequency of the retinoid. Once, twice, three times, four times a week, two interminable week periods per increase. So far, so good. I can feel fairly confident that Liquid Gold is the responsible party here since the rest of my non-actives routine stayed stable while I was tinkering with how to reintroduce them after my hiatus. Gradually, I added all my actives back in so that now, here’s what I’ve got going on my face: 1) Tazorac 0.05% gel 4x/week; 2) Curology 0.009% tretinoin, 9% azelaic acid, 1% clindamycin every night; 3) Paula’s Choice Resist 2% BHA morning and night; 4) Timeless 20% Vitamin C+E Ferulic Acid serum (AM only).\n\nEvery time I wash my face, I think today will be the day I finally overdo it and start feeling my barrier damaged again. BUT NO. My skin feels strong, bouncy, resilient, and looks glowing. My husband pokes me in the face, nods knowingly, and declares, “Chok chok.” He’s right. Now, I’ve been throw actives at my face like there’s no tomorrow and my face takes it like a champ. Eventually, I’m hoping to add in an AHA and up my Tazorac to 0.1%, but my schedule says I’m not allowed to do that for another few months. I’m glowing like the goddamn North Star thanks to all those actives, and I can keep coming back for more thanks to the almost surreal talents of Liquid Gold.\n\nI started to panic a bit the closer I got to the end of my bottle since this was a DIY formula since I absolutely had neither time time nor inclination to whip up a batch myself and didn’t know what I would do when I ran out. The day before I was about to email Alli and beg her to keep making me some forever in exchange for my first born child, SHE OPENED HER OWN SHOP ONLINE!!! This is the best news my skin has ever had. I immediately purchased a 60 mL glass pump bottle of Liquid Gold for $24 from Stratia, The Acid Queen’s shop website. After having such a fabulous experience with this, you better believe I threw Rewind, her DMAE serum, into my cart with a quickness. \n\n**Conclusion:** This shit is my life now. It let’s me go active-crazy without unduly compromising my moisture barrier and makes my skin feel stronger than it has in my entire life. It’s affordable, pleasant to use day and/or night, well-formulated, conscientiously packaged, and made in-house by a fellow skincare junkie on the other side of the country. I couldn’t be happier to love this product and have the opportunity to support her shop.\n\n[Stratia Skin, Liquid Gold, $24](https://www.stratiaskin.com/collections/skincare/products/liquid-gold)\n\n*Disclosure: I was asked to write a review of this product that was originally intended only for Alli to read for formulation feedback and my experience with the product. I only decided to write it for public consumption when I realized she was opening the shop and other people could get this product. I did not accept the product with an agreement to review it positively, nor have I received any monetary compensation for doing so. All opinions expressed above are my own.*\t\n\n**Sources**\n[The Beauty Brains: Is sea buckthorn oil good for skin?](http://thebeautybrains.com/2014/07/is-sea-buckthorn-oil-good-for-skin/)\n[The Beauty Brains: Is rose hip oil good for anti-aging?](http://thebeautybrains.com/2015/01/is-rose-hip-oil-good-for-anti-aging/)\n[The Beauty Brains: Are ceramides good anti-aging ingredients?](http://thebeautybrains.com/2015/04/are-ceramides-good-anti-aging-ingredients-episode-77/)\n[Stratia Skin: Liquid Gold](https://stratiaskin.com/products/liquid-gold)\n[Skin & Tonics: The Importance of Fatty Acids, pH & the Moisture Barrier: How I Eliminated my Acne & Decreased my Skin Sensitivity](http://skinandtonics.com/the-importance-of-fatty-acids-ph-moisture-barrier-how-i-eliminated-my-acne-decreased-my-skin-sensitivity/)\n[The Acid Queen: Fun with DIY: Beginners Recipe Shopping List](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/02/16/fun-with-diy-beginners-recipe-shopping-list/)\n[The Acid Queen: Fun with DIY: Moisture Barrier Serum](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2015/11/03/fun-with-diy-moisture-barrier-serum/)\n[FutureDerm: 11 Things You Never Knew about Retinol and Retinoids Until Now](https://www.futurederm.com/11-things-you-never-knew-about-retinol-and-retinoids-until-now/)",

I just wanted to add some  impressions and my skin type.\n\nI have dry, sensitive, always-red skin with hormonal acne. I tested Liquid Gold on half my face for two weeks and it didn't cause any visible changes. No increase in acne, no miraculous redness reduction. I find it very minimally moisturizing. My skin still feels dry and tight after letting it sink in (which I agree happens quickly) and I have to follow it with a heavier moisturizer (or three.) There is just a tiny amount of stickiness and little to no slip after it dries/absorbs.\n\nI, too, have been trying to find a way to use actives without over-exfoliating. Daily use of a mild BHA and AHA has proven too harsh in the past, so I've been increasing in frequency very  slowly and now I'm up to every other day with no discomfort or peeling, even when combining BHA and AHA and using my stronger products.\n\nI'm really happy with Liquid Gold and see myself using it indefinitely. The price and ingredients speak for themselves, and the packaging is really nice too. One last thing I just thought of: I was showing it to my mom and she had an irritated spot on her hand from a cut or something, so I put this on that spot and she said it was amazingly soothing.",

I read your earlier post on Top 10-20 Cleansing Oils & Gels also. \n\nI'm looking to introduce a new cleanser to my daily routine and was playing with the idea of an oil cleanser.  So much choice, but this should make it easier.  Ideally, I'm looking for something without propylene glycol. butylene glycol, essential oils or added fragrance.  And no parabens - was shocked to see Phytomer still incorporating these!  The ATrue Black Tea Cleanser in your previous post looked interesting; simple list of ingredients, although ironically green tea is the first ingredient in the list, rather than black tea!  Aromatica Orange Cleansing Sherbet looks interesting, as does Clinique - so simple but effective.  Have you any idea what Kakadu (reference Sidmool) means??\n\nWhich do you use incidentally?  You are probably more geared up than most to recommend?  Thanks again.  Bev",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F18 (umar badh gayi but dimaag nahi 💀)**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , acne (pustules, fungal and cystic) pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae ](https://preview.redd.it/fnjipguox9ma1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d880ff6b482ade3f03237375ef02cdd64fb4e3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl  Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a  fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\n* **The Derma Co.** **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum** \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredient list** : Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would  get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation. I found this really mediocre.\n\n* **Axis-Y Complete No-Stress Physical Sunscreen \\[SPF 50+ PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1450 for 50ml (bought for Rs.999 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily combo skin types. those with dry skin like mine, might find it a bit more drying. good one for sensitive skins since it has a lot of calming ingredients as well!\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick white cream. fragrance free but has very strong ayurvedic smell. matte finish. physical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Zinc Oxide, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propanediol, Titanium Dioxide, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Caprylyl Methicone, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Disiloxane, Niacinamide, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Water, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Stearic Acid, Aluminum Hydroxide, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Copaifera Officinalis (Balsam Copaiba) Resin, Tocopherol, Squalane, Allantoin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5\n\n**filters** :\n\n* zinc oxide (mineral filter)\n* titanium dioxide (mineral filter)\n\nthis had been on my 'to buy' list for such a long time! and I finally got it during a march beauty barn sale! when I first tried it, I was really skeptical since it gave me a pretty bad whitecast and smelt so weird. I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :(  but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nupdate : this ones a hard no for me. is it calming? yes. but the whitecast is too much. and when i sweat it literally looks like I'm secreting milk from my skin  (~~nipple)😭😭~~\n\n**rating** : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure! in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh. I feel like this one is getting over sooner than others in my ss ki theli 😫 but either way, if you find a good deal on it, blindly add this to your cart and order it. you wont be dissappointed!\n\nrating : 5/5 and WRP on reduced mrp only.\n\n* **Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun : Rice + Probiotics (SPF50+ PA++++)**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1530 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1200 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : dry, sensitive, acne prone and combination\n\n**texture and appearance** : creamy white lotion (ya nasty-). unscented ( ha, ha , aur socho ashleel cheeze 🤡)\n\n**ingredients list :**   Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Water, Glycerin, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Behenyl Alcohol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Sodium Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Water, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/​VP Copolymer, Polyisobutene, Silica, Caprylyl/​Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Bifida Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacillus Ferment,Streptococcus Thermophilus Ferment\n\n**filters :**\n\n* uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nthis deserves all the hype it gets on the net. my current and forever HG sunscreen (unless they change formulation). seriously this ticks all the boxes . no whitecast? check. great filters? check. doesn't make you face look like you rub pan grease on it? check. it absorbs so well and is more moisturizing than some of the moisturizers out there. obviously, wished we would get more quantity for the price paid but itna criticise karne ke baad bhi, brands toh behre hai 😔and on reapplication, doesnt feel like im doing the 100 layers challenge lol. plus , I don't feel regret when applying it these days, cuz no fear of sunscreen melting during winters (#rajailife) . *taareef karu kya uski, jisneee tujhe banayaaaa✨\\~*\n\n**rating :** 5/5 and forever HG\n\n* **Benton Mineral Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 15g (haalat kharab biros). got it at 30% on beauty barn\n\n**For skin types** : normal and sensitive skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : a white stick. that's it. kind of a really thick lotion like texture. unscented and smol. mineral sunstick.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Coco-caprylate/caprate, sunflower seed wax, propylene glycol dicaprylate, H-di/trimethylol hexyllactone cross polymer, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, titanium dioxide, dicaprylyl carbonate, Synthetic fluorphlogopite, vinyl dimethicone, microcrystalline wax, aluminum stearate, polyhydroxystearic acid, purslane extract, centella extract, sodium hyaluronate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, sodium Acetylated hyaluronate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, polyglyceryl-4diisostearate/polyhydroxystearate/sebacate, silica, alumina, pentylene glycol, allantoin, panthenol, Glycerin, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Xylyl Glucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Glucose, Glyceryl Caprylate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Stearic Acid, Tocopherol, Purified Water, 1, 2-hexanediol, ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**filters** :\n\n* titanium dioxide\n\nthis one came around the same time as the tocobo sunstick on beauty barn so being the ✨phisool kharchi wala baccha✨, I bought both of them. unfortunately , this one was a big letdown. how tf can a sunstick leave a whitecast? this one is a great example. first off, it requires a lot of pressing and dragging across the face to dispense , so not fond of that, especially when I have active acne. secondly, it legit looks like someone rubbed fair and lovely mixed with water on my face 💀. its not waterproof, expensive for the quantity you get and gives a disappointing finish and result. I'm not particularly sure about protection against sun on this one but oh well. also piddu si stick hai so kind of cute but lootne wala hai lmao\n\n**rating** : 2/5 and WNRP\n\n* **Tocobo** **Cotton Soft Airy Sun Stick SPF50 Pa++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1550 for 20g (bought at 1100 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily, combination, acne prone skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale blue long cylinderical like stick. has a really pleasant and soft floral fragrance . leaves a matte fininsh and doesnt feel greasy on apllication. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list :**  Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Niacinamide, Tromethamine, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol, Polysilicone-15, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Extract, Sophora Flavescens Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum Root/Stalk Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Oenothera Biennis (evening primrose) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Seed Oil, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* titanium dioxide (physical filter)\n\nprobably the only sun stick that comes even close to the isntree sun stick. this gives such a good matte finish without any greasy feel . plus has cute floral smell to it that doesn't transfer to your skin or anything. and damn what a bang for a buck. probably the closest dupe for the isntree one. the only con is that it kind of pills after the 3rd application and rubs of oily after a while. if you are a person who touches their face every once in a while (like my dumbass), you might find it a bit uncomfortable. that being said, most of the times I just blot the grease away after 3-4hrs of application and apply another layer afterwards. sun protection wise, it does a good job! my forehead is the area that is the most prone to getting tan and it looked quite even toned after 3 weeks of consecutive use. one of my most favorite sticks (😏)\n\n**rating** : 4.5/5 and lets seeee\n\n* **Neutrogena beach defense sun stick water + sun protection SPF 50+**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs 1260 for 42 g (got it at Rs. 900 from amazon)\n\n**for skin types** : honestly, none lmao. I used it as a body stick most of the time with how oily this was. but can be used by anyone ig\n\n**texture and appearance** : whitish yellow stick. has a fruity kind of smell. really oily and greasy on first application that doesn't absorb or goes away after a while.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Polyethylene, Isohexadecane, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Ozokerite, Paraffin, Synthetic Beeswax, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Neopentyl Glycol Diisostearate, Dimethicone, Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Fragrance, BHT\n\n**filters** :\n\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n\noof this was an impulse purchase that I regretted later on. mind you, this is a great sunstick for your body but definitely not for your face . not to mention its waterproof . but the tapti garmi really just melts everything in its way and this is no exception. bhai itna chip chipa lagta hai i dont even feel like putting this on just because of the MoIsT feeling it gives. unless you're going to a pool or beach (as it suggests duh) , if you're okay with feeling like [that peanut butter baby](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.ie%2Flife%2Ffamily%2Fthis-peanut-butter-baby-is-sure-to-brighten-up-your-day-31499579.html&psig=AOvVaw0Qc7SXcD436wP5Ywrn_yJv&ust=1678212392776000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCIDzt77yx_0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) , then you can give it a try. it  does provide a good amount of product for the price and is a solid waterproof one fosho. but nahi jhela jata for some reason 😣😣😫\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\nme after buying and trying all of these to find my HG\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zzjpjrbly9ma1.gif\n\nbut it was fun doing this in a span of a few years and I finally got one that fits all my boxes . the BOJ one is seriously godsent for me ✨✨~~lets just ignore that it makes my wallet cry every time I buy it .~~ But id rather spend more on stuff that works than just hit and trials lmao. also I've gone past my obsession on using sun sticks as a whole since they require quite a lot of pressing while applying and the application just irritates my acne a lot 😫 imma finish the ones I have but I have no intentions on buying anymore from any brands (even though the minimalist and earth rhythm ones look good 🤡)more reviews to come! ill be doing one on stuff my dad will be bringing from the U.S in the next few weeks so do let me know if you'd like a follow up on those too! (~~why do i treat my posts like a sitcom😭).~~  and as always, any other questions, comments are always welcomed and so are dms!\n\nbyeeee 💖💖",

I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n   \n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte      Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable      UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB      filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV      filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB      mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change",

    "body": "Another hack for you'll!! From Ayurveda before to chemical compounds now - life needs to have some balance 😀\n\nSo I've been looking for a scalp serum, have used 2 bottles of The Ordinary Multi-Peptide serum before, and was looking at the Inkey List Caffeine scalp serum, and the ingredient \"Redensyl 1%\" caught my eye, went down a rabbit hole of a few hours of Googling and discovered that the TO serum also uses it and the Mamaearth Onion oil! 😆Also discovered that the Inkey List Amino Acid Anti-Gray Scalp Treatment uses a compound called Darkenyl.\n\nNow - if both The Ordinary and Inkey List are using these compounds, they must be good. Whilst I can do product research am not good at explaining science-y stuff, so just going to link out to resources that explain better what &amp;amp; how they function! These are compounds made by Givaudan a Swiss company.\n\n**Redensyl for hair growth**: \n\n* [doc 1](https://thefitzroviacentre.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/REDENSYL-04-04.pdf), [doc 2](http://www.nardev.com/UploadSection/ProdCat-276-1446515551.pdf) (TLDR: a safer topical than Minoxidil that doesn't need to be taken lifelong but results expected after 3 months minimum usage). \n* **INCI:** Aqua (and) Glycerin (and) Sodium Metabisulfite (and) Glycine (and) Larix Europaea Wood Extract (and) Zinc Chloride (and) Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract. \n\n**Darkenyl for anti-gray:** \n\n* [doc](https://www.benevablack.ch/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Study_Darkenyl.pdf), [article](https://supplementclarity.com/darkenyl-anti-gray-hair-review/). \n* **INCI:** Glycerin (and) Water (and) N-Acetyl-Tyrosine (and) Sodium Metabisulfite (and) Glycine (and) Larix Europaea Wood Extract (and) Zinc Chloride (and) Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract.\n\nI've found 16 products (oils and scalp serums) containing Redensyl in India, and 1 containing Darkenyl (oil).  I've added the % of the compound used where I could find them, have messaged brands on IG wherever missing, and will update as and when they respond (if they do!). For these products, I'd recommend getting a scalp serum as am not sure how the penetration efficacy would be in an oil. There are a lot of men's products as male pattern balding is a common issue to address, my brief research on Saw Palmetto and DHT blockers is that it can be used unisex, though I went with a product without these myself, more below.\n\n**You can find my list of products here:** \n\n**UPDATE:** Doc now also contains other hair growth compounds Aminexil, Baicapil, Capixyl, Procapil \n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V2Q3GrImfb9zOogFCc8y9ovpYZVI7iO\\_ejbz8Vr1AZI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V2Q3GrImfb9zOogFCc8y9ovpYZVI7iO_ejbz8Vr1AZI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n* **For Redensyl:** I ended up buying the Escobar Beard Growth Serum (no beard here 😂, but will go on the scalp), with 3% Redensyl, Biotin and Keratin. Got 3 pieces for Rs.600 on Flipkart (received 2 beard serums and one oil which has Redensyl also but prefer the serum so now have to go through the long drawn out process of having it replaced, and have got really bad service from NutriGlow so avoid the brand or buy at your own risk). It's made by NutriGlow which also makes the exact same formulation for Satthwa which charges way more, they've also launched the Beard Growth serum as a Hair Growth serum 😆 I'd stopped using The Ordinary one as it was expensive and I'd run out of it every 10 days, so will share a review of these after a few months as I hope to stick to a 3 month course. \n\n***UPDATE***: am not a fan of the Escobar beard serum. Firstly got an oil in the pack of 3, and have been ghosted by both Flipkart and NutriGlow for the replacement. Secondly, the product has a strange masculine smell which is annoying and have realised I’ve been avoiding putting it because of the smell. So it’s a WNRP and will try the other products instead. When I do apply it use this Shiseido technique https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFEuwVrf28M\n\n* **For Darkenyl:** there is only one option of the Bombay Shaving Company oil, have enough hair oils for now so will get this later. \n\nWhilst the peptides in The Ordinary serum and caffeine in the Inkey List would have added benefits, we get to try the main compound for a fraction of the cost! And to add a disclaimer, this is my quick research, so request you'll to do your due diligence as well before trying these out. Hope this helps! 😀",

When I was prescribed redensyl I was told to apply 1-1.5ml to the crown daily and the mamaearth one says to use it once a week on your scalp. The key to these is consistency, also informed by my dermat.

But ever since getting some high end Western skin care as gifts, I noticed that many of them actually have a lot of fermented/yeasty ingredients in them.\n\nBut I can't find much on the \\~science\\~ or evidence behind why ferments can be good for your skin. But I also wonder, since ferments aren't really a thing that majority of consumers in the Western market are looking out for (like fragrance, rose water, coconut water, rosehip oil, fruit/veggie extracts that have label/experience appeal, but aren't necessarily good for skin), why would these huge companies bother putting ferments in their expensive skin care if they didn't have evidence that they do SOMETHING?\n\nI especially am curious because AB/Korean beauty are sometimes looked down upon as just being trendy and not using ingredients that are scientifically proven to be truly beneficial for skin.\n\nDo you think ferments are legit?

Fermenting antioxidant rich ingredients such as ginseng, green tea etc. breaks down the antioxidants/complex molecules that are beneficial to our skin into smaller molecules, which allows it to be absorbed into the skin easily. Not only that, yeast/bacteria ferments produce additional metabolites (AHAs, peptides) that provide additional benefits such as whitening, hydration, skin repair, you name it!\n\nEdit: forgot to put my favorite fermented product!! I love the Manyo Factory Galactomyces Niacin Special treatment. :) \n\n2nd Edit: here are the links to some scientific literature articles on fermented cosmetics which were found through PubMed! You do need access to the database if you want to read them in its entirety, but you can get some brief information on the topic just through the abstract.\n\nFermenting red ginseng enhances its safety and efficacy as a novel skin care anti-aging ingredient: in vitro and animal study.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23126662\n \nEvaluation of tyrosinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of Angelica dahurica root extracts for four different probiotic bacteria fermentations.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254340\n\nSkin resistance to UVB-induced oxidative stress and hyperpigmentation by the topical use of Lactobacillus helveticus NS8-fermented milk supernatant.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598022\n\nBifidobacterium-fermented soy milk extract stimulates hyaluronic acid production in human skin cells and hairless mouse skin.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12637786",

    "body": "I have been a long time devoted user of the Round Lab Mugwort Calming Cleanser, and would consider it my HG. I can't even remember how many tubes of it I've gone through. Recently I've noticed that it's started going up in price (last time I bought it I had to pay $26 CAD), and it's become increasingly hard to justify that price for a cleanser. So when I saw this Bring Green Artemisia pH Balancing Foam at my local kbeauty shop for $13.99 CAD I had to try it!\n\n\nSkin type: combination, dehydrated, acne and clog prone\n\n\nRound Lab Ingredients:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Butylene Glycol, Coco-Betaine, Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Artemisia Vulgaris Extract, Aspartic Acid, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl Glycol, Polyquaternium-67, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Malt Extract, 1,2- Hexanediol, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Allantoin, Madecassoside, Panthenol, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid\n\n\nBring Green Ingredients:\n\nGlycerin, Purified Water, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Lauryl Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Artemisia Capillaris Extract (8,000ppm), Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Malt Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Lavender Oil, Citrus Nobilis (Mandarin Orange) Peel Oil, Rosemary Leaf Oil, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Orange Peel Oil, Polyquaternium-39, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder (800ppm), Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Ethylhexylglycerin, Linalool, Limonene \n\n\nBoth cleansers claim to be pH balanced at 5.5 and gentle on the skin. That I will say is true, I never had irritation using the Round Lab, and in the 4 times I've used the Bring Green I didn't either. They both leave my skin feeing properly cleansed without being stripped or dry. \n\n\nTexture wise I prefer the Round Lab. It has a slightly thicker texture which foams up to a nice rich foam. However at times it can take a little extra effort to rinse away. The Bring Green does foam up just as well, but it isn't as rich of a foam. It contains very tiny visible bits of mugwort, but they're so small you don't feel them. It also rinses away much cleaner and faster. \n\n\nIn terms of scent the Round Lab doesn't really have one, it smells very faintly of mugwort. The Bring Green however has a light citrus scent due to the essential oils, but it isn't overpowering and doesn't linger once rinsed. \n\n\nOverall I think I might end up switching to the Bring Green. Although the user experience might not be as pleasant as when using the Round Lab, for almost half the price it's definitely worth keeping in my routine.",

The expectation seems to be that it's supposedly very good for acne prone skin. There are pictures of someone with pretty bad acne showing before and after pictures of their acne going away. (Korean skin care is more geared toward CALMING & SOOTHING acne than to go to war with it with drying treatments and whatnot. I guess because a large component of acne is inflammation?)* \n\n*Some people said it doesn't seem to do anything for them, sensitive types seems to like it a lot, that it absorbs quickly. They like that it's unfragranced. Some VERY oily types said they feel like their skin is a little bit more oilier when they use it and that it doesn't absorb well for them.

    "body": "\nHey all! 👋🏻I want to review hair growth serum from minimalist-\n\nSo i have straight fine hair(little below shoulder length)(30s/F), oily scalp. \n\nI have been suffering from hair loss for past two years. I haven't checked with my derm. I have lost some hair (in patches) because of my tight hairstyle. Then came humidity season and my hair were everywhere. Before taking an appointment I decided to try hair serum. I started on 29th june. \n\n\n29/6: Started with serum. First application was hassle free. No burning or warming of the scalp. I used 4 drops front of scalp(problem area) and 4 drops back of my head, everyday, in the AM(as i take shower in the PM). Rubbed into my fingers and then Massaged only on my scalp and not on length. It was non greasy.\n\n\n01/07: In just two days I started to feel my hair fall is less, like 3-4 strands in my comb. I thought its a placebo effect.\n\n\nI continued it for two weeks straight, every day and my hair fall reduced by 20%. I stopped the application on 14/7 for two weeks as i was traveling and wanted to see if hairfall return and to my luck it Did. But it wasn't alot. I think some people miss understand that after stopping hairfall doubles but it's just the same amount you used to get(at least for me)\nI restarted again and still using it and now i can say I definitely see hair looks bit thicker, have seen baby hair growth especially at the hairline and hair fall has reduced to 80%. \n\nI will keep using it as it dint have any side effects except one stubborn cc which always occurs on my forehead if apply regularly. Thus i now use it 4-5 times a week(depends on which day i ll shampoo and workout)\n\nIts non greasy if applied less but if you directly use the dropper on scalp you might end up using alot and it will give oily look. My scalp normally gets oily on 3rd day but with everyday application of serum hair looks oily on 2nd day. \n\n\nPROS: 1. It works.\n2. New hair growth. \n3. Hair seem thicker.\n4. Less hairfall.\n\n\nCONS: 1.Everyday application is a task for long hair and oily scalp as you need to shampoo.\n2. Give cc on forehead with regular use.\n3. Don't think its a permanent cure.\n4. Expensive.\n\nInci:\nButylene Glycol, Aqua, Dextran, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3, Trifolium Pratense (Clover) Flower Extract, Propanediol, Arginine, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Gluconolactone, Calcium Gluconate, Glycerin, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Apigenin, Oleanolic Acid, Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Sprout Extract, Isomalt, Sodium Metabisulfite, Larix Europaea Wood Extract, Glycine, Zinc Chloride, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Saccharide Isomerate, Sanguisorba Officinalis Root Extract, Serenoa Serrulata (Saw Palmetto) Fruit Extract, Capryloyl Glycine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Lactic Acid\n\n\nTL:DR- True to its claims, will repurchase it!\n------------------------------",

    "body": "I vaguely remember signing up for the notification for Charlotte Cho's new launch about a month or so back and received an email about the opening of her new brand, '[Then I Met You](https://thenimetyou.com/),' this morning. While I only looked at Soko Glam during the very beginning of my skincare days, I know it's a popular outlet for a lot of people since it's a convenient, one-stop-shop for a lot of the most popular Asian beauty products. \n\nIt appears that Charlotte Cho wants to dive into the realm of making her own skincare products and the new brand touts a very similar story to a lot of other online-owned brands. Based on the 'Our Story' page, she's focusing on \"**natural, premium ingredients, even when it means cutting into our own margin.\"** (ok, sis).  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe initial launch is a cleansing balm and a cleansing gel sold separately or as a pair. Here's the breakdown:\n\n* LIVING CLEANSING BALM (38.00 USD): **Massage this luxurious, sorbet-soft oil cleanser into the skin to melt away oil-based impurities, such as sunscreen, makeup and excess sebum while nourishing the skin with antioxidants, essential fatty acids and vitamin E.**\n\n>Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Trii-sostearate, PEG-8 Isostearate, Cera Microcristallina (Microcrystalline Wax/Cire Microcristalline), Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Ceresin, Synthetic Wax, Orbiignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Diospyros Kaki Fruit Extract, Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Rosemarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Ethylene/Propylene Copolymer\n\n* SOOTHING TEA CLEANSING GEL (36.00 USD): **This premium gel cleanser with antioxidant and antibacterial properties uses gentle cleansing agents to clear skin of any impurities, without stripping the skin. The mandarin citrus scents are designed to awaken your senses during every use.**\n\n>Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake), Aqua (Water/Eau), Sorbitol, Glycerin, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Diethylhexyl, Sodium Sulfosuccinate, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, 1,2 Hexanediol, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Diglycerin, Potassium Cocoate, Propylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Citrus Reticulata (Tangerine) Peel Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Panthenol, Gluconolactone, Butylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, T-Butyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously, I haven't tried any of them yet but I probably won't be investing in these products. First, neither are fungal acne friendly unfortunately. Second, holy price point batman. They're expensive on their own and together they're 68.00 USD. Also, and this isn't a dig at Charlotte Cho, but the way some of these companies advertise their products as if they're absolutely revolutionary kind of blows my mind and is overdone. Cleansing balms and cleansing gels aren't new and there are only oh-so many ways you can reinvent the wheel. Does anyone else have any initial reactions?",

And really, let's stop pretending that a cleansing product's ingredients are beneficial to our skin. We solely apply a cleanser to wash off dirt and then rinse it off. It doesn't stay on your skin long enough to do anything but cleanse.\n\nIt's a no from me.",

Oh and they're super tiny so buy 5 of them together which will also save on shipping!'",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

    "body": "Review Day 1/7\nI recently purchased most of the new acne line by Pyunkang yul and I'm pleasantly surprised.\nUnlike the minimal ingredients the other lines have has these products contain a whole list of beneficial ingredients such as Centella Asiatica, Licorice Root extract, Niacinamide, a peptide complex as well as many more. The star ingredients for this line is white willow Extract and Forsythia fruit extract. \n\nPyunkang Yul ACNE Toner:\nIt's very watery so great for those with oily skin. It absorbs pretty quickly and has a sweet scent despite it not having any essential oils. After two weeks of using it I prefer the essence toner to it but it did help with the breakout I had and helped with clearing out my pores but it's not hydrating enough for me to see using in the long term. \n\nPyunkang Yul ACNE Facial Cleanser:\nMade with almost the exact same stuff but includes Citric acid and other agents for cleansing the skin. I'm not going to lie I love the cleanser it's so gentle and uses micro bubble technology. You might be disappointed that it doesn't lather well but I don't really care abut that aspect. It's a thicker consistency than their ato cleanser and 500ml cleanser but thinner than the foaming cleanser and has a pH of 5.5-6. My friend tested the pH on her one and she got a pH of almost 5.8. It also doesn't strip me of any moisture i feel more hydrated after cleansing. I'll definitely repurchase when I run out i prefer it over the Cosrx salicylic acid cleanser or my cereve hydrating cleanser. \n\nPyunkang Yul ACNE Spot Cream:\nI got this for my sister but tried some myself I didn't really notice any difference on my skin but my sister who has sensitive acne prone skin saw improvements on her acne. I prefer to my a'pieu pimple patches over it. \n\nThis line is perfect for acne prone sensitive skin while people like me that has combo- dry skin might not like it as much it. \n\nEdit (I think their listed on cosdna if you want to check what is what) : Ingredients for the cleanser\nWater Cocamidopropyl Betaine Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate PEG-75 Acrylates Copolymer Glycerin Disodium cocoamphodipropionate PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate Dimethyl Sulfone Pyridoxine HCl Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract Forsythia Suspensa Fruit Extract Butylene Glycol Centella Asiatica Extract Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract Sodium Chloride Copper Tripeptide-1 Allantoin Citric acid Potassium Hydroxide Sodium Benzoate Phenoxyethanol Disodium EDTA\n\nIngredients for the toner:\nWater Butylene Glycol Dimethyl Sulfone Pyridoxine HCl Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract Niacinamide Forsythia Suspensa Fruit Extract Centella Asiatica Extract Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract Copper Tripeptide-1 Glycerin Hydroxyacetophenone Myrtus Communis Extract Tropaeolum majus Extract Ethylhexylglycerin Disodium EDTA\n\nSpot cream ingredients \n\nWater Pentylene Glycol Glycerin Behenyl Alcohol Cetearyl Alcohol Niacinamide Glyceryl Stearate Dimethyl Sulfone Silica Polyacrylate-13 Polyisobutene Polysorbate 20 Allantoin Madecassoside Asiaticoside Panthenol Pyridoxine HCl Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract Xanthan Gum Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer Forsythia Suspensa Fruit Extract Butylene Glycol Centella Asiatica Extract Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract Copper Tripeptide-1 Hydroxyacetophenone Myrtus Communis Extract Tropaeolum majus Extract Ethylhexylglycerin Disodium EDTA\n\n*For the cleanser and toner everything has an EWG rating lower than 3 these are all available in sale on style korean for $10 USD and under (shipping was dreadful to Canada its probably good if you live in the US) \n\nEdit x2? I just saw it on yesstyle too and they are doing a sale on the products as well . To clarify i broke out by using the moisture cream from this brand I added those products plus olivarrier products to sooth my skin. I'm planning on reviewing that brand later this week \n",

I have oily acne prone skin so I'm really interested in the toner and acne cream for now. Thank you for this review. Another thing, I always buy from Yesstyle and I never had problem with it but I saw the prices of this line extremely low (Toner $11 acne cream 10 spot cream $8) and it seems kinda sketchy. I'm not sure if it's safe to buy from them, am I gonna get fake products or...? On the other hand Style korean shipping takes ages to arrive and it's quite expensive for me...",

    "body": "## [Product Deets from Deciem's website](https://deciem.com/en-in/theordinary/mas-rdn-multi-peptide-serum-for-hair-density.html?dwvar_mas-rdn-multi-peptide-serum-for-hair-density_size=60ml&quantity=1):\n\nThis concentrated formula is designed to support hair health so that it looks thicker, denser, fuller and healthier. The technologies present in this formula include **REDENSYL**™ complex (with Larix Europaea Wood Extract and Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract), **Procapil**™ peptide complex (with Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1), **CAPIXY**L™ peptide complex (with Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3 and Trifolium Pratense Flower Extract), **BAICAPIL**™ complex (with Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Triticum Vulgare Germ Extract and Glycine Soja Germ Extract), **AnaGain**™ (Pisum Sativum Extract) and High-Solubility **Caffeine** (1% net Caffeine by weight), in an ultra-lightweight, emollient base for efficient penetration. The total concentration of these technologies in the formula by weight is 21.15%.\n\n## Purchased from:\n\n[Cult Beauty](https://www.cultbeauty.com/the-ordinary-multi-peptide-serum-for-hair-density-60ml/11841280.html?autocomplete=productsuggestion)\n\n*Customs Info for anyone who's interested*: The first time, I'd purchased two bottles, along with a few other products- my order total came to Rs 4530 and I had to pay \\~53% of that(Rs 2400) for customs. The second time, I'd purchased two bottles of this alone- they were on discount and the discount amount was higher than the shipping fees, so I paid for shipping and got both bottles for 3k(including shipping) and paid no customs fees. I've ordered from Cult Beauty 4 times so far- Order Amounts: 2.2k, 500, 4530 and \\~3k- and only had to pay customs once. Location: Kerala\n\n## Usage:\n\n*Usage Period:* \\~4 months\n\n*How I use it:*  I use it maybe around 4 night a week, concentrating on the front of my head, by sectioning my hair and dropping \\~3 drops of the serum along each parting(it spreads quite easily, so that's enough). It takes a little over half a pipette to do this(I have a pretty small head though, I think most people might need a bit more). I then put on an episode of a TV show/anime and massage till the episode ends if it's a short one, otherwise for half the episode, so roughly around 20 minutes?\n\n## Texture:\n\nViscous, easily spreadable liquid, which means a little goes a long way.\n\n## Greasiness:\n\nLeaves hair looking a tad greasy right afterwards, but it goes back to normal by morning(disclaimer: I don't have a greasy scalp at all, so idk how it'll fare for those of you who do).\n\n## Weird shit:\n\nMy scalp felt all weird and tingly the day after I used it for the first time- not bad, per se, but noticeable enough to be distracting. You know those sci-fi movies where they show the supervillain's head expanding till they look like more human versions of Mojo Jojo? Kinda felt like that was about to happen to me. Experienced this again to a slighter degree the next time, and then never again.\n\n## Results:\n\n* *Hair Fall:* By the end of the third week, my hairfall had decreased dramatically. I have depression, so every now and then, I go long periods of time without washing my hair, which sucks because I get insane hairfall if I go longer than 5-7 days without washing it. Towards the end of the first month, I was going through a tough time and didn't wash my hair for \\~10 days. I'd braced myself for the insane hairfall- and it never came! Not when I detangled my hair pre-wash, not when I shampooed or conditioned it and not when I towel-dried it. Like I was fully prepared for 100+ strands, but I'm pretty sure I didn't lose over 30 during the whole process.\n* *Hair Growth:* It's only been \\~4 months and I don't have any visible bald spots, plus I always have a halo of baby hair so I'm not sure I'll be able to tell how effective it is here, unless there's a dramatic difference. But while I'm not sure if it increased the growth of new hair, I think it sped up my hair growth? Like I think it got longer faster? My hair normally doesn't grow super quickly(for context, I've been getting my hair smoothened since I was in high school and when my roots grow out, they're not noticeable at all for the first 5-6 months, fairly noticeable from months 6-9 and very noticeable and looks pretty damn weird from months 9-12). Around the time I started using this, I had a big haircut and I just had another haircut yesterday back to that same length yesterday and the hairdresser definitely chopped off over 2 inches. So I think that's more than 2 inches in 4 months, which is higher than my usual rate. Sounds like I'm rambling, I know, but I'm explaining all this so you know this is all completely anecdotal, I hadn't taken any before and after pictures.\n\n## VFM:\n\nThe first time I purchased this before Cult Beauty turned evil and stopped docking prices on checkout for non-EU citizens. Two bottles of it cost me Rs 2732 then\n\n\\-> one bottle(60ml) = 2732/2 = **Rs 1366**\n\nBUT I had to pay 53% customs, which means\n\n\\-> one bottle(60ml) = 1366 x 1.53 = **Rs 2090**\n\nThe second time was after Cult Beauty turned evil, but with discount + shipping charges + no customs, I only had to pay Rs 3078 for 2 bottles, which means\n\n\\-> one bottle(60ml) = 3078/2 = **Rs 1539**\n\n*How long a bottle lasts for me:* 2.5-3 months\n\nCustoms fees are erratic, ranging from 0-70% from what I've seen on this sub, so I guess this answer's going to be very subjective. I'd say it's definitely worth a purchase if you have slight hairfall, especially if it's on sale, if it's within your budget, but if not, I think Be Minimalist has a dupe for it with all the same actives, which goes on B2G1 sales a lot(haven't tried that one myself, but I've heard good things about it on this sub).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Note:** If you have excessive hairfall, I think you should save your money and see a trichologist instead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Repurchase Status:\n\nOn my second bottle now, already repurchased a third for myself and a fourth for my mom(might update in a few months if she sees significant results, but she's not consistent with beauty stuff, so don't count on this).\n\nI think I'd repurchase this forever and it would totally be my HG IF it were easier to source. Why oh why can't Deciem retail in India\n\nI think I might put a brief pause on repurchasing this after I empty my current stash to try the dupe by Be Minimalist, but such a tiny bottle ugh. If anyone has tried both, I'd love to hear a comparison!",

    "body": "Hello! I wanted to do a long end-of-year skincare review of the products I’ve bought, products I have finished, and also mention the products I’m excited to try next year.\n\nAs someone who has searched this sub a lot for reviews before purchasing products, I wanted to give my 2 cents back and also have a reference for the future 💅\n\n**My skin type:** Combination skin with an oily T-zone.\n\n**Cerave Renewing Salicylic Acid Cleanser:**\n- **Usage:** 2x a day\n- **HG HG HG** I’ll forever use this until they change the formulation, which I really hope they don’t 😭\n- Tackles my blackheads problem and overall helps my skin be acne and pimple-free. I tried switching to Neutrogena Acne-free Cleanser last year when I didn't have this in stock, and my skin had a clear difference with pimples and dark spots. HG\n\n**The Body Shop Vitamin C serum:**\n- God, this made me never buy a Vitamin C serum product in my life. Maybe it could just be me who used it incorrectly. I used it in the mornings and went ahead with moisturizer and sunscreen, but I don’t think it did anything for glow or reduce dark spots. Also made a point to only use actives in the night. WNRP\n\n**Minimalist Alpha Arbutin serum:**\n- **Usage:** 3-4 times a week at night\n- I’m halfway through this, and I feel like it is making a difference in making my skin glow as compared to before. WNRP because I want to try other products.\n\n**Paula’s Choice BHA serum:**\n- **Usage:** 1-2 times a week at night\n- This refuses to get over 😩 I’ve had it for over two years. It is really strong, and I use it very lightly. It affects my skin barrier if I use it more than once a week, so I’m careful with this. I’m using this to minimize my pores but haven’t seen much results as of now. MRP\n\n**Cosrx Two in One Poreless Power Toner:**\n- **Usage:** Few times a week\n- 🥲🥲 what a regret purchase. It doesn’t benefit my skin in any way, and I’ve to really calculate where to fit this in my week among other actives serum. WNRP\n\n**One Thing Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract Toner/Mist:**\n- **Usage:** 1-2x a day\n- I like to use this as a mist throughout the day sometimes, and it makes my skin feel hydrated. Or as a toner in the night when I’m not wearing any actives. It is a bit sticky on my face after a few minutes but I don’t mind that when I’m at home. MRP\n\n**Neutrogena Hydroboost Toner:**\n- **Usage:** Daily in the morning\n- TBH when I’m lazy to apply moisturizer and just need a pick-me-up throughout the day, I just use this and wear sunscreen, and it works well for me. Doesn’t do any wonders though for the price point. MRP if I feel the need to later.\n\n**Cosrx Snail Mucin Essence:**\n- **Usage:** Daily at night\n- Great product to repair my skin barrier on the days I don't use any actives. Also love being a glossy donut sleeping at night because of this. WRP\n\n**Neutrogena Hydroboost Moisturiser:**\n- **Usage:** Daily in the morning\n- I love this light moisturizer to use as a daytime moisturizer under any makeup if I apply any. I haven’t come across any other product like this one. I tried the Pond’s Water gel moisturizer as raved about in this sub, but I felt it was too silicone-y for me :( Doesn’t get absorbed as well as Neutrogena. WRP\n\n**Neutrogena Brightboost Moisturiser:**\n- wtf is up with the glitter particles in this product. I liked this product on vacation when I was in a cold place, but uhm it tanned me when I was back to my regular place with a lot of harsh sunlight. WNRP\n\n**Hydravo Skin Renewing Moisturiser:**\n- **Usage:** Daily at night\n- This was prescribed by my mom’s dermatologist, and I love using it at night as a sleeping mask. Makes my skin really soft and hydrated. It is neither a light nor a heavy moisturizer, but I love using a thick amount to apply on my face.\n\n**Sebamed Eye Cream:**\n- **Usage:** Daily at night\n- Hoping this product solves years of my sleeping in with Kajal/Eyeliner 🤡 It is a good moisturizer for sleeping in. I love feeling oily while sleeping in, tbh, and waking up feeling not dry.\n\n**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask:**\n- **Usage:** Few times a week at night\n- Good moisturizer for lips. Removes dead skin well in the morning. I really wish it was cruelty-free though :( Hate that Laneige tests on animals. Not worth it for the price point. WNRP\n\n**The Ordinary Lash and Brow Serum:**\n- **Usage:** 1-2 times a day\n- I’m not sure about my brows, but I definitely feel a difference with my lashes getting a lift-like effect. MRP\n\n**Minimalist SPF50 sunscreen:** I don’t love this product because it does make my skin appear a bit oily, but I don’t hate it either. It works as a sunscreen, and I’m on my second tube. No white-cast if applied moderately as I do. WNRP because I want to try other products.\n\n**Products I’m excited to try next year:**\n- Beauty of Joseon Glow Serum\n- Beauty of Joseon Sunscreen\n- Cosrx All in One Cream\n- Cosrx Rice Sleeping Mask\n- Anua toners\n- Numbuzin serums\n\nThank you for reading!! Happy New Year everyone!!!",

    "body": "Hello all! First, let me thank everyone for all the information they share on this sub and reviews. I find them so helpful when I was making my first AB skincare purchases. Hopefully my review can help you too! \n\nAlso, I posted this review to my [blog](https://passiixn.wordpress.com/2021/01/07/winter-skincare-review/) if you'd like to check it out there! (I included 5 western product reviews on my blog post in addition to AB).\n\nSo let's get into it,\n\nI have combination skin (slightly oily forehead and dryness around my nose and cheek/chin). My acne is not severe, I get Closed Comedones on my forehead and on my temples. As well as some hormonal acne around my chin. My main goals in curating my routine were to have better skin texture, hydrate, and GLOW. I also currently live in I suppose what is a “Mediterranian climate”, not very humid and not very dry.\n\n**Guide:**\n\nWRP – Will Repurchase\n\nMRP – May Repurchase\n\nWNRP – Will Not Repurchase\n\n**Cleansers**\n\nCOSRX Good Morning ph Cleanser\n\nThis is my boyfriend’s cleanser and I tried it out when I was at his house. It’s not great. My skin felt SO TIGHT after I used it and didn’t do anything other than that. The texture was nice and the like tea tree? The smell didn’t bother me. Maybe if you have more oily skin this would suit you, but dry, normal, and combo should stay away. 1/5 WNRP\n\nHANSKIN Pore Cleansing Oil \\[PHA\\]\n\nThis product was sort of my introduction to oil cleansers. I bought it in a travel set that also came with the balm version all for around $12. And I’m glad I just got minis because this cleanser is just so-so. It cleansed nicely, smelled nice (there are citrus oils in this), and washed off easily. I don’t think this did much in the way of exfoliating (PHA is quite mild so I don’t know if the AHA and BHA would be better). I also don’t wear any foundation or heavy make up so I can’t speak to its make up removing strength. However, this did its job on the light makeup I do wear. I’m going to search for another oil cleanser but if I don’t find anything I may repurchase. 3/5 MRP\n\n**Toner**\n\nACWELL Licorice pH Balancing Cleansing Toner\n\nThis is a lovely toner, however, I don’t have much to compare it to. I do think it brightens my skin when I use it consistently day and night and I like I think it provides a nice base for the rest of my products. It also does have a slight scent (I’m assuming that’s the licorice water?) but you can’t smell it after you apply. 4/5 MRP.\n\n**Essence**\n\nHANSKIN Hyaluron Skin Essence\n\nI do notice a glowing dewiness after I apply and the next morning. I don’t have another AB hydrating essence to compare this to, but it is more hydrating than my Fresh Rose Toner. I also really like the watery consistency and you only need two shakes of the bottle to cover your face, so I expect this to last a long time. Overall this is giving me glass skin vibes, but I’m not obsessed. 3.75/5 MRP\n\nNEOGEN Real Ferment Micro Essence\n\nThis really makes my skin GLOW. I can tell the days I’m not using this and the days I am. And I think this is giving me more of a glass skin look that the Hanskin. This was my big purchase. I appreciate the fact that it is in a glass bottle, it helps justify the price tag a little more. Lol. 4/5 MRP\n\nISNTREE Clear Skin 8% AHA Essence\n\nWow. This is so incredible. This was a last-minute addition to my shopping basket after spending hours looking at all kinds of exfoliants. My skin L O V E S AHAs. Especially the two in this formula, Glycolic Acid (4%) and Lactic Acid (4%). Additionally, this contains licorice root extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, and Madecassoside. So while you’re getting that exfoliation, you are also getting some calming ingredients. 5/5 WRP\n\nNow as far as exfoliating goes, I think this really fits the bill for me. Not too mild and not too intense. I get a glow immediately after I use it and the glow continues when I wake up. I also find that it helps with my acne. Not dramatically, but I can tell it definitely helps. And lastly, my pores look so much better, I have no words to describe it. This product really makes me want to explore Isntree more. Especially their product with green tea in them.\n\nThis could be a Holy Grail for me, especially because of its affordability great ingredients. 5/5 WRP.\n\n**Moisturizers**\n\nCOSRX Advanced Snail 92 All in One Cream\n\nI have been SO excited to try this product. Snail is such a highly regarded ingredient and the COSRX snail essence is so raved about, so I thought the cream would be equally incredible. But alas, this was terrible for me. No matter how much I put on, my skin still felt dehydrated. It was quite uncomfortable and I did notice a few small breakouts after using it. After a week I concluded it wasn’t going to work for me and returned it. Though, one pro was I did notice a slight “glow” despite the dehydrated feeling. Overall, made my skin look nice but not feel nice. YMMV. 2/5 WNRP\n\nCOSRX Birch Sap Moisturizer\n\nThis product was simply not made for me. Nice consistency, however, it didn’t moisturize my face enough and I prefer a thicker layer (especially after the stripping feeling of the good morning ph cleanser). I could see this being much better for more oily acne-prone skin types. 3/5 WNRP\n\nSoonjung 5-Panthensoside Cica Sleeping Pack\n\nThis is a simple and nice product. I like the slightly heavy texture. It feels like just enough and not an over the top vaseline feeling that I was worried about. I wake up with calm and moisturized skin. Overall, a good product to get some added moisture and lock all your other steps in for the night! Simple and effective, 5/5 WRP\n\nDear Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream\n\nThis cream is really lovely. First of all, the blue color quite pretty, and the texture reminds me of a gel-cream leaning more towards cream? I find that it absorbs nicely and you need about a pea and a half size amount. I have been using this cream in the day time despite it being marketed as a night cream. It leaves a nice dewy glow on my skin and most importantly, makes my skin actually feel moisturized. I feel like it is too early to tell if I will repurchase. Last, The most impressive result is that I don’t get oily by the end of the day. Which to me is a major pro for this cream. Unless I find something comparable for less or something really interesting. 4.5/5 MRP\n\nbelief The True Cream Moisturizing Bomb\n\nThis was just alright. I received a sample of this from Sephora. Simple texture to the Klairs, but not as moisturizing and doesn’t provide the exact same glow. The is an herbal scent to this product that lingers for maybe 2 minutes after application. You could probably find better ingredients for a better price. 3/5 WNRP\n\nNooni Applebutter Lip Mask\n\nYou need a little less than a pea-sized amount. I would recommend exfoliating your lips before so this can work the best. I enjoy the thickness and texture and the way it melts on application. I got this on Amazon for $7 and for that price, it is worth it. But usually, it seems to be priced around $20USD, which I think is a bit too much for it to not be completely life-changing. I also have a non-AB discovery I think outshines this one which is $7.50. But this Nooni mask does feel a tad more luxurious. 4/5 MRP",

Or was it more like after it was absorbed, maybe 1-5mins later?\n\nI use it and find it super hydrating. However, there's nothing in it or about it which is going to lock that hydration in, so it's easy to get dehydrated over time especially if you're in conditions which may suck out that moisture. Or even if you use other things that have HA in it - if there's nothing occlusive on top of it then it can dehydrate your skin. So if you have oily skin, then a very very thin layer by itself is likely sufficient but if you have dry/combo dry skin, then you'll probably need a thicker layer (not thick though) and something occlusive.\n\nI really like putting any sunscreen on top in the AM or in the PM, putting the [PKY Balancing Gel](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-balancing-gel-60ml-tube-type-60ml/info.html/pid.1064226859) on top.",

Anyways, didn’t get around to returning it before I had used too much so now I use it as moisturizer for dry areas on my body like elbows knees and hands. Still not great but I hate to waste it 😅",

I'm pretty sure these are all  the same base sunscreen with the same protection. I would get the sunscreen with the simplest ingredient list and whichever one is cheapest. The About Me Be Clean seems to be alcohol and fragrance-free (non sure if rosemary leaf oil is an essential oil and fragrant??). I would probably go with the Innifree though because I prefer alcohol in my sunscreen, otherwise they are too too dewy and greasy looking, and the ingredient list is rather simple. If only it didn't have fragrance, but I can compromise with that. The Dr. G has too many unnecessary ingredients and many comedogenic ingredients like myristic acid, so I would stay away from it.",

Just because it takes the # of reviews into account. You can find lots of good reviews vouching for very good products with lesser amount of reviews. It doesn't necessarily mean that just because a product is extremely popular, there can't be lesser known amazing products as well. For some categories, like toners and creams, I feel that it's worth to look all the way down towards the 40s and 50s. I think I will make certain categories longer if you guys don't mind my spamming, lol.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm thinking doing creams or gels next. =) Thank you everybody for the comments, glad to see the time I spent making these posts is helping some of you!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Oils & Gels](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6dqq7/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing_oils_gels/)\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Balms/Milks/Creams & Foams](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6fso3/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing/)",

Fortunately, the packaging is often **color-coded** (rose gold, red, green, etc.) to help us distinguish them. This guide is a work in progress and aims to clarify the options. **All the products listed below contain Thiamidol.**\n\nIf I missed one, got something wrong, or if you’d like to help build a full list, please comment!

They don't always appear as \"ceramide \\_\\_\", there are other names for them, such as:\n\nHydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, Myristoyl/​Palmitoyl Oxostearamide/​Arachamide MEA, Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide, Hydroxypalmitoyl Sphinganine, [Safflower Oil/​Palm Oil Aminopropanediol Esters](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/safflower-oil-palm-oil-aminopropanediol-esters), etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo today I wanted to make a list of products that are easily overlooked when searching for ceramide skincare, because many people are only looking for the word \"ceramide\".

Still probably way higher than most other brands).\n\nThough with these products in general, particularly for the ones with “real” (not pseudo/ceramide precursors), honestly I would be shocked if they were present at more than 0.1 %. Even if they come before the preservatives, the preservatives are probably present at like 0.9% so the company can list them after the fancy ingredients even though the expensive ingredients are at minuscule concentrations. Maybe I’m too cynical, but a >1% concentration of any ceramides would be such a HUGE selling point (not to mention very expensive to produce) that I can’t believe they’re not advertising it\n\nLike Regimen is coming out with one and they are trumpeting the HELL out of it (and I mean fair enough)",

I much prefer it made into banchan to get rid of that hairiness.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w2aipuxqvd731.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=61e9efff503be8fb28c0d10f06554470b7818560\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**10. \\[INNISFREE\\] Superfood Blueberry Rebalancing Skin - 4.05 (6,670 Reviews)**\n\n350ml/14,000 KRW\n\nWater, Dipropylene Glycol, Propanediol, Glycerin, Glycereth-26, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polyquaternium-51, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis(Orange) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, C12-14 Pareth-12, Methyl Gluceth-20, Triethylhexanoin,Diphenyl Dimethicone, Butylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Polyglyceryl-10 Oleate, Glyceryl Caprylate, Pentylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y8b4a01tvd731.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=db65674441858a6bc27eda9bc51f8bf43360905b\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**11. \\[Kiehl's\\] Calendula Herbal Extract Toner - 4.09/5 (3,776 Reviews)**\n\n250ml/59,000 KRW\n\nWater, Propylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Methylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Arctium Lappa Extract/Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Calendula Officinalis Extract/Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Corn Starch, Allantoin, Hedera Helix Extract - Ivy Leaf/Stem Extract, Althaea Officinalis/Althaea Officinalis Root Extract.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ko96mlkwvd731.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=81b5cd28692582782f2a31089406aa802d8ed543\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**12. \\[IsNtree\\] Hyaluronic Acid Toner - 4.06/5 (10,677 Reviews)**\n\n200ml/12,000 KRW\n\nSodium Hyaluronate • Water • Glycerin • Butylene Glycol • Trehalose • Betula Alba Juice • Beta-Glucan • Soluble Collagen • Althaea Rosea Flower Extract • Aloe Barbadenis Leaf Extract • Portulaca Oleracea Extract • Panthenol • Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract • Pulsatilla Koreana Extact • Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract • Hydroxy Ethyl Cellulose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/keod4ggyvd731.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b714ce84a3c4e86195036a4a544e519d98a1413d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**13. \\[BEAUTIQLO\\] Noni Fresh Balance Skin Toner - 4.25/5 (1,404 Reviews)**\n\n200ml/14,500 KRW\n\nMorinda Citrifolia (Noni) Fruit Extract (50%), Mineral Water/Eau Mnérale, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract Water/Eau, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Beta-Glucan, Centella Asiatica, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Betaine, Glycerin, Camellia Japonica flower Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Green Tea Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Sodium PCA, Allantoin, Panthenol, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Polyglutamic Acid, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yd9ag0o3wd731.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a78deee55f2be25cdf40c37778424fe35e80c85\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**14. \\[2SOL\\] Sunhan Salgyeolsu Water Toner - 4.12/5 (2,426 Reviews)**\n\n200ml/7,420 KRW\n\nPurified water, Glycerin(vegetable), Butylene Glycol, PEG-75, Witch Hazel leaf Extract, Protulaca Oleracea Extract, Poly-Glutamic Acid,  Anthemis Nobillis(camomile) Flower Extract, Bacopa Monniera Extract, Aloe Vera Leaf Powder, Spiraea Ulmaria(meadowsweet) Extract, Guaiazulene, Hydrolyzed Opuntia Ficus Indica Flower Extract, Mannan, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrizate, Syringa Vulgaris (Lilac) leaf Cell Culture Extract, Piper Methysticum Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Citrus Grandis Peel Extract, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Oryzanol, Saccharide Isomerate, Panthenol, Betain, Sorbitol, Sodium PCA, Magnesium Aspartate, Zinc Gluconate, Copper Gluconate, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Levulinic Acid, Citric Acid, Sodium Levulinate,  P-Anisic Acid, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Hydroxide.\n\n*Fun fact: \"2SOL\" isn't pronounced 2 soul, it's E (just say the letter E) sol.

    "body": "Hello folks! So my Physicians Formula booster and Olay Luminous booster came in the mail today!\n\nI'm just really excited to share because I searched HIGH AND LOW for affordable niacinamide products that have a high % of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLINK TO MY PICTURES:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/7ab5NZ8](https://imgur.com/a/7ab5NZ8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe PF I have not used before.

Probably because Olay developed it. But it works great on its own as a brightener, and even better combined with vitamin c (which is why you see ascorbyl glucoside here, a stable derivative of ascorbic acid). The miracle boost USED to contain n-acetyl glucosamine (which is the one I used) as well the other ones listed here. But I guess it got too expensive or whatever.\n\nThis also has some other great ingredients, like xylitol, gylcerin, panthenol, zinc and copper gluconate for soothing and healing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used this booster in conjunction with the Luminous cream, which has niacinamide and NAG. My skin looked so much brighter and prettier. The texture was really smoothed out and my skin started getting a more like.. translucent ?? quality? You DO need to give brightening ingredients *at least 3 months* to work their magic though, especially for things like arbutin/hydroquinone. (Arbutin breaks down into hydroquinone.) But for niacinamide, I saw results for skin texture/overall brightening before that.\n\nI honestly couldn't believe the price Target was selling it for, because I got it for a much higher price elsewhere before. I couldn't keep affording it so I let it go, sadly. :'(\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe [**Luminous Tone Perfecting Treatment ($24.99)**](https://www.olay.com/en-us/skin-care-products/regenerist-luminous-tone-perfecting-treatment) is a simpler formula, but still has the same active ingredients.\n\n*Water,* ***Niacinamide\\*****, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Dimethicone,* ***Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine***\\*, Silica, Boron Nitride,\\* ***Ascorbyl Glucoside***\\*, Polyglyceryl-2 Oleate, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Dimethiconol, Aminomethyl Propanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Oleate, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, \\*Vitamin B3\\*\n\nBut ironically, it costs more than the more complex booster if you purchase at Target online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DIY:**\n\nI have made DIY niacinamide NAG serums before. But because I'm too lazy to make it properly, they really lack penetration power. I'm really into cosmetic science and have read from professional cosmetic chemists that a simple DIY isn't effective if you don't do it right. You gotta keep the powders dissolved right and STAY dissolved instead of them recrystallizing on your skin and not penetrating your skin/being useless. I experimented for months with the DIY but I DEFINITELY noticed a difference as soon as I started using well-formulated, commercially available niacinamide serums.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy personal experience with certain products:\n\n\\- [**Eva Naturals 5% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-Niacinamide-Serum-Eva-Naturals/dp/B0147PDMYY/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=eva+naturals+niacinamide&amp;qid=1561763684&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3)**:** Pretty awesome, works well, you get 2 oz. But it has avocado oil and such, and may break some people out. (This is definitely a private-label product and you can find the same exact formula for cheaper on DIY sites - which is why you see like 324982394 bottles of the same formula of everything from niacinamide to vitamin c serums on amazon.) I get the same sort of overall brightening and translucency I get with Olay. Better results with my other products, Benton 0.5% salicylic acid (very gentle) aloe BHA toner, Purito green level centella buffet serum (also has niacinamide, like 2%), and Naturie Hatomugi gel essence. Bright, translucent skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Cerave PM:** Supposedly has 4% niacinamide. Loved this as a lightweight moisturizer, but did NOT see the results I got with other niacinamide products. Makes me feel skeptical. Or perhaps there's a pretty big difference for my skin with 4% and 5%. I doubt it, but you know. Maybe it's just cuz it's formulated for skin-replenishing and not for brightening. But you'd think same ingredient will have same effects, y'know?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.skinlex.com/product/10-niacinamide-serum-60ml/)**:** Ingredient list looks GREAT and some others seem to love it, but I saw absolutely zero niacinamide benefits for my skin. Penetration issue?\n\nI have other products I've used with niacinamide, but these are the main ones I can remember on the top of my head. La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ baume has it as well, but I do not know the %.

It's completely unfragranced but the product itself smells a little... Mouldy? I knew it smelt bad from reviews but I wasn't expecting it to really smell that unpleasant. I'm used to it now though and have a completely unfragranced routine. If you're accustomed to fragranced products I think you'll definitely find this unbearably unpleasant.\n\nI will say the texture itself is quite pleasant. It's got a silky smooth texture that spreads easily. You don't need a lot which is good but I'm definitely using it up more quickly than I was expecting.\n\nI'll probably stick with it for 3 months to see if there's any improvement but at the moment I'm seeing a small improvement in overall skin tone but not much improvement on sun spots that I wanted this product to fade. I do use this after TO Niancinamide so hopefully the peptide brighteners work together!",

    "body": "In my opinion the only way ascorbic acid may potentially work topically is when it's used fresh, and applied at night in the absence of UV exposure. Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid. Shelf life is no indication of the stability of actives and doesn't say anything about it's stability on skin. Ascorbic acid is simply notoriously unstable, it's more likely to degrade on skin and be irritating. From all the research available today, the best efficient way to get ascorbic acid in skin is to just take it orally.\n\nBeneficial actives in bold, potential irritants in italic/stripethrough\n\n**Water based products**: below pH3.5 the ionic charge of AA is removed ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5605218/)), improving skin penetration and stability, but water based products remain extremely unstable ([ref](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/7291637/stability-of-vitamin-c-derivatives-in-solution-and-topical-formulations/3),[ref](https://skinelegance.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/CSBM_-Skincare-theories-busted-Dec-2014.pdf)), most companies don't store their product in fridges in warehouses, it isn't unlikely products are severely oxidized by the time they arrive at your home\n\n* [€18/50mL - Skinlex 20%](https://www.skinlex.com/product/20-vitamin-c-serum-30ml/)\n  * **pH:** 3-3.3\n  * **Pros:** simple irritant free formula, right pH, pump is convenient compared to pipet, light serum, inexpensive\n  * **Cons:**  pump is not airless, concentration other actives unknown, instability, the look and feel of website and adress of company make me doubt if it's really formulated by a well educated cosmetic chemist\n  * **INCI:** Water, **20% L-Ascorbic Acid**, Butylene Glycol, **Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin**, *Triethanolamine*, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol.\n\n* [€28/50mL - SkinPep C15](https://skinpep.com/super-c15-serum/)\n * **pH:** 4.3\n  * **Pros:** Great blend of actives, light serum, shared concentrations\n  * **Cons:** pH is too high, dropper, instability, incorrect ingredient order (Propylene Glycol)\n  * **INCI:** Aqua, **15% l- Ascorbic Acid, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3, Panthenol**, Hydrolyzed Collagen, **1% Alpha Tocopherol, 0.5% Ferulic Acid**, Glycerin , *Triethanolamine*, Phenoxyethanol, *2% Propylene Glycol*, Ethoxydiglycol, Laureth-23\n\n* [€34/50mL -Wishtrend 21.5 Advanced Serum](http://www.wishtrend.com/skin-care/1215-pure-vitamin-c215-advanced-serum-by-wishtrend.html)\n * **pH:** unknown\n  * **Pros:** Simple irritant free formula\n  * **Cons:** concentration is a bit high, dropper bottle, lack of stabilizers, not many actives \n  * **INCI:** Hippophae Rhamnoides Water (70%), **Ascorbic Acid** (21.5%), Sodium Lactate, 1,2-Hexanediol, **Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol**, Cassia Obtusifolia Seed Extract, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol\n\n* [€41.60/50mL - SkinActives 15%](http://www.skinactives.com/Vitamin-C-Serum-Ascorbic-Acid-L.html)\n * **pH:** 1.5-2.5\n  * **Pros:** Airless pump!, great blend of actives, not very expensive, no propylene glycol, ph is low enough for penetration, skinactives is busy with a reformulation without the citrus extracts.\n  * **Cons:** ph is irritating, according skinactives not suited for daily use, lack of stabilizers like water reducing agents, recrystalizes quickly.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water. The key here is to make it fresh every 1-3 days I guess.\n  * [€5.80/20g TO Powder](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g?redir=1)\n  * [€89 /20mL Philosophy Turbo C booster](https://www.sephora.com/product/turbo-booster-c-powder-P204606)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Anhydrous formulas**: best stability, but not much research on penetration\n\n* [€9.60/50mL - The Ordinary C23](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)\n  * **Pros:** Cheap, anhydrous (stable), together with TO Ferulic+Resveratrol a very affordable good combo\n  * **Cons:** No other actives,  no vitamin E, relatively unpleasant texture, stinging, for me too thick/greasy for daytime use.

They claim that the THD ascorbate is 50x more powerful than traditional vitamin c (I am skeptical and what are they referring to with “traditional vit c”).  Also has 3% vitamin E and 2% ferulic acid. The only negative I read in the reviews is people saying it was not ideal for dry skin types. Do you have any experience with this? \n\nPS- thank you so much for your comprehensive list, it is much appreciated!! Paula’s Choice is having 20% this weekend (on one product) so I am contemplating trying her vitamin c serum. I will be shy on free shipping though, and not sure what else to order lol.",

        "body": "Wow, nice post! I'll be shopping around later, love trying new products. Did you make a mistake on the Skinlex one btw? It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

    "body": "**Skin Type:** Combination with Oily T zone\n\n**AM Routine:** Rejuglow Face Wash<Minimalist Vitamin C<BOJ Ginseng Toner<CosIQ NMF moisturizer<Isntree Real Eye Cream<Formularx sunscreen \n\n**PM routine:** Rejuglow Face Wash<Olay Retinol Serum<BOJ Toner<Isntree Eye Cream<Pyungkal Yul Moisturizer \n\nIt's that time of the month when I'm saying goodbye to certain skincare products after trying them out. Some of these are repeats and some were first time bought. Let me start with the repeats:\n\n**1) Minimalist Vitamin C + E + Ferulic Acid 16%**\n\n**💸Price:** Rs. 599/- for 20 ml. I got Minimalist Invisible Sunscreen SPF 40 free with it.\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Butylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Citrate, Citric Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Gluconate, Ferulic Acid, Coceth-7, Phenoxyethanol, PPG-1-PEG-9 Lauryl Glycol Ether, Fullerenes, Tocopherol Acetate, Ethylhexylglycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PVP, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n**🍶Packaging:** Dropper black bottle, comes with an extra carton\n\n**Fragrance:** None \n\nIf there's one product I've always raved about, it's this Vitamin C Serum. This has become my HG that I've purchased Multiple times now, and will probably repurchase in future. \n\nI love how it lasts longer and doesn't oxidise quickly compared to other Vitamin C Serums, and there's a no difference in my skin on its usage. It does a good job at lightening and fading acne spots and marks. The only other Vitamin C Serum I like is Cosrx 23%, but it's quite heavy on the pockets. \n\nI'm quite tempted to try out the Klairs and the Numbuzin one. Would appreciate the reviews if anyone has used them.\n\n**2) Formularx Hydrashied Vitamin C + Peptide Watery Gel Sunscreen SPF 50 PA ++++**\n\n**💸Price:** Rs. 699/- for 50 ml. It's frequently available on BOGO offers on their website.\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Vitamin C, Peptides, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin B5\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Octocrylene, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Titanium Dioxide, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate/VP Copolymer, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Gold, Disodium EDTA, Pentapeptide-4, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glutathione, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract\n\n**🍶Packaging:** Tube\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\nThis is my second tube, and I love the texture. It's very lightweight, absorbs easily, no greasiness on the skin and yes, No whitecast. It also doesn't burn my eyes, like the Minimalist Invisible Sunscreen. I doubt it's waterproof, as the tube does state to reapply after exposure to water. Using this post snail mucin essence or a hyaluronic moisturizer gives a dewy look. \n\nAs far as protecting against sun exposure goes, I do cover my face with a dupatta when I leave home. I'd say there's a light tan on my face coz the summer heat is at its peak. Though labmuffin says that good sunscreen don't always prevent tan so I don't know what to say about that. \n\nAs far as the texture goes, it's Amazing, just don't expect miracles when it comes to sun protection.\n\n**3) Pyungkal Yul Calming Moisture  Barrier Cream**\n\n**💸 PRICE:** Rs. 1250/- for 50 ml. Frequently available on discounts at Maccaron\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Centella Asiatica, Ceramides\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Isohexadecane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Stearic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Glucoside, Pentylene Glycol, Trehalose, Ceramide NP, Arachidic Acid, Glucose, Palmitic Acid, Oleic Acid, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Squalane, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Hydroxyacetophenone, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, Disodium EDTA, 1,2-Hexanediol, Tromethamine, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Packaging:** Tub\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\nThis is a BOMB moisturizer. Having a combination skin with oily Tzone always meant trouble finding a good barrier repair cream. Most barrier repair moisturizer having ceramides have thicker textures that feel either too heavy or too greasy, or both, on the skin.\n\nNow I had just started Olay Retinol Serum, and was in need to a ceramide moisturizer to protect my skin barrier. I just randomly bought this on Maccaron when it was available on a great discount.\n\nAnd I've found my HG. It's so good, so lightweight, not at all heavy and soothing. I always end up with a pimple while trying ceramide cream but this one was so light it didn't feel greasy at all. \n\nI'm in love and this has definitely entered my list of future repurchase. \n\n**4) Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Essence Water**\n\n**💸Price:**  Rs. 1500/- for 150ml Available on discounts at multiple websites\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Ginseng, Niacinamide, Adenosine\n\n**Ingredients:** Panax Ginseng Root Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Propanediol, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Water, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glyceryl Glucoside, Panthenol, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Adenosine, Dextrin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Disodium Edta, Glucose, Panax Ginseng Callus Culture Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Panax Ginseng Berry Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Lactobacillus/Panax Ginseng Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n**Claims:** Cruelty free, no artificial fragrance, colorants, mineral oil, parabens, sulfates.\n\nA cult favourite toner, how could I skip this? And here's my judgement, it's good to damp your skin and give a nice plump. Not ideal if you're looking for the glass skin effect. I think this is one of those products that don't give an immediate result, but when you use it consistently, you do feel your skin looks better. \n\nHaving said that, I don't think this would be a repurchase. It's good, but nothing that stood out. I'd rather experiment with multiple other toners available in the market. ",

I guess because it’s pure ascorbic acid it really does a good job on giving a subtle brightening glow and lightening some spots.\n\nAlso it is not very mild so when i started using it alone it gave me dry flaky skin. So I started mixing it with my moisturiser and things were good !\n\nBefore this I have only used Sugandha vit C which I also liked and Minimalist 10% vit C which did nothing for my skin.",

    "body": "**Context for reviews:** I posted [a haul of mineral-based sunscreens](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/1c8400r/mineralphysical_spf_haul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) a few weeks ago and wanted to share my thoughts so far! My goal this summer is to find at least one alternative to Dr. G (my HG, see below) since sometimes it's harder to find in stock, and the other goal is to find a water-resistant sunscreen, possibly mineral, that doesn't irritate my skin; this review post does not includeany water resistant products. Hope to post part 2 in a couple weeks after I can test more!\n\nMy skin seems to react better consistently to zinc oxide-based sunscreens for daily use. (Typically, not so good with titanium dioxide as the primary SPF ingredient, that has been drying for me.) I haven't totally ruled out all chemical sunscreens, though I've had reactions of irritation, break outs, flushing or burning with some chemical-based sunscreens (including the oh-so-lovely BOJ Rice + Probiotics, Skin1004 hyla-cica sun serum, HaruHaru Wonder airyfit, some Skin Aqua products). Mineral sunscreens also seem to help reduce shine/oil on t zone.\n\nI opt for products that are fragrance free (I find it distracting on my face but also some concern for irritation) and avoid or minimal use of essential oils. \n\n**Skin type:** Combination, acne-prone, sensitive, rosacea type 1. Mid 30s. Pale skin.\n\n\n\n**Climate:** \"Mediterranean\" according to google, extra hot and very dry spring/summers, mild winters.\n\n**Relevant routine notes:** I typically apply a daytime moisturizer under sunscreen and sometimes a serum, such as Aestura Hydro Soothing Cream and Cos De Baha Tranexamic Acid + Niacinamide Serum. I also double cleanse most nights using a cleansing balm and a water-based cleanser. I do try to reapply SPF every 2 hours in direct sun and before going out for walks during the workday. I don't often wear makeup beyond concealer.\n\n**Skin concerns:** barrier care, acne, redness, PIE\n\n---\n\n**KEY:** WRNP = Would Not Repurchase. MRP = Might Repurchase. WRP = Would/Will Repurchase. HG = Holy Grail/Multiple Repurchases/I Rely On This!\n\n*Note: All of these sunscreens contain butyloctyl salicylate, which seems to be generally considered an unregulated chemical sunscreen ingredient; some ingredient sites consider it an \"emollient\" and others a \"sunscreen booster.\" I don't seem to react negatively to this ingredient but I do consider it worth mentioning, given the various factors that many folks seek out mineral sunscreen options.*\n\n**Isntree - Hyaluronic Acid Natural Sun Cream** SPF 50+ PA++++\n\n**Ingredient list** (from Olive Young): Water, Zinc Oxide, Cyclohexasiloxane, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propanediol, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Isododecane, Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Niacinamide, Caprylyl Methicone, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Lauryl Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Tocopherol, Sodium Hyaluronate (10 ppm), Betaine, Inositol, Panthenol\n\n**Use time:** about 1 week of daily use in springtime.\n\n**Overall Impression:** Creamy in texture and fairly moisturizing. It does have kind of an extreme white-cast. It takes a fair amount of rubbing in to reduce for me, it's a dedicated process, hah! I noticed it most around my nostril creases and uhhh my mini mustache. My partner who has a deeper skin tone found the white cast intolerable, TBH. That said, it has a decent pore blurring effect if you get it rubbed in enough, heh. I found it to be non-drying. I originally thought I could possibly skip moisturizing with this but I noticed some days when I didn't reapply in the PM, my forehead looked more dehydrated than usual. I think it's a dewy-ish finish. I didn't experience any irritation while using, so that's also good.\n\n**Rating:** WNRP as I think there are better options out there! I will use up what I have later this summer.\n\n**Torriden - DIVE IN Mild Suncream** SPF 50+ PA++++\n\n**Ingredient list (from Olive Young Global):** Water, Zinc Oxide, Cyclohexasiloxane, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Isododecane, Lauryl Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Caprylyl Methicone, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Hyaluronate, Dimethylsilanol Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Dimethylsilanol, Panthenol, Allantoin, Trehalose, Ceramide NP, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, 2,3-Butanediol, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Lauryl Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Malachite Extract\n\n**Use time:** about 2 weeks of mostly daily use in springtime\n\n**Overall:** I really enjoy this sunscreen! It's quite cosmetically elegant and I would say very very easy to apply. I do sort of apply in layers a bit. It is a slightly gel-creamy texture, the texture feels \"plump\" for lack of a better word. The white cast disappears much faster and with less rubbing in than most mineral sunscreens for me, though I have to be mindful of white cast along my hairline more than I'm used to and it takes longer when reapplying. It dries down fairly well, feels both moisturizing and hydrating somehow! My skin feels extra soft at the end of the day. I can use it interchangeably with my HG below, which for my sensitive skin is *saying somethin'.* I would say it's a more dewy or maybe satin finish. Extra plus, it comes in a cute narrow tube that is quite convenient in my packed purse!\n\n**Rating:** WRP for sure\n\n**Dr. G - Green Mild Up Sun+** SPF 50+ PA++++\n\n**Ingredients (from Olive Young Global):** Water, Zinc Oxide, Propanediol, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Caprylyl Methicone, Isododecane, Lauryl Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Methyl Trimethicone, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Lauryl Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Caesalpinia Spinosa Fruit Extract, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Kappaphycus Alvarezii Extract, 7-Dehydrocholesterol, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Ectoin, Buddleja Officinalis Flower Extract, Lactobacillus Ferment, Hydroxycinnamic Acid, Rutin\n\n**Use Time:** about 1 year with pretty regular use as a daily sunscreen, all seasons\n\n**Overall:** This is a slightly loose, more liquidy texture but not runny. It applies easily and dries down pretty quickly. There is a distinct white cast that for me disappears effectively once rubbed in and after it settles; it gives a nice pore blurring effect. I find this non-drying, non-irritating and reliable. I don't seem to notice white cast around my hairline, in comparison to Torriden, and find it easy to reapply. While it does have more plant extracts than I typically aim for, I've had no issues so I'll keep using! It's a bit plain -- which is great for sensitive skin, but I admit I find the Torriden just a bit more *fun* somehow. I do think it is the best matte finish with nice oil control.\n\n**Rating:** HG always want to have a backup at the ready\n\n  \nNext on my list: Biore UV Kids Pure Milk (water resistant - spoiler: didn't have a great start on day 1&2, broke out immediately), Biore BarrierMe (water resistant), Axis Y No Stress Physical Sunscreen, Benton Mineral we'll find out if I can tolerate rosemary oil. \n\nAny other suggestions to try? I've tried Haruharu's mineral SPF but wasn't a fan of the texture or white cast, and I've used the hybrid Skin Aqua Moisture Milk (seems to break me out, boo). \n\nThanks for reading! Let me know any questions! ",

Im fair skinned and Same skin type as you but living in a hot and cold seasonal climate (Canada) \n\nI was looking for a non drying mineral sunscreen as I’ve been recently dealing with rosacea that suddenly walked into my life when I got skin damage from UV \n\nInstree - I tried the physical one. I found it cosmetically beautiful . Never saw my pores. But definitely the slightest white tint since my eyebrows went a shade lighter lol. Dries matte. dunno if I have a hyaluronic sensitivity from my damaged skin barrier but I found as the day wore on it was VERY drying. I did use it to almost full bottle but prolly will not repurchase \n\nBiore kids UV pure milk - used for a week. While moisturizing left me shiny and oily looking. Now I give it to my 2 year old lol. Since they always need extra protection. I would still use this in a clutch cuz I believe it’s more water resistant and good for those pool days (when you look gross and sweaty anyways) \n\nColorescience no show mineral - I got a sample of this from my esthetician. While it went on great, inbetween dewy and matte, I swear it’s pilling. Especially when I wear a mask all day at work. Still testing this with different moisturizer in day to see if that was the issue. \n\nI was still on the hunt for a sunscreen I could tolerate. I will definitely try dr G. It felt great on my hand so now big test onto the face….\n \n\n\n- another side comment. Sorry if this is making my post extra long. Even tho I cannot tolerate chemical sunscreens. Oddly enough my HG was la Roche Possay melt in sunscreen. It was a titanium dioxide sunscreen hybrid. I ONLY used it for hikes and pool days. Never burned. Which makes me want to research more hybrid sunscreens. Have you tried any?",

    "body": "[Here](https://imgur.com/a/Mnijy) are some pictures of the goods! \n\nWhen you get a haul, even a mini one, there is always at least one thing that doesn't work out the way you thought it would. For my finicky skin, it's usually several things. So I was ***shocked*** when not only did everything from my recent AB haul work for me, but it all worked ***really*** well. So well that I wanted to share my excitement with all of you! I'm still mildly in disbelief right now, this never happens. \n\nCVS was having a BOGO 50% off sale so I decided to try a couple things that I’ve had my eye on. I thought these reviews might be helpful for those in this sub that aren’t very familiar with AB products. My routine is a mix of different types of brands (I do love my French pharmacy products) but I’ve had a lot more luck finding things that work for my skin type in the AB world. Some people get scared off at the idea of ordering things from overseas - either because of shipping cost or the length of shipping times. Since these are all products carried at CVS, they are a lot more accessible for those in the US. \n\n**Skin type:** Oily, dehydration-prone, sometimes sensitive (depends on its mood that day), with a very low tolerance for silicones. \n\n**Holika Holika Aloe Cleansing Foam -** I've had rough luck with foaming cleansers as they all seem to strip my skin (other than my HG LRP Toleraine but it's fun to switch it up sometimes). Not this guy! My skin loves anything aloe and this did not disappoint (aloe is the best humectant for oily skin imo). It has a very dense, thick foam that feels very nice on my skin. The scent is very fresh, it almost reminds me of fresh-cut watermelon and aloe mixed together. It leaves my skin very soft and not remotely stripped. No squeaky-clean feeling here! I'm not positive of the pH but it does contain potassium hydroxide (a pH adjuster) so I'm assuming it's in the normal range and not on the higher end. I think this is going to make a great AM cleanser since it's so gentle. \n\nIngredients: \nAloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Water, Lauryl Hydroxysultaine, Myristic Acid, Lauric Acid, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Chlorphenesin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Palmitic Acid, Capric Acid, Butylene Glycol, Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Potassium Sorbate.\n\n(*Ah-ha! I just saw the watermelon extract as I was adding this, so that explains the lovely scent.)\n\n**Peach Slices Citrus-Honey Aqua Glow Hydrating Moisture Gel -** Holy shit you guys, this is ***everything*** I've been looking for in a winter moisturizer. It's lightweight, a gel, has ceramides, is hydrating *and* moisturizing and doesn't make me oily. The search is over! Seriously, I've been trying to find the perfect moisturizer for about 8 months now. I thought I had the perfect one (Etude House Moistfull Collagen Water Jelly Cream) but turns out it was perfect *for summer*. Once winters cold, dry air came it just wasn't enough. I've desperately wanted to add ceramides to my routine with no luck (Rosette Ceramide Gel was a greasy disaster). The inclusion of ceramides is what originally caught my eye and also the lack of any -cones. My skin is sensitive to silicones and finding a heavier winter moisturizer without any has been virtually impossible. This does include a couple -anes so I was skeptical at first but they don’t seem to bother me as much as straight up dimethicone. Dimethicone + my skin = a greasy mess and lots of clogged pores (and fun little whiteheads all over). The first time I used it, I squeezed out too much but thought 'what the heck, I'll see what happens'. As I began to spread it around, I realized that it was *way* too much product and figured I was doomed for an oily face that night. Cut to a few minutes later, when I was shocked to find that it had ***all*** absorbed. It dries down quickly to a soft, almost-matte finish. It legit gives my skin a healthy glow without making it oily, something that I didn't think was possible. The first time I wore it to work, I was ***incredibly*** impressed by the fact that my skin was still matte at the end of the day. My work's super dry air usually drives my dehydrated skin nuts and by the end of the day, it's over-produced a ton of oil to compensate. But not with this!! It gives my skin the hydration it always needs with just enough moisture to seal it all in. I am absolutely over-the-moon in love with this product and I can't recommend it enough! \n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Polysorbate 60, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Honey Extract, Ceramide Np, Sorbitan Stearate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Isohexadecane, Tromethamine, Hydroxyacetophenone, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Polysorbate 80, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitan Oleate, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Oil, Disodium EDTA, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Butylene Glycol, Bixa Orellana Seed Oil, Tocopherol.\n\n**The Saem Iceland Hydrating Soothing Gel -** The name pretty much says it all and it lives up to those claims. It's very hydrating, soothing and feels very refreshing. The fascinating thing about this product is how it dries down. It leaves an almost undetectable finish. I've never had anything disappear into my skin before - and I say that in the best way possible. It doesn't leave a tacky film the way most gels do. I use the Skinfood aloe gel daily (which does leave a bit of stickiness) and out of curiosity, I applied this on top of it. The combo dried down to almost nothing! It took away the stickiness all together. I am highly impressed with this gel! It is definitely a staple in my routine now and (*gasp*) may just replace my beloved Skinfood aloe (at least in the AM).\n\nIngredients: Water, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate 20, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Perfume, Sodium Acrylates Crosspolymer-2, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Disodium EDTA, Silica, Betaine, Heptane, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Propylene Glycol, Butylene glycol, Cetraria Islandica Extract, Sorbitol, Citric acid, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Prunus Mume Fruit Extract, Lactic acid.\n\n**Elisha Coy Refreshing Ampoule Solution Sheet Mask -** Another product that lives up to its name. I was nervous because these are on the cheaper side and usually the quality reflects that. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised! The mask itself fit very well. It's on the thinner side and it reminds me a lot of my fav sheet masks, the Etude House 0.2mm Air Therapy. It stayed in place and despite the essence being very watery, it didn't drip everywhere. The mask really seemed to hold onto the essence. After I took it off, I patted in the remaining essence from the pouch and it all absorbed completely. I was able to continue my routine with no issues. My skin was left hydrated, soothed and happy. \n\nIngredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Magnolia Kobus Bark Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Betula Alba Juice, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Chrysanthellum Indicum Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Fragrance.\n\nI haven’t had the chance yet to try the rest of the sheet masks yet but I am very excited to do so!! If anyone has any questions, I’m happy to help! :)\n",

    "body": "Hiya,\n\nI hope you enjoy the below reviews. I'm just a regular consumer buying everything with my own money - i.e., nothing sponsored, etc. Note, I've bought all of them on sale for around AUD$15-20 because I like sales haha.\n\nProducts:\n\n1. PKY - essence toner;\n2. PKY - mist toner;\n3. Secret Key - fresh nature toner - milk brightening one;\n4. Benton - Aloe BHA Toner;\n5. Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner; and\n6. Purito - Centella Green Level Calming Toner & the unscented version (Purito Unscented Centella Toner)\n\nMy skin used to be severely dry but is now slightly dry on the cheek areas and slightly oily on the t-zone during summer and slightly dry on the whole face in the winter.\n\nAlso note that the below two PKY products have different 'actives'/hero ingredients notwithstanding them seemingly being quite similar! I've bolded the plant extracts under the ingredient headers below.\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Essence Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495), Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. *Note, this one is generally recommended for people with drier skin whereas the mist version is generally recommended for those with oilier skin* Friends with eczema have also used this with success. *.* I can use both year round without breaking out. I've had friends with oilier skin who've used this one and have broken out. YMMV.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** LOVE THIS. May repurchase this for the rest of my life. I've used this after breaking my moisture barrier, after chemical peels, after active masks, and also *after getting my face ablatively lasered (after the the initial few days of only using an ointment)*. It's REALLY benign in a godly way. If you want it to do anything other than hydrate or increase the penetration of your other actives, this isn't the product for you (note, it doesn't claim to do anything else apart from hydrate & calm really).\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a little bit thicker than water but not as thick as the Purito centella toners. Won't run off your hand/face like water will but will eventually run off.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** None at allll, even when I broke my moisture barrier.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? Yes**/I have rebought this 4 or so times so far.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Mist Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance. This is in a spray bottle and is better suited to oily skinned persons.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1060395517?cpid=1060395516&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1060395517%3Fcpid%3D1060395516%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=876677637398885328), and Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/pyunkang-mist-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. This one is more for people with slightly oilier skin too. It's a lighter formula than the essence one.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Decent hydration, I prefer to use this in the toner stage instead of after my skincare but I have enjoyed using it as a 'refreshing' spray during the day.\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a nice mist, doesn't run on the face. Feels like a spray of water?\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a spray bit on top. I've had no issues with it but one mate had a couple that didn't spray properly.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** Unsure. I've rebought it once but haven't gone to use this one as much as I have the PKY essence toner or the Purito Unscented Centella Toner. I also don't like mists a whole bunch as they can go onto your clothes (if you're out) or jewellery if you're wearing any. But, I did go through a phase of keeping it in my handbag and using it when out and about for a bit of hydration.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Coptis Japonica Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Secret Key - Fresh nature Toner (Milk Brightening)**\n\n**What is it:** Hydrating toner that's meant to brighten your skin.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx.

Couldn't use it long enough to notice anything.\n\n**Smell:** A very strong scent that I could barely use it. I think I used it around 5-10 times before binning it - I couldn't even put up with the scent of this to use it on other parts of my body.\n\n**Feel:** really watery.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Fortunately (given the high fragrance), no reactions to this. If you had any irritation though, I'd expect some sort of reaction.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? No**, given I threw mine out.\n\n**Ingredients:** Not a comprehensive list given there's a generic list on yesstyle then a list below it for the main ones in the milk one but here -\n\n700ppm) \\[**sic**\\], 1, 2-Hexandiol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata Extract, Nonoxynol-12, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Tremella Fuciformis Extract, Allantoin, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Cucumber Extract, Propylene Glycol, Tomato Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Rice Extract, Lanoline, Tea Tree Leaf Water (9, Sciadopitys Verticillata Root Extract, Pumpkin Extract, Papaya Fruit Extract, Oleth-10, Viola Tricolor Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Ethanol, Glyceryl Stearate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Chamomilia Recutita Flower Extract, Morus Alba Bark Extract, Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Lemon Extract, Oleth-5, Sodium Hyaluronate, Potato Extract, Pomegranate Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Sap Extract, Bean Extract, Aloe Vera Leaf Water (9, Broccoli Extract, Glycerin, Green Tea Extract, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Hollyhock Root Extract, Witch Hazel Extract (9, Phenoxyethanol, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Mineral Oil, Ulmus Campestris Extract, Carrot Extract, Polysorbate 80, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rose Damascena Flower Water (9, Korean Raspberry Extract, Milk Protein Extract (9, White Willow Bark Extract, Psidium Guajava Fruit Extract, Witch Hazel Extract, 4-Terpineol, Algae Extract\n\nand then it says the main ones in the milk version are -\n\ngalactomyces ferment filtrate, pomegranate extract, physalis alkenkengi extract, milk protein concentrate, raspberry extract, pasque flower extract, potato extract, carrot extract, pumpkin extract, rice extract, usnea extract, broccoli extract\n\nso who really knows what's in it...\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Benton Aloe BHA Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating toner which is meant to gently exfoliate with 0.5% salicylic acid.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$23. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/benton-aloe-bha-skin-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1053033537), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** people with sensitive and dry skin as it's quite rich.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** on and off since mid 2020, still using it randomly to just use it up.\n\n**My thoughts:** Per Google (may not be accurate), it has a pH of 5.5 which is too high for there to be any noticeable exfoliation with 0.5% BHA present. I've not noticed any calming effects. It is definitely hydrating but given it's advertised as a BHA toner I'm quite disappointed at the lack of BHA efficacy here. I would much rather use the purito centella toner to hydrate and calm my skin as the centella has other benefits such as helping to stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** Similar to the PKY essence toner. Not as thick as the purito centella toners.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a pump on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **No**, almost threw it out but am trying to use it up.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nAloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Water (80%), Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Beta-Glucan, Polyglutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea (Green Purslane) Extract, Psidium Guajava (Guava) Fruit Extract, Salicylic Acid (0.5%), Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract (200mg), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice (200mg), Arginine, Pentylene Glycol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Polysorbate 20, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**E**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804)**tude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 relief toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$25 for 180mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/etude-house-soon-jung-ph-5-5-relief-toner-180ml-180ml/info.html/pid.1058586258), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone. It adds light hydration with benign ingredients - akin to the PKY toners but very minimally more expensive. It'd be good if you have irritated and/or dry skin.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** I used it once/twice a day until I used it up. Bought it in December 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Pretty decent. I'd recommend this to the same group of people who'd use the PKY essence toner. Nothing ground breaking. I prefer the calming nature of the Purito Unscented Centella Toner or even the PKY essence toner if you want zero actives (if you consider centella an 'active').\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** A watery toner.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** No but for no fault of the product. I just prefer using the Purito Unscented Centella one as it's just as benign, a bit cheaper, and has the benefits of centella.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, Propanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Madecassoside, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Polyglycerin-3, Disodium EDTA\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**Centella Green Level Calming Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804) **& the** [**Centella Unscented Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380)\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating and calming toner - may also stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$30 but I've always bought it on sale for approx. AUD$20-25 for 200mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380), [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml)\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone however this is best suited to those with any sort of irritation, acne, or redness. That is, if you have basically perfect skin you're probably not going to notice much of a difference but if you have irritation etc then you'll likely fall in love. Also good if you're wanting to help stimulate collagen production especially for the low price point - target ages for this is probably mid twenties and up.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** religiously since April 2020, sometimes twice a day.\n\n**My thoughts:** *BLOODY EXCELLENT*. I'm on my second bottle of this. My first bottle was the first listed one (scented) and then they released the unscented one so I bought that! It's incredible. I love it. In my opinion, it's partially why my skin is able to tolerate me using actives so much. It's excellent to use before actives as it doesn't interact with anything and really good to use after an 'active' mask or a clay mask etc. I switched to the unscented one to just reduce the risk of irritation.\n\n*also studies, which I haven't read but have seen derms I trust on insta etc, say that* ***centella can help stimulate/produce collagen... a big yes from me given it's a calming ingredient that shouldn't purge you or break you out*** *(unless you're allergic/sensitive to it)!*\n\n**Smell:** The scented one smells herbaceous (akin to Asian herbal medicine - I don't mind it but others may). The unscented one doesn't really smell like anything / I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** thick/fat/heavy water. Not a watery toner. Enjoyable.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Neverrrrrr, this helps me reduce the side effects from using actives such as retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, etc.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **Yes** & I have. Will probably rebuy for life.\n\n**Ingredients:** 4 variants as they've got the scented and unscented versions, and then those with and without witch hazel\n\nnon-witch hazel unscented version -\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract (strengthens skin barrier), Butylene Glycol (humectants), Pentylene Glycol (skin-conditioning agents), Dipropylene Glycol (humectants), 1,2-Hexanediol (stabilizers), Trehalose (humectants), Sodium Hyaluronate (natural moisturizing factor/ humectants), Hamemelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiaticoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiatic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Madecassic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Panthenol (strengthens skin barrier), Carbomer (viscosity increasing agents), Allantoin (skin protectants), Arginine (skin-conditioning agents), Portulaca Oleracea Extract (skin-conditioning agents), Ethylhexylglycerin (skin-conditioning agents), Disodium EDTA (stabilizers)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope these reviews were useful & feel free to ask any questions / start any discussions :)",

    "body": "This is a pretty long review that I have been adding to and compiling for a long time, so please bear with me. Hair and climate details are:\n\n**Hair and scalp type:**\n\n3A/2C curls, very dry and course strands, low-porosity, silicone and protein sensitive, oily scalp. I am not sensitive to fragrance, and find the fragrance of these products very mild. However that might be different for other people.\n\n**Climatic conditions:**\n\nHot and Humid.\n\n**Age range:**\n\nTwenties.\n\n**Usage timeline:**\n\nThe Moisture Duo have been my favourite styling products for about two years now.\n\nThe Protein Duo was bought approximately a year ago and has been used intermittently for 6-8 months since then.\n\nThe Wash-Day products were also bought at around the same time, and I have regularly used the Cleansing Shampoo and the Conditioner every wash-day since.\n\n# ✨Wash-Day Bundle✨\n\n# 🔹Cleansing Shampoo\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua),Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Panthenol, Polyquaternium -7, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-73, Fragrance, Apple Cider Vinegar, Disodium EDTA, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Oil, Polyquaternium -10, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick gel that lathers into a thick foam.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit while massaging into hair, completely washes off on rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nIt is sulphate-free so it is only mildly cleansing. If you are not prone to a lot of build-up and don’t have dandruff, this is good enough. Does not strip off moisture from the hair strands and doesn’t dry out the scalp either. I use this as my regular shampoo and use a sulphate shampoo every once in a while to clarify any build-up since this shampoo isn’t enough for me.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nEven though this is a cleansing shampoo, the website clearly states that this is not a Clarifying Shampoo. They actively encourage using a sulphate shampoo if you are prone to build-up, which I thought was a refreshing change from the usual marketing of sulphate-free shampoos.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n## 🔹Everyday Moisturising Shampoo\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua) Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium -7, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Panthenol, Phospholipids (and) Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/Palmitate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-73, Cetrimonium Chloride, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Fragrance Polyquaternium -10, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Citrus Aurantium (Neroli) Oil\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Mild to no lather.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit while massaging into hair, completely washes off on rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nI did not like this shampoo at all. It didn’t clean my scalp well at all and the strands felt weirdly brittle after washing. It isn’t hydrating enough to use without following up with a conditioner. However, if I am going to be using a conditioner anyway, the additional step is pointless for me. It might work for someone who needs extremely mild cleansing, but it is not for me. I stopped using after 2-3 washes at most, and switched full-time to the cleansing shampoo alone. Though the fact that this shampoo has proteins might be contributing to my dislike of it.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n1/5. Will Not Repurchase.\n\n## 🔹Hydrating Deep Conditioner\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Quaternium-87, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Phospholipids, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Polyquaternium -7, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/​Palmitate, Polyquaternium-73, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Avena Sativa (Oats) Extract, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Tamanu Oil, Honey Extract, Goji Berries Oil, Taraktogenos Kurzii Seed Oil, Jojoba Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Oil, Disodium EDTA, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, Potassium Lauroyl Wheat Amino Acids, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Leptospermum Scoparium Branch/​Leaf Oil, Capryloyl Glycine, Cysteine\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Low to medium slip.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit even after rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis conditioner is protein-moisture balanced, and this is the max protein my hair will tolerate. It doesn’t have a lot of slip, so if you are someone who detangles with conditioner, this one might be difficult to detangle with. My hair is always dry, and it felt softer immediately on the first use with this. It does tend to make hair a little greasy afterwards. But after adding styling products, it works out for me so I don’t really mind the greasiness. I have also used it as a deep conditioner and kept it in my hair for 30 minutes and then washed off. It didn’t make much of a difference in comparison with leaving it in for 5 minutes like I usually do, so I didn’t bother to do that again.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nFMC says the conditioner can also be used as a leave-in conditioner, though I have never tried this myself, and do not plan to try either.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Protein Duo✨\n\n## 🔹Leave-in Cream\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Dicetyl Phosphate & Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Panthenol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-87, Polyquaternium -7, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/Palmitate, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acids, Sodium PCA, Hydrolysed Milk Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Cetrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Polyquaternium-68, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Ceramide, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Fragrance, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Tocopheryl Acetate, Potassium Lauroyl Wheat Amino Acids, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Leptospermum Scoparium Branch/Leaf Oil, Disodium EDTA, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, Taraktogenos Kurzii Seed Oil, Capryloyl Glycine\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Thins out a little on emulsifying.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHeavy fragrance that lasts for the whole day. This is the only FMC product whose fragrance is too much for me.\n\n**Review:**\n\nI purchased the Protein Duo when I was still experimenting and figuring out the needs of my hair. I very quickly realised that my hair is protein-sensitive and this cream does not work for me. Thankfully I had only bought the 50g travel pack. It is very protein-heavy, not very hydrating. If your hair is already healthy, this may work well. However for very dry hair, this will not provide enough moisture.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nI know now that the cream doesn’t work for me in regular usage. However I do keep the 50g tube around for the rare moisture-overload days to give my hair a little boost of protein. I only need a tiny amount for that purpose, so the tube is going to last me a very long time.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n1/5. Will Not Repurchase. Didn’t work for me, might work for someone else.\n\n## 🔹Defining Hair Gel\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Polyacrylate-2 Crosspolymer, Phospholipids (and) Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Polyquaternium -7, Polyquaternium-73, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Panthenol, Fragrance, Disodium EDTA\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nVery sticky, thick gel.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays for a few minutes, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis is a very strong-hold gel. It is a part of the Protein Duo, but it isn’t as protein-heavy as the leave-in cream. Even with my protein-sensitive hair, I was able to use it occasionally on days when I wanted some serious definition. If I used it 2-3 times consecutively, it caused protein-overload. Overall, a nice gel that gives pretty good definition and hold. I haven’t bought it again, though I might do so once my current hoard of gels is finished.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n3/5. May repurchase sometime.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Moisture Duo✨\n\n## 🔹Curl-Quenching Hair Butter\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract, Salvia Hispanica(Chia) Seed Extract, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-87, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Panthenol, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond Oil), Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Glycerin, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, PEG/​PPG-8/​3 Diisostearate, Astrocaryum Vulgare Kernel Oil, Tocopherol, Olea Europea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Euterpe Oleracea (Acai) Fruit Oil, Mauritia Flexuosa (Buriti) Fruit Oil, Fragrance, Polyquaternium-73\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick white cream. Emulsifies into a thinner non-sticky cream.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nMild fragrance that lingers around for a few hours, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis one is an extreme boost of hydration. It is a heavy product, and tends to make hair greasy if too much is used. Since my hair is very dry, this works really well to keep it considerably soft and frizz-free. It doesn’t help me a lot with definition though, I don’t feel my hair is more defined on the days I use this butter as opposed to some other leave-in cream (usually the green Arata styling cream). Since it is heavy, it might weigh down wavy or fine hair. But for tighter curl patterns and/or coarser drier hair, this is great.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nThe product label mentions that it can be used as a one and done styling product. But for better definition, I prefer always using the gelly with it.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased. \n\n## 🔹Curl-Quenching Flaxseed Gelly\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract, Sorbitol, Propanediol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Salvia Hispanica (Chia! Seed Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-73, Panthenol, Sodium Gluconate, Fragrance, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Vinegar\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThin to medium, non-sticky gel.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays for a few minutes, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis is protein-free and quite hydrating honestly. Has a lot of slip, so it is a nice experience to style. It doesn’t have a lot of hold. Curls last for a day or two maximum, and that is after all protective measures like a satin pillowcase, satin scrunchies, etc. If long-lasting curls are not a goal for you, and you don’t mind refreshing more frequently, I would highly recommend this. The Moisture Bundle would probably be my most highly recommended FMC products.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nThe product label mentions that it can be used as a one and done styling product. I do use it as my sole styler sometimes, and it works out fine.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Miscellaneous Notes About Fix My Curls✨\n\nFix My Curls website used to have the full ingredients list of their products on the product pages prominently displayed. However during their recent website update, they have replaced it with Key Ingredients. So, minus points for that from me.They do have a photo of the back label in the product images, which shows the ingredients, but I feel that is not good enough. I prefer having the ingredients easily accessible. \n\nThey always have some kind of sale, discount offers, freebie offers, etc on their website. A lot of Indian Curly Hair Influencers also have affiliate codes for FMC. If you are planning to buy anything, I’d recommend comparing prices from the official seller on Amazon and the website during sales. I would have included other platforms like Nykaa, Foxy, Purpple, etc, but they are pretty much always out of stock or very highly priced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ✨Frequently Asked Questions✨\n\n🔹How do I find my curl type/porosity?\n\nI used [this quiz](https://www.naturallycurly.com/quiz)!\n\n🔹How do I know whether my hair needs moisture or protein?\n\n[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/mzhv17/haircare_guide_to_proteinmoisture_balance/) might help.\n\n&#x200B;",

Thank you for the reviews.\n\nI've seen FMC go upto 35%off on kindlife & 30%off on their own website.\n\nEdit - I have fine 2a wavy hair, & medium porosity from what I can tell. I'm hair dumb tbh. I use FMC leave in cream, hair mousse & defining hair gel & quite like them as they don't weigh down my hair while making them soft enough. Provide moderate hold & don't make them look crunchy. \n\nI agree with your assessment that they don't provide much moisture. So sm1 with Frizzy or dry hair would need other more rich / moisturizing products.\n\nThe leave in cream & mousse are my more used products, I haven't quite figured out how to use the gel properly yet.",

    "body": "Hey ScA! I recently lapsed on my skincare routine, so I decided that I should do a review of my main products as I add them back into my routine. This review will be mainly overall experience, with some recent insights. I have more products that I have used in the past, but I decided to only review ones I have a lot of experience with so far. The only product I don't have reviewed from my routine is the Advanced Retinoid - as I just reintroduced that back into my routine in the last week.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**My current routine:**\n\n*AM*\n\n1.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n2.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n3.\tTO Niacinamide over whole face\n4.\tApply TO Caffeine to under eye\n5.\tFormula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free moisturizer over whole face\n6.\tIf using sunscreen, use Etude House Sunprise\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*PM*\n\n1.\tIf wearing makeup, I use baby oil to remove\n2.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n3.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n4.\tPaula’s Choice 2% BHA Gel to whole face – wait ~20 mins to sink in\n5.\tTO Retinoid Advanced Retinoid 2% over whole face\n6.\tMoisturize with Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Info about my skin/general experience trying out products:**\n\n* VERY oily t-zone, normal cheeks, normal-to-dry jaw line and around mouth; light-to-medium skin tone\n* VERY VERY CC-prone, mainly on my forehead (some on chin). This is mainly due to not being consistent with my routine (especially simply washing my face with a cleanser, which is the minimum I need). This can also occur from moisturizer.\n* No issues with acne, except a few whiteheads around my menstrual cycle\n* Most cleansers I have tried are either a) not strong enough or b) too strong\n* Main skin concerns: Oil control, reducing appearance of giant nose pores, preventing CCs, even skin tone, healthy aging\n* Slowly trying to reduce the number of products I use for all the things (not just skin care) that contain fragrances\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser](https://imgur.com/a/uAvebDj)\n\n***Product Type:*** Cleanser; specifically purchased because it is **sulfate free** (my body hates sulfates)\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Juice, Coco-Betaine, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Peg-50 Shea Butter, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Lycium Barbarum Fruit Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Morinda Citrifolia Fruit Extract, Punica Granatum Juice Extract, Garcinia Mangostana Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Benzoic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Red 33\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance free**; **Sulfate free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; AM: use with konjac sponge; Fragrance is actually pleasant, doesn’t linger; consistency starts off creamy, but foams very easily\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is amazing, and has been a major game-changer for me when it comes to cleansers. I’ve never found a cleanser that worked long-term before this one. A little goes a long way with this stuff – it is a very efficient clean. My face feels so soft afterwards. While it is strong enough to get rid of all my oil, it’s not so harsh that it makes my skin tight.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** In terms of function, none that I can think of. Only downfall (IMO) is it is not fragrance-free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4.5/5 stars, I’ve gone through over 4-5 bottles of this stuff and I will keep it in rotation until I can find a functionally similar product that is fragrance-free\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Thayer’s Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner](https://imgur.com/a/OwCREGs)\n\n***Product Type:*** Toner; purchased because of how many people liked it on ScA\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~0.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Purified Water, Certified Organic Witch Hazel Ext Blend (Hamamelis Virginiana Extract (Witch Hazel*), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (Filet of Aloe Vera*)), Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Water, Fragrance (Natural Rose), Citric Acid, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Seed Extract\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** ***Not fragrance-free***; Liquid consistency; potentially irritating, depending on your skins relationship with witch hazel\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Despite the smell (see below), this stuff works pretty well. I always feel like this enhances my *clean* feel following my cleanse, but it also leaves my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized. I always follow-up with moisturizer, but I can definitely tell when I don’t use it, especially in my dry areas.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** **I HATE THE SMELL OF THIS STUFF!** Come to find out, I hate the smell of roses (I’m weird, I know…) but seriously. This stuff smells like a rose pooped in some water and then sold it on the side of the road on a hot sunny day. It’s terrible. If you are remotely disinterested in the smell of rose, do not buy this.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5 due to smell. Will repurchase the fragrance-free version in the future\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%](https://imgur.com/a/Tuo5otO)\n\n***Product Type:*** Purchased to reduce redness/even skin tone and to control oil; side-benefits: helps prevent CCs\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mild medicinal smell**, doesn’t linger; Somewhat-sticky consistency; Absorbs quickly\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** I keep this in rotation mainly because it helps control my oil. Even if I use this stuff without my mattifying moisturizer, it helps prevent the massive amounts of oil that my skin normally produces. It helps keep my skin an even texture and tone, as well. I’m not 100% sure if this is solely responsible for preventing my CC (doubt it, since I use BHA), but I’m almost certain it’s contributing at the least. This product has been one that I have been most consistent with besides my cleanser and what little redness I sometimes develop (mainly due to allergies or weather) has been under control.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Functionally, none. This stuff does what it’s supposed to. I just hate the dropper packaging, personally, of most TO products. It’s hard to get the little bits out of the bottom!!\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, have repurchased 2+ times; will be replacing with skinlex’s version to avoid buying more products from Deciem.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG](https://imgur.com/a/roT93Vy)\n\n***Product Type:*** Active for reducing appearance of eye contour pigmentation\n\n***Cost:*** **$* - ~$7.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Caffeine, Maltodextrin, Glycerin, Propanediol, Epigallocatechin Gallatyl Glucoside, Gallyl Glucoside, Hyaluronic Acid, Oxidized Glutathione, Melanin, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Urea, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Xanthan gum, Lactic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Propyl Gallate, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Benzyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; Watery-to-thick consistency (from the glycerin, probably); no noticeable smell; yellow-ish in color\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I’ve been using this stuff for a little over a year, and honestly it does absolutely nothing for my eye contour. I don’t have much puffiness, but I do have decent enough under eye darkness where I wanted something to help. This does not. It does help reduce the appearance with some small, visible blood vessels around my nose, but it’s only a temporary effect thereby reducing redness. \n\n***Bad stuff:*** It doesn’t really work for what I wanted it to work for.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 1/5, WNRP.\n\n*Does anyone have any suggestions of what I can do with what I have leftover? I’d love to use it for something else if it’s functional!*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free Mattifying Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/rQeCSUV)\n\n***Product Type:*** Daytime moisturizer; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Propylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethicone, Ceteareth-20, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Silica Silylate, Behenyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Salicylic Acid, Panthenol, Fragrance, Boron Nitride, Bambusa Arundinacea (Bamboo) Stem Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Maltodextrin, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance-free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; very thick consistency; absorbs quickly; powdery/soft finish\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** Another game-changer with my oily skin. Using this moisturizer during the day saves my face from producing oil. Even if I sweat a little bit, it controls oil. Normally, without it, I’ll start producing oil within a few hours of cleansing. If I use this moisturizer, I’m relatively oil-free all day, except around my nostrils. This is also a strong enough moisturizer to keep my dryness at bay, even during the wintertime (and where I live gets very cold during the winter).\n\n***Bad stuff:*** The smell is pretty bad (probably the bamboo), but honestly I get used to it and the smell goes away quickly. My friend said it smells like wet dog... haha but I don't notice it anymore since I've been using it for so long.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, only because it’s not fragrance-free. Will continue to repurchase until I can find a fragrance-free alternative.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++](https://imgur.com/a/kXZLXCa)\n\n***Product Type:*** Sunscreen; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.40 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dipropylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Viscum Album (Mistletoe) Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Carex Humillis Root Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Pinus Sylvestris Leaf Oil, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Malpighia Emarginata (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Echium Plantagineum Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Peg-10 Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Magnesium Sulfate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Methicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Aluminum Hydroxide, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Octyldodecanol, Dimethicone, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-6 Polyricinoleate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Butylene Glycol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Cellulose Gum\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mineral sunscreen**; **Not fragrance-free**; **Mild whitecast**, but absorbs well; **Drying**; mattifying/oil-control like a boss; pleasant scent; not waterproof\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Due to drying my skin out, I only use this product when I have to. I don’t wear SPF most days (work inside, very little exposure to sun during the day), but I do wear this when I’m running errands and/or trying to control my oil more than I can with the moisturizer mentioned previously. This stuff works really well to control oil – the best of any product I’ve tried so far. Wears well under makeup, as long as my dry skin is kept controlled. Some minor white cast, but with my skin it absorbs and isn’t visible (even when I’m tanner) – but may not be the same on someone with a darker than medium skin tone.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** This product is very drying. It works SO WELL on controlling oil, but it zaps any amount of moisture out of my dry spots. To the point where I have to counteract the dryness in my PM routine. Do not recommend for people with sensitive skin, or dry skin.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 3/5, due to drying and not being fragrance-free; Will continue to repurchase until I find an alternative that controls my oil as well as this does, if ever.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Paula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Gel Exfoliant](https://imgur.com/a/X9YEexN)\n\n***Product Type:*** Chemical exfoliant; meant to prevent/reduce CCs and help with overall skin texture\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$8.80 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, (hydration), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Phytosphingosine (skin-renewing), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Vitis Vinifera Seed Extract (grape extract/antioxidant), Camellia Sinensis Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (green tea/antioxidant) Epilobium Angustifolium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (willow herb/skin-soothing), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH-adjusting), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; **BHA**; thick consistency, absorbs slowly\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is AMAZING! It attacks any signs of CCs overnight, and can easily clear my CC-prone forehead within a day or two. I use it almost every day as a preventative. My face has been noticeably clearer and smoother thanks to this product. Also, it visibly reduces the appearances of pores - this combined with the retinol I use has been an amazing in reducing their appearance.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Smells chemical, so may be off-putting to some people. Absorbs slowly, so you should leave room in your routine for that.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, WRP. I am going to be trying to the liquid version (I got it on sale), but if this works better for me over the liquid I will come back to it\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/BDGVfpd)\n\n***Product Type:*** PM moisturizer; light-weight\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$9.50 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Dimethicone/vinyl Dimenticone Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethaqnol, Polyacrylamide, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Dimethiconol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, C12-14 Pareth -12, Sodium Hydroxide, Blue 1\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **NOT Fragrance-free**; **Contains silicones**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; **Contains hyaluronic acid**; Very light-weight moisturizer.\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I love this product. It was the first moisturizer I tried when I embarked on my skincare journey, and I am so thankful I found it. This is the first moisturizer I used every in my life that didn’t break me out or lead to a forehead full of CCs. I’m in love with this stuff! It is light enough for my super oily spots (which is not due to being dry, it’s just oily…) and is strong enough for my dry spots. In the winter I use a little extra HA serum over my whole face and it works like a charm. I’ve been dabbling with some oils as well, but so far I haven’t found it necessary in the summer because this moisturizer works so well!\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Nothing, just that it’s not fragrance free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, because of fragrance. Will continue to RP until I can find an alternative that I can afford and is fragrance free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading, everyone! I hope this is helpful, as I use some products that you don't see a lot around here (as well as some you do...). This is definitely a more simplified version of my routine, but that may be a good thing, as I'm noticing the same effects as to what I was seeing before despite reducing the number of products I use!",

    "body": "I'm From wash off masks are well-loved in the Asian Beauty community. So I've been trying a few of these out and wanted to let you all know my experiences with them! The Fig Scrub Mask is a new product I received as a beauty tester for Wishtrend. Would have preferred getting the essence or cleansing balm instead, but hey! A free product's a free product.\n\n**I'm From Honey Mask**\n\n*Ingredients:*\n\n>Honey, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Pentylene Glycol, Microcrystalline Wax, Polysorbate 20, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Beeswax, Tocopheryl Acetate, Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract, Corylus Avellana (Hazel) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Water, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Propolis Extract, Beta-Glucan, Bee Venom, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Sophora Angustifolia Root Extract, Eugenia Caryophyllus (Clove) Flower Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Punica Granatum Fruit Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin\n\n*Overview:*\n\n- Looks and feels like a thick, gooey caramel sauce. Smells sweet since there's a lot of honey in this, but it's notably a medicinal type of honey scent. If you've ever smelled manuka honey this scent is within that general ballpark.\n- May separate occasionally. All you have to do is stir and it's good to go.\n- Pretty much never dries down. They recommend leaving it on for 10-60 minutes. Dry people would probably benefit more from leaving it on longer, but 60 minutes is overkill. I just do 30 minutes.\n- My first time washing this off, I had removed most of it with a wet paper towel (to save my clog prone sink) but thought it was strange that everything hadn't been taken off yet no matter how much I rinsed. Then I realized - no, that wasn't the mask. Or any residue. That plump, bouncy thing I was touching was just MY FACE. This mask just seems to max out your moisture levels like mad.\n- I think most people would really enjoy the Honey Mask. Dry and dehydrated skin types would especially love it. People who are oily and already have enough moisture may find it doesn't do much for them, though.\n\n**I'm From Mugwort Mask**\n\n*Ingredients:*\n\n>Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cordyceps Sinensis Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Methylpropanediol, Ligularia Fishceri Leaf Extract, Rosa Davurica Bud Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Sodium Polyacrylaste, Carbomer, Arginine, Phenoxyethanol, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Panthenol, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA\n\n*Overview:*\n\n- A clearish brown gel with bits of real mugwort. This is not supposed to be an exfoliating mask so be careful and don't rub those pieces in too much.\n- Kinda looks like you've rubbed dirt all over your face. Not necessarily a bad thing.\n- There's a distinctive scent. I've never specifically encountered mugwort before delving into K-beauty, but opening this immediately reminded me of the smell from Chinese traditional herbal stores. This smell isn't overwhelmingly strong but it is present. People who dislike those kinds of earthy scents will probably hate this.\n- Actually dries down. About 10-15 minutes depending on how thin of a layer you put on.\n- In contrast to the honey mask which excels at nourishing and plumping out your skin, the mugwort masks excels at reducing redness and calming irritation. It also made my face look a bit brighter.\n- It's not a moisture bomb like the honey mask. But it's enough to keep my skin decently hydrated and in a pretty good state.\n- This mask is pretty lightweight. Pretty much anyone can use this. Rather than a question of \"do you want a product for your skin type\", it's more of a question of \"do you have irritated skin and want a product targeted towards calming it down?\" The Mugwort Mask definitely delivers in this regard.\n\n**I'm From Fig Scrub Mask**\n\n*Ingredients:*\n\n>Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sucrose, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate , Stearalkonium Hectorite, C13-15 Alkane, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Powder, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Seed Meal, Fragrance(Parfum), Juglans Regia (Walnut) Shell Powder, Caprylyl Glycol, Caramel\n\n*Overview:*\n\n- Since this is a new product many people haven't seen yet, [here's some pictures!](https://imgur.com/a/Yh4QBfs)\n- Disclaimer: I'm not someone who usually uses scrubs on my face. So I can't really compare it to other products of this type.\n- The Honey Mask is gooey. The Mugwort Mask is a gel. I would the describe the Fig Scrub Mask as chunky.\n- This is an exfoliating wash off mask primarily made of sugar and fig powder. It has tiny 1mm wide nut pieces which are either the sweet almond or walnut shell listed in the ingredients. \n- There's a light fruit scent. Presumably this is what fig smells like, but can't confirm as I've never actually eaten fig. As Kelly Driscoll mentioned with the Ginseng line - if an I'm From product has a fragrant component it might just be included to amplify whatever scent's already in there. It doesn't seem to be an artificial fruit scent. Still find it unnecessary and would have preferred this product to have no fragrance at all. It's an exfoliating mask so what's the point?\n- The instructions say to leave it on for 10-15 minutes and then gently rub for a few more minutes. It doesn't say whether you're supposed to put it on wet or dry skin. I assume the wait time is for softening dead skin cells, so dry skin is probably the way to go.\n- As with all physical exfoliants - the end result will mainly depend on the user. Contrary to the name, you shouldn't actually scrub your face with this like you would scrub burnt bits off a pan. Please be gentle when massaging this in.\n- Could feel the mask warming up with the heat of my face and becoming a little more pliable. Not all the sugar's going to dissolve. Don't wait for that to be an indication of when you should stop rubbing. Just lightly glide with circular motions a couple times and wash it off.\n- My first time using this, there were flakes around my mouth (maybe from not massaging there enough) and a puffy red patch on my cheek (maybe from massaging there a little too much). So it's important to be thorough, but it's even more important to be gentle.\n- This leaves a similar moisturized feeling to the Honey Mask but to a lesser degree. My face feels smooth after.\n\n**Some further comments:**\n\n- The Honey and Mugwort Masks are available in sample size tubes. So try those out before buying the full size. Good for 5-6 uses.\n- Nobody else mentioned this, but all I'm From wash off masks come with a handy spatula.\n- The Fig Scrub Mask primarily uses capric triglyceride. This is also included in the Honey Mask, but with 60% confirmed honey and a lot of other ingredients it should be much lower than 40%. Capric triglyceride is a coconut oil derivative. It's included in a lot of other well-known skincare products and definitely not as bad as straight up raw coconut oil. But if you have a sensitivity or are clog-prone to coconut-derived ingredients, I'd say avoid the Fig/Honey Masks.\n- The Honey Mask is an easy universal recommendation to most people. But all these masks are meant to target different things. Anyone wondering which one to get should primarily choose one for their own skin concerns.\n\ntldr; honey for moisture/mugwort for soothing/fig for physical exfoliating\n\nThank you for reading this word vomit! By the way, if anyone has any tips for wearing glasses on top of wash-off masks, I'd love to know.",

It has glycerin as a top ingredient, the same as Mac Fix+ which people use to \"foil\" or help shadows stay better.\n\nHope you enjoy! Just testing a theory! \n\n*DISCLAIMER AND WARNING*\n\nIdk if it's exactly eye proof. It says keep out of eyes, but you should really keep alot of crap out of your eyes. I use urban decay all nighter mixed with shadows and that says keep out of eyes. Also, if you use it as a primer, it could potentially get in your eye.\n\nSo.. FYI, don't squirt it in your eye unless you... Really want to?? \n\nI haven't used it on my eyes yet until I look at the ingredients a bit more thoroughly. I also am not advocating you to do so. I just had a thought and played a bit to test it! \n\nIngredient list to inform yourself:\n\n\"Ingredients:\nWater, Glycerin, Isopropyl Palmitate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Bark/Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tapioca Starch, Triceteareth-4 Phosphate, Maltodextrin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Piroctone Olamine, Fragrance.\"\n\n\nEDIT: \n\nFIX+ ingredients if you're curious!\n\n\"Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Caffeine, Panthenol, Arginine, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Fragrance, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol\"",

I was using these and testing them out while I was writing my previous sunscreen post , so I couldn't include these back then heheh. enjoy and I hope this helps you out!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/un9cxl/shelfie_sunscreens_more_info/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**preliminary info**\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wvluy9fctp691.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d3dc4f6ac986e712bf9b297f7f11882f59c62e78\n\n* **The Derma Co.**  **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum**  \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfsq89eetp691.jpg?width=2064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44d6b8bae83040943583a5eb4b1167f006397a41\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gneguawetp691.jpg?width=2693&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=310db1edebf494a6ddcbc27c6d5bd31261b1ee84\n\n**ingredient list** :  Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation. I found this really mediocre.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Axis-Y Complete No-Stress Physical Sunscreen \\[SPF 50+ PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1450 for 50ml (bought for Rs.999 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily combo skin types. those with dry skin like mine, might find it a bit more drying. good one for sensitive skins since it has a lot of calming ingredients as well!\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick white cream. fragrance free but has very strong ayurvedic smell. matte finish. physical sunscreen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0lmry60ntp691.jpg?width=2284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=87ba8e26163d69608b5908427942392e037340cf\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k16vk0tntp691.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5842c13a2344fb14bbe8cb6275e1b6355354b19\n\n**ingredients list** :  Water, Zinc Oxide, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propanediol, Titanium Dioxide, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Caprylyl Methicone, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Disiloxane, Niacinamide, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Water, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Stearic Acid, Aluminum Hydroxide, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Copaifera Officinalis (Balsam Copaiba) Resin, Tocopherol, Squalane, Allantoin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5\n\n**filters** :\n\n* zinc oxide (mineral filter)\n* titanium dioxide (mineral filter)\n\nthis had been on my 'to buy' list for such a long time! and I finally got it during a march beauty barn sale! when I first tried it, I was really skeptical since it gave me a pretty bad whitecast and smelt so weird. I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :( but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nrating : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uglx4tvptp691.jpg?width=3027&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1edc1b4cadce02af8a7cdc6b1c061b01ce3df5ce\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sjk70mlqtp691.jpg?width=3234&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9624dd3003686cc5cf39097b7f271e1643502dd5\n\n**ingredients list** :  Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure!  in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh. I feel like this one is getting over sooner than others in my ss ki theli 😫 but either way, if you find a good deal on it, blindly add this to your cart and order it. you wont be dissappointed!\n\nrating : 5/5 and WRP on reduced mrp only.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand that's all I have to share with you all today! there are so many other ss I want to try like the BOJ one and the Beplain nonnano one, but I want to finish my current stock before buying anymore! do feel free to ask any questions related in the comments and I hope you enjoyed reading these!",

I love physical sunscreens for indooors mainly due to the whitecast, I’ve been using the Neutrogena Sheer zinc for a while because it not only gives me a sun protection but also soothes my skin and reduces oil production. But the biggest drawback is it’s whitecast :/ and I totally get you when you mention the white cast around mouth. The Neutrogena one makes me looking like a ghost all day.",

I've been using the 130ml pump bottles with the 2021 minor font change, but the 2023 reformulation is in 130ml tubes, and YesStyle doesn't specify the type of packaging, just \"2021 NEW\", and 2021 could be a typo...

    "body": "Hi everyone!\n\nThis is me doing a comparative review once again. You can check out my comparative review for winter moisturisers [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/kjuvbt/comparative_review_cetaphil_dam_vs_reequil/).\n\nThe title mentions a lot of moisturisers I know, but all of them have been used in the past one year or so. Summers are icky and choosing a moisturiser has become harder for me. Should I even use one when my skin is wetter and saltier than the Indian Ocean at the moment? idk friends, you tell me. When it is extremely humid and I am stepping out, I do not use a moisturiser. I use a hydrating toner (klairs supple) and sunscreen (I have reviewed all of them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/o9jpj9/sunscreen_comparative_review_neutrogena_innisfree/) )\n\n* *Skin Type:* Combination, oily at the T zone. At the moment, extremely oil at the T Zone, esp during high humidity days.\n* *Current climatic conditions:* Continental, hot and humid at the moment\n* *AGE:* 27 yo female\n* *Usage timeline:* More than a month for all the moisturisers except the FormulaRx one.\n\n1. **Neutrogran Hydroboost Gel:** I do not honestly recall what I was using before I began using this. It is a silicone rich light gel and spreads easily. The texture is light and it does not feel heavy on the skin, though it does not get fully absorbed either. When I used it last year, it seemed okay but did not impress me much. The fragrance was high, which further put me off of it. **I bought it for 800 bucks but I just checked and it now retails for a whooping 1000 bucks for 50gm on Nykaa**. That is honestly too much for this blue jar. I have also seen influencers raving about it calling it \"ocean in a jar\"....Sorry, have they seen the state of the oceans? It is all kachra these days. While the gel is neither ocean nor kachra, **I did not repurchase it and will not do so**, simply because it is way below the mark for me. However it did not break me out.\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\n[Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Dimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Dimethicone/​Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone-vinyl-dimethicone-crosspolymer), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Polyacrylamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyacrylamide), [Cetearyl Olivate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-olivate), [Sorbitan Olivate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitan-olivate), [Dimethiconol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethiconol), [C13-14 Isoparaffin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c13-14-isoparaffin), [Dimethicone Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone-crosspolymer), [Chlorphenesin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/chlorphenesin), [Carbomer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/carbomer), [Laureth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-7), [Sodium Hyaluronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-hyaluronate), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [C12-14 Pareth -12](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-pareth-12), [Sodium Hydroxide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-hydroxide), [Blue 1](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-42090)\n\n**2. Simple Light Hydrating Moisturiser:** I got introduced to this moisturiser through this sub and I really like it! It is hydrating and occlusive as well. Its consistency is somewhere between a gel and a cream- but it is not as light as an emulsion, it is slightly leans towards the lotion side. I usually use it in months that are neither too hot, nor too cold. That is February, March and then September, October and November. In colder months, my skin remains dry despite using it and in hotter and humid months, this feels a little heavy for my combination skin. **I love it over all and it is definitely a no frills, value for money moisturiser, retailing for 430 bucks for 125ml on Nykaa. WRP.** Did not break me out.\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\n[Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Paraffinum Liquidum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/paraffinum-liquidum), [Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyglyceryl-3-methylglucose-distearate), [Dimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone), [Cetyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-palmitate), [Cetyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-alcohol), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Caprylyl Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylyl-glycol), [Carbomer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/carbomer), [Potassium Hydroxide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-hydroxide), [Tocopheryl Acetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tocopheryl-acetate), [Bisabolol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bisabolol), [Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-c10-30-alkyl-acrylate-crosspolymer), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Pantolactone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pantolactone), [Borago Officinalis Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/borago-officinalis-seed-oil), [Potassium Carbonate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-carbonate), [Pentylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentylene-glycol), [Urea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/urea), [Lactic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/lactic-acid), [Sodium Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lactate), [Serine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/serine), [Sorbitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitol), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Allantoin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/allantoin)\n\n**3. Etude House Soon Jung Moist Relief All in One Gel-** This is the one I am using at the moment and it satisfies my currently very oily Tzone perfectly. It does feel a tad bit less for my cheeks but all the sweat makes for it lol ;\\_; . I tried the emulsion as well in the hopes of meeting all my needs but it feels sticky to me.It seems like I cannot have it all ;\\_;\n\nCompared to HydroBoost, this is way lighter! It is almost watery when applied on the skin.The ingredient list is impressive but I dont know if it has done anything extra special for my skin. It is good enough and that is perfectly satisfactory for me. I don't think it has any occlusives and it mainly just hydrates my skin. So i use it in my AM routine, and use the sunscreen over it. Hopefully that should trap all the moisture in, right? (insert Anakin and Padame meme). I love it and will buy it for summers, especially for the hot and humid months of May, June, July and August. I don't think it can satisfy my skin's needs in the other months. **It retails for 1200 bucks for 120 ml and is available only on Nykaa afaik. WRP.** Has not broken me out either.\n\n**Ingredients:** Water / Aqua / Eau, Propanediol, Panthenol, Silica, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Glyceryl Caprylate, Butylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Ethylhexylglycerin, Madecassoside, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Tocopherol\n\n**4. The FormulaRx Barrier Relief Lightweight Gel Cream:** This is a new kid on the block and the company does not have a good reputation here and rightfully so. I did not want to buy from them but then I sold my soul and compromised my morals all because its emulsion like texture seemed exactly what I wanted and felt it would suit my skin. Sorry heavenly father, I will do better. That said, the texture really is all that. It has ceramides and what not (=niacinamide). The texture is exactly how the long ass name describes it as- a cream-gel, g(j)elly cream etc etc. Also I have only used it only for a week, during my PM routine so these are strictly my first impressions. It sinks in nicely, given you are able to take out the desired amount from the metallic tube. Because often, you wont be- it will squirt out way more than what you need, the packaging is aesthetic but really inconvenient. Even the tube arrived all dented and pichka hua. Overall it is a good moisturiser that I will perhaps continue to use in my PM but I have not yet made my mind whether I'll repurchase it or not. **It retails for 799 bucks for 50gm and I feel it could have been priced lower.**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, caprylic/ capric triglyceride, glycerin, niacinamide, propanediol, cetearyl alcohol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, sodium hyaluronate, colloidal oatmeal, panthenol, allantoin, ceramide np, ceramide ap, ceramide eop, phytosphingosine, cholesterol, linoleic acid, sodium lauroyl lactylate, xanthan gum, butylene glycol, carbomer, tocopherol, phenoxyethanol, dimethicone, disodium edta, linolenic acid, ethylhexylglycerin.\n\nI hope these reviews are helpful! As always, these are my personal impressions and YMMV. So please take it with a pinch of salt. Additionally I have reviewed Disguise Cosmetic's C+C Sorbet [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/jyao20/disguise_cosmetics_cc_sorbet_review/).\n\nAnd yet,  [I still haven't found what I'm looking for](https://youtu.be/e3-5YC_oHjE). I actually did find something that suited me through most months- the Sulwhasoo Essential Balancing Emulsion. The texture and consistency are wonderful. Sinks in nicely. I don't feel dry or greasy. Moreover it brightens up my face. I absolutely love it. Unfortunately I only had a sample size which got over pretty soon ;\\_; I have been tempted to buy the full size but guys, does it make sense to spend 4k on the full size of this emulsion?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**edit(copying this from my comment below)**:  *Unfortunately today i woke with a painful zit. I do not get zits. So either it is because of the formularx moisturiser or the mangoes I am eating everyday. I guess karm ka phal ekdum mil gya.*\n\n It could be the ceramides because I have broken out a little because of them earlier too. Too soon to say it is this moisturiser. Will update here if I find anything conclusive.",

I don't necessarily believe in spending less or more based on the type of product. If it's something that absolutely fits all your bills and you know it won't make you want go buy anything else since it matches you to perfection it's better on getting that one than mindlessly trying to try multiple other products which anyways you wil be spending on. But if it's out of budge liek way off then keep your search on😅 for me it's cleansers. Ppl spend thr least on it but for me the perfect cleanser was something I badly needed. Found one expensive yes but saves me from buying or being tempted to buy anything else. Also I don't buy the other products in expensive range because I am happy with how the ones I already own function",

For a few minutes it leaves a shiny finish, but doesn’t peel, doesn’t have any smell.

It has a nifty opening; after flipping open the flip cap, you can hold the packaging and twist the opening. After this you can squeeze out the cream. When you are done you simply twist back the opening and put the cap back on. This extra protection mechanism for dispensing the cream makes me feel like it is protected from air and therefore keeping the contens more fresh.\n\n**My experience:**\n\nThe cream is white and has a lovely whipped texture. I found that a little goes a long way. I dot a minimal amount on my face and then pat it in. It is quite a thick cream and therefore patting it in is recommended; I found that when I did not do this properly, the cream would lay on my skin a little and feel slightly greasy. The result of patting it in is lovely soft and almost 'mochi' like skin. I feel like this cream has helped me tremendously in keeping my barrier intact.\n\nAnother strong point is that it seems to be a very gentle cream. Last week, I found out that there was something in my routine irritating my skin. I decided to cut back on all products but cleanser, moisturizer and sunscreen. This was the moisturizer I kept using. I noticed that within one day my skin calmed down greatly. This was undoubtedly due to a more simplified routine, but I felt that the Panthenol, Madecassoside and Green Tea extract worked wonders for calming down my skin. I am also very acne prone and this cream has not broken me out but your mileage may vary.\n\nI did not experience any problems with applying sunscreen and makeup afterwards.\n\n**Final verdict:** This is a lovely cream with soothing ingredients. I would strongly recommend you to buy it if you are looking for a basic but very reliable moisturizer that is unlikely to aggravate your skin.",

I've tried mint and peach and prefer the mint. Great lip product and I've used a lot. Some favorites being the Laneige Lip sleeping mask, Bite Agave Nectar Lip mask, Dr. Dan's Cortibalm, and C.O. Bigelow My Favorite Night Balm. This is one of the more affordable options out of the ones listed and it's amazing! Very very hydrating as someone who suffers with severely dry lips. It makes my lips feel like butter. Has some great ingredients like ceramides, green tea, panthenol. Very mild fragrances just enough to notice when applying but almost like it's unscented after it's on your lips for a few minutes. I'd say it's a medium consistency not too thick and not too thin just enough of a barrier. Really recommend if you've had trouble finding a great affordable everyday lip product.

    "body": "I was on the search for the perfect fragrance free oil/balm cleanser for quite some time. I love to do double cleanse to make sure I remove all the sunscreen and makeup at the end of the day. Over the years, I have tried quite a few of first cleansers/cleansing balms so I thought I would do a quick review here for anyone who is interested. My standards when it comes to a good cleansing balm/oil: fragrance-free, effective, but gentle on the skin, doesn’t over-dry the skin and doesn’t sting my eyes. My skin is sensitive and acne-prone.\n\nAll the products I buy and review here completely fragrance free, contain no masking fragrance, no “natural” fragrances or essential oils, no photo-sensitizing, potentially irritating plant oil/extracts (lavender, eucalyptus, citrus). So here we go:\n\n**Versed Gentle Cycle Hydrating Milky Cleanser:**  **•**\n\n**Ingredients**: Water/Aqua/EauOlea Europaea (Olive) Fruit OilHelianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed OilPropanediolVitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed OilGlycerinCaprylic/Capric TriglycerideMusa Sapientum (Banana) ExtractMagnesium Aluminum SilicateLactobacillus Ferment LysateSclerocarya Birrea (Marula) Seed OilAvena Sativa (Oat) Kernel ExtractRubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit ExtractLeuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment FiltrateTocopherolCitric AcidSodium Lauroyl SarcosinateXanthan GumEthylhexylglycerinSodium BenzoatePotassium SorbateSodium Hydroxide\n\n**My thought:** This product has a milky texture that is easy to use, effective and also gentle on the skin and doesn’t sting my eyes, but there are a few things to note: 1/ It doesn’t spread very far on the skin so you have to use quite a lot of product to cover the entire face so the bottle doesn’t last very long. 2/Even though the product is fragrance free, there’s a light banana scent due to the banana extract in the formula. So if you’re not fond of the banana smell, you might not like it.  Overall, it’s a great , gentle formula and one that I might repurchase.\n\n**Updated review (11/10/22): I recently repurchased this product again and noticed there are little grainy particles like sand in the product. I'm not sure what they did to the product but my sensitive skin can't tolerate scrubs or any physical exfoliant so I won't be using or repurchase this product again.**\n\n**Good Molecule Instant Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Polyethylene, PEG-8 Isostearate, 1,2-hexanediol, Butyrospermum Parkii (shea) Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Caprylic/capric Triglyceride, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Citric Acid.\n\n**My thought:** This product used to be only available in the scented version (loaded with potentially irritating essential oils), but due to customer demand, they decided to make a fragrance free version (thank you very much). I’m not sure if the scented version is still out there, so make sure you check the ingredients carefully before purchasing. This product come in a tub with a small spatula that you can use to scoop up the product. I do like this cleansing balm, I think it’s very effective and a little goes a long way. You don’t need to use much to cleanse the entire face. It’s also gentle enough to use around my eyes without any irritation. One con I can think of about this product is the smell. Even though it’s fragrance free, it has a chemical smell that is quite strong which I guess comes from one of the raw ingredients in the formula (though I’m not sure which one exactly). I think some people might find it unpleasant, but it’s still better than adding fragrance or essential oils.\n\n**The Ordinary Squalene Cleanser:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Squalane, Aqua (Water), Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Glycerin, Sucrose Stearate, Ethyl Macadamiate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Sucrose Laurate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Isoceteth-20, Sodium Polyacrylate, Tocopherol, Hydroxymethoxyphenyl Decanone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Malic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Chlorphenesin.\n\n**My thought:** This product has a cream texture that is quite thick coming out of the tube, and once it’s on the skin, it does require a lot of massaging, then the texture changes to oil as you work it in. Even though it’s gentle on the skin, I find it a lot less effective than other products on this list. This is not a product I would recommend for someone that wears a lot of makeup or doesn’t like to take a long time removing makeup at the end of the day. Even if you don’t wear a lot of makeup, I think there are better products out there. Personally, I wouldn’t repurchase it because: 1/It requires too much rubbing and effort to make it work. 2/I find it does irritate my eyes a little. 3/you have to use a lot of product to cleanse the entire face and the tube doesn’t last very long.\n\n**The Inkey List Oat Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Oil, Candelilla Cera (Cire de candelilla), Silica,Sorbitan Stearate, Tribehenin, PEG-60 Almond Glycerides, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Flour, Aqua (Water/Eau), Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Biosaccharide Gum-4, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil.\n\n**My thought:** This product comes in a tube, similar to the packaging of the ordinary squalene cleanser, but the texture is different. It comes out of the tube like petrolatum jelly. Because it’s quite thick, it doesn’t spread very far, so you have to use quite a lot of product to cleanse the entire face. It’s gentle on the skin and eyes, and leave my skin very soft afterward, but I think it will not work well for someone that wear a lot of makeup. I consider myself a minimal makeup wearer and this product couldn’t remove my eyeshadow completely. I also notice that the texture of the cleanser is not completely smooth, it’s slightly grainy due to the small pieces of oat which I do not like. I will not be repurchasing this product.\n\n**Jordan Samuel Skin The After Show Treatment Cleanser for Sensitive Skin:**\n\n**Ingredients**: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Glycerin, Aqua/Water, Sucrose Laurate, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobiliss Flower Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Propanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**My thought:** This has to be the worse balm cleanser I have ever tried. It has a jelly-like texture coming out of the tube, and it goes on the skin just fine, but it just doesn’t cleanse off when I rinse my face with water. It barely remove makeup and leaves my face with a layer of residue that feels oily. I feel like I have to follow up with another cleanser right away or risk breaking out. I hate wasting product but I couldn’t make myself use this one so I threw it out after trying a few times. Sadly, I cannot recommend this product to anyone.\n\n**Hada Labo Gokujun Oil Cleanser:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Triethylhexanoin, Sorbeth-30 Tetraisostearate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olive Fruit Oil, Water, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate(Super Hyaluronic Acid), Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate (Skin-adsorbed Hyaluronic Acid), Jojoba Seed Oil, Ceresin, Dextrin Palmitate/Ethylhexanoate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, BHT\n\n**My thought:** this product is a very popular Japanese cleansing oil, and for a good reason. It’s affordable, cleanses quickly and effectively, without leaving any residue behind. 2 pumps are what needed to cleanse my entire face. If you’re someone that wear a lot of makeup and need something that can remove make up fast and effortlessly, you will love this product. Some cons about this product: 1/ it can bother my eyes sometimes if I get it too close to the eyes. I thought i just throw this out there in case anyone has super sensitive eyes. 2/ It might be hard to get in in store. You have to order it online and it might take some time to arrive.\n\n**Isnt Tree Micellar Melting Cleansing Oil:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Sap , Opuntia Ficus-Indica Seed Oil , Camellia Sinensis Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Squalane\n\n**My thought:** This is a liquidy cleansing oil that comes in a pump bottle. It’s thin in texture and gentle, but effective. It’s also non irritating to the eyes, and rinses off well. Compare to the hada labo, it’s a thinner oil, and I have to use more product than Hada Labo to cleanse my entire face. I need 3 pumps for Isnt Tree as opposed to only 2 pumps for Hada Labo. If you are deciding between the 2, I would recommend Hada Labo. It’s just as effective if not more, the bottle lasts longer, and more cost effective as well.\n\n**Purito from Green Cleansing Oil:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Glyceryl Caprylate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Vegetable Oil, Tocopherol\n\n**My thought:** This oil cleanser come in a pump bottle similar to the ones from Hada Labo and Isnt Tree, but the texture is thicker than the other 2 brands. It’s effective, but gentle and doesn’t irritate my eyes. I need about 3 pumps to cleanse my entire face. Overall, it’s a good cleanser but I still prefer the Hada Labo because it’s cheaper, works just as well, and the bottle lasts longer.\n\n**Paula’s Choice Omega + Complex Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients**: Ethylhexyl Palmitate (emollient solvent), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (skin-replenishing), PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate (emollient cleansing agent), Diisooctyl Succinate (emollient), Olive Oil PEG-7 Esters (emollient cleansing agent/emulsifier), Trihydroxystearin (texture enhancer), Glyceryl Stearate (emulsifier), Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Hydrogenated Rapeseed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Tocopheryl Acetate (vitamin E/antioxidant).\n\n**My thought:** This one has a balm like texture coming out of the tube and spread easily on the skin. There’s no residue left behind after cleansing. This product is gentle on my skin, doesn’t sting my eyes and is also effective. It has no discernible smell, which is nice since some fragrance-free products can still have an unpleasant smell due to the raw ingredients used in the formula.\n\n**Beauty of Joseon Radiance Cleansing Balm** \n\n**Ingredients:** Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-10 Isostearate, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Seed Water, Avena Sativa (Oat) Meal Extract, Coix Lacryma-Jobi Ma-yuen Seed Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Water, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Glycerin, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**My thought:** This is the most recent product that I've tried and is my current favorite. If I have to choose only 1 balm/oil cleanser to use, this would be the one. It replaces my previous favorite cleansing balm from Paula's Choice. The texture is smooth and gentle on the skin. It spreads more easily than Paula's Choice's and has no detectable scent. \n\n**Other plain oil options I’ve tried that work well:** When I run out of my balm cleanser and haven’t purchased a replacement in time. I usually use plain oils to remove my makeup. But because plain oils do not contain emulsifier, they don’t come off with water, so I have to immediately follow up with a water based cleanser to rinse off the oil residue on my face. Here are 2 oils that I like to use:\n\n**Coconut oil**: thicker oil, best for people with normal to dry skin\n\n**Jojoba Oil:** thinner in texture than coconut oil, best for oily and combo skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Top 3:** \n\n**Beauty of Joseon Radiance Cleansing Balm** \n\n**Paula’s Choice Omega + Complex Cleansing Balm**\n\n**Hada Labo Gokujun Oil Cleanser**\n\nIf you have a favorite oil/balm cleansers that are not on this list, please share with me in the comment :)\n\n&#x200B;",

        "body": "This is so cool! I love seeing people as committed to zero fragrance/irritants as I am! I'm definitely going to keep these in mind for reccing balms in the future since I don't usually mess with those.\n\nFor context, I'm dry skin and sensitive + acne prone, plus have keratosis pilaris. A cleansing oil I would highly suggest to try out is\n\nKOSE SPEEDY cleansing oil. Here is the current ingredient list https://incidecoder.com/products/kose-speedy-cleansing-oil\n\n you'll see a lot of different listings since they reformulated a lot but this is the right one. \nIt is a very light, well emulsified oil that rinses cleanly and doesn't overstrip. Spreads very well. Doesn't leave a residue. It is even good as a solo cleanse! This is my default recc for any skin type or with any condition. I have people with rosacea, eczema, and ichthyosis using it so I'm very confident in its gentleness. In the US, there's 1pack 7.8oz for $13 or 2pack with 1 full and 1 refill for $20 on Amazon. Some have mentioned being able to find it at Daiso stores in US and other countries. \n\nSo this second one I've only used for a week but I begrudgingly have been pretty into it as I'm more on the dry side. It's the Neutrogena lightweight body oil fragrance-free https://www.neutrogena.com/products/skincare/body-oil-fragrance-free/6861830.html\n\nIt's a very low-viscosity watery-freling oil and it has good spreadability. Works really well at getting into pore for that deep but gentle clean you want from oils. It's probably the gentlest one I've tried even more so than my DIY sunflower/grapeseed + Polysorbate 80 I've made. The \"problem\" is that the Neutrogena oil does not rinse well at all. However I think it might good alternative for people who have tried other oil cleanser and found the emulsifiers just made it too much for their skin but don't want to use a pure oil. It does mostly come off with the gentle second cleanse. It will leave a bit behind in your skin, but as someone dry I quite appreciate that slight buffer for the cleanser and it hasn't caused any issues or broken me out. My skin does actually feel quite a bit more comfortable and less dry since introducing this when this was the only change. It does feel decently nourishing without being overwhelming. It definitrly lives up to its claims if used this way. Normal price is $13 for 8.5oz but can be found for $9-10 on sale sometimes. I'm still not sure how I feel about it but my skin has already decided it likes this, so... 😒\n\nAs my gentle water-based cleanser, my current favorite is the Pipette baby wash and shampoo fragrance-free https://www.target.com/p/pipette-baby-shampoo-wash-fragrance-free-11-8-fl-oz/-/A-79503241. I get a lot of funny looks when I recc this but it's genuinely the best thing I've found that is on par in gentleness with some of the better non-foaming cleansers like the Aveeno calm and restore oat cleanser and is more affordable. It has amazing spreadability and you don't need a lot. I have gone through 4 bottles and am about to repurchase because I'm too hooked and it's insanely cost effective compared to most facial cleansers. Normal price is $8 for 12oz, it's commonly on sale for $6.50ish and one time I caught it for $4 so I stocked up hard. But I'd be happy paying $8. I also use it for body and hair so 😳 I felt it was worth mentioning since it's the second cleanse I follow with.\n\nI'm definitely gonna be taking a look at more of your content now as well!

Like Signature C Source, Red C serum contains 20% ascorbic acid - but also glutathione and Vitamin B12. It seems like a more powerful version of the well-loved Signature C Source (at least as far as lightening scars go), but when I searched for it on this sub I didn't get any results. \n\nHere's the ingredient list: \n\nWater, Ascorbic Acid, Alcohol, Niacinamide, Sodium Lactate, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glucose, Butylene Glycol, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyacetophenone, Xanthan Gum, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Glutathione, Cyanocobalamin, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Panthenol, Lactobacillus/Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract Ferment Filtrate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan \n\nWhat do you guys think about it?",

To be fair I've already been using vit c's daily prior to trying this formula so there's not much more brightening I can reasonably expect at this point.\n\nYou can absolutely see the colour change as it oxidizes, it was red when I first got it, now it's more orange (colour started changing at around week 5). It's been [hypothesized that glutathione protects against oxidized vit c radicals](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-0348-7424-3_11), which I found quite interesting, so I gave the serum a shot. \n\nI tested it with my pH strips and it has a pH of around 3.\n\nAlso interesting is that I didn't get a flush from the LAA/niacinamide combo. Previously I had used Purito's c serum and that caused Kim Kardashian vampire facial level of flushing. When I started using the serum, there was a very strong prickling sensation, but no redness or itching. I persevered and it went away by the 4th day, although I find that if my face is damp upon application, I'll still get some prickling/ tingling. For that reason I use this prior to any toners and always once my face is dry after cleansing.\n\nI haven't tried the OST vit c, so I wouldn't be able to tell you how it compares to that. The other LAA serums I have tried are Skinceuticals ce ferulic (greasy and smells like hot dogs) and Purito (extreme red flushing). I have sensitive atopic skin (which is under control right now thank god), combination normal skin with slightly oily t-zone.",

I was under the impression that the LAA version of Vitamin C should not be used in conjunction with/at the same time as Niacinamide. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I was under the impression that the two ingredients had a canceling-each-other out effect.\n\nAlso, I've used the original Tiam C and it was super strong and nothing like the Vitamin C serum that I'm using now (Skin Actives) in terms of how tingly it feels applied to the skin, so I feel like Tiam is doing something right. (?)\n\nLastly, glutathione itself/alone has been shown to have some anti-aging activity IN ADDITION to its known brightening/whitening qualities. It's supposed to be an extremely potent antioxidant (I supplement with it daily.) I've actually been looking for skincare products with glutathione in them but haven't found much other than a ridiculously expensive serum from Perricone and a couple things from Skin Actives, hence my interest in this product.",

    "body": "Hiya,\n\nI hope you enjoy the below reviews. I'm just a regular consumer buying everything with my own money - i.e., nothing sponsored, etc. Note, I've bought all of them on sale for around AUD$15-20 because I like sales haha. \n\nProducts:\n\n1. PKY - essence toner;\n2. PKY - mist toner;\n3. Secret Key - fresh nature toner - milk brightening one;\n4. Benton - Aloe BHA Toner;\n5. Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner; and\n6. Purito - Centella Green Level Calming Toner & the unscented version (Purito Unscented Centella Toner)\n\nMy skin used to be severely dry but is now slightly dry on the cheek areas and slightly oily on the t-zone during summer and slightly dry on the whole face in the winter.\n\nAlso note that the below two PKY products have different 'actives'/hero ingredients notwithstanding them seemingly being quite similar! I've bolded the plant extracts under the ingredient headers below.\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Essence Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495), Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. *Note, this one is generally recommended for people with drier skin whereas the mist version is generally recommended for those with oilier skin* Friends with eczema have also used this with success. *.* I can use both year round without breaking out. I've had friends with oilier skin who've used this one and have broken out. YMMV.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** LOVE THIS. May repurchase this for the rest of my life. I've used this after breaking my moisture barrier, after chemical peels, after active masks, and also *after getting my face ablatively lasered (after the the initial few days of only using an ointment)*. It's REALLY benign in a godly way. If you want it to do anything other than hydrate or increase the penetration of your other actives, this isn't the product for you (note, it doesn't claim to do anything else apart from hydrate & calm really).\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a little bit thicker than water but not as thick as the Purito centella toners. Won't run off your hand/face like water will but will eventually run off.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** None at allll, even when I broke my moisture barrier.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? Yes**/I have rebought this 4 or so times so far.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Mist Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance. This is in a spray bottle and is better suited to oily skinned persons.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1060395517?cpid=1060395516&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhYvl2sqQ7gIVUq6WCh0tbwX0EAQYAiABEgJb9vD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1060395517%3Fcpid%3D1060395516%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=876677637398885328), and Australian websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/pyunkang-mist-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. This one is more for people with slightly oilier skin too. It's a lighter formula than the essence one.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Decent hydration, I prefer to use this in the toner stage instead of after my skincare but I have enjoyed using it as a 'refreshing' spray during the day.\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a nice mist, doesn't run on the face. Feels like a spray of water?\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a spray bit on top. I've had no issues with it but one mate had a couple that didn't spray properly.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** Unsure. I've rebought it once but haven't gone to use this one as much as I have the PKY essence toner or the Purito Unscented Centella Toner. I also don't like mists a whole bunch as they can go onto your clothes (if you're out) or jewellery if you're wearing any. But, I did go through a phase of keeping it in my handbag and using it when out and about for a bit of hydration.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Coptis Japonica Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Secret Key - Fresh nature Toner (Milk Brightening)**\n\n**What is it:** Hydrating toner that's meant to brighten your skin.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx.

Couldn't use it long enough to notice anything. \n\n**Smell:** A very strong scent that I could barely use it. I think I used it around 5-10 times before binning it - I couldn't even put up with the scent of this to use it on other parts of my body.\n\n**Feel:** really watery.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Fortunately (given the high fragrance), no reactions to this. If you had any irritation though, I'd expect some sort of reaction.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? No**, given I threw mine out.\n\n**Ingredients:** Not a comprehensive list given there's a generic list on yesstyle then a list below it for the main ones in the milk one but here -\n\n700ppm) \\[**sic**\\], 1, 2-Hexandiol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata Extract, Nonoxynol-12, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Tremella Fuciformis Extract, Allantoin, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Cucumber Extract, Propylene Glycol, Tomato Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Rice Extract, Lanoline, Tea Tree Leaf Water (9, Sciadopitys Verticillata Root Extract, Pumpkin Extract, Papaya Fruit Extract, Oleth-10, Viola Tricolor Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Ethanol, Glyceryl Stearate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Chamomilia Recutita Flower Extract, Morus Alba Bark Extract, Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Lemon Extract, Oleth-5, Sodium Hyaluronate, Potato Extract, Pomegranate Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Sap Extract, Bean Extract, Aloe Vera Leaf Water (9, Broccoli Extract, Glycerin, Green Tea Extract, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Hollyhock Root Extract, Witch Hazel Extract (9, Phenoxyethanol, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Mineral Oil, Ulmus Campestris Extract, Carrot Extract, Polysorbate 80, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rose Damascena Flower Water (9, Korean Raspberry Extract, Milk Protein Extract (9, White Willow Bark Extract, Psidium Guajava Fruit Extract, Witch Hazel Extract, 4-Terpineol, Algae Extract\n\nand then it says the main ones in the milk version are -\n\ngalactomyces ferment filtrate, pomegranate extract, physalis alkenkengi extract, milk protein concentrate, raspberry extract, pasque flower extract, potato extract, carrot extract, pumpkin extract, rice extract, usnea extract, broccoli extract\n\nso who really knows what's in it...\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Benton Aloe BHA Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating toner which is meant to gently exfoliate with 0.5% salicylic acid.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$23. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/benton-aloe-bha-skin-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1053033537), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** people with sensitive and dry skin as it's quite rich.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** on and off since mid 2020, still using it randomly to just use it up.\n\n**My thoughts:** Per Google (may not be accurate), it has a pH of 5.5 which is too high for there to be any noticeable exfoliation with 0.5% BHA present. I've not noticed any calming effects. It is definitely hydrating but given it's advertised as a BHA toner I'm quite disappointed at the lack of BHA efficacy here. I would much rather use the purito centella toner to hydrate and calm my skin as the centella has other benefits such as helping to stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent. \n\n**Feel:** Similar to the PKY essence toner.

AUD$25 for 180mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/etude-house-soon-jung-ph-5-5-relief-toner-180ml-180ml/info.html/pid.1058586258), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone. It adds light hydration with benign ingredients - akin to the PKY toners but very minimally more expensive. It'd be good if you have irritated and/or dry skin.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** I used it once/twice a day until I used it up. Bought it in December 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Pretty decent. I'd recommend this to the same group of people who'd use the PKY essence toner. Nothing ground breaking. I prefer the calming nature of the Purito Unscented Centella Toner or even the PKY essence toner if you want zero actives (if you consider centella an 'active').\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent. \n\n**Feel:** A watery toner. \n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** No but for no fault of the product. I just prefer using the Purito Unscented Centella one as it's just as benign, a bit cheaper, and has the benefits of centella.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, Propanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Madecassoside, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Polyglycerin-3, Disodium EDTA\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**Centella Green Level Calming Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804) **& the** [**Centella Unscented Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380)\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating and calming toner - may also stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$30 but I've always bought it on sale for approx. AUD$20-25 for 200mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380), [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml)\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone however this is best suited to those with any sort of irritation, acne, or redness. That is, if you have basically perfect skin you're probably not going to notice much of a difference but if you have irritation etc then you'll likely fall in love. Also good if you're wanting to help stimulate collagen production especially for the low price point - target ages for this is probably mid twenties and up.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** religiously since April 2020, sometimes twice a day.\n\n**My thoughts:** *BLOODY EXCELLENT*. I'm on my second bottle of this. My first bottle was the first listed one (scented) and then they released the unscented one so I bought that! It's incredible. I love it. In my opinion, it's partially why my skin is able to tolerate me using actives so much. It's excellent to use before actives as it doesn't interact with anything and really good to use after an 'active' mask or a clay mask etc. I switched to the unscented one to just reduce the risk of irritation. \n\n*also studies, which I haven't read but have seen derms I trust on insta etc, say that* ***centella can help stimulate/produce collagen... a big yes from me given it's a calming ingredient that shouldn't purge you or break you out*** *(unless you're allergic/sensitive to it)!*\n\n**Smell:** The scented one smells herbaceous (akin to Asian herbal medicine - I don't mind it but others may). The unscented one doesn't really smell like anything / I don't notice any scent. \n\n**Feel:** thick/fat/heavy water. Not a watery toner. Enjoyable.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Neverrrrrr, this helps me reduce the side effects from using actives such as retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, etc.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **Yes** & I have. Will probably rebuy for life.\n\n**Ingredients:** 4 variants as they've got the scented and unscented versions, and then those with and without witch hazel\n\nnon-witch hazel unscented version -\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract (strengthens skin barrier), Butylene Glycol (humectants), Pentylene Glycol (skin-conditioning agents), Dipropylene Glycol (humectants), 1,2-Hexanediol (stabilizers), Trehalose (humectants), Sodium Hyaluronate (natural moisturizing factor/ humectants), Hamemelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiaticoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiatic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Madecassic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Panthenol (strengthens skin barrier), Carbomer (viscosity increasing agents), Allantoin (skin protectants), Arginine (skin-conditioning agents), Portulaca Oleracea Extract (skin-conditioning agents), Ethylhexylglycerin (skin-conditioning agents), Disodium EDTA (stabilizers)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope these reviews were useful & feel free to ask any questions / start any discussions :)",

They have spread from there to the sides of my face and chin, and since then have randomly disappeared from my forehead but have remained everywhere else. I have tried switching my shampoo, laundry detergent, toothpaste, and using a clean towel over my pillow every night. I have changed my entire routine slowly and completely multiple times. I have not found a permanent routine yet because I keep thinking it's a product causing the cc's.

I have large pores and used to have oily skin, although recently it has been a little flaky.  I have tried using H&S shampoo and noble zinc soap, thinking they may be fungal, but without any help. I have also used Paula's Choice AHA gel and BHA liquid, but they did not seem to affect them very much. In fact, the AHA created more cc's and the BHA caused me to break out in cysts. \n\nIs there any way cc's without any inflamed acne could be hormonal? I am not on BC. Or any other ideas? ",

It is the case sometimes but there are many cases where they're caused by the pore being clogged by sebum and dead skin cells, either because of an overproduction of sebum and/or your skin being bad at shedding skin cells effectively/'sticky' skin cells. for me, my closed comedones are hormonal (diagnosed hormonal by several derms bc of timing and placement), hormones classically causing an overproduction of sebum and those 'sticky' skin cells i mentioned. If chemical exfoliation didn't work for you you should consult a derm. Retinoids are usually prescribed for ppl with closed comedones. Retin-a reduced mine a lot but I still get them.

Considering the size, amount you need (it’s not super spreadable without using a generous amount) and the fact that because of sunscreen you kinda have to use it every day, I really would have loved to see more options.

    "body": "**Liquid Gold Review, or: How I learned overexfoliation is a bad thing**\n\n**TL;DR:** If your moisture barrier is damaged, this stuff will seriously change your life. Support an up-and-coming indie shop and repair your moisture barrier, all without breaking your wallet.\n\n**Background:** I recently upped my skincare game considerably through the infinite wisdom and patience of r/SkincareAddiction and r/AsianBeauty. I’ve always been both a science nerd (currently working myself through a Masters program to be a physician assistant) and a product junkie, and those two things have gloriously collided over the last few months to the benefit of my skin! The AB side bar has an excellent list of blogs, one of which I fell way down deep into is The Acid Queen. Alli, who runs the blog, is a seriously impressive DIY’er, which allowed me to get involved in her guinea pig pool for testing product formulations she was currently tinkering with. I’ve spent the last five weeks testing her moisture barrier repair moisturizer, Liquid Gold, and here are my thoughts! The formatting of these sections is shamelessly ripped from bloggers whose reviewing formats I admire: Fiddy Snails, Skin & Tonics, Fan-B, Snow, and of course, Her Majesty The Acid Queen Herself ;)\n\n**What it’s supposed to do:** Liquid Gold is a moisture barrier repair moisturizer/emulsion. (For more info on what a moisture barrier is, see Skin & Tonics excellent moisture barrier post linked in the sources.) Liquid Gold takes your thinned out, red, overexfoliated, stinging, weakened skin and makes it supple, bouncy, strong, and able to tolerate some serious heavy-lifting from acids and actives. It accomplishes all this with the magic of CERAMIDES *oooh ahhhh*\n\n**How to use it:** We’ve got two recommended options here. The first is a thin layer all over your face as the first occlusive step of…well, however many of those you have. The second is a thicker layer as a deeper moisturizing sleeping pack of sorts. I’ve been going with option 1, twice a day every day, AM and PM. Its consistency is slightly thicker than a serum, but not as thick as a gel cream or oily despite the ingredients list (more on that in a moment). It’s BRIGHT yellow-orange from the sea buckthorn, but spreads pretty easily and only leaves the tiiiiniest yellow cast after I’ve spread it in. However, my paleness makes Casper the ghost look like a tanning bed addict, so I imagine on most other skin tones it wouldn’t be visible at all. One of the things I love about this product is how quickly it dries down. I’m (gleefully) looking down the barrel at 15+ steps in my PM routine, so anywhere I don’t have to wait for dry time, I’m a happy camper. I don’t wear makeup often, but I’ve brought it out a number of days to see how Liquid Gold plays under makeup. I’m pleased to say it holds up just fine, without makeup settling into fine lines, caking, or otherwise disintegrating throughout the day.\n\n[**Here's some photos of it in action!**](http://imgur.com/a/knjp4)\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (Aqua), Propylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Polyglyceryl-3 Methyglucose Distearate, Rosa Mosqueta (Rose) Hip Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Seed Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Fruit Oil, Panthenol, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Squalane (olive-derived), Cetyl Alcohol, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA.\n\n**Notable Ingredients:** Oh, man…all of them?! This ingredients list is STRAIGHT FIRE if we are talking moisture barrier repair. Let’s break that down, shall we? I’m going to limit my highlights because otherwise I will literally never finish this review.\n\n**Ceramide Complex** (Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP; Phytosphingosine; Cholesterol): The Beauty Brains, another fabulous “science of skincare” blog, has a great discussion of ceramides (see sources for link) and describes them so: “Ceramides form a kind of water-proofing barrier in the upper layers of skin. They’re not only critical for helping skin retain water but they also help repair the skin’s natural barrier and regulate cells. Ceramide production dwindles with age which can result in dry skin, wrinkles and even some types of dermatitis.” The other important thing to know about ceramides is that they are team players. Ceramides without fatty acids and cholesterol won’t get you very far. Specifically, ceramides penetrate best with a mixture of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% fatty acids. So maybe you’ll find a product with ceramide floating around in the ingredient list, but good luck finding one with all three players…and if you do, cross your fingers they’re in the optimal ratio. Except that’s exactly what we have in Liquid Gold. Hell yes.\n\n**Niacinamide:** Why hello, my old friend! I’ll let the Queen herself explain the wonders for niacinamide: “One of the most studied skincare ingredients, niacinamide does everything: smooths fine lines and wrinkles, increases ceramide and fatty acid synthesis, regulates skin cell turnover, fades hyperpigmentation, evens skin tone, and has powerful anti-inflammatory properties.” Naturally then, it seems like niaciamide is in errything these days, but who knows how much is in there? Niacinamide is most effective at 3-5%, so unless the percentage is disclosed, we’re left stacking niacinmide products to reach that threshhold. Liquid Gold has 4%, which happens to be the same amount you’d get if this ingredient was included in a Curology prescription. Jackpot.\n\n**Sea Buckthorn:** Again, from The Beauty Brains: “[Sea buckthorn is] known for being rich in a number of bioactive compounds, including the following: vitamins A, B1, B2, C, D, K, and P; omega 3, 6, 7, and 9; 43 lipids, organic acids, amino acids, folic acids, tocopherols, flavonoids, phenols, terpenes, tannins, [and] 20 mineral elements.” Okay…but what does all that do for your skin? Well, we’ve got some studies that show all that goodness adds up to improved wound healing, protection from UV damage, and increased collagen production (see sources for link).\n\n**Rose Hip Oil:** High in oleic and linoleic acids, both of which are polyunsaturated fatty acids important for the integrity and regeneration of skin cell membranes. More moisture barrier magic going on here, my friends.\n\n**Okay, but seriously…**everything in this ingredients list is AMAZING. And rightly so, that’s the whole idea behind DIY in the first place: if you make it yourself, you know everything is there for a reason without any fluff or fillers.\n\n**How it worked:** And here’s where the other part of the title of this post comes into play. I have a long and glorious history of overexfolating my skin because…well, basically because that’s what I thought I was supposed to do. Physical exfoliants, all sorts of acids, inappropriately high strength retinoids…I would throw them all at my face at once every single day until literally my whole top layer of skin peeled off in sheets in the shower and I was shiny and red as a cherry. Even normally gentle products would sting like the devil, and I never questioned it because I honestly thought that’s how it was supposed to work. I’d fry the life out of my skin until I couldn’t handle it (so like 3-4 straight days of all this), then take a break for a week, maybe less, and then I’d start all over again. It was a roller coaster, let me tell you, and I did this for years. \n\nThen I found this post on FutureDerm that totally blew my mind about setting a schedule for building tolerance to retinoids (see sources for link). So I mapped out my schedule for all 24 weeks and promised myself I would be patient. I went without actives for over a month, then took another crack at one night with lower strength Tazorac, my drug of choice. Disappointingly, I still peeled like a snake for the next three days, despite babying my skin before and after the Tazorac. The next week, the same thing. I was beginning to doubt the wisdom of the retinoid tolerance schedule.\n\nEnter Liquid Gold.\n\nI got on Alli’s testing list and got a bottle in the mail soon after. I am not exaggerating when I say this is literally the most amazing shit I have ever put on my face in my life. Redness starting receding within days. A night with retinoids was no longer followed with peeling, pain, redness, or stinging — all of my hallmarks of a compromised moisture barrier. I tentatively and slowly moved through increasing the frequency of the retinoid. Once, twice, three times, four times a week, two interminable week periods per increase. So far, so good. I can feel fairly confident that Liquid Gold is the responsible party here since the rest of my non-actives routine stayed stable while I was tinkering with how to reintroduce them after my hiatus. Gradually, I added all my actives back in so that now, here’s what I’ve got going on my face: 1) Tazorac 0.05% gel 4x/week; 2) Curology 0.009% tretinoin, 9% azelaic acid, 1% clindamycin every night; 3) Paula’s Choice Resist 2% BHA morning and night; 4) Timeless 20% Vitamin C+E Ferulic Acid serum (AM only).\n\nEvery time I wash my face, I think today will be the day I finally overdo it and start feeling my barrier damaged again. BUT NO. My skin feels strong, bouncy, resilient, and looks glowing. My husband pokes me in the face, nods knowingly, and declares, “Chok chok.” He’s right. Now, I’ve been throw actives at my face like there’s no tomorrow and my face takes it like a champ. Eventually, I’m hoping to add in an AHA and up my Tazorac to 0.1%, but my schedule says I’m not allowed to do that for another few months. I’m glowing like the goddamn North Star thanks to all those actives, and I can keep coming back for more thanks to the almost surreal talents of Liquid Gold.\n\nI started to panic a bit the closer I got to the end of my bottle since this was a DIY formula since I absolutely had neither time time nor inclination to whip up a batch myself and didn’t know what I would do when I ran out. The day before I was about to email Alli and beg her to keep making me some forever in exchange for my first born child, SHE OPENED HER OWN SHOP ONLINE!!! This is the best news my skin has ever had. I immediately purchased a 60 mL glass pump bottle of Liquid Gold for $24 from Stratia, The Acid Queen’s shop website. After having such a fabulous experience with this, you better believe I threw Rewind, her DMAE serum, into my cart with a quickness. \n\n**Conclusion:** This shit is my life now. It let’s me go active-crazy without unduly compromising my moisture barrier and makes my skin feel stronger than it has in my entire life. It’s affordable, pleasant to use day and/or night, well-formulated, conscientiously packaged, and made in-house by a fellow skincare junkie on the other side of the country. I couldn’t be happier to love this product and have the opportunity to support her shop.\n\n[Stratia Skin, Liquid Gold, $24](https://www.stratiaskin.com/collections/skincare/products/liquid-gold)\n\n*Disclosure: I was asked to write a review of this product that was originally intended only for Alli to read for formulation feedback and my experience with the product. I only decided to write it for public consumption when I realized she was opening the shop and other people could get this product. I did not accept the product with an agreement to review it positively, nor have I received any monetary compensation for doing so. All opinions expressed above are my own.*\t\n\n**Sources**\n[The Beauty Brains: Is sea buckthorn oil good for skin?](http://thebeautybrains.com/2014/07/is-sea-buckthorn-oil-good-for-skin/)\n[The Beauty Brains: Is rose hip oil good for anti-aging?](http://thebeautybrains.com/2015/01/is-rose-hip-oil-good-for-anti-aging/)\n[The Beauty Brains: Are ceramides good anti-aging ingredients?](http://thebeautybrains.com/2015/04/are-ceramides-good-anti-aging-ingredients-episode-77/)\n[Stratia Skin: Liquid Gold](https://stratiaskin.com/products/liquid-gold)\n[Skin & Tonics: The Importance of Fatty Acids, pH & the Moisture Barrier: How I Eliminated my Acne & Decreased my Skin Sensitivity](http://skinandtonics.com/the-importance-of-fatty-acids-ph-moisture-barrier-how-i-eliminated-my-acne-decreased-my-skin-sensitivity/)\n[The Acid Queen: Fun with DIY: Beginners Recipe Shopping List](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/02/16/fun-with-diy-beginners-recipe-shopping-list/)\n[The Acid Queen: Fun with DIY: Moisture Barrier Serum](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2015/11/03/fun-with-diy-moisture-barrier-serum/)\n[FutureDerm: 11 Things You Never Knew about Retinol and Retinoids Until Now](https://www.futurederm.com/11-things-you-never-knew-about-retinol-and-retinoids-until-now/)",

I didn’t have any issue using it with actives. But I am guessing all ferments are different, really. I wish there were more study on the types of ferments and which type is best/worst for who.

    "body": "I have tried these products from the brand, and after enough time has passed, I think it's time to share my thoughts.\n\n**About my skin:**  \nHighly reactive, Dry and sensitive, prone to eczema and acne and fungal acne.\n\n  \n**Products I've tried:**\n\n1. Hydrashield vitamin C & Peptide watery gel suncreen PA++++\n2. Barrier Relief Lightweight Ceramide Moisturizer with Niacinamide\n3. Hydraveil Hyaluronic Hydrating Gel moisturizer with Ectoin & Ceramide\n4. Sun Relief Ceramide Silk Hydrating Sunscreen SPF 50 / PA ++++\n5. Beyond Hydration Glycerin Intense Hydrating Serum with Ceramide\n\n  \n**Review:**\n\n**1. Hydrashield vitamin C & Peptide watery gel suncreen PA++++**\n\n>Ingredients: Water, propanediol, butylene glycol, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, octocrylene, ascorbyl glucoside, butyl methoxydibenzoy|methane, diethylaminoHydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate, titanium dioxide, centella asiatica Extract, ascorbic acid, sodium hyaluronate, panthenol, polygonum Cuspidatum root extract, ammonium acryloyldimethyl taurate/VP copolymer, dicaprylyl carbonate, scutellaria baicalensis root extract, glycyrrhiza glabra (Licorice) root extract, gold, disodium edta, pentapeptide 4, camellia sinensis leaf extract, glutathione, chamomilla recutita (Matricaria)flower extract, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin, sorbitol, rosmarinus officinalis (Rosemary) leaf extract. \n\nPackaging:   \nAs seen in the picture, really compact and travel-friendly, and has a nozzle-like end, which I love.\n\nTexture:   \nAs it claims, but less watery and more gel-like. Blends quickly and absorbs easily.\n\nFA safe:  \nYES!\n\nEye stinging:  \nNo\n\nThoughts:  \nThis sunscreen uses decent sun filters and provides good protection. Haven't experienced any tanning since I started using it, but my sun exposure isn't much to begin with. I really love how easy it is to apply this sunscreen and how quickly it absorbs.  \nBUT it can irritate your skin because of the sun filters used. I have noticed that this sunscreen stings a little when applied near the area where my skin tends to get irritated quickly, like my chin and around my mouth. But the irritation subsides in 2-3 minutes, and after that, I haven't experienced any irritation.  \nOther than the irritation, there isn't anything about this sunscreen I dislike, and in terms of the finish and comfort, this has to be one of the best sunscreens that I have tried\n\nRating:  \n4/5 (if you have really irritated skin, this isn't the right fit for you)\n\n  \n**2. Barrier Relief Lightweight Ceramide Moisturizer with Niacinamide**\n\n>Ingredients: Water, caprylic/ capric triglyceride, glycerin, niacinamide, propanediol, cetearyl alcohol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, sodium hyaluronate, colloidal oatmeal, panthenol, allantoin, ceramide np, ceramide ap, ceramide eop, phytosphingosine, cholesterol, linoleic acid, sodium lauroyl lactylate, xanthan gum, butylene glycol, carbomer, tocopherol, phenoxyethanol, dimethicone, disodium edta, linolenic acid, ethylhexylglycerin\n\nPackaging:   \nFormularx's typical packaging hasn't experienced any breakage with it yet, but I wouldn't say it's travel-friendly.\n\nTexture:   \nLightweight, somewhere between a cream and a gel\n\nFA safe:  \nNo, nope, not at all (contains cetearyl alcohol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate as its 6th, 7th, 8th ingredient respectively, and also linoleic acid. All these ingredients can trigger FA)\n\nThoughts:  \nI dislike this moisturiser so much that I don't even want to write this part, but well. It triggered my FA like crazy, and when I got this moisturiser, I wasn't aware that I had fungal acne, so you can imagine what I went through when I woke up with a bunch of spots on my face every. single. day.  \nSomehow realised it's this moisturizer maybe, so stopped using it every day, and started wearing it under my make-up (basically once every 2 weeks) and it STILL gave me FA even though I never wore it for more than 4 hours.  \nBut I have to admit, the glow and hydration this one gave me was unmatched. I didn't experience any dryness with it, and this didn't feel \"heavy\". I am not sure if this one gave me acne or not, since my skin was at its worst when I used it.  \nCurrently using it as hand cream haha.\n\nRating: 2/5 (because of hydration and feel. If you don't have FA or really oily or acne prone skin, you can try it out, otherwise avoid imo)\n\n  \n**3. Hydraveil Hyaluronic Hydrating Gel moisturizer with Ectoin & Ceramide**\n\n>Ingredients: Water, glycerin, propanediol, panthenol, sodium hyaluronate, ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate/VPcopolymer, ceramide np, ectoin, sodium hyaluronate crosspolymer, sodium acetylated hyaluronate , xylityglucoside, hydrolyzed sodium hyaluronate , anhydroxylitol, pentylene glycol, xylitol, dicaprylyl ether, disdium edta, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin\n\nPackaging:   \nthis one feels sturdier than the barrier relief moisturiser's packaging, but the latter was bought in 2024, so I can only assume they improved their packaging. Love the colour.\n\nTexture:   \nLightweight and gel-like. Non-greasy and fast absorbing.\n\nFA safe:  \nYES!\n\nThoughts:  \nOkay, there's nothing in the ingredients list that I find concerning, and this moisturiser is very simple and straight to the point. I haven't tried the original malazia hydraveil (the yellow tube) but damn this moisturiser is my favourite and I love it with all my heart.  \nProvides enough hydration to keep my dry patches under bay, and at the same time does not trigger my FA. During winter, I was prescribed topical immunosuppressants because my eczema was getting so bad, and the medication somehow triggered my FA, so my skin was a battleground tbh. I ordered this recently and it's been working out well for me. In the morning, I use it as it is, but at night I mix or layer it with minimalist squalene oil.   \nOh, and it also leaves a nice glow after application! The only thing is that you have to wait a couple of minutes before and after applying it to make sure it gets absorbed properly.\n\nRating:  \n4.5/5 \n\n**4. Sun Relief Ceramide Silk Hydrating Sunscreen SPF 50 / PA ++++**\n\n>Ingredients: Water, glycerin, dicaprylyl carbonate, propanediol, butylene glycol, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate, titanium dioxide, ethylhexyl triazone, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine, niacinamide, glyceryl stearate, cetearyl alcohol, ceramide np, ceramide ap, ceramide eop, phytosphingosine, cholesterol, nonapeptide-1, linoleic acid, alpha bisabolol, sodium hyaluronate, panthenol, allantoin, sodium lauroyl lactylate, xanthan gum, tocopheryl acetate, carbomer, phenoxyethanol, tocopherol, disodium edta, linolenic acid, ethylhexylglycerin, iron oxides (Cl 77499 & Cl 77491 & CI 77492)\n\nPackaging:   \nMinimalistic look, and as you can see in the picture, it's more like a plastic tube (?) but less compact than the hydrashield sunscreen.\n\nTexture:   \nCreamy but also watery and gel-like. Feels heavy and oily :( Also tinted.\n\nFA safe:  \nNOOOPE (contains clyceryl stearate, cetearyl alcohol and linolenic acid)\n\nEye stinging:  \nA little.\n\nThoughts:  \nAgain, don't want to share but here we go!   \nthere is one primary concern I have with this sunscreen is that there's no sun filter in the top 5 ingredients, which makes me question the protection it provides, as most of the popular and effective sunscreens in the market have atleast 1 sun filter in the top 5 ingredients. Makes me wonder whether the brand compromised on the protection in order to give this sunscreen a moisturizing effect. But the filters present are good and non-irritating.   \nGave me FA, and it didn't have a glowy finish but rather a heavy, oily finish, which I didn't enjoy. Like at all. This sunscreen gives almost no coverage despite being tinted, and I don't think the 'tint' really shows up.  \nI guess this could be a good indoor sunscreen for someone who isn't oily or has fungal acne, but I would suggest my FA gang to stay away from this one.\n\n  \nrating:  \n2/5\n\n  \n**5. Beyond Hydration Glycerin Intense Hydrating Serum with Ceramide**\n\n>**Ingredients:** Water, glycerin, dicaprylyl carbonate, squalane, naicinamide, propanediol, sodium polyglutamate, ceramide np, madecassoside (centella asiatica extract), bisabolol, tocopherol acetate, allantoin, phenoxyethanol, glyceryl stearate, disodium edta, xanthan gum, polyacrylate crosspolymer 6, ethylhexylglycerin\n\nPackaging:   \nAgain, this has the typical formulaRX's aluminium-like packaging, the it has a paper- like coating which feels weird to me.\n\nTexture:   \nGel-like and watery. Leaves an oily residue.\n\nFA safe:  \nYes, contains glyceryl stearate, which is in the bottom 5 ingredients of the ingredient list.\n\nThoughts:  \nIs this hydrating? Yes. But the thing is, my skin doesn't like its 'feel'. Like right after application, it kinda feels warm and icky if that makes sense. Oh, and on top of that, I leave a weird, oily and slime-y residue. It's not overwhelming, but it's there.  \nAnd because of the texture, I am unable to form a perspective on this product because it is definitely doing its job (although I don't think it has a calming effect), but the texture and the feel is off-putting. As for FA, it may or may not trigger it. In my case, it wasn't as bad as what I had experienced with their barrier relief cream, but it may still trigger some reaction.\n\nRating:  \n3/5\n\n**Now, if I had to rank the 5 products:**\n\n1. Hydraveil Hyaluronic Hydrating Gel moisturizer with Ectoin & Ceramide\n\n2. Hydrashield vitamin C & Peptide watery gel suncreen PA++++\n\n3. Beyond Hydration Glycerin Intense Hydrating Serum with Ceramide\n\n4. Sun Relief Ceramide Silk Hydrating Sunscreen SPF 50 / PA ++++\n\n5. Barrier Relief Lightweight Ceramide Moisturizer with Niacinamide\n\n  \nPurchased everything from their website. Also the ingredients list is straight from the website.",

Feels heavy and oily :( Also tinted.\n\nFA safe:  \nNOOOPE (contains clyceryl stearate, cetearyl alcohol and linolenic acid)\n\nEye stinging:  \nA little.\n\nThoughts:  \nAgain, don't want to share but here we go!   \nthere is one primary concern I have with this sunscreen is that there's no sun filter in the top 5 ingredients, which makes me question the protection it provides, as most of the popular and effective sunscreens in the market have atleast 1 sun filter in the top 5 ingredients. Makes me wonder whether the brand compromised on the protection in order to give this sunscreen a moisturizing effect. But the filters present are good and non-irritating.   \nGave me FA, and it didn't have a glowy finish but rather a heavy, oily finish, which I didn't enjoy. Like at all. This sunscreen gives almost no coverage despite being tinted, and I don't think the 'tint' really shows up.  \nI guess this could be a good indoor sunscreen for someone who isn't oily or has fungal acne, but I would suggest my FA gang to stay away from this one.\n\n  \nrating:  \n2/5\n\n  \n**5. Beyond Hydration Glycerin Intense Hydrating Serum with Ceramide**\n\n>**Ingredients:** Water, glycerin, dicaprylyl carbonate, squalane, naicinamide, propanediol, sodium polyglutamate, ceramide np, madecassoside (centella asiatica extract), bisabolol, tocopherol acetate, allantoin, phenoxyethanol, glyceryl stearate, disodium edta, xanthan gum, polyacrylate crosspolymer 6, ethylhexylglycerin\n\nPackaging:   \nAgain, this has the typical formulaRX's aluminium-like packaging, the it has a paper- like coating which feels weird to me.\n\nTexture:   \nGel-like and watery. Leaves an oily residue.\n\nFA safe:  \nYes, contains glyceryl stearate, which is in the bottom 5 ingredients of the ingredient list.\n\nThoughts:  \nIs this hydrating? Yes. But the thing is, my skin doesn't like its 'feel'. Like right after application, it kinda feels warm and icky if that makes sense. Oh, and on top of that, I leave a weird, oily and slime-y residue. It's not overwhelming, but it's there.  \nAnd because of the texture, I am unable to form a perspective on this product because it is definitely doing its job (although I don't think it has a calming effect), but the texture and the feel is off-putting. As for FA, it may or may not trigger it. In my case, it wasn't as bad as what I had experienced with their barrier relief cream, but it may still trigger some reaction.\n\nRating:  \n3/5\n\n**Now, if I had to rank the 5 products:**\n\n1. Hydraveil Hyaluronic Hydrating Gel moisturizer with Ectoin & Ceramide\n\n2. Hydrashield vitamin C & Peptide watery gel suncreen PA++++\n\n3. Beyond Hydration Glycerin Intense Hydrating Serum with Ceramide\n\n4. Sun Relief Ceramide Silk Hydrating Sunscreen SPF 50 / PA ++++\n\n5. Barrier Relief Lightweight Ceramide Moisturizer with Niacinamide\n\n  \nPurchased everything from their website. Also, the ingredients list is straight from the website.",

    "body": "I must admit, I bought this without giving it a lot of thought, as this was before I really began to do a lot of skincare and Asian beauty research.  But boy am I glad I did!  It’s also the first time I’ve ever used a cleansing balm and aside from pictures and descriptions, I didn’t really know what to expect!  So let's get to it!!\n\n---\n##**Packaging:**\n\n\nI really wish I took a picture of this thing before I started using it because it was so pretty!  Here’s what it looks like now after about a month of use:  http://imgur.com/defsUXI and  http://imgur.com/dTm3jSt\n\n\nEven though it comes in tub form, it provides a little spatula to keep it sanitized.  As you can see, I like to spatula only one side so I can still have a section that is un-touched and extremely smooth looking!! \n\n---\n##**Application:**\n\n\nI use this as the first cleanser in my double-cleanse routine at night, and the MRCS as my second.  The directions say to massage this product onto your face and then tissue it off.  I actually didn’t know these were the directions when I started using it so I always just washed it off instead of tissue-ing it off and it’s worked for me.  I only found out about the actual instructions later after reading skinandtonic’s review of the original lol.  I imagine tissue-ing it off would help with make-up removal immensely, but I haven’t tried (or needed to).\n\n---\n##**Smell:**\n\n\nThis cleanser doesn’t have any added fragrance (yay for you peeps with this sensitivity!), but it does have a faint, fresh floral scent.  I personally like it a lot!\n\n---\n##**Performance/Results:**\n\n\nOverall, this is one of my top cleansers; the Su:m37 MRCS is #1, and this is #2.  Compared to my old Shiseido White Lucent Cleansing Foam (which had a pH of 9.5, yikes!!), this cleansing balm is AMAZING.  It makes my face feel extremely soft and smooth after cleansing and I don’t get that dry, squeaky, tight feeling that I used to get with the Shiseido cleanser.  I think it might actually be slightly more moisturizing than the MRCS!  I have really dry skin in general, so this was a huge plus.  It also doesn’t leave behind any greasy residue like some cleansing oils or OCM can.  Finally, if you get it in your eyes, it doesn’t sting but it does blur your vision for a few minutes (I imagine this is because of the oil residue?).  It’s not really a problem for me, since I can wash it off after a few tries or I just use my MCRS right afterwards and it takes care of that issue.\n\n\nAs a make-up remover, I’d say it’s pretty good.  You may need a dedicated make-up remover for those really hard to remove make up though (I’m looking at you Kiss Me Mascara).\n\n---\n##**Ingredients:**\n\n\nThis is kind of the main reason I LOVE this cleanser so much!  It has a pretty damn rockstar ingredients list.  The full list can be found here: http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_4575161484.html \n\n\nI’ve included an analysis of some of the ingredients below.  It’s a massive wall of text, but the TL;DR is that they’re all pretty great. \n\n\n- *Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride:* This is the triglyceride fraction from coconut and is not the entire coconut oil, so it should be less comedogenic than straight-up coconut oil.  Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride has also been shown to be a non-irritating and non-sensitizing solvent, is an acceptable vehicle for topical applications [1], and is just a great overall moisturizer.  Additionally, it’s anti-inflammatory properties may actually reduce the risk of breakouts.  Finally, it has some occlusive properties to help resist water loss!\n\n\n- *Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil (Argan oil):* I don’t really need to go into this much, everyone knows about the moisturizing benefits of argan oil! It’s also got some medicinal uses against rheumatism and the healing of burns apparently.\n\n\n- *Oenothera Biennis Oil (evening primrose oil):* Evening primrose oil is rich in fatty acids, including linoleic (LA), oleic, and y-linolenic acids (GLA), that help repair the skin and improve the skin’s barrier function.  These fatty acids also have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, acne reducing and moisture retention properties!  However, it appears that evening primrose oil’s stabilizing effect on the stratum corneum barrier works only with a water-in-oil emulsion formulation (which I believe Banila Co. Clean It Zero Purity is, phew!) [2]. It also looks like it has some anti-irritant properties as well [3], so I have no idea why cosdna gives it an irritant rating of 2.  I imagine the anti-inflammatory properties should also make it more likely to help prevent acne instead of causing it, and LA is also supposedly very beneficial for acne-prone skin.  So again, not sure why cosdna rates it as 2 on acne.  Those that are acne prone, please let me know if evening primrose oil breaks you out.\n\n\n- *Portulaca oleracea extract (a type of succulent):* Seems to have wound healing properties [4], muscle relaxant properties [5], and analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. \n\n\n- *Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (Licorice root):* I think it’s pretty widely accepted that licorice root is an awesome active for skincare purposes.  It’s got anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and brightening properties!\n\n\n- *Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract (green tea):* Antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties!  Please note that most research seems to agree that green tea has potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties while applied topically; however, I’m not sure that the anti-carcinogenic properties are really that effective when used topically (compared to drinking it!).  There does seem to be some research that shows green tea extract can also prevent collagen breakdown and reduce UV damage to your skin [7 & 8].  \n\n\n- *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract:* Who doesn’t love aloe?\n\n\n- *Beta-Carotene:* good antioxidant/helps protect against sun damage [9 & 10], but this benefit is dose dependent!  Too much can actually generate oxidative damage (e.g. cell and tissue damage) [11].  I’m going to assume that because this is rather far down the ingredients list that it’s probably within the optimal amount to be beneficial.\n\n\nThe rest of the ingredients all look pretty solid, but I only had time to do a quick search on them. I don’t really see any “bad” ingredients.  Sources will be provided in comments since this post is already huge.\n\n\n---\n##**Overall Summary:**\n\n\n\nPros:\n\n- gentle and FAN-Freaking-TASTIC ingredients (unless you’re actually allergic to one or more of them…)\n\n- non-stripping\n\n- non-greasy\n\n- moisturizing \n\n- not messy \n\n\nCons:\n\n- a little pricey\n\n- I can’t figure out the pH of this thing because I don’t think pH strips work for this mostly oil based cleanser.  But that’s not really the fault of the cleanser…\n\n---\n**Would I recommend this product?**  Hellz-to-the-yeah!!\n\n\nThanks for reading, it's my first review post, hooray!\n\n\nEdit: argh how the hell do you format this thing?!\n",

It's truly a strange product in terms of how the texture is, but the result it provides is silky skin that feels weightless. I apply a 50 paise coin sized amount twice a day on my face immediately after washing and patting it dry (because my skin is the kind which feels very taut and stretched after cleansing), followed by my serums (and SPF in the morning).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**INGREDIENTS:**\n\n>Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polyglyceryl- 10 Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Caprylate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Tocopherol\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlthough I have dry skin, I feel very heavy and icky when I layer my sunscreen on top of my moisturiser in the day time, so this toner is great for providing the effects of moisturization without the weight—almost letting you skip the moisturiser step before SPF. I have been using it since a month now, and my skin is far less drier than it was before, because I made it a habit to apply it as soon as my face was cleansed.\n\nIt's super efficient for the price too, because little goes a long way and it will take you forever to empty it!",

    "body": "Day 4/7 this brand is underrated but their products work better than other brands I know of. So this brand is cruelty-free and vegan. It focuses more on sensitive skin, clean ingredients, hydration, and improving the skin Barrier in the long term. Any skin type can use the products and the main ingredient is the olive squalene and hyaluronic acid. They also use a blend of three different hyaluronic acid sizes (they have the smallest HA size for skincare in the world). If you've ever been to Sephora and saw that expensive and much-raved brand that uses squalene oil in everything, this is a cheaper alternative. The pH of everything is a 5.5. If you are looking for something for sensitive skin I'd think this is a good brand. \n\nDisclaimer: what worked for me might not work for you. I was gifted 3 of the products last year which got me interested in the entire line.\n\nEdit : some if the products have been reformulated so im not sure how it might impact the product. \n\nDual moist toning lotion 180ml:\n\nTo me, it's not worth it and there are definitely better hydrating toners worth your money. However, if every toner irritates you and you have dehydrated skin or just really sensitive skin you will like this. This is a good hypoallergenic hydrating basic toner. My friend has eczema and acne prone skin and loves this toner but now I got her wanting the pyunkang Yul's acne line. It's more viscous than water and dispensed well also comes sealed. \n\nIngredients - Water, Glycerin, Glycereth-26, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Arginine, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ceramide NP, Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Avena Sativa (Oat) Meal Extract, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Sodium Citrate, Disodium EDTA, Octyldodecanol, Dodecane, Isohexadecane, Isoeicosane, Octadecane, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Citric Acid, Tetradecane, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Linoleic Acid\n\n❤️Dual moist comfort cream 75ml:\n\nMy favourite daytime moisturiser works well in winter and summer it's perfect if your oil-water balance is out if wack. In the summer is adjust excessive sebum so I sweat less on my face but keeps me hydrated in the winter time. Feels like a gel, absorbs fairly quickly. It's a basic essential. Uses panthenol, madecassoside, and Allantoin to soothe, repair and strengthen skin. \n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-10, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, Dimethicone, Squalane (Olive Squalane), Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Arginine, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Ceramide NP, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Butylene Glycol, Carbomer, Dimethiconol, Octyldodecanol, Dodecane, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Isohexadecane, Isoeicosane, Sorbitan Isostearate, Polysorbate 60, Octadecane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, PEG-20 Glyceryl Stearate, Potassium Hydroxide, Tetradecane, Disodium EDTA, PEG-100 Stearate, Polyglutamic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Linoleic Acid\n\n❤️Dual moist hyaluronic Essence 100ml:\n\nclaims to rapidly hydrate even dry or sensitive skin without irritation. It does work. One if my favourite essences an alternative to the cosrx snail in terms of the hydrating effects your skin gets. If you are vegan and want the hydrating effects and healing effects of Centella Asiatica and vitamin E from tocopherol this could be great for you. My skin was soothed and cooled down, quickly. Absorbs fairly fast feels and hydrating on the skin. \n\nEdit: I repurchased this and didn't notice any actual change to the product still worked. I tried like putting drops of both on my face and I guess the new formula kept my skin more hydrated. But it still works the same but if you have an allergy to anything in the new formulation I'd pass. \n\nIngredients \n\nWater, Pentylene Glycol, Polyglycerin-3, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Collagen, Madecassoside, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, C14-22 Alcohols, Xanthan Gum, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Gaultheria Procumbens (Wintergreen) Leaf Extract, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate\n\nUpdated formula:\nWater, PentyleneGlycol, Squalane, Polyglycerin-3, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Gardenia TahitensisFlower, Tocopherol, CamelliaSinensisLeaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita(Matricaria) FlowerExtract, CentellaAsiatica Extract, AloeBarbadensis LeafExtract, LavandulaAngustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Glycerin,Cetearyl Olivate,Sorbitan Olivate, C14-22 Alcohols, Xanthan Gum, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside,PulsatillaKoreanaExtract, ZanthoxylumPiperitum Fruit Extract,UsneaBarbata(Lichen) Extract, Arginine, Gaultheria Procumbens(Wintergreen) Leaf Extract\n\nFluid oil 30ml:\n\nIf you have TO squalene oil I'll pass on this one they both have 100% organic squalene oil. This one is more cosmetically elegant but save $30 while you can if you are interested in squalene oil by itself. \n\nEmollient extra comfort cream 75ml\n\nContains panthenol too (D-panthenol contains vitamin B5) it feels sticky when applied. If your skin is dry or dehydrated or if you have combination skin but live in a dry climate you will enjoy this. It's a really heavy cream and I dislike the feeling since it takes a while to absorb but my skin doesn't feel hydrated. \n\nIngredients : \n\nWater, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Panthenol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glycerin, Squalane(Olive Squalane), Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Arginine, Ceramide NP, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Carbomer, Octyldodecanol, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Wax, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Dodecane, Isohexadecane, Isoeicosane, Octadecane, Tetradecane, Dimethicone, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Disodium EDTA, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Butylene Glycol, Glucose, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Linoleic Acid\n\nNew formulation - Water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Squalane, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate,Cetearyl Olivate, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Canola Oil, Xanthan Gum, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Gaultheria Procumbens (Wintergreen) Leaf Extract\n\nEmollient cleansing bar\n\nDoesn't contain any harsh sulfates or anything but I don't like cleansing bars in general. Good for body and face and it won't dry your skin out if you have oily - combo skin. Honestly, there are so many better cleansing gels/milks/foams that I think work better than this bar. It's cleansing properties are abysmal at best and it struggles to remove even the minimal makeup I wear occasionally. My friend hated this too and pointed out to me that looks like it can easily get bacteria on the product. \n\nIngredients:\n\nTriticum Vulgare Wheat Starch, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Potassium Lauryl Sulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Aqua, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Avocado Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Calophyllum Inophyllum, Olea Europaea, Squalidae, Sodium Hyaluronate, D-Panthenol, Tocopherol Acetate, Glycerin, Spinacia Olearacea Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Sapindus Trifoliatus, Apium Graveolens (Celery) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Spinacia Oleracea L., Chorella, Allantoin, Olive Butter\n\nI think they are. Trying to do something cool with their brand but because what they focus on are pretty basic stuff not all people may like it. I think the dual moist comfort cream is a great moisturiser for any skin type and the essence and toner are good items. However, by making products like the cleansing bar or their clay mask (which you can't purchase anywhere anymore)... By only using this brand in my routine my skin looked dull despite being hydrated. My friend who tried some of the products with me saw her skin Barrier become healthier over the next few months and her sensitivity to products decreased slightly. Anybody with a sensitive skin type or dehydrated - dry skin would enjoy trying some of the line. You can get the brand on stylekorean.com, yesstyle, roseroseshop, or ohholly\n\nHope this was helpful i feel like it was kind of a messy review 😅\n\nEdit: It remind me of the ordinary because of the reformulation changes and how they use olive squalene (squalene derived from olives) instead of shark squalene to make it cruelty free.

    "body": "**Personal Info:**\n\nI live in nothern europe, so currently cold, windy and dry Climate. My Skintype is sahara desert dry, prone to closed comedones plus some light hormonal acne. Sadly im also super prone to hyperpigmentation. My main Goals are barrier health, hydration, acne & Hyperpigmentation management and getting rid of the damn stubborn CC\\`s... I also follow a kinda skincycling routine wich includes a non AB Retinal product.\n\nIn **Bold** will be the product name + how long i have been using it\n\nin *italic* will be the ingredients i liked\n\n\n\n**Axis-Y Sunday morning cleanser: (using for a month now)** *green tea extract, centella extract, allatonin*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Coco-Betaine, Butylene Glycol, Potassium Cocoate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Benzoate, Polyquaternium-67, Xylitylglucoside, Citric Acid, Anhydroxylitol, Propanediol, Xylitol, Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Glucose, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Disodium EDTA, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Agrimonia Eupatoria Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Dipropylene Glycol, Allantoin, Perilla Frutescens Leaf Extract, Saponaria Officinalis Extract, Sodium Acetate, Pentylene Glycol, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Kigelia Africana Fruit Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Natto Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxycinnamic Acid, Rutin\n\nTexture:\n\na balmy texture, foams up to a dense and soft foam\n\nExpirience:\n\nI picked this up because I wanted to change from my old clenaser to something that felt like it had a bit more cleansing power, yet was not stripping. As far as i can tell it seems to accomplish that. It foams up nicely, cleans well and doesent seem to strip my Skin. After washing it off it feels almost as if there is a slight layer on my Skin, but i dont mind it/ think that it contributes to the non stripping?\n\n(4/5)\n\n**Cosrx Propolis Toner: (about a month 1/2 of use)** *propolis, honey extract, panthenol*\n\nIngredients:\n\nPropolis Extract, Honey Extract, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Cassia Obtusifolia Seed Extract, Panthenol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride\n\nTexture:\n\na waterlike texture, thats just a bit thicker\n\nExpirience:\n\nTo be honest im not overly impressed... its a nice hydrating toner for sure but i didnt notice anything outstanding that would have me choose it again. But it gets a pluspoint for being reasonably priced so i migth pick it up again to reach free shipping...\n\n(3/5)\n\n**Holika Holika Aloe Waterproof Sungel (3 Months of use)** *Aloe*\n\nIngredients:\n\nAqua, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Niacinamide, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Caprylyl Methicone, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hippophae Rhamnoides Fruit Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Extract, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Juice, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Pentylene Glycol, Behenyl Alcohol, Poly C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Decyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, T-butyl Alcohol, Tocopherol, Ascorbic Acid, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Ceramide Np, Phytosphingosine, Parfum\n\nTexture:\n\na thin cream Texture, not runny but almost there\n\nExpirience:\n\nIt comes in quite a big size for a Sunscreen, you can find 80 - 100 ml Tubes online for around 15-17 Euros! Wich honestly was the sole reason why i bougth it xD i figured my skin would be fine with the Ingredients and i just hate tiny sunscreens! And well... that was exactly what it is like, its decently moisturizing and doesnt irritate my Skin. But if you have sensitive Skin be careful, it does have Fragrance, smells kinda like very artificial Aloe. You can smell it but only upon first apllication, it doesnt linger. I have been using 1 bottle for 3 months and still have enough for another month at min. so a win!\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n**Purito Dermide Cica Barrier Sleeping Mask: (3 months of use)** *Squalane, Centella Extract, Jojoba oil, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Ceramide*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract(250,000Ppm), Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Squalane, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Butylene Glycol, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Panthenol, Ceramide NP(3,000Ppm), Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyacetophenone, Sodium Carbomer, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract\n\nTexture:\n\nA thick Cream, feels quite emmolient\n\nExpirience:\n\nI love, love, loe this! Its the first moisturizer that i found that feels like it actually does its job well on my Skin. As a nigthtime moisturizer it keeps my Skin hydrated all through the Night and has my wake up nicely glowy. I love to use this when my Skin is irritated, it really soothes it quickly. Always have this on my Shelf, you would have to pry it out of my dead cold hands, to seperate me from it. One Bottle last me about 2 months.\n\nHG!\n\n(5/5)\n\n**Mary & May Blackberry Cream Essence: (4 months of use)** *Jojoba oil, ceramides, lotus water, centella*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Nymphaea Caerulea Flower Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit Extract, 1,2-hexanediol, Methlypropanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Hydrolyzed Gardenia Florida Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Trilaureth-4 Phoshate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Pvm/Ma Copolymer, Cyanocobalamin, Ceramide Np, Maltodextrin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol\n\nTexture:\n\nthin, watery but creamy? (just realized i suck at describing textures haha)\n\nExpirience:\n\nA really nice hydrating and moisturizing Toner, feels like a great balance of the two. Acts nicely as a layer with other Skincare because it absorbs really well. I like it, a bottle lasts me about 2 months.\n\n(4/5)\n\n**Abib Quick Sunstick Protection Bar: ( 3 months of use)** *Aloe, Centella, Ceramides*\n\nIngredients:\n\nOctyldodecanol, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Dibutyl Ethylhexanoyl Glutamide, Dibutyl Lauroyl Glutamide, Diisostearyl Malate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dextrin Palmitate, Octocrylene, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Saccharide Isomerate, Maltodextrin, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethyl Hexanediol, Ceramide NP, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol\n\nTexture:\n\nA translucent stick, glides on smooth, feels a bit occlusive on skin\n\nExpirience:\n\nNicely moisturizing Sunstick, feels good on my Skin and well... does its Job xD I really like the curved shape of it, it relly helps with the application. I just use it for reapplication of my sunscreen, but also sometimes when my Skin gets really dry during the day ( tho its not the best for that)\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n**Numbuzin No.2 Protein 43% creamy Serum: ( 4 months of use)** *Oat protein, Ceramides, cholesterol, fatty acids, ferments, Rice protein*\n\nIngredients:\n\nAvena Sativa Protein Extract, Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Poly C6-14 Olefin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Erythritol, Limnanthes Alba Seed Oil, Sodium Chloride, Allantoin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Adenosine, Dextrin, Theobroma Cacao Extract, Pantolactone, Ceramide NP, Cholesterol, Palmitic Acid, Oryza Sativa Seed Protein Extract, Stearic Acid, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Lactobacillus Ferment, Glycine Soja Protein, Hydrolyzed Lupine Protein, Glucose, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Sweet Almond Protein, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Myristic Acid, Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Arachidic Acid, Lauric Acid, Sodium Succinate, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance\n\nTexture:\n\nVery thick serum, really is creamy like the name says\n\nExpirience:\n\nSooo repairing and soothing, does wonders for my barrier. It really helps keep my Skin moisturized and helps keep my transepidermal waterloss in check. Love it so much! HG!\n\n(5/5)\n\n**Purito Aha Bha Refreshing Solution: (1 month of use)** *Glycolic acid, Salcylic Acid*\n\nIngredients:\n\nSalix Alba (Willow) Bark Water, Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid (7%), Tromethamine, Water, Salicylic Acid(2%), 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Citrate, Arginine, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid(0.28%), Hydroxyacetophenone, Pentylene Glycol, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Disodium EDTA\n\nTexture:\n\nlike water, it put 2-3 drops on a thin cotton pad and swipe over my Face with it\n\nExpirience:\n\nSince it has only been a month i cannot say too much about how it has worked (and i feel its hard to tell what effects on my skin is retinal and whats from this product) but my comedones are reducing in size and developing into breakouts. But the effects of these ingredients are well studied in these concentrations so i would say its save to say it works. Its my first time using glycolic acid and i can say it packs a punch for sure! So be careful, its intense, so far im using it once a week on my exfoliation day and i dont think ill be moving up.... Might also be the fact that its a combo product, but i have been using salcylic acid and mandelic acid in combo before, and that felt less sensitizing. So im attributing that factor to the 7 percent glycolic acid, since it is the smallest molecule size of all Aha\\`s.\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow lets move to quick first impressions of a few products i just started trying, wich i have seperated from the review portion because i just havent been using them long enough to really speak about the effects on my Skin: (these will also be shorter impressions with less info)\n\n\n\n**Neo:labs liquid enhancer Pycogenol:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Propanediol, Hydrogenated Poly C6-14 Olefin, 1.2-Hexanediol, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Saccharum Officinarum Extract, Jojoba Esters, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Salvia Sclarea Oil, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa Root Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Theobroma Cacao Seed Extract, Melaleuca Altemifolia Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, C18-36 Acid Triglyceride, Coprylyl Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, C12-18 Acid Triglyceride, Squalene, Sodium Polyacrylate, Tromethamine, Albatreus Contuena Extract, Paimitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Phytasteryl Macadamiate, Citric Acid, Phytosterol, Dextrin, Tocopherol, Butylene Glycol, 4-Terpineol, Pentylene Glycol, Octonediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\nExpirience:\n\nBougth this because of the tea tree extract, oil and 4- terpineol for the antimicrobial and antiinflammatory benefits , plus it also promised balancing the water-oil contend of the skin. So far i have been using it for a week and it feels nicely moisturizing, but i cannot say if it has helped with my breakouts. Smells strongly like tea tree, wich i dont mind.\n\n**Isntree Spotsaver Mugwort Ampoule:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nArtemisia Princeps Extract, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Erythritol, Betaine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Piper Methysticum Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Panthenol, Propanediol, Beta-Glucan, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Allantoin, Carbomer, Tromethamine, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\nExpirience:\n\nThis i got because i heard amazing things about mugwort and it was on a 50 % Sale, so i got it for a steal! So far i like the simple ingredient list an it seems soothing and hydrating.\n\n**RNW Der.Ceramide Cream:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Ceramide NP, Panthenol, Caprylyl Methicone, Glycerin, C12-16 Alcohols, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Ceramide NS, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Ceramide AS, Ceramide AP, Oligopeptide-1, Ceramide EOP, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Betaine, Arginine, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Carbomer, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Arachidyl Glucoside, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Stearic Acid, Adenosine, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium EDTA\n\nExpirience:\n\nIm really intriged by this brand an was debating between this and the Ceramide serum, but got this Cream. At first i was intimitaded by the essential oils and the strong smell it has (herbal, but to my nose very pleasant) so i patchtested it on my cheek. The Patchtests went fine and i have been using it on my whole face for 4 days now and i must say im impressed.\n\nIf you have oily skin i feel you could hate it but for my dry skin... the texture is amazing. Its a THIIICK cream, like an ointment, very balmy. Upon apllication it feels nice to spread it and it sinks in so well for the thick texture. The cream surprisingly dries down velvety and leaving a protective shield over the Skin. I also love that it has 3 % Panthenol, 3% ceramides and cholesterol and fatty acids.... so perfect ingrdients for skin barrier repair! Really a potential HG...\n\n\n\n",

This product was gold to me. SO hydrating, soothing, anti-aging. Outperformed Deciem's modulating glucosides, as well as most other moisturizers and myriad centella products whenever my skin was irritated, overexfoliated, or otherwise in need of TLC.\n\nNOW check out the ingredients list:\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Glycerin, Glycereth-26, Squalane, Sorbitan Oleate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer,Colloidal Oatmeal, Mel (Honey, Miel), Saccharomyces/Honey Ferment Filtrate,Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate,Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid, Beta-Glucan, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Propolis Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum,Ethylhexylglycerin,Tetrasodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Benzoic Acid, Sorbic Acid\n\nIt's all phenoexyethanol and Ethylhexyl Salicylate. Why the heck would I want a sunscreen so high up in my essence/toner? According to new reviews it stinks.\n\nIt seems like a widespread strategy to create a great product, rack up great reviews, and then quietly change the formula to make it cheaper to produce and hope nobody notices. It's also happened to Sulwhasoo's Overnight Vitalizing Mask - there's essentially no ginseng in this product anymore (it's shunted wayyyy down in the ingredients list). Unfortunately I purchased it before realizing, at fiddysnail's recommendation.\n\nWhat products have betrayed you in this way?",

It's hydrating enough that most of the time I can skip a second serum, though I do need something extra in the winter.\n\nJust a head's up that while it's usually $$$, the brand's website has good sales a few times a year that are worth waiting for. The last time I scored three bottles of serum for \\~$10 each.\n\nEdit: Since someone else asked, I find I can get 2-3 months out of each bottle, depending on how much I use (I'm super dry right now, so I'm using more).

        "body": "It’s wild to me that the other commenter found this 10x heavier than the BoJ and Round Lab. I guess everyone has different experiences and for this sun cream, I’m the opposite. \n\nMy skin is dry right now as it’s winter down under. I find the BoJ and Round Lab are very similar in consistency. They’re a thicker viscous gel that forms this film over the skin, and it takes ages to dry down for me. It also leaves a blue and white cast on me especially if I reapply and/or don’t apply makeup over it. It is more moisturising and hydrating compared to the Skin1004 though. \n\nThe Skin1004 water fit sun serum spf is a lighter lotion/cream type that gives that burst of hydration without that thick film. Also there’s no blue/white cast and it sinks in very quickly (like a serum). I can apply makeup after a few minutes whereas the other two, I usually have to wait for much longer for it to dry. \n\nI do prefer the other two for winter since it’s more thicker and moisturising, but I’d definitely be using the Skin1004 for the rest of the year as I think it would be great for warmer weather/reapplication.",

        "body": "Beauty of joseon seems to be on the heavy side comparing to this? I mean, I understand that our experiences with products might be different, but the Skin1004 Water-Fit feels like 10 times heavier than the BoJ or Round Lab Birch. The Air-Fit version - which is a physical sunscreen - was actually really pleasantly lightweight, but this... Feels like a moisturizer for winter time, that takes ages to soak into the skin, but does not absorb fully and leaves a bit of stickiness. Which is interesting, because it really does have a serumy texture, so one would imagine its just gonna dissapear into the skin, but as for me, a layer is kind of just sitting on top. The BoJ one feels a lot lighter to me and also absorbs into my skin a whole lot faster. But this is just my experience. I imagine this must he nice for dry skin or in the winter for some. Btw there are quite a few sunscreens with the same base: Round Lab Birch Sun Cream, Romand Zero Clean Fresh, Benton Air-Fit UV defense (these are all the same Kolmar base formulas)",

For example:\n\n**Revox Just Vitamin C 20 % serum** \\- €3, 95 (30 ml)  \nAqua, Ascorbic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Propylene Glycol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Phenoxyethanol, PPG-1-PEG-9 Lauryl Glycol Ether, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA\n\n**Revox Just Hyaluronic Acid 5 % serum** \\- €3,95 (30 ml)  \nAqua, Sodium Hyaluronate, Propylene Glycol, Panthenol, Xanthan Gum, PPG-1-PEG-9 Lauryl Glycol Ether, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium Edtá\n\nThe extremely low price makes me kind of cautious, would love to hear your thoughts on these products.

I’ve noticed in particular an alarming (for me) amount of new products coming out with no niacinamide in the ingredient list. I remember some old products targeted towards brightening the skin containing arbutin, now nearly all the new ones contain some ridiculous plant extract instead (vitamin tree, some sort of citrus, white flowers...)",

One of the sunscreens that I was most excited for that did get along with my skin was the Purito Centella Green Level Unscented. It left my skin with a rash and ever since I have been reluctant to try other chemical sunscreens (even though I'm not really sure why my skin had an allergic reaction: I have used centella/niacinamide products before and never had experience such a thing). Nonetheless, I have decided to try mineral sunscreens and one of them was the Cotz Sensitive SPF 40. Although it left my skin \"greasy\" (I didn't really mind it since I have dry skin), it gave my skin a very tight and dry feeling :(.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThe ATO Mild Sun Cream is a mineral sunscreen with the most runny lightweight texture. Despite it being lightweight oh my it is so pleasant to put on! It does not leave my skin tight and dry and best of all it is fragrance and essential oil free!! It is very easy to blend and it leaves a very minimal white cast in the beginning but it quickly disappears. I believe there was a video with Juan putting on the sunscreen on Ohlolly's instagram page. Overall, I really love this sunscreen :)\n\nEdit: SPF rating: 45 PA+++\n\n**Star Rating 5/5**\n\n​ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n**Ingredient List**\n\nWater, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Propanediol, Titanium Dioxide, Methylpropanediol, Cyclomethicone, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Aluminum Stearate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Caprylic/Capric/Succinic Triglyceride, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Silica, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Alumina, Cetyl Hydroxyethylcellulose, Cellulose Gum, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tromethamine, t-Butyl Alcohol, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Butylene Glycol, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phosphatidylcholine, Ceramide NP, Glycine, Serine, Glutamic Acid, Alanine, Threonine, Proline, Arginine",

I quite enjoy it and am considering repurchasing as it’s about to run out. This new product doesn’t seem like a replacement for it? Plus it’s 25ml bottle vs 30ml for the retinol cica ampoule 🤔\n\nBelow is a description that I copy pasted from Olive Young:\n\nIngredients: Lactobacillus Ferment Lysate (56.88%), Glycerin, Propanediol, Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Squalane, Glyceryl Polymethacrylate, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Methyl Trimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Allantoin, Glyceryl Stearate, Xanthan Gum, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Pentylene Glycol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Stearic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Sodium Metaphosphate, Kojyl Methylenedioxycinnamate, Palmitic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Retinol (1,000IU/g), Sodium Hyaluronate, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Beta-carotene, Myristic Acid, Lauric Acid, Pullulan, Zein, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Pectin, Citric Acid\n\nWhy we love it\nRanked #1 overall at OLIVE YOUNG upon release.\nA skin booster that cares for pores and provides inner glow.\nA dual-functional product for wrinkle improvement and brightening.\nOverall satisfaction 100%, feeling that the skin becomes firm and smooth 94.2%, skin feels nourished 92.3%, pore improvement, and skin looks luminous and healthy 90.4%.\nA high-efficiency, high-concentration retinol product.\nSmooths the surface of the skin with retinol and strengthens from within with Green Tea PDRN™.\nA highly moisturizing, fresh, and nourishing ampoule with booster technology that absorbs 3.4 times more.\nCompleted primary skin irritation tests and dermatological tests.\nFeatured ingredients\nINNISFREE’s first 3-layer Retinol Complex™ and Green Tea PDRN™ original formula product.\nCares for pores and skin texture with the 3-layer Retinol Complex™, and provides inner glow, brightening, and elasticity care with low-molecular Green Tea PDRN™.\nThe 1/10 size low-molecular Green Tea PDRN™ formula, researched for use as an ampoule, absorbs deeply into the skin, caring for pores, skin texture, and inner glow.\n\nHow to use\n1.

However, the ingredients list is pretty solid as well, and these two are relatively inexpensive, on the $15 ~ $20 USD side. \n\nHave any of you used these products? Or any other Alive:Lab products?

Amazon marked it delivered without me neither receiving the product nor the OTP/delivery agent details. I raised a complaint and they delivered another product free of cost. The customer support was good, but I was disappointed with this kind of experience of delivering it without any verification at their end.\n\n**🌿Ingredients:** Aqua, Propylene Glycol, Propanediol, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Ethoxydiglycol, Glycerine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl Glycerine, Panthenol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Fragrance, Sodium Gluconate, Hyaluronic Acid, Xanthan Gum\n\n\n**Texture:** Transparent Liquid\n\n**🧴Packaging:** Brown Translucent bottle with dropper\n\n**My Experience:** I came to know about this brand from this sub itself.  I was drawn to this brand due to it being from Pharma company Cipla. As I was unsure over Minimalist Vitamin C 16% , I had bought this bottle in my search of a new Vitamin C Serum. \n\nThe texture is very lightweight, absorbs easily into the skin, doesn’t sting your face. I’ve also applied it in under eye area, and it didn’t sting, so for me it’s a positive point. It was only a 10ml bottle, that lasted without getting oxidization. From my small experience of using Vitamin C Serums, this product seemed like a great start for beginners.\n\nI did not see any reduction in pigmentation, but I can’t say for sure if the product is to be blamed here coz it was only a 10ml bottle, it might have shown effect with more usage. There’s also another thing, that my skin is already used to higher percentages, so maybe getting a 10% serum wasn’t the best idea.\n\nAfter my last post on [Minimalist Vitamin C ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/x5i8iy/minimalist_16_vitamin_c_serum_with_vitamin_e/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) where most of you confirmed that there was no oxidization and the yellow colour was due to Ferulic Acid, I’ve gone back to it. So I wouldn’t be using Rivela Serum anymore, but it’s not due bad experience with the product. I’d still recommend this to beginners, like Plum 15% Vitamin C serum.\n\n**WRP:** WNRP",

(However, some stores may still be on sale.)\" . From what I could get from some comments the gel has stopped production this april while the lotions from the line have stopped been produced since last fall.The entire Ceramide line is gone from the lineup on the Rosette's site.",

    "body": "Peach & Lily - Pure Peach Retinoic Eye Cream\n\nAnother eye cream review...from someone that should not be reviewing eye creams.\n\nReally though, I need to stop buying eye specific skincare and I think the Peach & Lily Pure Peach Retinoic Eye Cream will be the last one (at least for a good long while).\n\nI’m lucky enough that I don’t (yet) tackle many of the issues that eye products are meant to address. I’m not seeing any lines or wrinkles in that area really...and the slight darkness/bagginess I have has been there since I was a tiny human.\n\nSo, I fear that any amazing benefits or results might be a bit lost on me. At least that seems to be the trend since no eye product I have tried has truly wowed me.\n\nWhat I do like about the Pure Peach Retinoic Eye Cream is that it features so many ingredients I love in a product that is lightweight and absorbs beautifully. Niacinamide, ginseng, bamboo, and several antioxidant rich greens are here.\n\nAlso, Bakuchiol is in the formulation which is said to be a more “natural” and gentle alternative to Retinol. From what I’ve read and heard from skincare professionals...we need more studies/research before making that claim with confidence.\n\nMy experience with this product is that it hydrates my eye area really well and plays nicely with the other products in my routine. That in addition to the nice dose of antioxidants makes this a fine product for me...I just can’t say for certain that it is doing much more than that.\n\nA little bit goes a really long way here so I’ll probably have this bottle in my routine for quite some time. But, I don't think it is something I would come back to...I guess the same could be said for all eye products (for now).\n\nLike I said...not the best person to be reviewing this one lol!\n\nFull Ingredients List: Water, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Bambusa (Bamboo) Textilis Stem Extract, Arctium Lappa (Burdock) Root Extract, Morus Alba (Mulberry) Leaf Extract, Prunus Persica (Peach) Fruit Extract, Bakuchiol, Rosa Rubiginosa Seed Oil, Daucus Carota (Carrot) Sativa Root Water, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Spinacia Oleracea (Spinach) Leaf Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Acetyl Octapeptide-3, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Extract, Apium Graveolens (Celery) Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Sorbitan Olivate, Lactuca Scariola Sativa (Lettuce) Leaf Extract, Ceramide Np, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ferulic Acid, Tocopherol, Panthenol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Adenosine, Cetearyl Olivate, Hydrogenated Rapeseed Alcohol, Betaine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyglyceryl-4 Oleate, Glyceryl Olivate, Glyceryl Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Asparagus Officinalis Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Phosphoric Acid, Corallina Officinalis Extract\n\nWhere To Buy (Peach & Lily - $42.00 USD - 20ml): [https://www.peachandlily.com/products/pure-peach-retinoic-eye-cream](https://www.peachandlily.com/products/pure-peach-retinoic-eye-cream)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nl18p3drb6p51.jpg?width=1098&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c564fa513071af08b08743c2da57e8bd991bf14e",

    "body": "Hey guys, so a couple days ago someone on one of the daily help threads asked for a comparison review of the Bonvivant Botanical Mellow Clay Mask and the Innisfree Jeju Volcanic Pore Mask. And since I have both, I said I'd do a comparison! This is my first review so I'm glad to be helping people :) so let's get started!\n\nNOTE: I caught a head cold when I went home for my Thanksgiving break, so please keep that in mind! I'll specify where things were affected as a result of my head cold. (Don't worry, I'm doing better now and was already on the mend by the time I got back to campus to be able to test these!)\n\nBonvivant Botanical Mellow Clay Mask in Hawaiian Pink Calamine\n- Scent: It has a very faint herbal scent. I could smell it when it first arrived, before I got sick, but when I opened it up again to actually use it, I couldn't smell it any more because my nose had gotten so plugged up...\n- Color: It was a very cute pastel pink!\n- Texture: It's kinda like jello! I pushed on it and it pushed back like a soft rubber; it was kinda fun to play with! Normally I hate having long nails when I put on clay or gel masks (I'll admit I'm too lazy to trim them if they still look good), but having longer nails was actually useful this time to get past the bouncy top and scoop it out of the jar. It was also useful when breaking apart the chunks to smooth it onto my face.\n- Time: 10 minutes\n- First impression: It slightly stung on my nose, but my nose was very dry and raw from having to blow it so much (darn you, head cold!). After about 30 seconds, though, the stinging went away and I could enjoy the cooling sensation all over my face.\n- In progress thoughts: You definitely want to do more than a thin layer. Mine was thin because I got less than I thought I did once I broke the chunks apart and smoothed it out, and it dried faster than I thought it would have. I could see it sinking into my pores though.\n- Final thoughts: It's easy to wash off, but I recommend using a sponge to get it off easier than using just your hands like I did. My skin felt very soft afterwards, and even after just one use the raw and dry skin on my nose seemed nice and calm! Definitely still red, but not as extreme as before. Granted this was just one use, but I think it did what it was advertised to do!\n- Ingredients (cosdna.com): Water, Kaolin, Glycerin, PEG/PPG-17/6, Copolymer, Calamine, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Betulla Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Papain, Maltodextrin, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Castanea Crenata (Chestnut) Shell Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Volcanic Ash, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Cellulose Gum, Hydroxyacetophenone, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Betaine, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Tetrasodium Pyrophosphate, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\nInnisfree Jeju Volcanic Pore Clay Mask\n- Scent: It was like natural clay (different from art clay). It was very very faint, and while I'm basically done with my head cold, I would not have noticed it if I hadn't just taken a hot shower that cleared my sinuses.\n- Color: It was kind of a brownish gray.\n- Texture: It's like any normal clay mask.\n- Time: 15 minutes\n- First impression: It was very easy to spread on and get a nice even layer. (It was a bit annoying to try to clean out from under my nails, though.) There wasn't really much of a feel to it aside from a somewhat subdued cooling sensation along my cheekbones.\n- In progress thoughts: There really isn't too much of a cooling effect. There was somewhat more in other areas (my forehead and cheeks) than when I first put it on, but not much. I didn't see much sinking into my pores, but I also got a more generous layer with this than I did with the Bonvivant mask.\n- Final thoughts: There still wasn't much visible pulling out stuff from my pores, but I guess that means that the blackheads I thought I had are either large pores or they're closed over (yikes!). It was easy to wash off, but again, a sponge would be easier than your hands (also use warm water, it likes to cling with cool water). Not much of a softening effect immediately (I noticed my skin felt softer maybe 10 minutes later, before I started the rest of my routine for the night), but some of the healing acne that's been popping up due to the stress of finals look less red. It's probably better for those who have more blackheads or sebaceous filaments than I do.\n- Ingredients: Water, Butylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Trehalose, Volcanic Ash, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Bentonite, Zinc Oxide, Polysorbate 60, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Citrus Unshiu Peel Extract, Opuntia Coccinellifera Fruit Extract, Orchid, Camellia Japonica, Cryptomeria Japonica Leaf Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Extract, Theobroma Cacao Seed Extract, Kaolin, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, PVP, Dextrin, PEG-100 Stearate, Sorbitan Stearate, Cellulose Gum, Xanthan Gum, Lactic Acid, Tetrasodium Pyrophosphate, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, CI 77491\n\nThe Bonvivant mask will be more useful for me personally, but the Innisfree one was nice too. They definitely have different purposes, but I only reviewed one version of the Bonvivant mask, the one meant to calm troubled skin. They also have them in Jeju Volcanic, meant for blackhead removal like the Innisfree one, and in Mint Tea Tree, meant for removing dead skin cells. If you're looking for something to soothe your skin, I'd definitely say try the Hawaiian Pink Calamine version of the Bonvivant mask. If you want something more like the Innisfree one, I'd say give the Jeju Volcanic one a try. (I don't have the other two to try out, so sorry!) My skin problem is more keeping skin soft and healing non-blackhead acne, so for me the Hawaiian Pink Calamine mask is better. But that is just me!\n\nHopefully this helps! I kind of tried to model what other reviews I've seen here and over other parts of the Internet look like, so I hope that all the important information is there! Thanks!",

    "body": "[My skin: dry and I get acne when the skin gets too dry.  Can be dehydrated mostly depending on weather.  Redness is my main issue]\n\nSo!  I bought this in the hopes of soothing my skin, improving overall redness, and reducing the chances of acne appearing.  I LOVE a good hydrating toner, so away we go.\n\nIngredients: \nCamellia Sinensis Leaf Water (50%), Aqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Root Extract, Punica Granatum Fruit Extract, Tocopherol, Betaine, Arginine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\nTexture:  Very watery.  This is probably very similar to what it would be like to put cold green tea on the skin.  It sinks it very quickly, especially if your skin is thirsty like mine. \n\nThe first two weeks I was having a great time!  I slotting in this product before my standard hydrating toner (Klairs Unscented), so it was acting like an FTE going directly onto clean skin, morning and evening.  It sank in immediately and everything going well.\n\nThen, around week 3 my face started getting dry and no biggie, just some weather changes.  Let's pile on the hydrating layers!  So I upped things to 2 or 3 of the Benton and 2 or 3 of the Klairs.  However while it seems like dehydration was taken care of, my face *craved* oil.  My rosehip seed oil started getting sucked in right quick.  Small bits of acne started to appear as is normal for me when my skin gets dry.\n\nYou see, **I had completely forgotten green tea regulates sebum production**.  And sebum regulation is exactly what I DO NOT need.\n\nSo!  Once I realize my error (2 weeks later), I dropped out the Benton and my face went back to normal.\n\nRecommendation:  This has been one of the few times where I have seen such noticeable impact of a product on the daily functioning of my skin.  While not for me, if you are looking to reduce sebum production I would recommend the Benton Deep Green Tea Toner without hesitation.  It is cosmetically elegant, minimal potential irritants, a straight-forward addition to a routine, and affordable.\n\nApologies for the clickbait title.  It was an interesting product to try and interesting skin adventure!  Cheers!",

    "body": "I grew up eating Botan Rice Candy, and I would love a cheeky fragrance that reminds me of it. Any ideas?\n\nIf you haven’t tried these candies before, (1) go try them!, and (2) here’s a description I found online: “Botan Rice Candy is a soft, chewy, slightly lemon-orange flavored candy with an outer layer of rice paper.”\n\nThe closest smell I’ve encountered is Alba Botanica acnedote face wash—and the smell was *really close*!! Here are the ingredients: “Active Ingredients: Salicylic Acid 2.0% Inactive Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Coco-Betaine, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Chloride, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil(2), Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil(2), Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil(2), Azardirachta Indica Leaf Extract(1), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract(1), Carum Petroselinum (Parsley) Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract(1), Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Extract, Alcohol(1), Citric Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citral, Limonene, Linalool (1)Certified Organic Ingredient (2)For scent only“",

    "body": "• There aren’t that many reviews of products by Bonajour online so I decided to make a review post. All of the products were purchased from Amazon through the official Bonajour seller. \n\n(Obviously not sponsored)\n\n1.) Coconut Oil Body Moisturizer (300 ML)\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Cetearyl Olivate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sorbitan Olivate, Pinus Densiflora Extract, Saussurea Involucrata Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Olivoyl Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Glyceryl Oleate, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Arginine, Carbomer, Fragrance, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n- Review: I’ve repurchased this body lotion multiple times already. The scent is so heavenly and it feels so good on my body. This moisturizer is lightweight but moisturizing. 5/5\n\n2.) Sensitive Skin Body Wash (500 ML)\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Disodium cocoamphodiacetate, Lauryl Glucoside, Propanediol, Sodium cocoyl glutamate, Sodium chloride, Glycerin, Centella Asiatica Extract, Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosmary) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Aniba Rosodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil, Octyldodecanol, Echium Plantagineum Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Butylene Glycol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hexylene glycol\n\n- Review: I love this body wash, I’ve purchased it 2 times and it lasts for a while too (even with daily use). It has a relaxing smell and it lathers well. I put this body wash on a Salux washcloth and the body wash doesn’t dry out my skin. 5/5\n\n3.) Mugwort Cream Calming Mask (1.9 fl. oz)\n\n- Ingredients: Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract(32.20%), Water, Kaolin, Butylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Bentonite, Sorbitan Olivate, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Apium Graveolens (Celery)Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Brassica Rapa (Turnip) Leaf Extract, Solanum Lycopersicum (Tomato) Fruit/Leaf/Stem Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Brassica OleraceaItalica (Broccoli) Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Cinnamomum Cassia Bark Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosmary) Leaf Extract, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Enantia Chlorantha (Bark) Extract, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pusatilla Koreana Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Citrusparadisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Octyldodecanol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant) Seed Oil, Oleanolic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder (4,000ppm), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Powder, Tocopherol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Artemisia Vulgaris Oil(500ppm), Sod\n\n- Review: I’m still going through my first purchase of this and it’s grown on me. Although I prefer the I’m From Mugwort Mask, this mask is skin calming too. I use mask this during my menstruation cycle (where my skin is more prone to having skin inflammation) and it felt very nice. I also like how the date when opened can be written on the product + it’s a cheaper mugwort product. 4/5\n\n4.) Propolis Serum (100 ML) \n\n- Ingredients: Propolis Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Water, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Cinnamomum Cassia Bark Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Ulmus Campestris (Elm) Bark Extract, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Gleditsia Australis Thorn Extract, Angelica Dahurica Root Extract, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Bletilla Striata Root Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Seed Extract, Trichosanthes Kirilowii Root Extract, Broussonetia Kazinoki Root Extract, Eugenia Caryophyllus (Clove) Flower Extract, Amomum Xanthioides Seed Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Sodium Carbomer, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Epigallocatechin Gallate\n\n- Review: I have mixed thoughts about this product. The price is really good especially for the size (100 ML). I would recommend this serum for oily skin types. This is more of a skin calming serum rather than a hydrating one. It did calm my face but did little for my acne. This product is also unscented. I didn’t repurchase the serum. 3/5 \n\n5.) Seaweed Lotion (150 ML) \n\n- Ingredients: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Butylene Glycol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Water, Sargassum Fulvellum Extract, Gelidium Cartilagineum Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycerin, Panthenol, Polyglutamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Allantoin, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n- Review: I also have mixed thoughts about this lotion. This product is unscented and the smell of the moisturizer doesn’t bother me. This is a very basic moisturizer. Sometimes this would make my face feel itchy but my face was dehydrated at the time I was using this. I wouldn’t repurchase it and am now using it as a hand lotion (which works). 3/5\n\n6.) Seaweed Skin Toner (150 ML)\n\n- Ingredients: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Water, Sargassum Fulvellum Extract, Gelidium Cartilagineum Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Polyglutamic Acid, Panthenol, Allantoin, Betaine, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n- Review: This is a great toner but after I started using the Matsuyama Hadauru Moisturizing Infusion Balancing Lotion, I used this one less. I haven’t repurchased it. I also used it before applying lotion on my body (which feels nice and cooling). This is a lightweight toner that can easily be layered. This product is also unscented. 4/5",

This line features an essence, cream, sheet mask, spot treatment, and this wash off product. The featured ingredient across the board is…you guessed it…Artemisia (aka Mugwort). Most of the products feature Artemisia Extract, but the I’m From Mugwort Mask includes Artemisia Powder. Several other wonderful extracts are found in this product including Cordyceps Sinensis Extract, Japanese Knotweed Extract, Skullcap Root Extract, and Fischers Ragwort Extract…just to name a few.\n\nOverall, the ingredients list focuses almost solely on reducing inflammation and calming the skin. Other preservatives, texturizes, and hydrators make the list as well. The total formula has a really unique look and feel. Little bits of mugwort can be seen and felt once applied to give the mask a really “earthy/natural” aesthetic. Meanwhile…the texture is quite thick and jelly-like. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f2zu9v9khd251.jpg?width=3821&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76a0273f2f84c4d7b6b1e3abc600015fb93d99ca\n\nAs for the scent, I find it to be really incredible. I mentioned the slightly earthy, herbal, grassy scent of the I’m From Mugwort Essence in my review for that product…well the Mugwort Mask takes that scent to an even higher level. Opening this jar is like being transported to some far-off mugwort field LOL. I am a sucker for these types of scents and I looked forward to opening and applying this product each and every time.\n\nApplication of the product is fairly easy…although I found using a mask brush of some kind to be better than using the included spatula or my fingers. I’m not sure if my skin tone kept me from seeing just how much I had on, or if I just preferred a heavier application…but either way I tended to slap this stuff on pretty thick! It could also be that I loved having this product on and seeing the little mugwort bits…so the more the better!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cxfz60umhd251.jpg?width=3295&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8de704346a7005d70f6db24250008fa0de547ee\n\nOnce on, I was able to keep the mask on for anywhere between 10 and 30 minutes. The packaging recommends 5-10…but I found that the mask didn’t really “dry down” in the same way that other wash off masks might (especially clay masks). It retained its jelly-ness for quite some time. Even after 30 minutes…I would still see small areas of “damp” product on my skin (of course this may have to do with the heavy application).  \n\nAlthough rinsing this mask off is a bit of a hassle…I found the process to be kind of relaxing while using some cool water. After rinsing, that is where the I’m From Mugwort Mask really shines. My skin always looks calm AF after using this product LOL! Redness and irritation are at a minimum and dryness/flaking are pretty much gone as well. In addition to all of that…my skin looks hydrated and dewy after using this product. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rylyjhnohd251.jpg?width=2316&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be0222f7fcf96847d74e38c02ac765c6f035b1cd\n\nThis super calming/skin resetting result is probably yet another reason why I kept coming back to it and slathering it on. The I’m From Mugwort Mask was such a life saver while using Curology/Tretinoin and a great compliment to my daily use of the I’m From Mugwort Essence. I don’t know if I could pick between the two as I found the essence to be my daily/general maintenance product while the mask was more of a “emergency” reset (if that makes sense). Both are amazing products in my opinion and compliment each other really well.\n\nI don’t see any reason why all skin types cant use the I’m From Mugwort Mask. It provides excellent soothing and calming…while also offering hydration for those with dry skin. There is an entertainment value here with the look of the product that I think a lot of people will get a kick out of. This is 100% a product that I will continue to purchase, recommend, and keep on hand! \n\nFull Ingredients List: Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cordyceps Sinensis Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Methylpropanediol, Ligularia Fishceri Leaf Extract, Rosa Davurica Bud Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Sodium Polyacrylaste, Carbomer, Arginine, Phenoxyethanol, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Panthenol, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA\n\nWhere To Buy: I am an affiliate with Wishtrend…which is where I picked this product up.

This past winter killed my skin… lots of stressors, dry air, inside heat, etc. My rosacea was really flaring and my skin barrier was really compromised. I took a step back from my ZO products (that had been working really well previously) and at the same time found Charlotte. Revisiting old advice, I just went with a simple cleanser and moisturizer am and pm. No actives or anything. I decided to try the Dieux products and now after having them in steady rotation for a couple of months and two empty bottles (instant angel and deliverance) I can definitely say that have both done wonders for my skin. I started with instant angel and immediately loved the texture and moisture it gave me without feeling heavy. Then added in deliverance and found it to really help calm my redness and irritation. After my skin calmed down, I did slowly add back in 0.25% tret and azaelic acid and my skin is soooo happy again which makes me happy! I do lean towards dry skin but am acne prone.

Luckily, I was able to get a full refund and considering Dieux's website even notes reactions from the serum when requesting a refund, I know breakouts must be common.\n\nI'm just bummed that I went from having clear skin that rarely needed concealer to still dealing with scarring and dark spots six months later.

    "body": "Looks like we are receiving more scalp-targeted skin care products which is very exciting! There are little scalp focused products (although there are more lately in the form of scalp acids).\n\nThis line also has a shampoo but the treatment/conditioner is what I would really like to discuss. What's different, from just a glance, is that it's more \"dermatologically\" proven. It claims that the ingredients used are \"certified by Korean ministry of food and drug safety\" and it is also \"certified as low irritation through a rigorous skin patch test by Korean dermatology research institute.\"\n\nThis product REALLY caught my eye because I am constantly looking for more scalp-care products. It is my understanding that conditioner shouldn't touch the scalp, (especially if you are acne prone). I have a sensitive scalp prone to inflammation which is why I am very interested in scalp care. If this product is everything the marketing for it claims then this might just be a holy grail for scalp-focused skin-carers.\n\nPY's approach is interesting because most conditioner seem to be formulated as a hair conditioner first and skin conditioner second. In my experience, products formulated like this tends to leave an irritating residue as the consideration for the scalp is secondary. Their testing seems to be addressing this.\n\nI don't pay much attention to the hair loss claim in itself (only in terms of how much it improves scalp health which obviously affects hair health in the long term).\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR:This hair conditioner is designed with scalp-contact in mind making this product stand out from most other I've seen on the market (something like a wash off scalp mask + hair conditioner)\\*\\*\n\nIt seems like a pretty new product (so long shot asking if anyone has used it) but this is product really caught my eye so I will try it out and report back.\n\nif this seems like an ad for this brand, it's not. I'm just really passionate about scalp health lmfao (check my posting history and rifle through the housewives and university posts)\n\nany thoughts on this product's formulation or comments on scalp-care asian products in general?

Cleanser - Innisfree Jeju Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam, Toner - Rosewater (Kama or Khadi Naturals), Essence - Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence, Moisturizer - Beplain Cicaful Calming Gel. \n\nUsage: I used the BOJ Relief Sun for approximately 2+1 weeks, after the above routine. I reapply once after lunch usually. I try to rinse my face beforehand, but sometimes have to just apply on top of the existing layer.\n\nIngredients:  Water, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract (30%), Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Niacinamide, Methylene Bis-benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Coco-caprylate/Caprate, Caprylyl Methicone, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Germ Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Lactobacillus/Pumpkin Ferment Extract, Bacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Macrocystis Pyrifera (Kelp) Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Monascus/Rice Ferment, Pentylene Glycol, Behenyl Alcohol, Poly C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Decyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, 1,2-Hexanediol,Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Tocopherol, Lactobacillus/Rice Ferment, Aspergillus Ferment, Saccharomyces/Rice Ferment Filtrate \n\nTexture, Consistency, Fragrance: Feels like a lightweight moisturizer. Thinner consistency, as expected with chemical sunscreens. It doesn't really dry down, leaves you with a more dewy finish. I didn't see any whitecast when using 2-3 finger lengths. No significant fragrance. \n\nResults & Experience: My first impressions of this sunscreen after initial use were great. It has an amazing texture and the lightweight formula was a dream to blend and to reapply. I didn't experience any pilling or issues with any of my other skincare products. \n\nThe first issue I had was that the sunscreen burned/tingled for a few minutes in my eye area during application. However, since my skin is so sensitive, I'm used to that happening with chemical sunscreen formulations, and didn't consider it that much of an issue. I applied an extra layer of moisturizer around my eye area to help combat the issue. I continued usage normally. \n\nI used this product for about a week and started noticing significantly more acne than usual, but I shrugged it off. I was ovulating and typically do experience more acne breakouts during that time, so just thought it was due to that and decided to power through, thinking it would settle down soon enough. In retrospect, wrong time to start using a new product, but who really has the patience to wait after the product has arrived (not me!). \n\nThen, in week two the breakouts moved from being regular whiteheads and pimples to giant, red cystic acne. That's when I started suspecting the sunscreen. While I am acne prone, I almost NEVER get cystic acne, and within this week I had 5-6 spots all over my face, that were hurting to the touch. I discontinued use of the sunscreen and switched to a known non-irritating sunscreen for 2 weeks for my skin to calm down. \n\nRandomly, last week I decided to give it another try. In the first two weeks of usage, it was super super hot, and I was sweating buckets all day, every day. My workplace doesn't have AC in the lab, so I was exposed to the extreme heat and thought that could have also be a cause of the acne. I wanted to confirm before giving the sunscreen away. I was sitting in the office for the last week, which does have AC, but same results. Thankfully, I stopped usage before it reached the cystic acne stage again, but uncountable smaller breakouts. \n\nBottomline, this sunscreen definitely did not suit my skin. I am not entirely sure what caused this reaction. I suspect I might be sensitive to niacinamide, but normally in small percentages it is okay. Also, some other reviews said it might be the fermented ingredients, but I have used a few products which included similar ingredients without issue. I guess it is just the overall formulation and the combination of potentially irritating ingredients together. \n\nOverall: 2/5, WNRP. I will not even be able to finish the tube, and have already given it to my mom since her skin is much less sensitive.",

The ingredients are typically aren’t superb. \n\nFor example, the Fresh Black Tea Kombucha Facial Treatment Essence (250ml) is $68USD and this is the ingredient list: Water, Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Glycerin, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Polyglycerin-3, Kigelia Africana Fruit Extract, Citrus Unshiu Peel Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Butylene Glycol, Diglycerin, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum (Fragrance), Disodium EDTA, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Citrate, BHT, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Biotin, Phenoxyethanol, Linalool, Citronellol, Geraniol. \n \nIn comparison to an Asian Essence with similar claims/ingredients (though the concentration and overall ingredient list is superior)-ATRUE Real Black Tea True Active Essence 180ml for $42USD. The ingredients are: Saccharomyces/Xylinum/Black Tea Ferment(146,340mg), Butylene Glycol, Saccharide Isomerate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycereth-26, Niacinamide, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Dipropylene Glycol, Trehalose, Panthenol, Glycerin, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Fruit Extract, Maltodextrin, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, Sorghum Bicolor Stalk Juice, Adenosine, Tromethamine, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Water, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Fragrance\n\nIs this price discrepancy due to marketing?

        "body": "because you're comparing fresh, a higher-end brand, to atrue, a more mid-tier brand. if sulwhasoo released a $65 black tea treatment essence, we wouldn't be having this conversation. but because a cheaper brand happened to release something like fresh, we draw a comparison, but since the brands aren't even on the same price point level within their respective markets, the comparison falls short from a money perspective.\n\nit just so happens that even cheaper korean brands like innisfree, nature republic, etc. happen to release products that are on par with the products released by higher-end western brands. in korean beauty, every brand is focused on having all of these fancy skincare products, whereas in western beauty, only higher end brands do that, while more affordable brands tend to stick with the basics. if cetaphil or cerave were releasing fermented essences or super complex-seeming miracle creams, it wouldn't seem like korean skincare is cheaper at all, but since drugstore brands tend to stick with the more basic niche, we start comparing cheap korean brands to luxury western brands.\n\nso basically, korean beauty isn't necessarily cheaper; korean brands as a whole are all going crazy with skincare, while in the west, only luxury brands tend to use these \"fancy\" ingredients and have these fancy claims. i guess it boils down to mindset. in the west, fancy skincare is a luxury, so brands only feel like it's worth delving into that realm if they know they're going to sell it for an expensive price (which is why you don't see cetaphil releasing an at-home 30% AHA facial with trendy pink packaging). if you want something cheap, you go with the basics. meanwhile, in korea, fancy skincare is kind of a standard i guess, so brands are all releasing products that fill the same niche, regardless of their price points.",

    "body": "I have been wondering about BeautyNetKorea's house brand, Eyenlip, since it first launched. The prices are rock-bottom for most items (sunscreen for $2, BB cream for $3 -- plus shipping). The box of 10 masks was $1.90 when I bought it. It's hard to pass up a mask for 19 cents (plus shipping). Note: This was a promotional price. It looks like they're $2.29 today (April 18, 2018), but more varieties are available than when I purchased.\n\n**Packaging:** The box has that velvety feel and the sheet masks each have a matte background with colorful flowers that are glossy. It appears to be heavily borrowing from the packaging of the [Jayjun Anti-Dust](http://en.jayjun.co.kr/img/main_visual_antidusttherapy_en.jpg) sheet masks. The packaging is nicer than expected. Ingredients are listed in both Korean and English, but instructions are only in pictograms for those who don't read Korean. It's a sheet mask -- it's not that difficult.\n\n**Ingredients:** (I couldn't find these listed in English online, so here they are)\n\nWater, Glycerin, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Betaine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Polysorbate 20, Snail Secretion Filtrate (25g), Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Flower Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Pinuis Palustris Leaf Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract (Tea Leaf), Camellia Japonica Seed Extract (Camellia), Honey Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Hamamelis Virgniana Leaf Extract (Witch Hazel), Phenoxylethanol, Fragrance\n\nI just wanted to list them here for anyone who wants them. I'm not the world's best ingredient analyzer.\n\n**Use:** The first thing I noticed about the mask is how drippy it is. I left the mask on a flat surface for a couple of days so it could absorb the essence better. When I took it out of the pack, it was dripping into the sink -- something most masks don't do. \n\n**Fit/Material:** The mask fit OK, and would work for fiveheads like me. Others may need to fold it over on the forehead. The eye holes seemed smaller than average for sheet masks. The material is fairly thin on this one and it's translucent. Because the eye holes covered my eyebrows and the mask was drippy, I had serum running into my eyes, which was a first for me.\n\n**Fragrance:** The serum has a fairly robust rose fragrance. It's not overwhelming for me, but it is reasonably strong. The rose scent wasn't overly fake or perfumy, but it's definitely there. \n\n**Serum:** I found the serum didn't absorb into my skin as well as other masks I've used (including Innisfree, Mizon, Tosowoong, Leaders, Dermal Korea, MBD, etc.). I was patting for quite some time after I removed the mask. Despite how much was in the mask, I still had leftovers for my next couple of routines. The serum wasn't overly sticky, but I did need to put on moisturizer to make it dry down better. \n\n**Results:** The hydration level I got from this was OK. I didn't break out and my skin felt soft. It was overall a \"meh\" mask for me.\n\nI'm not sure if I'll repurchase or not. Summer is coming and I tend to mask more when it's hot, so these might be a nice way to mask more often at a low price.\n\n**Score:** 3/5",

My experience with the snail essence mask was about the same as your experience.\n\nDid you get a slight itching sensation with the snail essence mask? It wasn’t bad enough that I felt the need to take the mask off immediately and it didn’t leave any irritation, but I definitely had light itchiness on my face a few minutes after putting the mask on. It could be coincidence because my face frequently itches at random.\n\nEdit: Also, thanks for this review! When I was initially looking at buying these masks I had a hard time finding any reviews on them. I hate spending money on untested products, so it’s good to get some reviews out there on these masks.",

This line features an essence, cream, sheet mask, spot treatment, and this wash off product. The featured ingredient across the board is…you guessed it…Artemisia (aka Mugwort). Most of the products feature Artemisia Extract, but the I’m From Mugwort Mask includes Artemisia Powder. Several other wonderful extracts are found in this product including Cordyceps Sinensis Extract, Japanese Knotweed Extract, Skullcap Root Extract, and Fischers Ragwort Extract…just to name a few.\n\nOverall, the ingredients list focuses almost solely on reducing inflammation and calming the skin. Other preservatives, texturizes, and hydrators make the list as well. The total formula has a really unique look and feel. Little bits of mugwort can be seen and felt once applied to give the mask a really “earthy/natural” aesthetic. Meanwhile…the texture is quite thick and jelly-like. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/umifxzncid251.jpg?width=3821&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2f6a2e2c3bad66fa6ec962737e683fa6af0501a\n\nAs for the scent, I find it to be really incredible. I mentioned the slightly earthy, herbal, grassy scent of the I’m From Mugwort Essence in my review for that product…well the Mugwort Mask takes that scent to an even higher level. Opening this jar is like being transported to some far-off mugwort field LOL. I am a sucker for these types of scents and I looked forward to opening and applying this product each and every time.\n\nApplication of the product is fairly easy…although I found using a mask brush of some kind to be better than using the included spatula or my fingers. I’m not sure if my skin tone kept me from seeing just how much I had on, or if I just preferred a heavier application…but either way I tended to slap this stuff on pretty thick! It could also be that I loved having this product on and seeing the little mugwort bits…so the more the better!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jzzzepaeid251.jpg?width=3295&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f48cd3b89b10de67e622246d066a4291b91dc8f8\n\nOnce on, I was able to keep the mask on for anywhere between 10 and 30 minutes. The packaging recommends 5-10…but I found that the mask didn’t really “dry down” in the same way that other wash off masks might (especially clay masks). It retained its jelly-ness for quite some time. Even after 30 minutes…I would still see small areas of “damp” product on my skin (of course this may have to do with the heavy application).  \n\nAlthough rinsing this mask off is a bit of a hassle…I found the process to be kind of relaxing while using some cool water. After rinsing, that is where the I’m From Mugwort Mask really shines. My skin always looks calm AF after using this product LOL! Redness and irritation are at a minimum and dryness/flaking are pretty much gone as well. In addition to all of that…my skin looks hydrated and dewy after using this product. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k7vl17nfid251.jpg?width=2316&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dbad918b692d74f11463179763a32d2663404929\n\nThis super calming/skin resetting result is probably yet another reason why I kept coming back to it and slathering it on. The I’m From Mugwort Mask was such a life saver while using Curology/Tretinoin and a great compliment to my daily use of the I’m From Mugwort Essence. I don’t know if I could pick between the two as I found the essence to be my daily/general maintenance product while the mask was more of a “emergency” reset (if that makes sense). Both are amazing products in my opinion and compliment each other really well.\n\nI don’t see any reason why all skin types cant use the I’m From Mugwort Mask. It provides excellent soothing and calming…while also offering hydration for those with dry skin. There is an entertainment value here with the look of the product that I think a lot of people will get a kick out of. This is 100% a product that I will continue to purchase, recommend, and keep on hand! \n\nFull Ingredients List: Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cordyceps Sinensis Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Methylpropanediol, Ligularia Fishceri Leaf Extract, Rosa Davurica Bud Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Sodium Polyacrylaste, Carbomer, Arginine, Phenoxyethanol, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Panthenol, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA\n\nWhere To Buy: I am an affiliate with Wishtrend…which is where I picked this product up.

Their team is POC, with a black woman CEO and their products target eczema and hyperpigmentation. \n\nIn case you don't want to go through the entire Twitter thread, I've reposted some information here. \n\n**Faded**\n\n* \"A silky, fragrance free(!) serum which is a holy grail for hyperpigmentation. Faded is a highly effective and powerful, yet gentle formulation.\n* \"The Power Players in Faded are:  - Tranexamic Acid: prevents melanocyte tyrosinase activity. Melanocytes are skin cells that are responsible for producing pigment. They produce/distribute melanin, which is what results in PIH! - Kojic Acid: a tyrosinase inhibitor and exfoliant.\"\n* \\- Azelaic Acid: A super gentle exfoliant. Prevents the conversion of tyrosinase into melanin. Also scavenges for free radicals.  - Licorice Root: powerful antioxidant and anti inflammatory. Also a tyrosinase inhibitor!  - Centella Asiatica: very anti-inflammatory\n* \\- Niacinamide: Anti inflammatory. Great antioxidant. Repairs the barrier. Brightens the skin. Refines pores and excess oil. And limits melanocyte stimulation. A STAR (and gentle) ingredient - Melatonin: Anti inflammatory and also inhibits melanocyte activity!\"\n\n\\*I DM'ed and they told me Niacinamide content was 4% \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Like Butter** \n\n* \"A rich, buttery cream for all our dry, damaged skin, and eczema pals. This works to strengthen the skin’s moisture barrier. It’s SO soft. You won’t believe it’s \\*not\\* butter.\n* Power Players in Like Butter are:  - Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract: Anti microbial and anti inflammatory (notice a theme here with our ingredients?  - Madecassoside: Accelerates wound healing. Assists in collagen and fibronectin production which helps the skin’s barrier.\n* \\- Colloidal Oatmeal: soothes itching and irritation. Also anti inflammatory!  - Chinese Rhubarb Root: Antimicrobial and also helps to decrease the levels of hyperactive immune cells that can trigger eczema flare ups.\n* \\- Ginseng Root: Anti inflammatory so it’ll bring down edema (swelling) from eczema. Assists with itchiness.  - Turmeric: Shortens wound healing time (for our pals who itch to the point of bleeding!) and reduces inflammation.\"\n\n**\"Faded and Like Butter launch on 8/7 at 9:00 AM EST! Faded will be $36 and Like Butter is $32. You can grab the bundle for $56!** People with skin conditions are 2-6 times more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety, **so we now and forever will donate 1% of profits to mental health orgs like Black Girl Therapy, Fearless Femmes, Sad Girls Club, + the Jed Foundation**. We’ve already donate $10K!\" (My Topicals Twitter)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do ya'll think about the brand/ingredients? They seem like solid products with an amazing cocktail of ingredients.",

What started off being a rather negative review about the Peach & Lily Skin Shield Blurring Primer has now become a review about me lol! Let’s get into it…\n\nThe Skin Shield Blurring Primer is a product that had me a little confused when it was announced last month. A primer product from Peach & Lily just didn’t seem in line with the brand’s product launches up to that point.\n\nBut, the marketing and product description sold me on this product’s ability to be used without makeup while still having a great benefit/impact to the skin. So...I went for it.\n\nEven though the Skin Shield Blurring Primer has a thin, lightweight, and creamy consistency...it is to be used after sunscreen. Peach & Lily uses their patented VoluSmooth complex in this primer which is said to be a natural alternative to silicone. \n\nAside from the VoluSmooth, this product contains centella asiatica, aloe leaf extract, and ceramides. There are quite a few fruit extracts as well for a boost of antioxidants (aka a great pairing with sunscreen).\n\nMy first impressions of this product weren’t that great. I filmed my first use of the Skin Shield Blurring Primer for social media and found it hard to mask my slight disappointment. I wanted to give the product a fair shot/proper time in my routine.\n\nBeing a cosmetic product intending to fall more on the makeup/skin blurring side of things...I expected to see a difference in my skin in terms of pore masking and tone evening pretty much immediately. However, my skin honestly looked the same...maybe (just maybe) a slightly different finish than what my sunscreen had already provided.\n\nAnother pain point was that the bottle cap started cracking and splintering pretty much from day one. It wasn’t a huge issue as it didn’t impact the product inside...but it was just kind of a bummer to see from the brand (and I’d hate to step on one of the plastic shards).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rt1p4lboolj51.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f4007f2e7a0f85366c19b8fd69add876e96644c6\n\nThe serum/primer itself also looks a bit odd in that it separates fairly drastically as it’s being dispensed. Certain bits are creamy while others are totally clear/watery. I’m not sure if this inconsistency impacts the result, but the Skin Shield Blurring Primer just doesn’t look or feel...finished. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y8gf8y0polj51.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48c0975832ca5b32790023cc4cd05692f2937953\n\nAs for how makeup applies over it or the end result with a full makeup application...I can’t speak to that because I do not wear makeup. Which is why I think it was a mistake for me to even give this product a try. \n\nI love sharing my thoughts on skincare products, trying new things, and finding items that really work for my skin. But adding this extra step into my routine where I had not had something before seemed a little excessive in the long-run. Especially for a product that didn’t seem to be doing much of anything.\n\nSure, there are some soothing and antioxidant ingredients in the formula...but I have to think they would have a hard time getting through sunscreen/other products to do their work. At that point, I should just stick to an actual serum that provides what I need.\n\nSo in the end...this might be the primer/serum hybrid that all makeup wearers have been waiting for. That just isn’t me and I don’t think I see the value of this product in my current routine/lifestyle. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Water (Aqua), C13-15 Alkane, Diethylhexyl Carbonate, Dipropylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-3 Polyricinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin) Isododecane, Synthetic Beeswax, Mica, Sodium Chloride, Myrciaria Dubia Fruit (Camu Camu) Extract, Bambusa (Bamboo) Textilis Stem Extract, Arctium Lappa (Burdock) Root Extract, Morus Alba (Mulberry) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassic Acid, Phytosphingosine, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Fragaria Vesca (Strawberry) Leaf Extract, Ceramide Np, Ceramide Ns, Ceramide As, Panthenol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Asiaticoside, Tocopheryl Acetate, Butylene Glycol, Cholesterol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Disteardimonium Hectorite, 1,2-Hexanediol, Asiatic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Phosphoric Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ceramide Ap, Propylene Carbonate, Ubiquinone, Microcrystalline Wax, Propylene Glycol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Ceramide Eop\n\nWhere To Buy (Peach & Lily $34.00 USD): [https://www.peachandlily.com/products/skin-shield-blurring-primer](https://www.peachandlily.com/products/skin-shield-blurring-primer)",

        "body": "What a weird product. I personally would never use anything containing butters/oils/waxes over my sunscreen for fear of dissolving it- I mean that’s how oil cleansers effectively remove sunscreen anyway, right? Same reason I don’t use any makeup with oil/wax over my sunscreen.\n\nBesides, I don’t know why you would combine the serum/primer step in the first place. If you want actives to do work you probably want them closer to your skin, and I feel like so many AB sunscreens already serve as a sort of primer. This seems like it’s trying to replace two products and probably not being 100% successful in replacing either. \n\nI don’t get the point of a natural alternative to silicone, either. What’s the point? It’s not as if the myriad forms of silicone are dangerous or ineffective. I mean they might as well just say silicone-free, because many people don’t enjoy the feel of silicone based primers. But saying you have a natural alternative to silicone with no further explanation is tantamount to saying instead of silicone we included other ingredients- a pointless statement, truly.",

I purchased the full sized bottle about 7 months ago and just ran out.\n\n*Ingredients:* As you'll see in the full list above, licorice root water is the main draw. After a host of emulsifiers, then comes other floral extracts including rhubarb, rose, camellia, green tea, and citrus, some of which [can be irritants](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/sensitive-skin/how-sensitizing-ingredients-hurt-skin.html).\n\nThis toner is a cleansing toner with a reported pH of 5.5 (I didn't test it myself).\n\n*Texture and scent:* The liquid is very light brown in color and watery (duh, the first ingredient is water). I applied with cotton pads, because I'm a weirdo who enjoys seeing what junk came off/out of my skin. It is very lightly fragranced, and the fragrance doesn't hang around after applying. I found it to dissipate quickly.\n\n*Packaging:* The toner comes in a classic, plastic cylindrical bottle with a screw-on, flip-top cap. The label looks nice and has a matte finish, but the plastic feels cheap. The flip-top cap broke within a couple of months.\n\n*Experience:* This product was excellent for my normal but acne prone skin. It really helped to even my skin tone and never left me feeling tight or dry, despite being a cleansing toner. I love that it is pH balancing, setting the rest of my routine up for success! I use it in the evenings after cleansing and exfoliating, before applying serum. It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave a residue on the skin, so is easily layered. After I saw that it had sold out on Soko Glam, I repurchased a back-up bottle as soon as it was available again. That's how much I <3 it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** This pH balancing, cleansing toner worked well for my normal/acne prone skin, helping to brighten and even my skin tone and remove any left-over ickiness from cleansing before carrying on with the rest of my routine. I find it to be well-priced for the volume and results it produced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Rating:** 9/10 - I wish the packaging was a bit sturdier, and would need to test the pH for myself before giving a full 10/10!\n\n*\\*Disclaimer: This is my first cleansing toner, so if you've tried another that you like, please share so we can compare!*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erphhlqk1a921.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=110c7115eeab161e439e13f9ecae28e24e4ae2e0",

    "body": "Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser\n\nIt’s hard to get excited about a cleanser. Some products will offer a slight uptick of hydration, others may provide a nice softening effect. But for the most part, I have found most of the cleansers I have used to fall into two simple categories...low pH and high pH (the latter being something I avoid). That’s really what I look for over anything else.\n\nOf course, there have been cleansers that have stood out to me by offering a bit more. My first love was the D’Alba Pidemont Peptide No-Sebum Cleanser which helped clear excess oil and sebum (it was my 2018 pick of the year). Others from brands like Peach & Lily, Solved Skincare, Make P:rem, and Rovectin helped to soothe my skin. And a few others just smelled good LOL. Glow Recipe, Sulwhasoo, and The Lotus offer products that added a sensorial experience to my cleansing step.\n\nThe Soko Glam Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser takes some of the qualities I mentioned above and takes things a step further.\n\nThis cream/gel hybrid cleanser impressed me pretty much from the initial application. The consistency is similar to other thick “sticky style” cleansers like the Then I Met You Soothing Tea Cleansing Gel and the Krave Beauty Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser. But, there is a visible cloudy/creamy-ness to this product that makes it look a bit more intriguing.\n\nOne of the featured ingredients here is Green Tea Leaf Powder...which I love in the Inward Agas ACue Herbal Mask. Here though, they aren’t as concentrated and really just offer a pleasant appearance (at least for me).\n\nOther ingredients in the A New Leaf Cream Cleanser include Mugwort Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, and Celery Stem Extract.\n\nAside from the look of this product...the feel is even more impressive. Honestly, the thick/rich later that can be had from this cleanser is awesome. It’s been rare (in my experience) to get a foam so dense from a pH balanced product. Few others I have used make this happen but it’s a lovely surprise when it does.\n\nI had no issue taking my time massaging the lovely lather in...sometimes bringing the product down to my neck/chest just to enjoy the experience. A little bit goes a really long way here though. The smallest dollop/pea sized amount is sufficient for the whole face.\n\nOnce rinsed, the Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser leaves behind thoroughly cleansed skin...without being at all stripping. The lack of fragrance gives this product a “plain soap” scent that had me worried about the cleanser’s intensity...but that turned out to be a non-issue.\n\nIn addition to general cleansing, this product also delivered on its ability to calm/soothe the skin. The relatively high concentration of mugwort...while only on the skin for a short time...seems to pull through and reduce redness/irritation. Because of this, I found myself feeling comfortable in grabbing this product for not only my AM and PM routine...but also as a stand in for cleansing wipes after a workout or day spent hiking. \n\nAfter just about a month with the Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser...I am left feeling super impressed. To me, I see the Good Skin Days line as an excellent entry point into not only Soko Glam but K-Beauty in general (I’ll have my review for the moisturizer out very soon). The Prime Time Cleansing Toner wasn’t my cup of tea...but I know others will love it (some have already professed their love on the Soko Glam site).\n\nThis cleanser totally plays into that by offering a gentle/approachable use, awesomely dense lather, and a pretty great value. I am kind of a cleanser junkie so I’ll be continuing to test other products...but the Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser will be making it into several christmas gift bags for friends and family!\n\nFull Ingredients List: Aqua (Water, Eau), Glycerin, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Acrylates Copolymer, Artemisia Capillaris Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Powder, Apium Graveolens (Celery) Stem Extract, Coptis Japonica Extract, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder, Brassica Oleracea Acephala Leaf Extract, Cichorium Intybus (Chicory) Leaf Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Citric Acid, Potassium Cocoate, Sodium Chloride, Hydroxyacetophenone, Dipropylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Gardenia Florida Fruit Extract, Maltodextrin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\nWhere To Buy (Soko Glam $16.00 USD): [https://sokoglam.com/collections/water-based-cleansers/products/good-skin-days-a-new-leaf-cream-cleanser](https://sokoglam.com/collections/water-based-cleansers/products/good-skin-days-a-new-leaf-cream-cleanser) \n\nPS: I have been incorporating the Foreo Luna 3 into my routine for a little over a week, and I want to include a little blurb at the end of each cleanser review to talk about how they played together. As for the Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser...it’s not something I would use with the Foreo.\n\nThe little bits of green tea (while pleasing to look at and have on the skin) tend to get caught in the little silicone touch points of the Foreo. I found myself taking just as much time picking/rinsing out the little pieces as I did actually cleansing my face lol! It ended up being kind of a hassle to the point that I set my Foreo aside for the last few days of this review.\n\nNow that I have finished my “testing time” with the Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser...I will be using what I have left to either decant into smaller bottles for friends or just as a body wash. I really want to bring the Foreo back into the fold and for that to happen I’ll need to switch to a different product. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oct7ps65u9j51.jpg?width=5472&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b996a5e309d78985bea879ea4ac020333c26410",

It made my skin look flawless and I even used it on my bare face!!! And it paired so well with their glass skin veil mist!!! Anyway, anyone have a good dupe or primer that was similar to this?

I wished they'd rather save the cost of the book & work on reducing the price of their products.\n\n\nTalking about their Sunscreen, it's truly Lightweight, blends easily without leaving any white cast. It leaves a matte finish, but It feels slightly heavy post application. As someone suffering from an allergy, I've a tendency to rub my eyes and when I do that when I've applied the sunscreen to my face, it stings my eyes a lot.\n.\n\nThe finish of the screen felt like it's suitable for all types of skin, be it dry or oily. It claims to help acne prone skin & pores, which might be true coz it's non-comedogenic.\n\n\nThe problem I have is their packaging. It looks fancy but it's inconvenient to use the entire product. It's neither airless nor can be cut so it's a struggle when you're about to finish the product. \n\n\n\n🔸**WRP:** WRP, when on offer.\n\n \n\n☑️**Will I Recommend:** Definitely yes. This might be the Sunscreen you're looking for. Give this a try.",

Even though it is called a serum...it is to be used at the start of your routine just after cleansing and actives. So, it really is more like a first essence in serum form.\n\nThis lightweight/jelly-like serum features mondo grass, licorice root, honey, walnut seed, lotus, and green tea...as well as other herbal extracts for a formulation that covers a lot of bases. Brightening, soothing, balancing, and antioxidant benefits can all be found here.\n\nAlcohol makes it pretty high on the ingredients list which surprised me initially. But, it makes sense because the main purpose of this serum is to facilitate the absorption of other products in your routine. \n\nMy first few applications of this product left me quite impressed. The Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum absorbs beautifully into the skin without any stickiness or residue. I typically used three pumps of product to gently pat into my skin. Although the alcohol scent is pretty apparent...there is a bit of sweet/hanbang fragrance that comes through.\n\nAfter use I noticed that my skin was looking more bright/illuminated and had a more bouncy look as well. Honestly, I felt like my skin was as close to that “dewy/honey-skin” look than it has ever been before.\n\nHaving said that...I really did not want this to be some kind of placebo or my mind trying to justify the rather high cost of this product. So, after three weeks I pulled the Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum from my routine to see if there would be a difference. It only took a couple of days for me to notice that my layers of toner weren’t sinking in as quickly. Plus, my skin was just lacking that bounce and feeling of deeper hydration (with no other changes to my routine).\n\nSo it seems that this product really does deliver on its promises. My skin has really seen an almost immediate improvement since working the First Care Activating Serum into my routine. But, I still don’t know if I would come back to it. I feel like if I started working in a really nice first treatment essence packed with fermented ingredients (and a bit of alcohol) I might see a similar result...and could probably find something much more affordable per oz.\n\nFor now, I’ll probably finish my bottle up and move back to other more “typical” serums that I have in my stash. If I do end up missing the benefits that I found in the Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum...you may see it pop back up in my routine next year.\n\nFull Ingredients List: Water / Aqua / Eau, Butylene Glycol, Alcohol, Glycerin, Betaine, Peg/Ppg-17/6 Copolymer, Glyceryl Polyme-Thacrylate, Ophiopogon Japonicus Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Peg-60 Hyd-Rogenated Castor Oil, Carbomer, Tromethamine, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Fragrance / Parfum, Honey / Mel / Miel, Juglans Regia (Walnut) Seed Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Dextrin, Lilium Candidum Bulb Extract, Paeonia Albiflora Root Extract, Rehmannia Glutinosa Root Extract, Polygonatum Officinale Rhizome/Root Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Lim-Onene, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Disodium Edta, Phenyl Trimethicone, Chondrus Crispus (Carrageenan), Linalool, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Zizyphus Jujuba Fruit Extract, Natto Gum, Citronellol, Citral, Propylene Glycol, Geraniol, Chlor-Phenesin, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Bht, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Sorbic Acid, Tocopherol\n\nWhere To Buy (Sephora - $84.00 USD - 60ml): [https://www.sephora.com/product/first-care-activating-serum-P448915?skuId=2291102&icid2=products%20grid:p448915:product](https://www.sephora.com/product/first-care-activating-serum-P448915?skuId=2291102&icid2=products%20grid:p448915:product) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rucvd6ywi3x51.jpg?width=3232&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7545190b935f956f295c85796c107ee805edf9dc",

Granted, i used makeup/products pretty much blindly without researching on ingredients, which led to a damaged moisture barrier and contact dermatitis. At the moment my skin is highly sensitized, to the point where i use NOTHING on my skin, just OCM and that's it. Of course that makes my skin dry, tight and uncomfortable, so i mustered courage to dip my toes into some new products which led to.... same shit happening all over again :/\n\nThen, I spent weeks researching on skincare products and ingredients and i decided on Etude House's new Soon Jung line for sensitive skin, and i have an extremely positive first impression of their pH 5.5 toner. Here's a [before after](https://imgur.com/a/NULrW) - the left side depicts Day 0 and the right side depicts Day 2! \n\nIn addition to NOT further breaking me out, i was happy to see that it calms the redness down. The extra icing on the cake is that this toner is so hydrating, it leaves me with a glow and i can use nothing but this (i live in a tropical climate with 100% humidity) and a bit of their moisturiser (from the same line) on dryer parts like undereyes and laugh lines. I layer the toner 3 times during the daytime, and 5 times for night.\n\nNote: Korean toners are not the same as Western ones - they are not astringents! \n\nIngredients here:\n    WATER, PROPANEDIOL, GLYCERIN, BETAINE, PANTHENOL, MADECASSOSIDE, CAMELLIA SINENSIS LEAF EXTRACT, SCUTELLARIA BAICALENSIS ROOT EXTRACT, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, CARBOMER, POLYGLYCERIN-3, DISODIUM EDTA\n\nFor those of you who don't live in Asia, i found it on [Amazon!](https://www.amazon.com/Etude-House-SoonJung-Relief-Toner/dp/B06Y3YV663/ref=sr_1_sc_1_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1510660880&sr=1-1-spell&keywords=etude+house+soon+jung+toner) They have a 80ml and a 180ml - i bought the smaller one to try out first. I will try out their Cica Balm next.\n\n",

Wet. Like I've washed my face with really cool and hydrating water, but it feels damp for a while.\n\nAs per description, it has ingredients that are not just meant to hydrate your skin, but also maintain the pH balance in a way that your skin stays moisturized for a longer period. I can't confirm this as I used the cream in heavy summer (plus I've combination skin). If there's any dry skin user who can confirm this, I'll update your comment here.\n\nIt's definitely better than Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel if we consider its long term benefits, with time I could feel my skin getting healthier and better. So I'll probably purchase it during another heavy discount sale, but it ain't a preference due to the price \n\n**Will I Recommend?** Definitely Yes\n\n**WRP:** No🧟‍♀️\n\n\n\n\n",

My sunscreen also has Tinosorb S and Octocrylene in it, so I don't know if that would make the Avobenzone more stable with mineral compounds or just to UV? Does anyone have any insight on this? I have no idea if anyone would know this, since I don't know what studies have been done with avobenzone, but I figured I would ask!\n\nHere are the ingredients for the mineral powder: SILICA, CORN STARCH MODIFIED, DIMETHICONE/VINYL DIMETHICONE CROSSPOLYMER, CAPRYLIC/CAPRICTRIGLYCERIDE, MICA, METHICONE, MINERALSALTS, CAMELLIA SINENSIS LEAF EXTRACT, MENTHA ARVENSIS LEAF EXTRACT, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, DIMETHICONE, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, ETHYLENE/ACRYLIC ACID COPOLYMER, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, FRAGRANCE\n\nI'm mostly worried about the mineral salts.

    "body": "Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser\n\nIt’s hard to get excited about a cleanser. Some products will offer a slight uptick of hydration, others may provide a nice softening effect. But for the most part, I have found most of the cleansers I have used to fall into two simple categories...low pH and high pH (the latter being something I avoid). That’s really what I look for over anything else.\n\nOf course, there have been cleansers that have stood out to me by offering a bit more. My first love was the D’Alba Pidemont Peptide No-Sebum Cleanser which helped clear excess oil and sebum (it was my 2018 pick of the year). Others from brands like Peach & Lily, Solved Skincare, Make P:rem, and Rovectin helped to soothe my skin. And a few others just smelled good LOL. Glow Recipe, Sulwhasoo, and The Lotus offer products that added a sensorial experience to my cleansing step.\n\nThe Soko Glam Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser takes some of the qualities I mentioned above and takes things a step further.\n\nThis cream/gel hybrid cleanser impressed me pretty much from the initial application. The consistency is similar to other thick “sticky style” cleansers like the Then I Met You Soothing Tea Cleansing Gel and the Krave Beauty Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser. But, there is a visible cloudy/creamy-ness to this product that makes it look a bit more intriguing.\n\nOne of the featured ingredients here is Green Tea Leaf Powder...which I love in the Inward Agas ACue Herbal Mask. Here though, they aren’t as concentrated and really just offer a pleasant appearance (at least for me).\n\nOther ingredients in the A New Leaf Cream Cleanser include Mugwort Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, and Celery Stem Extract.\n\nAside from the look of this product...the feel is even more impressive. Honestly, the thick/rich later that can be had from this cleanser is awesome. It’s been rare (in my experience) to get a foam so dense from a pH balanced product. Few others I have used make this happen but it’s a lovely surprise when it does.\n\nI had no issue taking my time massaging the lovely lather in...sometimes bringing the product down to my neck/chest just to enjoy the experience. A little bit goes a really long way here though. The smallest dollop/pea sized amount is sufficient for the whole face.\n\nOnce rinsed, the Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser leaves behind thoroughly cleansed skin...without being at all stripping. The lack of fragrance gives this product a “plain soap” scent that had me worried about the cleanser’s intensity...but that turned out to be a non-issue.\n\nIn addition to general cleansing, this product also delivered on its ability to calm/soothe the skin. The relatively high concentration of mugwort...while only on the skin for a short time...seems to pull through and reduce redness/irritation. Because of this, I found myself feeling comfortable in grabbing this product for not only my AM and PM routine...but also as a stand in for cleansing wipes after a workout or day spent hiking. \n\nAfter just about a month with the Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser...I am left feeling super impressed. To me, I see the Good Skin Days line as an excellent entry point into not only Soko Glam but K-Beauty in general (I’ll have my review for the moisturizer out very soon). The Prime Time Cleansing Toner wasn’t my cup of tea...but I know others will love it (some have already professed their love on the Soko Glam site).\n\nThis cleanser totally plays into that by offering a gentle/approachable use, awesomely dense lather, and a pretty great value. I am kind of a cleanser junkie so I’ll be continuing to test other products...but the Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser will be making it into several christmas gift bags for friends and family!\n\nFull Ingredients List: Aqua (Water, Eau), Glycerin, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Acrylates Copolymer, Artemisia Capillaris Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Powder, Apium Graveolens (Celery) Stem Extract, Coptis Japonica Extract, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder, Brassica Oleracea Acephala Leaf Extract, Cichorium Intybus (Chicory) Leaf Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Citric Acid, Potassium Cocoate, Sodium Chloride, Hydroxyacetophenone, Dipropylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Gardenia Florida Fruit Extract, Maltodextrin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\nWhere To Buy (Soko Glam $16.00 USD): [https://sokoglam.com/collections/water-based-cleansers/products/good-skin-days-a-new-leaf-cream-cleanser](https://sokoglam.com/collections/water-based-cleansers/products/good-skin-days-a-new-leaf-cream-cleanser) \n\nPS: I have been incorporating the Foreo Luna 3 into my routine for a little over a week, and I want to include a little blurb at the end of each cleanser review to talk about how they played together. As for the Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser...it’s not something I would use with the Foreo.\n\nThe little bits of green tea (while pleasing to look at and have on the skin) tend to get caught in the little silicone touch points of the Foreo. I found myself taking just as much time picking/rinsing out the little pieces as I did actually cleansing my face lol! It ended up being kind of a hassle to the point that I set my Foreo aside for the last few days of this review.\n\nNow that I have finished my “testing time” with the Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser...I will be using what I have left to either decant into smaller bottles for friends or just as a body wash. I really want to bring the Foreo back into the fold and for that to happen I’ll need to switch to a different product. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yzw0rl22u9j51.jpg?width=5472&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2565789b81a630d2d717d68b20722cf3024b939e",

    "body": "**Laneige: Cream Skin Refiner/Toner & Moisturizer**\n\nI have to tell you…this toner has had a hard life in my routine! I picked it up on launch day at Sephora (I want to say back in September or October of 2019…correct me if I’m wrong) and ever since then it just hasn’t been treated kindly.\n\nOf all the “hyped” products in 2019…the Laneige Cream Skin (or Refiner in Korea and other markets) took it to another level. Some products fade away after a few days/a week, but this product…it lingered LOL! At the time I was really into only buying in-store (which I gave up in part due to COVID-19) so I ended up being late to the game. But when I finally found a Sephora that had it in the back room and not yet stocked…I jumped on it. \n\nSo, before I get into how I didn’t show this product ANY love…let’s talk about what it actually is LOL!\n\nWhile its hard to place this product in a specific category or “step”…the best place it falls into is between a nourishing/hydrating toner (like the Klairs Supple Preparation Toner or the Blithe 8 Nourishing Beans Toner) and an emulsion (like the Krave Beauty Oat So Simple Water Cream and the COSRX Oil-Free Birch “whatever LOL” Lotion). But unlike the moisturizers…its very thin and watery. Which I suppose, is the whole draw and awe around this product.\n\nThis milky/watery toner features a relatively short ingredients list compared to other products I have tried from Laneige using Meadowfoam Seed Oil and Green Tea Leaf Extract. The other ingredients in the formula include various hydrators, texturizes, and preservatives. What I was surprised to find is the lack of essential oils, fragrance, and colorants…good on you Laneige for changing things up from the Lip Sleeping Mask and Glowy Balm that I wasn’t a fan of! \n\nNow, about me giving this toner the runaround. I started using this product right away last fall…but after a week or so I decided to move it out of my routine in favor of the Mad Hippie Hydrating Nutrient Mist as part of a brand review. Things didn’t go so well with that product (LOL)…and after month I brought the Cream Skin back into the fold. That change only lasted a couple of weeks before the Then I Met You The Giving Essence came in to play and I felt like I just HAD to use the Birch Milk Refining Toner in conjunction to do that review. So, the Laneige toner was tucked back into my stash a second time.\n\nFinally, after finishing my month/review for the Then I Met You Duo…Cream Skin has been a steady member of my routine a couple of weeks. And, I have to say…I’m not really impressed.\n\nOne of the things that does seems to work for me is using this toner as a stand-in for a super lightweight moisturizer or maybe heavier serum. I also really like the milky/creamy scent.\n\nBut, my skin just has a really hard time playing well with this product overall. After each use…I am usually left with an odd/greasy residue that I am not a fan of. The only way that I have been able to combat this is to make sure I go RIGHT from my essence and get the Laneige Cream Skin on my face as quickly as possible. I usually try to keep my face damp while moving through my skincare routine…but for this product I feel like my skin needs to actually be W-E-T LOL! From there, I can take my time to pat it down until the result is much less greasy feeling. \n\nIt might just be that my combination skin type isn’t a match for this product. It’s marketed towards normal to dry skin…but for the most part I don’t really pay too much attention to those suggestions. Especially since my skin fluctuates between “styles”. Aside from the odd residue or layer left behind by this product…I find that the moisturizer or sunscreen I do apply over top has a harder time sinking in or applying evenly (which is more of a concern with the sunscreen).\n\nI really wanted to like this product because it got sooo much hype and positive feedback. I think this one might just be better suited to those with drier skin or who need each step in their routine to have some kind of emollient/occlusive ingredient.\n\nWhen applied properly (for me), the Laneige Cream Skin dose feel nice/nourishing and I could see myself being able to skip my serum step here and there or maybe even pass on a daytime moisturizer and going right to sunscreen. But personally…I tend to go for toners that are watery, hydrating, and layer-able. Even within that category there are brands out there that mange to include things like Jojoba Oil and Shea Butter into a really thin and easy to layer toner. Look to the Then I Met You Birch Milk Refining Toner as a great example.\n\nThese last two weeks were enough for me to call it quits with the Laneige Cream Skin. I’ll be saving what’s left of my bottle for a dry skin friend/family member to try! As far as a recommendation goes…those with dry skin or skin that really soak up heavier products will have better luck with this than I did. If you can snag a sample from somewhere that might be the best plan of attack (at least until we can get back into Sephora stores and test in person). \n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polyglyceryl- 10 Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Caprylate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Propanediol, Disodium Edta, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Tocopherol\n\nWhere To Buy (Sephora $33.00 USD): [https://www.sephora.com/product/cream-skin-toner-moisturizer-P446930](https://www.sephora.com/product/cream-skin-toner-moisturizer-P446930)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q3a59x3gc1u41.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77eb6f0aa3501cafff9b241a72b00f0027ba7be6",

What started off being a rather negative review about the Peach & Lily Skin Shield Blurring Primer has now become a review about me lol! Let’s get into it…\n\nThe Skin Shield Blurring Primer is a product that had me a little confused when it was announced last month. A primer product from Peach & Lily just didn’t seem in line with the brand’s product launches up to that point.\n\nBut, the marketing and product description sold me on this product’s ability to be used without makeup while still having a great benefit/impact to the skin. So...I went for it.\n\nEven though the Skin Shield Blurring Primer has a thin, lightweight, and creamy consistency...it is to be used after sunscreen. Peach & Lily uses their patented VoluSmooth complex in this primer which is said to be a natural alternative to silicone. \n\nAside from the VoluSmooth, this product contains centella asiatica, aloe leaf extract, and ceramides. There are quite a few fruit extracts as well for a boost of antioxidants (aka a great pairing with sunscreen).\n\nMy first impressions of this product weren’t that great. I filmed my first use of the Skin Shield Blurring Primer for social media and found it hard to mask my slight disappointment. I wanted to give the product a fair shot/proper time in my routine.\n\nBeing a cosmetic product intending to fall more on the makeup/skin blurring side of things...I expected to see a difference in my skin in terms of pore masking and tone evening pretty much immediately. However, my skin honestly looked the same...maybe (just maybe) a slightly different finish than what my sunscreen had already provided.\n\nAnother pain point was that the bottle cap started cracking and splintering pretty much from day one. It wasn’t a huge issue as it didn’t impact the product inside...but it was just kind of a bummer to see from the brand (and I’d hate to step on one of the plastic shards).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/glrjk9kholj51.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c1e4e9ced2967f94e30c59552f27823a3ce6c0db\n\nThe serum/primer itself also looks a bit odd in that it separates fairly drastically as it’s being dispensed. Certain bits are creamy while others are totally clear/watery. I’m not sure if this inconsistency impacts the result, but the Skin Shield Blurring Primer just doesn’t look or feel...finished. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hliiy1aiolj51.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e0d9445538f4b5a9af0ec2a41644752d9868bab5\n\nAs for how makeup applies over it or the end result with a full makeup application...I can’t speak to that because I do not wear makeup. Which is why I think it was a mistake for me to even give this product a try. \n\nI love sharing my thoughts on skincare products, trying new things, and finding items that really work for my skin. But adding this extra step into my routine where I had not had something before seemed a little excessive in the long-run. Especially for a product that didn’t seem to be doing much of anything.\n\nSure, there are some soothing and antioxidant ingredients in the formula...but I have to think they would have a hard time getting through sunscreen/other products to do their work. At that point, I should just stick to an actual serum that provides what I need.\n\nSo in the end...this might be the primer/serum hybrid that all makeup wearers have been waiting for. That just isn’t me and I don’t think I see the value of this product in my current routine/lifestyle. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Water (Aqua), C13-15 Alkane, Diethylhexyl Carbonate, Dipropylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-3 Polyricinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin) Isododecane, Synthetic Beeswax, Mica, Sodium Chloride, Myrciaria Dubia Fruit (Camu Camu) Extract, Bambusa (Bamboo) Textilis Stem Extract, Arctium Lappa (Burdock) Root Extract, Morus Alba (Mulberry) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassic Acid, Phytosphingosine, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Fragaria Vesca (Strawberry) Leaf Extract, Ceramide Np, Ceramide Ns, Ceramide As, Panthenol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Asiaticoside, Tocopheryl Acetate, Butylene Glycol, Cholesterol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Disteardimonium Hectorite, 1,2-Hexanediol, Asiatic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Phosphoric Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ceramide Ap, Propylene Carbonate, Ubiquinone, Microcrystalline Wax, Propylene Glycol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Ceramide Eop\n\nWhere To Buy (Peach & Lily $34.00 USD): [https://www.peachandlily.com/products/skin-shield-blurring-primer](https://www.peachandlily.com/products/skin-shield-blurring-primer)",

I will say though I think after this I need to give up on trying primers that are clearly geared towards dry skin or those that dig a glowy vibe. I think you’ll really like this primer if you want a natural glow without glimmer or mica  or any sparkles. That said, I genuinely don’t understand why they advertised this as a blurring primer. It doesn’t blur; if anything, one could argue that the glow emphasizes pores. You know, you’d think they’d use this opportunity to bank on the popularity of their glass skin serum by calling this their glass skin primer! But as it stands, this just isn’t the primer for me.",

    "body": "Peach & Lily - Pure Peach Retinoic Eye Cream\n\nAnother eye cream review...from someone that should not be reviewing eye creams.\n\nReally though, I need to stop buying eye specific skincare and I think the Peach & Lily Pure Peach Retinoic Eye Cream will be the last one (at least for a good long while).\n\nI’m lucky enough that I don’t (yet) tackle many of the issues that eye products are meant to address. I’m not seeing any lines or wrinkles in that area really...and the slight darkness/bagginess I have has been there since I was a tiny human.\n\nSo, I fear that any amazing benefits or results might be a bit lost on me. At least that seems to be the trend since no eye product I have tried has truly wowed me.\n\nWhat I do like about the Pure Peach Retinoic Eye Cream is that it features so many ingredients I love in a product that is lightweight and absorbs beautifully. Niacinamide, ginseng, bamboo, and several antioxidant rich greens are here.\n\nAlso, Bakuchiol is in the formulation which is said to be a more “natural” and gentle alternative to Retinol. From what I’ve read and heard from skincare professionals...we need more studies/research before making that claim with confidence.\n\nMy experience with this product is that it hydrates my eye area really well and plays nicely with the other products in my routine. That in addition to the nice dose of antioxidants makes this a fine product for me...I just can’t say for certain that it is doing much more than that.\n\nA little bit goes a really long way here so I’ll probably have this bottle in my routine for quite some time. But, I don't think it is something I would come back to...I guess the same could be said for all eye products (for now).\n\nLike I said...not the best person to be reviewing this one lol!\n\nFull Ingredients List: Water, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Bambusa (Bamboo) Textilis Stem Extract, Arctium Lappa (Burdock) Root Extract, Morus Alba (Mulberry) Leaf Extract, Prunus Persica (Peach) Fruit Extract, Bakuchiol, Rosa Rubiginosa Seed Oil, Daucus Carota (Carrot) Sativa Root Water, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Spinacia Oleracea (Spinach) Leaf Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Acetyl Octapeptide-3, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Extract, Apium Graveolens (Celery) Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Sorbitan Olivate, Lactuca Scariola Sativa (Lettuce) Leaf Extract, Ceramide Np, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ferulic Acid, Tocopherol, Panthenol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Adenosine, Cetearyl Olivate, Hydrogenated Rapeseed Alcohol, Betaine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyglyceryl-4 Oleate, Glyceryl Olivate, Glyceryl Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Asparagus Officinalis Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Phosphoric Acid, Corallina Officinalis Extract\n\nWhere To Buy (Peach & Lily - $42.00 USD - 20ml): [https://www.peachandlily.com/products/pure-peach-retinoic-eye-cream](https://www.peachandlily.com/products/pure-peach-retinoic-eye-cream)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nsx4ky6ob6p51.jpg?width=1098&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=286e4316987d70bf7911feacbd7c512e74369313",

I haven’t really been buying them, so my stash of 400+ is now down to about 12.\n\nThe ones that I have left are ones that I assumed would be all stars. End on a good note you know lol!\n\nThe By Wishtrend Natural Vitamin 21.5% Enhancing Sheet Mask seemed like a potentially great mask as it features Sea Buckthorn Water, Green Tea Leaf Extract, and Panthenol.\n\nThis light/watery essence focuses on hydration, calming, and antioxidant power.\n\nSea Buckthorn Water is a great antioxidant that I have used in the past...it’s a great complement to vitamin c to protect the skin from environmental stressors. \n\nAfter 20 minutes of use my skin was left feeling very hydrated, cool, and slightly brightened. \n\nBut, the mask material was a little underwhelming. While it is made of a “classic” cotton material...I found it to be a bit stiff and hard to keep adhere to my chin/eye area.\n\nEven though I was generally happy with the result, the less than ideal fit makes this one I would pass on in the future.\n\nFull Ingredients List: Water, Butylene Glycol, Hippophae Rhamnoides Water, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Betaine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Allantoin, Panthenol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nWhere To Buy (Wistrend Site - $3.00 USD): [https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/natural-vitamin-21-5-enhancing-sheet-mask/](https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/natural-vitamin-21-5-enhancing-sheet-mask/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/30zttq9u68h51.jpg?width=2316&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fedfa3886e995b0962ad86d2f6d8b135041f577c",

Fortunately, the ingredients are right on the package, so I'll list them here--there are a couple of red flags for the super-sensitive, but again, $3.33 for a box of ten at RRS!!!!!\n\nIngredients: Water, glycerin, butylene glycol, alcohol, xantham gum, PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil, sodium hyaluronate, panax ginseng root extract, panthenol, methylparaben, phenoxyethanol, sodium citrate, disodium EDTA, allantoin, hydrolyzed collagen, portulaca oleracea extract, witch hazel extract, camellia sinensis leaf extract, snail secretion filtrate, honey extract, ubiquinone, dipotassium glycyrrhizate, fragrance.\n\nSo not the best ingredient list for everyone, but far and away not the worst.  Again, a full 23ml of essence in each mask, substantial but soft and pliable mask material, and it really does smell very luxurious.  It's also very gentle (for me) on my skin, and **did I mention they're $3.33 for a pack of 10 on RRS???**\n\nThese masks are truly a hidden gem, and I will probably get every variety they make in my next haul!\n\nEdit: Holy crap, you guys.  I took this off after 40 minutes, and I look.....AMAZING!  My skin is radiant, fat, and SUUUPER calm.  I used the extra essence on my chest, and swear to snail, if you  put me in a corset right now, I could stop or start a war.  Maybe start one then stop it five minutes later, my bosom is so luminous.  I also would seriously consider buying this scent as a perfume, it's that pleasant.  For reference, I have combo/oily aging skin with PIH and--touch wood--no allergies or reactions so far.",
