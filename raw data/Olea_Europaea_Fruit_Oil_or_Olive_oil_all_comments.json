    "body": "Edit: A lot of people are asking about cooking time. I didn’t include that because it’s very subjective. I like the florets browned and the stems crunchy. 15 minutes at 400 degrees is a good guess for that, but if you like softer veggies and less browning you might want to decrease the temp to 350-375 and go a little longer. The stems won’t have as much “bite” that way.\n\nThat said, you’ll want to check in on it and see for yourself. I use color more than time to determine doneness.",

Check (and turn) them, because it can be easy to burn the whole batch. And  be aware the quantity will shrink a lot. Which can help you eat more veggies but might make the presentation look meager.\n\nSimmering vegetables in with your slow-cooker stew will keep the vitamins because you're eating the liquid.  \n\nMicrowaving in a covered container with only the drops of rinse water clinging to them is a quick and healthy method for asparagus (reverse half the stalks for even cooking) as well as cut broccoli, or brussels sprouts, if you like a bright green color and the original flavor.  Roasted vegetables all get that char flavor instead, which is nice for veggies you don't like. \n\nA tip for cooking for kids: rather than hide the veggies,  leave the pieces large enough to distinguish.  Have at least 2 kinds. They can choose one veg to reject, only tasting one piece,  and the other to eat a full helping of. You can model this behavior yourself, if you want.",

Obviously we'd heard that Naples is pizza mecca and read that Gino Sorbillo was considered by many as the best. We had already had pizza in Naples, and it was amazing so my expectations were high.  We walked down Via dei Tribunali with hundreds of tourists and locals dodging motorbikes and the occasional taxi squeezing its way through the foot traffic on the black basalt cobblestone roads that Roman slaves paved around two thousand years ago.  We found a mass of 50-60 people jostling for position under the awning to give their name and party size to the host.  After making sure he heard me I squeezed back out of the crowd and joined my wife and kids at the tiny bar across the road.  We enjoyed an Aperol spritz and cups of peanuts while we waited to hear our mispronounced name called out in barely audible italian.  \n\nThe wait really wasn't too bad (maybe 40 minutes) and somehow it was pretty fun and exciting waiting to be called up. With our name called we moved up and were taken to our table.  I really don't think I can oversell this.  We ate the most delicious pizza ever.  It was seriously next level and its very own unique style. The dough, the crust, thin chewy bread with just the perfect charr and texture, the cheese, the tomatoes, the meats, were all perfect.  What made it even more amazing is that we ordered like three pizzas,a bottle of wine, and cokes for the kids and it was only around $40USD total.  I'm pretty sure we had a margherita, diavola, and another with mortadella and basil.  I don't think a week has gone by in the past year and half that someone doesn't bring up how awesome Neapolitan pizza is.\n\nWe had plenty more pizza across Italy that summer and lots of it was REALLY good but that night will always be one of my favorite memories.",

The food's popularity saw a notable boost after 1789 with Thomas Jefferson's purchase of a waffle iron in France.[1][3] In the early 1800s, hotels and resorts outside Philadelphia served waffles with fried catfish. Such establishments also served other dishes like fried chicken, which gradually became the meat of choice due to catfish's limited, seasonal availability.[4] Waffles served with chicken and gravy were noted as a common Sunday dish among the Pennsylvania Dutch by the 1860s.[4] A 1901 memoir recalled a tavern in East Liberty, Pennsylvania, well known for \"suppers of spring chickens and waffles.\"[5] By the end of the 19th century, the dish was a symbol of Pennsylvania Dutch Country, brought on in part by its association with tourism.[4]\n\nWell fuck he inadvertently led to the invention of an American classic.

In 1784 Thomas Jefferson took James Hemings with him when he went to Paris as Minister of France, as he wanted the young man, then 19, trained as a chef. While they were in France, Jefferson paid Hemings a wage of four dollars per month.  \n\n>He paid personally to learn the language from a French tutor. He served his creations to the European aristocrats, writers and scientists whom Jefferson invited to dinner.\n\n>In Paris, Jefferson became concerned that Hemings might learn that he could be free when France had abolished slavery in 1789. While fearful of him seeking his freedom, they returned to America where he continued to pay James wages to work as a chef, as Pennsylvania did not allow slavery.\"\n\nWhat the fuck! I didn't know there were states that didn't allow slavery.\n\n>\"For two years, Hemings trained his younger brother Peter, also born into slavery, as chef at Monticello, and finally gained his freedom in 1796. He spoke French and English and was literate; his handwritten inventory of kitchen supplies made before he left Monticello is held by the Library of Congress. He also left recipes and other writings. After traveling to Europe, Hemings eventually returned to the United States, where he found work as a cook in Philadelphia.\n\n>In 1801, Jefferson offered Hemings a position at the White House, which the young man refused. Hemings returned briefly to Monticello to work in the kitchen. After a month and a half, Jefferson paid him thirty dollars, and Hemings left. Later, while employed as a cook in a tavern in Baltimore, he committed suicide, at age 36.\"",

Hers was the most rigorous attempt ever made, but ultimately she concluded that the project of identifying a Mediterranean diet was an “impossible enterprise, since data are lacking, incomplete, or too aggregated.” The all-embracing term “Mediterranean diet,” “while very attractive,” she wrote, “should not be used in scientific literature, until its composition, both in foods, nutrients and non-nutrients, is more clearly defined.”'\n\nExcerpt From: Nina Teicholz. “The Big Fat Surprise.”",

        "body": "Eating a Mediterranean diet that is rich in fish, vegetables and olive oil may protect your brain from protein build up and shrinkage that can lead to Alzheimer’s disease, according to a new study. The research is published in the May 5, 2021, online issue of Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. The findings applied to people with moderate to severe strokes, not people with mild strokes.\n\nThe study looked at abnormal proteins called amyloid and tau. Amyloid is a protein that forms into plaques, while tau is a protein that forms into tangles. Both are found in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease but may also be found in the brains of older people with normal cognition.\n\nThe Mediterranean diet includes high intake of vegetables, legumes, fruits, cereals, fish and monounsaturated fatty acids such as olive oil, and low intake of saturated fatty acids, dairy products and meat.\n\n“Our study suggests that eating a diet that’s high in unsaturated fats, fish, fruits and vegetables, and low in dairy and red meat may actually protect your brain from the protein build-up that can lead to memory loss and dementia,” said study author Tommaso Ballarini, Ph.D., of the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) in Bonn, Germany. “These results add to the body of evidence that show what you eat may influence your memory skills later on.”\n\nThe study looked at 512 people. Of those, 169 were cognitively normal, while 343 were identified as being at higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nResearchers looked at how closely people followed the Mediterranean diet based on their answers to a questionnaire asking how much they ate of 148 items over the previous month. People who often ate healthy foods typical of the Mediterranean diet, like fish, vegetables and fruit, and only occasionally ate foods non-typical of the Mediterranean diet, like red meat, received the highest scores, for a maximum score of nine.\n\nCognitive skills were assessed with an extensive test set for Alzheimer’s disease progression that looked at five different functions, including language, memory and executive function. All the participants had brain scans to determine their brain volume. In addition, the spinal fluid of 226 was tested for amyloid and tau protein biomarkers.\n\nResearchers then looked at how closely someone followed the Mediterranean diet, and the relationship to both their brain volume, tau and amyloid biomarkers, and cognitive skills.\n\nAfter adjusting for factors like age, sex and education, researchers found that in the area of the brain most closely associated with Alzheimer’s disease, every point lower people scored on the Mediterranean diet scale was equal to almost one year of brain aging.\n\nhttps://n.neurology.org/content/early/2021/05/04/WNL.0000000000012067",

    "body": "Last Saturday, I woke up in the middle of the night. No big deal, but I immediately noticed something wrong with my left ear. I had no pain, but every few seconds I would hear a loud crackling noise in my ear. I have experienced an earwax blocking before, but I had never heard this sound before. This made me concerned, so I tried googling my symptoms, but to no avail.  \"It's probably just an earwax blockage, right?\", I think to myself. I stuffed a cotton pad with olive oil in my ear to soften the earwax and returned to bed. After putting the cotton pad in my ear, the crackling sound stopped, but it was replaced with some soft ticking sounds. It made it hard to fall asleep, but eventually, I managed to drift off\n\nThe next morning, the noises in my left ear had stopped. Great, but there was still wax in my ear, because I could hear it move when I put pressure on my ears. Over the course of the next days, I tried to remove the ear wax myself. I put water in my ear, more cotton pads with olive oil and I even tried to get it out with tweezers (I know I shouldn't have done that, but I was impatient and really wanted to just get the earwax out and be done with it). All these methods failed to get the earwax out, until today.\n\nI was once again stupidly poking around with tweezers inside my ear, when I finally managed to grab the earwax. Excited, I took it out and wanted to look at what my ear had just birthed. To my horror, the blockage in my left ear was not caused by earwax, but it was caused by what looked like a kind of tiny moth. This creature had somehow managed to climb into my ear at 2 a.m., caused me to wake up and couldn't leave my ear because of the cotton pad I had stuffed inside.\n\nI am still trying to process that I had a dead moth in my ear for half a week.\n\n\nEdit: Thank you for the awards and for all of your own ear bug horror stories in the comments! It makes me feel less unfortunate to have experienced this. Also, to answer a common question: I posted a picture of the moth in the comments and people have been asking how big it was. It looks pretty big in the picture, but it was only around a centimeter big.\n\n\n\nTL;DR I thought I had an earwax blockage, tried removing it on my own, turned out it was a moth trying to make my ear its home or something.",

That's also often why it's cheaper. \n\nThis is especially true of \"extra light\" olive oil.\n\nBasically, you're pretty likely to be cooking with other oils.

The animal modeling alone should tell you that this isn't indicative of an extrapolated human effect. Use your common sense to tell you that maybe long chain fats like olive oil are good for you, not murine genetics.**\n\n\n**Edit 2: Jesus, gold?? Thanks, internet strangers, for being so rad.**\n\n\nThe mouse model they used, it's called the 3xTg-AD mouse, the Triple Transgenic, and it's named as such because it has three main mutations that are associated with AD (big surprise there). \n\nIt recapitulates all three of the AD hallmarks. The P301L mutation increases the induction of NFTs, or neurofibrillary tangles, which are the tau pathology, by 7 times. The APPSwe mutation increases the total amount of ABeta by essentially increasing the power of Beta-Secretase, which is one of the two enzymes that cuts ABeta from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). The third mutation is a Psen1 (M146V/-) Knock-In, which is a heterozygous induction that essentially accounts for synaptic loss, decrease in LTP between the CA3 and CA1 regions of the hippocampus, and accelerated neurodegeneration. \n\nThese mice are viable (which is good because presenilin knock- *out* mice often do not survive past birth), have no gross anatomical abnormalities (again good for viability), and have degeneration in an age-dependent fashion. They also exhibit gliosis, which means there's increased inflammation, also a good sign. There is also synaptic dysfunction *before* plaque deposition (cognitive impairment at 4 months, plaque pathology at 6 months, NFTs at 12 months), which is mostly okay because in humans it's just so variable. \n\nThis sounds like a really whole animal model, and that's correct, it's probably the best we have right now. I've worked with them and these animals are really good for testing drugs on, particularly antibodies that clear plaques. I'm almost certain that most preclinical trials of pharmaceuticals use this model before going to humans. \n\nHuge HOWEVER Moment: these mutations only exist in about 5% of human cases, which should give all of you pause. Yeah, this works as a \"good enough\" model for studying all the pathology, but there's a big difference between sporadic (no isolated genetic connection, except for the ApoE4 risk factor allele) and familial AD (confirmed genetic connection). Some of you may have heard about the Colombian case of familial AD, in a small area called Antioquia: it's the largest genetic tree of AD that involved the Psen1 E280A mutation; it is an extremely aggressive mutation that causes very early onset symptoms, often leaving people unable to care for themselves by the age of 40 (if you want to read more about that, look up Yakeel Quiroz, she's a sweetheart and a gigantic rockstar who works down the street from me). Though the 3xTg model does include a Psen1 mutation, it's mutated in a different spot and works along a different mechanism. \n\nWe're shockingly lacking in a more humanized model for AD. One paper I recently read was about Cynomolgus Macaques, and being able to use non-transgenic animals and still capitulate ABeta pathology. Because their brains and brain chemistry are even more similar to humans than rodents, they should be investigated more. There's a lot of ethical problems behind the use of primates, though (and I've heard from an acquaintance that they're actually a pain in the ass to work with).\n\nOne more tiny thing: rodents have different biochemistry than humans do. I think it was a paper I had to read about MS, that the researchers were trying to induce a specific immune response in their mice but couldn't make it happen because mice have a specific antibody against the antigen they introduced. They physically couldn't induce the symptoms they wanted because the mouse system just won't let it happen. This also should give cause for skepticism, because we're using a species that has an insane number of point differences in the genetic code of all of these proteins and enzymes that we're mutating anyways to make the Tg model. \n\nTL;DR: This is a good paper, but take it with a grain of salt. The animal modeling alone should tell you that this isn't indicative of an extrapolated human effect. Use your common sense to tell you that maybe long chain fats like olive oil are good for you, not murine genetics.",

They simply discuss previous findings in the discussion.\n\nFor the actual research, they have a control diet and then one where they dumped Canola oil into the food. This addition of calories likely explains the weight gain, as discussed in the discussion. It's worth noting they reference previous studies that didn't shownan increase in weight with the addition of Canola oil.\n\nFor Alzheimer's, looking at the actual aggregates, they noted one metric out of 4 that was statistically different compared to the control. Since the control had a different caloric intake with no added oil, I'm not convinced this is caused by the Canola oil. Comparing to an olive oil enriched diet at comparable caloric intake would be more useful for what is being discussed in this post.\n\nThey did observe some behavioral differences, but again, is it the oil or the difference in weight/caloric intake?\n\nIt's not a bad study, but the conclusions people are making in this thread are not supported by the study.\n\nTl;dr this doesn't look at what you think based on this post title",

He must also take an offering of a tenth of an ephah[a] of barley flour on her behalf. He must not pour olive oil on it or put incense on it, because it is a grain offering for jealousy, a reminder-offering to draw attention to wrongdoing.\n\n16 “‘The priest shall bring her and have her stand before the Lord. 17 Then he shall take some holy water in a clay jar and put some dust from the tabernacle floor into the water. 18 After the priest has had the woman stand before the Lord, he shall loosen her hair and place in her hands the reminder-offering, the grain offering for jealousy, while he himself holds the bitter water that brings a curse. 19 Then the priest shall put the woman under oath and say to her, “If no other man has had sexual relations with you and you have not gone astray and become impure while married to your husband, may this bitter water that brings a curse not harm you. 20 But if you have gone astray while married to your husband and you have made yourself impure by having sexual relations with a man other than your husband”— 21 here the priest is to put the woman under this curse—“may the Lord cause you to become a curse[b] among your people when he makes your womb miscarry and your abdomen swell. 22 May this water that brings a curse enter your body so that your abdomen swells or your womb miscarries.”\n\n“‘Then the woman is to say, “Amen. So be it.”\n\n23 “‘The priest is to write these curses on a scroll and then wash them off into the bitter water. 24 He shall make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and this water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering will enter her. 25 The priest is to take from her hands the grain offering for jealousy, wave it before the Lord and bring it to the altar. 26 The priest is then to take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial[c] offering and burn it on the altar; after that, he is to have the woman drink the water. 27 If she has made herself impure and been unfaithful to her husband, this will be the result: When she is made to drink the water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering, it will enter her, her abdomen will swell and her womb will miscarry, and she will become a curse. 28 If, however, the woman has not made herself impure, but is clean, she will be cleared of guilt and will be able to have children.\n\n29 “‘This, then, is the law of jealousy when a woman goes astray and makes herself impure while married to her husband, 30 or when feelings of jealousy come over a man because he suspects his wife. The priest is to have her stand before the Lord and is to apply this entire law to her. 31 The husband will be innocent of any wrongdoing, but the woman will bear the consequences of her sin.’”",

They have covered everything like \"if a stranger throws pork in the community cook pot, do you have to throw out the food\" to \"if a man has two penises, does he have to get both circumcised to convert\" in addition to just about every other aspect of life living by the law of Moses.\n\nThey have most definitely covered the topic of abortion. The first important point is that \"Thou shalt not kill\" has the exception of self defense. No. You don't have to sit there and die if you can't escape or can't defend yourself non-lethally. The council rulings on abortion are as follows:\n\n1) The pregnancy is as water for the first forty days. Abortion is permitted. (Don't look for scientific logic in your religious rulings.)\n\n2) The pregnancy is as the organ of the mother up to the point of viability. Abortion is permitted.\n\n3) If the pregnancy would kill the mother or destroy her ability to have future children, then abortion is permitted as is self defense against lethal attack.\n\nOf course, one of the key differences between Judaism and Evangelical Christianity is that Judaism does not believe that life begins at conception. \n\nSource: [https://www.ncjw.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Judaism-and-Abortion-FINAL.pdf](https://www.ncjw.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Judaism-and-Abortion-FINAL.pdf)\n\nThis is just one of many.

    "body": "Full disclosure, I do eat meat, eggs, and dairy. That being said I'm lazy and prepping and cooking meat takes more work than I'm willing to do a lot of the time, so I've built up a pretty okay repertoire of vegetarian and vegan meals. That's why I volunteered to cook last night for a small family dinner even though I would normally never. Love my mom to bits but if the first step isn't browning a pound of ground beef, she's a little lost on what to make.\n\nThis is all a thing because my brother has recently gotten engaged to a vegan woman. None of us have really spent a lot of time with her due to pandemics and generally having our own lives. The time I have spent with her has been perfectly nice. I'd thought this would also be perfectly nice.\n\nSo I did my best. I put together a dijon vinaigrette salad, pasta tossed with roasted asparagus and cherry tomatoes, and because this is America where carb on carb doesn't have to be just a dream, some bread I fucking vetted to make sure it didn't have milk or eggs in it. She could eat every single thing served.\n\nAt least I thought so. We sit down, plates are dished, she has questions. Whatever, fair enough. I can imagine that she's been in situations where things seemed safe to eat but surprise, there's honey in the salad dressing or something. Reassurances are made, I did my homework but...she has other complaints. You roasted the veggies in olive oil? There's olive oil in the salad dressing? The pasta isn't whole wheat? This is white bread? Yes. Vegan, all of it, but not stripped down to as few calories as possible. Anddddd now she won't eat, just sat there and tore one of the rolls up into tiny pieces until the table was cleared.\n\nMy brother texted me later that night about how fucked up it was that she had to go home hungry, and this is where I may be the asshole. I replied something in the effect of saying I thought I had to cook to accommodate veganism, not an eating disorder. He told me to go fuck myself, which again, fair. Now I imagine a cold war is brewing and mom is inevitably going to get sucked in. I also could have tried to make something healthier, though I don't think what was served was that bad. AITA?",

The oil reduces the density of the lake at the surface so that a certain parameter is reduced below a critical value that determines when the instability occurs. You can find this parameter on page 115 here: http://web.mit.edu/hml/ncfmf/15FI.pdf~~\n\nHow do I know the oil is less dense than water? It floats!﻿\n\nEdit: I want to clear the air and say that I actually liked the video and I appreciate the discussion the video elicited. [I also found a much better source for KH instabilities](https://ceprofs.civil.tamu.edu/ssocolofsky/OCEN677/Downloads/Book/Ch11.pdf) \nFollow the link and look at Eq. 11.36.\nSome of you brought up surface tension as a possible explanation of the phenomenon showed in the video. Eq 11.36 shows that less surface tension implies less stability. Since [oil lowers surface tension of water](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=oil%20lowers%20the%20surface%20tension), I don't think that surface tension accounts for the stabilizing effect here.\nEq 11.36 also shows that a smaller density difference implies LESS stability.

        "body": "Chemist here. Finally something I know about! Our company just started an olive oil panel to do sensory testing that instruments can't do. Turns out all my olive oil at home was garbage and I had no clue. \n\nSmell your olive oil. Does it smell like crayons? It's gone rancid. Throw it the fuck out. Good olive oil usually smells like fresh cut grass or bananas (in our market, anyway.) Just go buy some new EVOO and smell it when you open it. Compare to crayon bottle.  Youll see what i mean. \n\nEuropean markets with more variety smell like a whole lot of things, due to the differences in olive species and age of the olive at harvest.  Young olives have a greener smell and taste, with higher kick of bitterness and pungentcy.  More mature/ripe olives are slightly sweeter with a smoother finish.  Both are good, it's a preference thing.  Cooking with olive oil doesn't need fancy stuff (but not rancid will obviously taste better), we are talking about the type you'd want to use to make salad dressing or bread dips. \n\nEdit: oh man, I wasn't prepared for this. I've literally taken lectures from pros to do this at work, it's hard to summarize. I'll find a good resource for anyone interested.   \n\nEdit 2: pretty good source. Just Google olive oil sensory testing and olive oil defects for more. https://www.oliveoiltimes.com/olive-oil-basics/good-olive-oils-gone-bad/8900  \n\nHere are some brands suggested by the olive oil association. http://blog.aboutoliveoil.org/21-olive-oil-brands-certified-for-authenticity",

I get along with her well, except for this one point: if you don't keep an eye on her, she will get into the kitchen, and add seasonings to whatever is cooking. She thinks she is fixing stuff, but not all foods need turmeric in it.\n\nThis saturday, I received 40lbs of tomatoes, it took me the whole weekend to turn it into a sauce that I was planning to can. I can it plain, then add whatever seasonings and herbs it needs, depending on the recipe.\n\nThey came to take a bag of spare clothes for one of their kids, and in the 5 minutes it took me to get it, she managed to get into the kitchen, add salt, pepper, turmeric, olive oil, garlic powder and italian herbs to all 5 of the pots that were simmering on the stove.\n\nAnd when I told asked her what she was doing, she had the audacity to say \"this sauce needed some taste, I added it for you\". Like I've never told her to not touch what I was cooking before.\n\nI was so angry that I knew I couldn't be calm talking with her. So I simply walked to my brother, told him to take the clothes and his wife, and that she is no longer welcome in my house.\n\nShe had followed me, was shocked, started apologizing, but I just ignored her. I added that he should come by tomorrow to take the sauce his wife ruined, because otherwise it would be thrown away, and that I expected 40lbs of replacement tomatoes.\n\nThey left, he came back with the tomatoes, an apology letter from her, and an apology carrot cake (my fav). But I told him that I stand by my decision.\n\nNow my parents got involved, since I am the one that usually hosts, and since she is not allowed in my house, I told them to make alternate plans for Memorial day.\n\nMy husband says that I am in the right, but my parents say that my reaction is way overblown. So AITA?\n\nEdit: since there seems to be some confusion, I am not planning to host for memorial day and bot invite her, I said I am not hosting, my parents or my brother should host, and I will attend as a guest. I might be angey, but I don't want her excluded.",

Others can take a turn hosting or we can meet somewhere for family events. My home, and my kitchen, are closed until further notice.” \n\nIf they push back because of the apology, you can let them know it takes time and consistently trustworthy behavior to repair damaged trust. You’re glad she finally understands her behavior was wrong and damaging—it’s unfortunate it took a ban for her to apologize, but that’s something only she can explain. Given that she didn’t even apologize until she faced a serious penalty, it’s reasonable to need time and evidence that she’s changed before you grant her guest privileges again. Explain it to them like she’s 5, because she’s acting like it.",

    "body": "Why YSK: Most people can be comfortable if they figure out what causes their discomfort and deal with it and/or try these methods! I recently discovered that years of frequent discomfort was being caused by nipple chaffing, and bandaids basically cured it right away.\n\n1. Do yoga or stretches before and/or after bed. even 10-20 minutes helps, but the more the better.\n2. Take a shower and put on moisturizer right after. Never too hot or too long.  /u/dizzley would add that you should try a range of moisturizers until you find one to suit. People's needs differ. I use a product called Aveeno and my second choice is Aqueous Cream as it's called in the UK.  /u/kikistiel Would like to add to number 2, before you put moisturizer on gently pat a toner on as well. People always forget the toner step but it’s so important! Imagine rubbing lotion on an dry sponge (no toner) vs a wet sponge (toner). It absorbs into the skin so much better and really makes a difference. You can get toners super cheap and I swear it’s like night and day :)\n3. If your skin often feels irritated, try buying softer clothing like undershirts and underwear.  /u/stoicsticks said:  If you're not sure if a fabric is going to be scratchy to wear, try rubbing it lightly against the inside of your wrist. The skin there is more sensitive than your hands or fingertips.  \n4. If your nipples area often feels uncomfortable it could be due to chaffing. You can put on a bandaid with almond or olive oil.\n5. Correct your posture by being mindful of it throughout the day and doing stretches.  *Sleep in a good position with knee and neck support.  If your mattress sucks, biy a mattress topper.\n6. Foam roll and do warmups before and after exercising.  Always follow exercise routines to prevent muscle imbalances and to prevent overtraining.\n7. Take some deep breaths and relax.  Sometimes tension is held unconsciously, but you can consciously release it.  Relaxing on the exhale works very well for relaxing.\n8. Take care of your bodies basic needs which definitely includes exercise.\n\nSource:  [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/13-benefits-of-yoga](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/13-benefits-of-yoga)\n\nTips added by commenters:\n1.  /u/sojayn Check your sensory overload.  Sometimes (for some people) background noise/lights/temperature translates into a physical restlessness or discomfit. Especially when working or focused and forgetting about your physicality. Try nature sounds headphones, adjust lighting and dress for the temperature.\n2.  /u/5T6Rf6ut Drink some damn water. You're probably not properly hydrated.\n3.  /u/catfurcoat I recommend the Downdog app for yoga but if you want something for free then the FitOn app has some yoga and bedtime routines (as well as a lot of good exercise videos) or Yoga With Adrienne on YT\n4.  /u/jarredknowledge Strengthening our posterior chain goes a long way in alleviating issues surrounding static lifestyle and the inevitable posture issues that come with that\n5.  /u/skbat As an introvert - get some alone time. Read, watch tv, whatever. Get the house to yourself if possible. When I'm grumpy it's almost always because I need alone time.\n6.  /u/dvof meditate.  clear your mind and focus on yourself and surrounding. You'll become aware of tension in parts of the body that you hadn't before. Also try not to think about anything, your mind will probably wander off to something, but try to become aware of it and dissapate the thought. Then again focus on your body, breathing and surrounding again, actively thinking about nothing but the current moment. This basically gives your brain a moment to pause for a second and it really works.\n7.  /u/YourLocalAnarch Another really good tip from my occupational physiotherapist and especially if you work from home: Always have your mouse at the same level as your elbow. Doing it so won't force your body more than it should, especially your posture.  If possible have your screen at the same level of your eyes as well!  /u/LadyJig adds:  In reference to sitting at a desk:  A good quality chair is super important. You may here the term \"ergonomic\" thrown around a lot, but it's actually incredibly important. Chronic pain often arises from poorly fitted but often used equipment, like a desk chair. Ideally, you want your knees to be at a 90deg angle, good back and neck support, and your arms to rest comfortably at a neutral angle. It's also preferable to keep your head straight as much as possible, otherwise you will fatigue your neck.  If you'd like to see how good your desk is, check out this assessment!  Source: me, a Human Factors Engineering student who did a gigantic project on ergonomics\n8.  /u/rojm Write down the things that are bothering you and what you will do about it or how you should feel or cope or learn from it. I use the checklist in my phone’s notes app. Negative thoughts have been intruding and they are very irrational and I know this and writing down how I felt finally turned off those thoughts.\n9.  /u/Kost_Gefernon Feeling irritated or that you are tensing up or clenching your teeth and can’t seem to stop?  Force yourself to smile, then open your mouth wide to stretch your jaw. Repeat a few times.  Add in some double chins (moving your head back to make a double chin while keeping your head upright), and rub the back of your neck.  Poor head posture can cause a chain reaction of tension that leads to tight jaws and a headache. You don’t know what is causing it, which antagonizes the negative feeling, and the situation feeds itself. You can turn it off by smiling.\n10.  /u/LiezLies Left to right rhythmic movements and things that engage symmetrical body movements - things like walking up and down the hall while on a phone call, swimming laps (particularly breaststroke), knitting or crocheting. We see this in animals when they pace up and down.\n11.  /u/LiezLies Intuitive movement - quite literally shaking it out. Put a song on, and move your body however feels good, don’t try to dance, just move your body, including shaking movements. We see this in dogs when they shake after a tense situation.\n12.  /u/awreathafranklin You might be in actual danger. I'm surprised no one has said this yet. We have been taught to \"rationalise\" warning signs are bodies are telling us. Assess your surroundings. Is there anyone you are unfamiliar with or who just entered the immediate space? Is that when you became \"uncomfortable\"? In the event you need to get out, where are you exits? Does anyone know where you are right now? Is there anyone around you that you can trust? Trust your gut, worst case you're wrong and still safe. Uncomfortable can mean so many things. LPT: Become comfortable with your body and learn to listen. (I'm adding that doing slow deep breathing can take you out of fight or flight mode)\n13.  /u/magicEightballA_A Food is also important. Eat fruit man. Lots of it. I hate eating vegetables but I love fruit so started eat more of that and lemme tell you, it helps. I have lots more energy throughout the day and it definitely helps. I eat bananas in the morning, some citrus like oranges after lunch and sometimes an odd pear or apple with dinner.\n14.  /u/7moonwalker7 Go alone for a walk in a forest or park. Or any nature area. I love going deep into a forest at night, especially in the winter when I can enjoy the stars, northern lights and the snow covered trees.\n15.  /u/Stalinwolf Take some magnesium too. 150mg of Magnesium Citrate is my jam.  /u/ispebblespeople DONT supplement minerals at random! Minerals in too high amounts will poison you. The tip should instead be to take a blood test to check your levels and supplement accordingly, or track your diet for a few days in e.g. chronometer and supplement only if you're consistently low balling certain minerals  (I'll add:  make sure you supplement anything your diet is low in, or adding nutrient dense foods with what you're low in of course is better.)\n16.  /u/Ill_Age_1853 I used to have trouble sleeping until I started stretching my knees out\n17.  /u/shapeshifter83 My discomfort has always come from my lower digestive system. My tips are: smaller portions, keto/low carb (less gas production down there), avoid coffee/dairy/spicy, intake dietary fiber on the regular or take a fiber pill, regular exercise, pants that sit very high and fit right.  Also I'm mildly autistic with the typical autistic tendency to dislike things on my skin while paradoxically also disliking to feel uncovered, sleeping naked underneath a weighted blanket has been great.\n18.  /u/steakndbud I'd recommend a theracane over foam rolling. Much more intuitive to use correctly.\n19.  /u/Mondonodo I'm gonna be the horndog of the thread when I say this, but maybe try masturbating. Can be a nice stress release.\n20.  /u/KeithMyArthe I'd add... listen to any feelings of nagging dread or doubt. \n I developed sepsis due to a blockage in one kidney. There was no pain, pretty much asymptomatic except for an overwhelming fear that something wasn't right.  The ER doctor told me that if I had slept on it I might not have made it to the hospital. He estimated 10 to 12 hours before it became unlikely they could have dealt with it as effectively as they did.\n21.  /u/DopeandDiamonds If you are uncomfortable just ask yourself  \"Am I doing OK?\"  \"Do I feel comfortable?\"  \"How can I be happy in this moment?\"  So much of our internal discomfort comes from simply not checking in on how we are doing mentally. Some people need that outlet of being asked how they are to really take a moment and reflect.  It sounds dumb and simple but sometimes we need to have a mental check in. I have done this and burst into tears without knowing I was holding shit in that I couldn't manage.\n22.  /u/marlboroprincess I’m late to this party, but make sure you’re aware of your stimulant intake. Too much caffeine in a day will give me a “bees in my teeth” type feeling. Like my skin is itchy on the inside of my body. I can’t shake and it can trigger a panic episode until i remember that i had a giant coffee or whatever. Have a glass of water, it will help your body metabolize caffeine :)\n23.  /u/Sapiencia6 Sometimes you might find yourself irritable and annoyed by every little thing, the natural noises of your environment are suddenly grating, the light just isn't right, etc. Stress and anxiety can cause your sensory input to be overwhelming. Even if you don't feel that you would have any reason to suffer from sensory overload, keep some grounding exercises in your back pocket for when something \"feels wrong\" but you don't know why.  1.  Focus on a tangible item in your environment. Think of as many adjectives as you can to describe it using each of your senses. What can you say about its visual appearance? What does it smell like, or what do you imagine it smells like? What would it sound like if you used it to make a noise? What does it feel like? What would it taste like? Do this for as many things in your surrounding as you need until you feel relaxed.  2.  Close your eyes and take deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. Count slowly to seven while you inhale, hold for seven, and time your exhale to seven. Then focus on tensing and releasing every muscle in your body, one by one, working down from your head to your toes. You may not realize where your body is holding tension, especially in your face. Tense your forehead, release. Tense your eyes, release. Your nose. Your jaw. Your whole face. Your neck. Your shoulders. Etc. By the time you reach your toes you will have hopefully relaxed your whole body.\n24.  /u/glockGotaDick  Also try the Wim Hof method, super relaxing breathing method",

We're always told there's some mystical perfect posture that iliminates all the pains of the body but it's not true.\n\nWhat is true, is that your best posture is your next posture. Any posture that you stay in for too long is going to give you discomfort, being slouched is okay, being upright is okay, being all twisty and bendy is fine, just switch it up!\n\nThis applies to desk work. You can try to find the best chair, and the best desk, but really what will make a difference is movement. Changing how you sit, standing up (standing desks are great) taking your laptop and going to work on the floor, on the coffee table, etc.\n\nSame with sleep. There isn't an optimal perfect position to sleep in (SLEEPING ON YOUR STOMACH IS FINE!), Just have a minimal amount of pillows (ideally only one) so that your body is encouraged to change positions often in the night. That's how you wake up without being stiff like a board\n\n\nLong story short: movement is your best friend. Always be switching positions. You guys would be amazed at how many \"perfectly straight\" backs I see on a daily basis that are in tons of pain cause they have no idea how to slouch properly.",

What ensued was the question of “why do they call it that”?\n\nSo with all my wisdom I told him “it means no one has stuck their dick in it yet”. From that day on whenever we were around olive oil we had an *inside joke* that explained why it was named that way. Jokes like:\n\n> “It’s yet to be fucked”\n\n> “Companies are legally bound to disclose if the oil has lost its virginity”. \n\n> “If isn’t 100% virgin, the FDA will go after them”\n\nLet me mid-face this with all throughout high-school me and bro had good grades, Bio majors, tech-heads, loved to read novels, comics, etc. People who always seem to know random facts & trivia. Thereby earning the honorary title of “family geniuses” (spoiler alert we’re not) \n\nRecently through the holidays we had family from all over around.  I was once again back in the kitchen and my mom brought it up. Confidently proclaiming that no man has fucked this olive oil. \n\nSo I smiled, it grew into a giggle, then laughter. My eyes were tearing up, I looked around and I was the only one laughing. Everyone in the kitchen looked at me like I was crazy. They said it was a legal thing that had to be disclosed by companies. I asked “do y’all actually believe that?” And they all said yes. \n\nI asked where they had learned it from or if anyone would do a cursory google search. They said that they learned it from my brother who “learned it” from me. My family learned this “fun fact”, believed it and went and taught all their friends & extended family…\n\nIt’s no longer just a funny joke but a masterclass on misinformation. (Still funny imo) \n\nTLDR: Inadvertently convinced family who convinced friends & extended family that an Inside joke between brothers that 100% virgin olive oil meant “it was yet to be fucked” was a real thing.\n\nEdit: \n\nYes my family is simple minded but please refrain from  insulting them. (Especially y’all in my DM’s calling them “fucking stupid”) They’re refugees and weren’t formally educated.\n\nEdit 2:\n\nI didn’t expect this funny experience to blow up this much on Reddit. Thanks for the awards and the outpouring of support. \n\nI’ve also received a lot of people telling me this is fake. Believe what you want.",

While at the dinner table one night, we were chatting about wal*mart and I casually said “yeah, Walmart means evil empire on Ancient Greek” and we all laughed.\n\nFast forward a few months, and I go to my friends house for dinner. Friend has a younger brother who was in my sisters Latin class. We’re all chatting at their dinner table when he brings up the wal-mart meaning and I fell off of my chair at their table because of how hard I was laughing. It took me several moments enough to calm down to explain, then we all had a good laugh. I got home and joked with my sister about it, who had legitimately believed me.

Preheat your oven to 200°C. Cut the red bell peppers in half and remove the seeds and membranes. Place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, cut side down. Roast for 20-25 minutes, or until the skin is charred and blistered. Once roasted, place the peppers in a bowl and cover with cling film for 10 minutes to steam. Peel off the skin and set the roasted peppers aside.\n\n2. In a large frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté for 5-6 minutes until softened and translucent. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.\n\n3. Add the roasted red peppers to a blender, along with the sautéed onion and garlic. Spoon in the vegan cream cheese, nutritional yeast, smoked paprika, and dried oregano. Blend until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Season with salt, black pepper, and lemon juice to taste.\n\n4. To make the ravioli dough, combine the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the warm water and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Wrap in cling film and let it rest for 20 minutes.\n\n5. While the dough is resting, prepare the filling. In a medium bowl, combine the crumbled tofu, nutritional yeast, minced garlic, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until evenly combined.\n\n6. Once the dough has rested, divide it into two equal portions. Roll each portion out on a floured surface until it is very thin (about 2mm thick). Place small spoonfuls of the filling, about 4cm apart, on one sheet of the rolled dough. Place the second sheet of dough over the top, pressing around each mound of filling to seal. Use a knife or ravioli cutter to cut out individual ravioli pieces, ensuring the edges are sealed well.\n\n7. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the ravioli in batches for 3-4 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Drain and set aside.\n\n8. Pour the blended roasted red pepper sauce back into the frying pan and warm it over low heat. Add the cooked ravioli to the sauce, gently tossing to coat each piece in the creamy sauce.\n\n9. Divide the creamy ravioli between four bowls. Garnish with chopped fresh basil leaves for a burst of colour and flavour.\n",

    "body": "Having recently done a lot of experimenting with \"upgrading\" cheap frozen pizzas to make them taste less, well, cheap and frozen, this has been by far the most important trick. \n\nCommercial pizzas are baked in stone ovens that get up to 700- 1000 degrees, which is why they bake so quickly and end up with nice crispy crusts and un-burned everything else. Your home oven will never get that hot but you can try to get as close as possible to emulate the effect. \n\nCook the pizza on the bare rack to maximize air circulation if you don't have a pizza stone or a cast iron skillet/slab. If you have either of those, heat it in the oven first and then cook the pizza on that once the oven hits its max temperature. \n\nFor even better pizza, brush the crust with olive oil before you bake and sprinkle either fresh garlic or garlic powder on it. (The garlic flavor helps to balance out the usually heavy handed and far too sweet sauce that goes on your average frozen pizza). \n\nEdit: Forgot to mention, keep a close eye on the pizza if you're going to do this! 5-8 minutes is a pretty general number and, depending on the temperature your oven maxes out at, your pizza could go from \"perfect\" to \"burned to a crisp\" in the span of a minute.",

Then, as it forms a bit of a crust, yet is still pliable, I fold that bad boy in half to make myself a calzone of sorts. I continue flipping the pizza pocket over until I am confident all the cheese had melted. It gets to a super crunchy crust, and you will definitely spend longer than all the other methods mentioned. But if you're making a personal frozen pizza, the constant flipping and ensuring the pizza will not burn might give you enough distraction from your reality. Maybe just so that the tears of loneliness you cry into your flaky, crusty calzone might taste less salty.\n\nEdit: Gold!!! Thank you stranger! No salty tears on my personal pizza tonight!",

    "body": "Yesterday, two top. Two people sat themselves in my section at a dirty table (the table cloth hadn’t even been changed.) The people weren’t RUDE exactly, while we resat the table, they asked “Where’s our menus?” While the busser, me, and hosts are trying to move around them clearing glasses and plates. They acted confused if anything, like, how DARE this table not be ready for us at a reservation based fine dining restaurant. \n\nI got waters, and tried to do my spiel (the whole these are our chef specials etc etc) and they interrupted me. “If I order a glass of wine, do I pay for it?” I thought I misheard so I asked “What do you mean?” And they repeated themselves “If I order a glass of wine do I pay for it?”\n\nI said very professionally, “Yes it will be on your bill at the end of the dining experience.”\n\n“Oh…” they said, disappointed and confused. “Do I want the burger or the salmon?”\n\n“Hmm, are you in the mood for red meat or seafood? The burger is garnished with xyz and sits between a baked in house blah blah bun, rich savory flavors, while the salmon is a top x vegetables and a brightly flavored z glaze.”\n\nAgain, a stair of confusion. \n\n“I can give you a moment if you would like to review the menu further.”\n\n“No, we’re ready now.”\n\n“Ok, what would you like?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\nIn my brain right now I’m just wondering, WTF is happening? There is no language barrier. There doesn’t seem to be a culture barrier. They aren’t acting rude or upset, just confused. They’re well dressed and at least 40, they HAVE to have gone to a restaurant before to know how this works. \n\nThe other friend then says “She’s asking you want to order.” Ok alright. She want me to decide for her. That’s actually pretty common, you just need to explicitly say that. \n\n“Alright, I suggest the salmon then. And for you?”\n\n“I’ll have the BlahBlah filet, well done. Absolutely no pink.”\n\nI repeat the order back, they agreed, I think I’m in the clear, and I’m about to walk away. \n\n“Will you bring us appetizers?”\n\n“Of course, what would you like?”\n\nThem, not even opening the menu. “Chicken wings.”\n\n“I apologize, we don’t have chicken wings, might I suggest X or Y appetizer? We also have Z chicken entree which would be the closest thing to chicken wings, and is an excellent sharing option.”\n\nBlank stare. \n\nOther friend-“She just wants something fast.”\n\nI explain our from scratch kitchen, how all of our appetizers take as long or longer than the entrees. (Yes, even a well done steak)\n\nI offered to bring extra bread, and again repeated the order. Decided on entrees only and extra bread. \n\nI brought two portions of bread. “Here you are, our (restaurant name) freshly baked bread and whipped butter.” Our bread looks like bread. There is no mistaking for anything else. \n\nThe table looks at me aghast and confused, like I messed something up.\n\n“This is bread?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“So, this is bread?”\n\n“Yes, it is our baked in house bread.”\n\n“At (popular restaurant) they have XYZ bread and served with oil. Why is this your bread? It’s not XYZ bread.”\n\n“You are right, it is different bread. I would be happy to bring you olive oil for dipping. Would you like olive oil?”\n\n“No… are you sure you don’t have (other restaurant’s) bread?”\n\nOk, if you want their bread maybe go there?\n\n“Yes, I am sure I don’t. I apologize. Is there anything else I can bring for you at the moment?”\n\n“No…” filled with disappointment and confusion. \n\n\n\n30-40 minutes later, a food runner finds me with BlahBlah Filet in hand. “Table 77 said they didn’t order this.” \n\nI go up to the table. \n\n“You ordered the BlahBlah Filet, cooked well done, correct.”\n\n“Yes I want the BlahBlah Filet.”\n\n“Ok. Here is your BlahBlah Filet.”\n\n“Nonono, that is not the BlahBlah Filet. It doesn’t have the (she then describes a completely different steak with other garnishes and sides. Sides that we don’t carry.)”\n\n“I see. I apologize that the BlahBlah filet was not you had envisioned, however this restaurant does not have the meal you described. Would you like to enjoy this meal, or order something else from our menu.”\n\n“Yes. I want the BlahBlah Filet.”\n\nMy brain is melting. I feel like I’m losing my grip on reality. Am I not communicating properly? Why are me and this table not living in the same reality? What is happening?\n\n“This is the BlahBlah Filet.” I say, gesturing to the plate in front of her. \n\n“Oh, no… it’s not.”\n\nAfter a few back and forths, she decided she did not want the BlahBlah Filet, or to order anything else. She sat and watched her friend eat her dinner is record time. Chicken wing lady was really hungry. \n\nI drop off the check, process the card, easy. When I see she has finished signing it, I go back to the table and ask “I can take the check presenter if you are all set with it.”\n\nShe then hands me her untouched still folded cloth napkin. To her credit both are black and rectangular. But there is definitely a texture and weight and material difference you would immediately notice. \n\n“I can clear this napkin for you, but may I have the check presenter?”\n\n“I just gave it to you.” She has no malice or anger in her voice. I double checked and nope it was a napkin. \n\nI eventually got the check, tipped 15% which was honestly better than I hoped. They left their jacket, and no surprises here, the tags were still on. OF COURSE they are the type of people who wear things and return them. \n\nThe whole thing just left me exasperated and bewildered. It completely drained my social and emotional battery. I felt like Kate McKinnon in the re-enactment of Gaslight skit, where he’s like “This is a steak.” And she’s like “Uh, I’m pretty sure it’s a pineapple.”\n\nTLDR - Yes you have to pay for stuff.",

    "body": "So. This happened a few weeks ago but I’ve been meaning to post this story here since. It all begins when I found a few giant puffball mushrooms out in the woods. For those unfamiliar with a giant puffball. They are gigantic white and delicious mushrooms that look like this.  https://imgur.com/gallery/Mnay6 my fuckup comes while I was frying some up the next night. I seasoned them in breadcrumbs and cheese and ate a bunch of them. I thought they tasted a bit off but didn’t think much of it and went to bed. At 3 AM I was awoken by one of the worst upset stomachs I’ve ever had. I rushed to the bathroom and had a real bad time in there. I immediately thought that I was poisoned by the mushrooms and began frantically doing research online. I would have been in a lot of trouble if I incorrectly identified a mushroom and ate as much of\nIt as I did. Luckily I was safe on that front as giant puffballs are one of the easiest wild mushrooms to identify. So, I began thinking about the entire cooking process the night before when it hit me. I used castor oil to cook them in. I had purchased it at the Indian food store a couple weeks prior and had just run out of olive oil. At the time, neither me or my girlfriend had any idea what castor oil was or what effect it had on the human digestive system. For those who don’t know, castor oil is used in medicine as a natural laxative. It has been considered  a cure to constipation for years. The label on the bottle I bought had no indication that it was used for that purpose and I in fact just thought it was a traditional Indian cooking oil. So. I spent the rest of the day near or\nIn the bathroom and learned a very valuable lesson. Don’t cook with castor oil. \n\nTLDR; cooked a giant mushroom with laxative oil. ",

I knew all the stitches but kept asking myself at the beggining: why, how, what's happening, what's next, why we are still here just to suffer? I have now much more appreciation for everyone who crochet in this style!\nOverall the whole thing took me almost a month (which is really long for me and the piece of this size) and it was a lovely, but painful experience.\nAnd it's huge! Like 220x70 cm even though I reduced the number of repetition in both directions\nThe pattern I've used: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/forager-ruana-and-shawl\nYarn: Alize Baby Best (it's so soft after washing!)\nI questioned the colour combination for a while since it reminded me of the package of a greek olive oil (don't get me wrong - olive oil is life, but I didn't want to look like one), but after finishing the shawl I grew to love it!",

I was told by two people I should have added paprika or cayenne or cumin when the whole point is to enjoy the flavor of the three things together.\n\nI see this online all the time, when was it out of vogue to enjoy ingredients the way they are? Something like chicken, sure, it needs a lot of seasoning, but some things can be enjoyed on their own.",

The chicken was going to be chopped and simmered in a sauce with onions, garlic and herbs. The sauce was plenty of seasoning but people still shat on her because she didn't cover the chicken in an impenetrable layer of seasoning salt, onion and garlic powder .\n\nEta when I think of white people food I think of mayonnaise based salads, not a caprese",

    "body": "I'm an American who was living in Poland at the time of this fuck up. I've always been a big fan of going to the movies and I *love* popcorn. The one thing that always bothered me about European movie theaters, though, is that they don't give you butter on your popcorn. You can order it sweet or salty, but not greasy.\n\nMy wife's cousins had traveled to my city to visit ([somehow they are always around for my fuck ups!](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2ix5ss/tifu_by_being_overenthusiastic_about_my_salad_in/)), and we decided to go see a movie. I was talking about the superiority of American popcorn and they were making the predictable \"fat American\" jokes about our cultural need to pour fat on everything. We were going back and forth, and I got so worked up in my patriotic fervor that I told them I would bring my own butter to the movies to demonstrate how great it was. I melt a stick of butter in the microwave, pour it into a glass jar, put the jar into the pocket of my peacoat, and we head to the movies.\n\nIt was the dead of Polish winter, and it took us quite some time to take the trams to the theater. By the time we get there, the butter had congealed to a semi-solid that was glued to the bottom of the jar. No problem, we buy a large popcorn and my cousin holds it while waiting for me outside the men's room. I go into one of the stalls, hold the jar by the rim, and strike my lighter underneath it. Unfortunately, the lighter made quite a distinct sound, and people in the bathroom heard it. The gap in the stall door frame was quite wide, and a couple of people shot glances my way. I'm not sure what they think they saw, but it must have been weird to see a guy with a lighter under a glass. I heard whispers about \"narkotyki\" and started to get nervous. Was security about to get called on me for suspected crack smoking? \n\nFortunately, the butter melted quite quickly and I decided to make a run for it. *Unfortunately*, the jar was way too hot to hold anywhere except by the rim. So I did the only thing I could think of, which was to hold the jar in front of me by the rim and briskly walk out of the bathroom before my fingers burned. The crowd parted wide for me as I half-ran through the bathroom holding a mysterious jar of yellow liquid. People were equally stunned outside the bathroom when I emerged. An entire theater was emptying out in front of me, and all they saw was a frantic-looking man running out of a bathroom and hurriedly dumping a jar of yellow fluid into a popcorn bag held by an embarrassed-looking accomplice. There were several pronounced looks of disgust.\n\nI can't say that I kept my head held high after that, but I can say that I enjoyed the hell out of that buttered popcorn while watching that movie. Good times. I still love popcorn, but these days I'm more into olive oil and nutritional yeast than butter.\n\nTL;DR: My American love of grease makes Poles think I'm a crackhead who enjoys flavoring my food with urine",

    "body": "So, it has been roughly 1 month and a week or two since I made this post and I was apparently asked for updates multiple times even rather recently despite the post being old. Unfortunately I sort of lost my account since I got a new phone and completely forgot about logging in to reddit, so I ended up looking at my old phone and saw a few more replies and that brought me back to this post.\n\nPrevious post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/drmpk9/aita\\_for\\_refusing\\_to\\_cook\\_for\\_my\\_girlfriend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/drmpk9/aita_for_refusing_to_cook_for_my_girlfriend/)\n\nSo, quite a bit has happened in the meantime so let's just jump right in to it(I am sorry I watched Philip DeFranco earlier.)\n\nSo roughly a week after the post me and my girlfriend had a rather large argument mostly due to how she was behaving towards me, which as some pointed out was rather disrespectful. The argument was triggered after one of my dinner parties where she behaved in the way I described where she tasted like one element of the dish, put it away and did not eat any more. Now as you may imagine I was feeling embarrassed in front of my friends but this time Cleo(The wife of a friend I usually invite) Spoke up and told her she was acting extremely rude which then resulted in some of my other friends saying the same and well the party was ruined, my girlfriend got mad and in the late evening this argument happened. I was pretty nasty to her, she was pretty nasty to me and we barely spoke for 3 days. But after she spoke to her mom(Who agreed that she was behaving badly.) She decided to apologize and we made some deals concerning cooking.\n\n1: She would start cooking with me.\n\n2: She would try new things.\n\n3 She would no longer act rudely and if she did not want something she would not join a dinner party instead of acting snobbishly and not eating anyways.\n\n4: She would eat healthier since I also told her, her diet was gonna kill her at some point.\n\nIn the last 5 or so weeks there have been large changes, she has opened up to eating a lot more stuff slowly but steadily, she has realized there is a lot more that is nice to eat beyond bland stuff and cooking together has been fun.(She is really, really horrible at cooking but we'll get there!)\n\nSo hopefully sooner or later this problem will go away! Anyways thanks for the judgement and advice everyone, also exchanging recipes was rather fun the Corn recipe someone sent me was especially nice!\n\nEdit: Also since someone asked about a previous recipe(This is a comment from my other post where I explained it.) Well, I am not sure what you are looking for in terms of recipes, but I can toss you a simple one which I really like. Grilled Feta, my mom used to make it when I was young and it is really easy to make, basically you buy Feta(Note feta, not white cheese as they often try to fool you in to thinking that garbage is feta), some eggs, a proper baguette, Breading, Rocket(The Salad stuff), A Lemon, basil, Cherry tomatoes and well some dried herb mix. You just split the yokes from the egg whites, whisk the jokes, cut up the Feta in lines(You don't have to as Feta is brittle), Dunk the feta in the egg yokes, then dunk it in the breading and make sure it is fully covered, then you just put a whole bunch of olive oil in a pan and put the feta in, make sure there is a lot of oil in it, makes it easier to grill the sides properly. You then just slice up your baguette , put some olive oil and herb mix on it on the sides and slightly toast it, then you just smear the feta on the baguette add some tomatoes, basil and rocket, squeeze a bit of lemon juice on it and bam you got a tasty ass starter that barely takes any time and only an idiot would dislike. You can pretty much do the same with Halloumi but you don't have to bread it.",

Which is a recently classified eating disorder revolving around extreme picky eating. While specific acceptable foods vary from person to person, those who suffer from this are typically restricted to a small list of 'safe foods' which are usually junk foods (pizza, fries, pancakes, etc) and are physically unable to bring themselves to try new foods without gagging or vomiting.  \n  \nThose affected by this eating disorder are usually ridiculed by their peers for their diet and stern refusal to try any new foods. They're usually afraid to go to social events and restaurants with friends because of their dietary restrictions. Most people tend to look at them as acting childish because they refuse to try new foods, when really most of the time they wish they could try new foods.",

There haven't really been many reported instances of Teflon pans causing poisoning in people even when left like this. You will have been exposed to more toxic polymers and floruide molecules than you should have been but you'll likely be fine. Teflon flu is like I said very rare and typically only happens when you have a lot of water in the pan, let it heat up really high, and then breathe in the smoke. \n\nWith that said you should air out your house and get rid of that pan. It won't be nonstick anymore and could potentially hurt you if you use it. Adam Ragusea has a good video on his channel that talks about the health risks of doing something like this. I also believe on of the YouTube doctors who is actually a doctor has a video on this. You should be fine but I'd recommend airing out the house, disposing of the pan, and if you start to exhibit lung problems going to a doctor. I'd also recommend giving your roommate a swift kick in the ass. What they did was actually pretty unsafe and aside from the potential exposure to airborne toxic and carcinogenic chemicals they also created a huge fire risk. Especially with the having oil in the pan if you had a gas range or even just had the pan on an electric burner that's a bit to big you could've been dealing with a house fire. Regardless maybe recommend them some food safety videos or show them photos of what happens in a house fire, or to the lungs of people who get Teflon lung or have too much exposure to PFOA.",

Some of it will be milder, and some will be stronger, but they will all be extra virgin: to be honest, high-quality olive oil is well under the maximum parameters for EVO, which is why some of us are pushing for stricter regulations, but larger producers will never agree with that, cause they love to sell average products as extra virgin. Just to give you an idea, free fatty acids in EVO must be under 0.8%, but most high quality producers consistently get to 0.2% at most. \n\nVirgin Olive Oil is also extracted mechanically, but it can have worse chemical parameters (acidity of 2.0% just to mention one) and/or a few noticeable sensory defects. It’s basically extra virgin that had something go wrong along the way, but not enough to sell it to an industrial mill to be refined. In Europe it’s almost impossible to find.\n\nNow, regular Olive Oil is a different matter: by law, it can undergo some chemical processes that allow it to be refined. A blend of terrible extra virgin olive oils of different origin can be treated by specialized companies to become an acceptable regular olive oil, but it’s low grade. In many cases, there is no single harvesting date specified because they can also mix and match different years, because the refining process makes it so bland that you do not notice the difference.",

        "body": "Correct answer -\n\nMost answers about EVOO are correct, but Virgin and below Virgin (Lampante) is still being misrepresented.\n\nIf an oil is first cold-pressed - it should - but may not, pass chemical and sensory tests to grade as EVOO. Reasons it may fail to meet EVOO include crop issues (frost), delays getting olives from tree to mill (oxidation), improper milling (overheating), storage contamination, failure to rack or filter, etc.\n\nIf an oil misses Extra Virgin it’s still possible it can grade as Virgin depending on the chemical grade and/or sensory defects. If it fails to meet the Virgin standard, then it is graded as Lampante. Lampante is then chemically refined (usually sold to a refiner) and finally sold as pure olive oil. So EVOO, Virgin and Lampante make up the categories of UNREFINED olive oil.\n\nOil that graded as Extra Virgin right after harvest may NOT grade as Extra Virgin if tested 6-months or a year later. It depends on how far above the minimum EVOO thresholds the oil was at milling, as well as how well the oil is being stored (ensuring oxygen is removed from tanks). I would estimate the vast majority of EVOO tested at 12-months from harvest will no longer be EVOO. At this point, it’s possible that 12-month old oil could grade as Virgin. It just depends on the quality at that point. \n\nBut EVOO vs Virgin vs Lampante is ultimately just a grade of unrefined olive oil at a given point in time. \n\nThe “fraud” most perpetrated these days is the oil is only graded once at harvest, and typically never again. So the oil may have barely passed as EVOO at harvest, but will be Virgin a few months later as it degrades, and if not stored properly, will be Lampante (not fit for human consumption) even before the one year mark. But the oil will be sold as EVOO because that was the quality at harvest.",

        "body": "Okay, I've seen too many people answering that have no idea what 'virgin' and 'extra virgin' actually mean, so I have to say something. There's a short answer and a longer one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShort answer: It's not about the method of oil production, it's about quality. There's a list of characteristics that have to be measured (composition, taste, smell...), and depending on the results, the oil is given one label or another. All edible oils are safe to consume, so nothing happens if it's not virgin, but they have slightly different compositions and characteristics, so extra virgin is the best one you can get. But this way of labeling oil is used mainly in countries like the EU, Argentina, Egypt, Turkey, and some others. I do not know how the US, or Canada, or other countries label olive oil, but these categories were established in the ones that produce and consume mainly olive oil. So these rules may not be applied into your countries' laws, so if you see these labels, take them with a grain of salt, because they may not mean the same thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong answer:\n\nFirst of all, in most places oil is not pressed, it is centrifuged. Pressing was the original method, but centrifuging is more efficient and useful at an industrial scale. So labeling the oil according to one method that's not the standard makes no sense.\n\nBut even if it was pressed, that's not what determines the category of the oil. Those terms do not refer to how many times the oil has been pressed, cold-pressed, processed or whatever. They do not refer to the method of oil production. They refer to the **characteristics** of the oil. Physical, chemical and organoleptic (taste, smell, colour...) characteristics.\n\nThe International Olive Council (IOC) regulates the production and labeling of olive products in member states (like the EU), and on their website (https://www.internationaloliveoil.org/olive-world/olive-oil/) and their documents (https://www.internationaloliveoil.org/what-we-do/chemistry-standardisation-unit/standards-and-methods/) you can see how they label olive oil.\n\nIn Standard COI/T.15/NC No 3/ Rev.17/2TRA, TRADE STANDARD ON OLIVE OILS AND OLIVE-POMACE OILS (https://www.internationaloliveoil.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/COI-T15-NC3-REV-17\\_ENK.pdf) you can see the physical, chemical and organoleptic characteristics required for labeling oils. Here's a fragment:\n\n\"(i) Extra virgin olive oil: virgin olive oil which has a free acidity, expressed as oleic acid, of not more than 0.80 grams per 100 grams and the other physico–chemical and organoleptic characteristics of which correspond to those fixed for this category in this standard.\n\n(ii) Virgin olive oil: virgin olive oil which has a free acidity, expressed as oleic acid, of not more than 2.0 grams per 100 grams and the other physico–chemical and organoleptic characteristics of which correspond to those fixed for this category in this standard.\n\n(iii) Ordinary virgin olive oil: virgin olive oil which has a free acidity, expressed as oleic acid, of not more than 3.3 grams per 100 grams and the other physico–chemical and organoleptic characteristics of which correspond to those fixed for this category in this standard.\"\n\nAnd in the rest of the document there's a series of characteristics that are measured. For example, wax content in extra virgin and virgin olive oil has to be < 150 mg/kg.\n\nAs you can see, it has nothing to do with the method of production. It's about the oil's characteristics.",

        "body": "As most people are saying, “extra virgin olive oil” is of higher quality. But why? I am no expert by any means, but I recently took a tour of an olive oil plantation and production facility in Chile (like two weeks ago). What I learned was that the biggest factor in being able to label olive oil “extra virgin” is the acidity levels. The acidity level has to be less than 0.2% (or 0,2% as printed in Chile). In order to insure the acidity levels stay that low, they have to move very quick when it comes time to harvest. Once the olive is picked from the tree, it begins to ferment, and fermentation is where acidity comes from. The longer the olive ferments, the higher the acidity. The facility I toured goes from harvest to bottle in less than four hours to keep the acidity levels below 0.2% (0,2% Chilean). The process from harvest to bottle is surprising very simple, but once harvest starts, their machines run 24/7. Nothing stops until the last olive is processed.\n\nAlso, the closer you can buy olive oil to the time it was processed, the better. They recommend using their olive oil within one year of being processed. Olive oil, unlike wine, does not age well with time. It will go bad.\n\nOne cool thing at this facility is their attempt to reduce waste. After the olive has been obliterated to extract the oil, they use the scrap (including the seed) as fertilizer in their plantation. They even have a way to reuse the water left over from the olive after the oil is extracted.\n\nBy the way, if you are wondering about the comma used in the percentage above, some countries us commas as a way to separate the integer part of a number and the fractional part of a number. The more you know… 😁\n\nThis was the place I toured, if anyone is curious: https://qori.cl/english/",

Unless it's related to flavor or quantity reasons. Then it would make sense to be more expensive.",

    "body": "As a Thai person, I'm always eager to share the different ways I work with one cheap, universally common staple: eggs! \n\nNow these aren’t really recipes, they’re more like methods that you can try if you like eggs but want some variety without spending extra money. \n\n**Thai omelettes (ไข่เจียว)**\n\nUnlike French omelettes (which are delicately yellow and cooked in butter), Thai style omelettes range from golden yellow to brown in color (not burnt) and is fried in \\*HOT\\* oil like sunflower oil. This gives the omelette a really nice smoky amora, almost like popcorn? You can even pour the beaten egg mixture through a sieve into a pan/wok of hot oil, and it'll be super crispy/wispy like [this](https://www.clipmass.com/upload/news/49/48368_full.jpg). I love it with sriracha (probably one of the only instances where we actually use this ingredient, surprisingly) with a plate of rice. \n\n**Thai steamed eggs (ไข่ตุ๋น)**\n\nThis is similar to the Japanese chawanmushi, where an egg mixture (which is super customisable btw - but just adding green onions/scallions is common) is beaten, seasoned with soy sauce, a paste of cilantro root* garlic and black peppercorns (you can blend the 3 or use a mortar and pestle), and finally, pork/chicken stock. Then you steam it in a bowl for 20-30 mins. The result is like a savoury pudding/custard that should be eaten with rice - a very kid-friendly meal and is commonly eaten with you're feeling sick and want something hot and easy to digest. \n\n**Fried eggs (ไข่ดาว)**\n\nLike the omelette, Thai people like fried eggs to be *really* fried in hot frying oil (so olive oil wouldn't work for this). The edges of the whites are crispy (a bit of browning adds a lot of flavor). The yolk isn't  exactly sunny side up, because a key technique is to 'baste' the yolk in the oil until it turns slightly white while maintaining its overall runniness. Fantastic with rice and fish sauce (plus chopped garlic and chilies if you want).\n\n**Grilled eggs (ไข่ปิ้ง)**\n\nThis is probably the least well-known egg cooking method/recipe for both Thais and non-Thais as it's a street food item that you don't really see that much anymore. I recommend this for special occasions as its quite labor intensive. Basically... the contents of the eggs are taken out through a small hole (you can use a pin), thoroughly strained, seasoned with pepper and soy sauce, beaten, poured back into the eggs, steamed, put on skewers and then grilled/toasted. The toast adds a really nice smokiness that makes its way into the egg mixture. The result should be like boiled eggs but with flavour. Side note: I’m not sure how hygienic the eggs are in your country so check food regulations before trying this recipe as every country is different!\n\nEdit: clarity\n\n*cilantro stems work in a pinch \n\nEdit 2: Wow this blew up! This sub’s been super helpful to me so I’m glad to share with this you :)",

Possibly because that's how they were raised, too. \n\nIt's no wonder many kids hate those kinda vegetables. While adults can at least somehow munch down that oversteamed broccoli, or that salad that is either dry or drenched in greasy dressing, or those watery, wobbly tomatoes, falsely believing that it's somehow what you gotta do as an adult, kids don't give a shit and will just flat out refuse it. That is then ascribed to kids not liking vegetables or kids only liking greasy/sugary food. That's a big pile of BS. \n\nWhile some tastes are certainly developed over the years, you can get children to like all sorts of vegetables by cooking them right. So instead of letting that broccoli cook for 20 minutes with no salt, how about you let it roast in the oven with some salt, paprika and olive oil?",

Vegetables can be frickin delicious if you have a spice in your cupboard besides salt. get some cauliflower and potatoes, add some onion powder and olive oil and stir that ish up, holy mackerel it’s delicious. has anyone here ever heard of bittermelon? eat that raw, or just cooked with salt, and it’s disGUSting, but add some onions and potato and (while i still prefer most other vegetables) it’s more than palatable. i remember always wondering why obesity was such a big problem in the US before realizing that any kid is going to pick chicken nuggets and french fries over broccoli and spinach because (and i really hope i don’t offend anyone here) A.

    "body": "I typically used many “expensive” (aka $15+) products in my hair and my while my hair is a mixture of 2C/3A I always had a bit more waves than ringlets. I recently had twins and we had to cut down on spending so I’ve been shopping around for more affordable products that are under 10 bucks. I was SHOCKED to find that my hair responds better to the lower priced products than the higher priced ones! My head is full of ringlets and I haven’t finger curled a single piece! I am beyond happy and I thought I would share some products that really help my super dry and very thick hair. All of this stuff can be found at Walmart and dollar general!\n\nRoutine and Products:\n\nShampoo: Palmer’s Coconut Oil Shampoo ($7) and Aussie’s Curly Shampoo ($5)\n\nConditioner: Palmer’s Coconut Oil Conditioner ($7)\n\nLeave in: Cantù Leave in Conditioner ($6)\n\nCurl Cream: African Pride Curl Cream from dollar general ($6)\n\nGel: Eco Olive Oil ($5)\n\nBrush: Knock off Denman at Walmart, and paddle brush ($4)\n\nSpray bottle: Walmart spray bottle ($2)\n\n\nFirst I “clarify” with Aussie’s shampoo then shampoo again with Palmer’s. Then apply Palmer’s conditioner, followed by the Cantù leave in. Section hair and re-wet section before styling because my hair dries insanely fast. Brush through with the paddle brush then apply African Pride cream. Brush with knock off denman, then gently scrunch hair with a tshirt. I do this all over my head and at the very end I get a pea sized amount of the Eco gel and dilute it with water. I then gently scrunch all of my hair. Hover diffuse with conair hairdryer and regular diffuser attachment that comes with it. Scrunch diffuse when hair is about 50-75% dry. (EDIT: I use next of us hair oil, you can also find it at Walmart for around 5-6 bucks. I put it on my hands before this next part!) After that I separate the big curl clumps and gently shake out my roots to create more volume. Then I’m done!\n\nIt’s so crazy how much high end products are pushed onto us when we may not even need them! I hope I was of some help to all curlies on a budget 🩷\n",

    "body": "**Why YSK.** Basic cooking skills are easy and can greatly expand your food options. A vinaigrette (a diminutive of the French *vinaigre,* or vinegar, and the origin of the term \"French dressing\") is a mix of 3 parts oil and 1 part vinegar. What oil? What vinegar? Doesn't really matter. You can experiment on your own, but can use what you have. (Olive oil and red wine vinegar, for example.)\n\nWith the 3 parts oil and 1 part vinegar you can then add an emulsifier. Oil and vinegar don't mix very well, and if you don't have the emulsifier you end up with a vinaigrette that will taste like only vinegar one bite and only oil the next. The emulsifier will allow these two liquids to blend together.\n\nThere are a lot of emulsifiers, but in general mustard and mayo are the best for taste and stability. (Egg yolk is best as a long-term emulsifier, but the taste isn't great.) Adding a teaspoon of mayo and mustard (any kind, but Dijon is always great) is going to allow the mixture to stay mixed for a half hour at least.\n\nAfter that, it's all up to you. Want a sweeter sauce? Honey, maple syrup, molasses, brown sugar, etc. A brighter sauce? Lemon juice, pineapple juice, etc. Salt and pepper, garlic, herbs, and almost anything you want can go into a vinaigrette. Experimenting or using what you have is always an option, and as long as you keep the two main ingredients in mostly correct proportions, you may be surprised how much you can do with a vinaigrette.\n\n**Basic vinaigrette recipe**\n\n* 3 Tablespoon oil\n* 1 Tablespoon vinegar\n* 1 Teaspoon dijon mustard\n* 1 Teaspoon mayonaise\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\nAdd all ingredients to a bowl and whisk together until blended. Use as a salad dressing, meat marinade, or as a finisher to roasted veggies. (You can also leave out the mayo or mustard, but try to include at least something as an emulsifier. Tomato paste, roasted garlic, tahini, avocado, and others are useful here.)\n\n**Options**\n\n* **Sweet note**. 1 teaspoon honey or maple syrup\n* **More acid!** 1 teaspoon lemon juice\n* **Savory punch.** MSG and garlic\n* **Spicy spice.** Red pepper flake, cayenne, or your hot sauce of choice.",

All my dark (red, balsamic) vinegars into a different bottle. All my \"Asian\" sauces into one mega gallon sized Asia liquid. My fancy salt got mixed with the coarse sea salt I use to knock off burnt food in the cast iron pan. There is a Ziploc bag of spices that I believe is from this same event. It's just a quart of unlabeled spices that looks like a layered sand art. He also combined the white sugar and brown sugar.\n\n\n\nUpdate because of the volume of questions I have seen/inbox inquiries as to what jail must be like after killing such a person:\n\n\n-I told the roommate that did this an amount of money he owed me and he paid me in cash in about 24 hours.\n\n-I now have new spices etc. in a different location, ultimately taking up more space in the kitchen, but whatever. If anything I under charged him, but I felt no need to rebuy everything when I'm going to be leaving at the end of the year and I wouldn't use it in time. I didn't want to make more needless trash.\n\n\n\nOther:\n\n-I discovered this as soon as I got home, and it was at the beginning of finals week last semester. I took a rage nap after I saw how many small glass bottles of spices and sauces were in the recycling, and when I woke up I called my husband and he couldn't stop laughing at how absurd this was. \n\n-I rent 2 houses because my college is very far from my home to commute everyday, and spicy roommate is the place where I spend the least time, but I still want to be able to make food sometimes. I still have other spices at my main house, but this was upsetting.  \n\n-I do not believe this incident was in any way passive aggressive/fueled by drugs. He honestly thought this was an ok idea. He and I had just assembled a 5 tier industrial shelf in the unused dining area the day before, and I don't know why he felt we needed more space, but he did. He also told me he tried to combine the hot sauces but it was too difficult, and if we wanted he would organize the fridge. The roommate coalition gave him a resounding no.\n\n-The tainted spices are now his to do with what he wishes. He has used most of everything to date from my eyeball estimates. The sugar blend still exists. I didn't own the other spices that became the sand art. They are now in a re-purposed pasta sauce jar, essentially unused. I soft boiled an egg for ramen and let it marinate overnight in the Asia liquid. It was terrible and I threw it out. If I remember correctly it was nasty sweet. I made pickled onions with the white vinegar blend. It was ok but a little more bitter than I usually like. Asia liquid has all been used by this point.\n\n-I would never say he is stupid. I believe he has a doctoral degree, and used to be a professor. But book smart and kitchen smart might be different things.\n\n-Bonus fact: spicy roommate took over the room of our previous roommate that was a private chef for hire. The chef roommate never fucked with my spices, but chef and the rest of us had irreconcilable differences. Spicy roommate cooks us food sometimes, and I have to wonder how many of the cursed spices are in it.\n\n\n\n\nThis got long. Thanks for reading, hopefully this picture I have of the sugar works. He mixed it, to make it \"better\" so you can't tell it's 30% brown sugar https://imgur.com/a/GM9hE8g",

My mom also ranges between 'well-meaning but clueless', 'coocoo bananas' and 'actively malicious',\n\nIn any case, my boyfriend wasn't feeling well and I wanted to help. Chicken soup's a traditional choice, so I decided that I was going to make chicken and dumplings, from scratch.\n\nAs this involved making chicken-and-vegetable stock (and that takes several hours), I wrangled a friend to help out. He's good with prep and fun to talk to, so I had him come over and mostly keep me company while I sliced veggies, rendered down a roast chicken for the carcass and get the stock going.\n\nIt cooks. And cooks. And cooks. Friend and I play Magic, talk shit and mostly amuse each other while the stock does its thing.\n\nFinally, it's ready to go. I pick up the stock pot and begin pouring it into a pitcher. My mom, who's wandered into the  kitchen, promptly pitches a fit that pouring hot liquid into plastic is Bad and We'll All Get Cancer. I set the stockpot down and begin rummaging in the cabinets for something *else* to use to hold the stock.\n\nAs I'm doing this, my mom realizes that some stock (*maybe* a quarter of a cup, at most) has spilled on her shiny new counter tops. She promptly insists that this be wiped up absolutely *immediately* lest the counters be irreparably damaged by brief exposure to water. While I'm scrambling for a dishcloth, she picks up the entire (still fucking full!) stockpot and dumps it out into the sink.\n\nSo, from a gallon and a half of stock (and its accompanying grocery run, prep and cook time), I was left with perhaps two cups of stock, while my mom insisted that all of this was my fault.\n\nThat was one of *many* instances of her nonsense, but we don't talk any more.

MAKE IT STOP** \n\n**Originally posted to r/Cooking & r/CleaningTips** \n\n**Thanks to u/soayherder for suggesting this BoRU** \n\nMOOD SPOILER: >!If this post smells like cinnamon, you aren't imagining things!< \n\n[Too many apples. how to use them (that isnt a pie)?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/s/sGB0p8L7bt)  **Oct 8, 2024** \n\nwent apple picking and ended up with wayyyy too many macintosh apples. ive already made 6+ pies, apple tarts, apple mini pies, baked apples... and i still have 2 dozen apples ..please share any ideas on how to get through a horde of apples \n\nEDIT - THANK YOU!!! \nso far tonight i made applesauce and have 2 trays of dried apple slices in the oven right now! 14 apples remaining!! \n\n**TOP COMMENTS** \n\n**mrmadchef** \n\n>Apple butter? I think you can even make it in a slow cooker. \n\n**~** \n\n**violet_violet** \n\n>Apple butter, for sure!!! I've always made mine in a slow cooker. Peel and chop your apples, cover and let them cook down for several hours on high, blend, add sugar (I usually do brown sugar), spices and a little lemon juice, then let cook uncovered for several more hours on low. It keeps for ages in the freezer and makes for great Christmas gifts, too.\n\n\n>As far as baking goes, my two favorite non-pie apple recipes are both from Smitten Kitchen: [apple and cheddar scones](https://smittenkitchen.com/2010/10/apple-and-cheddar-scones/), and [big apple crumb cake](https://smittenkitchen.com/2021/10/big-apple-crumb-cake/). In fact, I'm planning to make one of them today, just not sure yet which one. 😅 \n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/s/Lh52KM4ywj)  **Oct 15, 2024** \n\ni made apple butter and now my slowcooker has a permament cinnamon smell. i tried soaking the lid in soapy aater for an hour. i washed every part 8 times, unscrewed the handles and cleaned every nook any cranny.. but IT WONT GO AWAY!!! and its not a faint smell its a cinnaMAXIMUM smell in the lid. \n\nis there a product i can use? or do i just have to accept my fate? \n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS** \n\n**fruithasbugsinit** \n\n>Try slow cooking two cups of 1:1 vinegar and water. Then let it air out and cool down for a day or so for the vinegar to go away. \n\n>ETA: Unless you have birds as this can hurt or kill them with their sensitive systems. \n\n**OOP** \n\n>>have I wronged you in the past? \nmy home. my santuary. is being forcibly air marinated. \n\n>>I'm dry heaving with each breath as the tiny vapors of this weaponized witches brew of Cinnamon Vinegarette Salad Dressing deep dives into my esophagus. \n\n**OOP Adds a mini update** \n\n[Mini Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/s/MLOBYAbSRG) \n\n*Processing img 2kt1d1bta1vd1...* \n\nUPDATE - the mixture of vinegar and cinnamon scents wafting through my kitchen is permeating through my eyeballs and directly into my soul. \n\n**wawa2022** \n\n>Throw a piece of fish in that baby. You won’t smell the cinnamon anymore \n\n**OOP** \n\n>>squinting really hard at you lol \n\n[Next Day update](https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/s/aHQowYAYnN)  **Oct 16, 2024** \n\nNEXT DAY UPDATE. \n\n\nAs i drifted off to sleep last night i still smelled it, covering the inside of my nose. and dreamed i was pickled. \n\nit seems that the cinnamon has effectively mutated in the fiery hell of its vinegar battle, and has has now become a biohazard. i soaked the lid in a big plastic tub with water, soap and vinegar mixture, because why not double down? \n\nmy sunk cost fallacy arguement has now made the bin ALSO smell like a spicy formaldehide. \n\nmy next attempt is sunlight, and open space....aka sneaking into my in laws home while theyre on vacation and leaving it on their kitchen table for a week. \n\nim 99% sure my nasal membranes have adopted these defiant particles and have begun incorporating them into my mucus. my sneezes are spicy... \n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/s/Jko8EBtvp9)  **Oct 21, 2024** \n\noriginal post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/1g4hkms/my_slow_cooker_smells_like_cinnamon_make_it_stop/ \n\nWelcome back to my cinnightmare. \n\nI had to drop off my ILs mail, so I checked on my lid. I was hoping that sunlight and fresh air would help, but my lid is not made of vampires. \n\nAccepting temporary defeat I moved the fight back onto home turf, and got a new set of supplies. Shout out to u/generic-curiosity who reminded me about the hydrophobic properties of my cinnenemy. With this knowledge, I was ready to reengage in this battle \n\nI armed myself with a bottle of isopropyl alcohol, a Love is Blind sized wad of paper towels, and…olive oil. \n\nI scrubbed with alcohol, then rubbed it down with the oil, then back at it again with the alcohol.  Out of context, that would make for an amazing party game. \n\nthis Sisyphean deodorizing battle will haunt my dreams for years to come. \n\nI don’t remember how many times I repeated this alcohol and oil endeavor, but I’m going to choose the number 6, because of the evil connotations of the number. \n\nMuch like my spirit, the smell has died down and has become a repressed whisper of the wild soul it once was. \n\nSatisfied that my slow cooker no longer bore the tonsil-coating scent of a season craft store mid-december, I went on my merry way. Ignorant, I Know. \n\nAs the days went on, and I continued to use more kitchen supplies, I began to think this was all in my mind – I just. Kept. Smelling. It. SOMEWHERE. \n\nLike any sane person I started sniffing around my kitchen like a tweaked out 2 legged bloodhound.  I had used a rubber spatula to stir my cinnncoction. Immediately binned it. I refuse to bend my will for the $2 spatula. And now, it will never see the light of day again, forever to think about how it failed to serve its culinary master. Forever to miss the hot broth it once knew. It must suffer in perpetuity for its betrayal. \n\nAnd I am NEVER using cinnamon again. \n\nthe apple butter tastes amazing. \n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP's OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**",

I count >150 comparisons being reported in this report, and they are still highlighting things at a significance level of 0.05.  This should be severely reduced to 0.001 or less for any legitimate significance.\n\n7) *ALL* of their amazing \"<0.0001\" statistics are uncorrected tests, not accounting for multivariate analysis.  IE) they are significantly explained by their covariance with other variables in the study.\n\nAll in all, this study is likely demonstrating an observable association that I suspect is largely caused by unaccounted-for covariates, and certainly almost all of the statistical significance save a few (like in the title) evaporates with a simple Bonferonni calculation.",

The mean total depression score was 26% lower for walnut consumers than for non-nut consumers. This association was stronger among women (32%) than men. The reason for this remains unknown. Lower depression scores among consumers of walnuts appear to be traced back to better concentration, higher energy levels, more interest in doing things, and greater self-control of rates of speech and movement. These depression-related characteristics are lower among nut and walnut consumers.",

        "body": "From the article: A common fatty acid in olive oil, as well as many other plant oils, has been found to stimulate the body's production of new fat cells, creating conditions that could – over time – lead to more fat storage and unintended weight gain. Until now, weight gain linked to this fatty acid was attributed to the high calorie content of foods that it's found in.\n\n\nThe University of Oklahoma researchers, along with Yale University and New York University medical scientists, have identified that oleic acid – a monounsaturated fatty acid broadly considered good for the heart and cholesterol, and a feature of the Mediterranean diet – can, in excess amounts, trigger the overproduction of a signaling protein known as AKT2 and subdue the activity of a regulating protein called LXR. The result of this saw an uptick in the growth of precursor cells that then differentiated into new fat cells.\n\n\"We know that the types of fat that people eat have changed during the obesity epidemic,\" said said Michael Rudolph, assistant professor of biochemistry and physiology at the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine. \"We wanted to know whether simply overeating a diet rich in fat causes obesity, or whether the composition of these fatty acids that make up the oils in the diet is important. Do specific fat molecules trigger responses in the cells?\"\n\nOleic acid, an omega-9 fatty acid, is the dominant fat in olive oil, but it's also found in canola, sunflower, avocado and peanut oil, as well as in many animal fats. And now, because oleic acid has been shown to extend oil shelf life, high-oleic versions of oils are widely used in commercial and fast foods.\n\nIn [this study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124725002980?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=94b680c0987adac6), mice were fed diets high in different types of fat – including lard, coconut oil and milk. Of the various fatty acids studied, only oleic acid triggered the body’s fat cell development pathway, which saw a boost in the production of adipocyte precursor cells (APC) and an acceleration in those cells maturing into fat cells. The same biological changes were also seen in isolated human APCs in the laboratory.\n\nUnder normal conditions, this process, known as adipogenesis, is natural, useful and regulated. Essentially, as our existing fat cells fill up, they signal for backup. Hearing the call, dormant APCs wake and convert into new fat cells to safely store more energy. This helps the body avoid overloading individual cells, which, if under too much pressure, can rupture and release fat into the bloodstream, liver and muscle, which can lead to serious health issues.\n\nThe researchers found that excessive oleic acid intake seemed to short-circuit this safety system, fueling the production of new APCs and activating existing dormant precursor cells, even when they're not needed.",

    "body": "I met my now husband about 15 years ago. I decided that I needed to cook a good dinner for him and impress him with my grilling skills.\n\nAfter perusing several recipes, I decided to make beer can chicken. If you don't know what that is, you basically shove a can of beer up the bottom side of a chicken and use the legs and beer can as a tripod to keep the chicken stable on the grill.\n\nI made a great rub and coated the chicken in a little olive oil and ALL the good spices. I was so excited for dinner. \n\nNow the thing is with beer can chicken...it's a set it and forget it kind of meal. You're not supposed to take the lid off the grill because it loses too much heat. \n\nSo things are going well. Chicken is on the grill. I make some delicious sides. Now husband comes over and I tell him I have great plans for us tonight. Chicken should be ready. I walk outside, take the top off the grill, and the chicken is crispy. Good to go.\n\nI go inside, grab a platter. He follows me out. I take the top off the grill. When I tell you that chicken burst into flames like it was ascending to hell, I'm not kidding. Now husband practically dies laughing. I practically die of embarrassment. \n\nWe ended up ordering pizza.\n\nTLDR: didn't realize indirect heat meant coals should be in a ring around the edge of a grill, not spread across the bottom. Sent a chicken to hell.",

So kakis and a button down or polo. I'm assuming you've read the title and see where this is going.\n\nSo after work one day the gf and I stop by Target on the way home to grab a few things. I'm wearing, you guessed it, a red polo with kaki pants. I also have an ID badge on my belt denoting \"communicator, Joe shmo police Dept\". \n\nGrabbed some olive oil, brought to my gf who told me she got some a few days ago. So I go back to olive oil aisle and put it back. I put it back in its proper place because I'm not an inconsiderate a-hole. Anywho...\n\nLady comes up to me and asks where she can find some brand dog food. I just thought she was asking for my opinion, gave her a general direction. She went off. Like five minutes later I'm looking at Harry's razors, and I feel someone poke me on my shoulder. I turn and find the lady standing there looking displeased. \n\nLady: m\nMy dog food wasn't where you said it was.\n\nMe: well, I dunno. I guess ask someone who works here. \n\nLady: I am, you.\n\nMe: nope, don't work here (turns and looks away). \n\n\nYes you do! You were stocking shelves!\n\nMe: yeah...don't talk to me.\n\nLady grabs my arms and pulls me to face her.\nYou ever get a sudden flair of anger? I did. Bitch touched me.\n\nLady: Young man, im a customer and you'd better--\n\nMe: Don't you fucking touch me! (my voice was a little raised now). Touch me again, you and I are going to have a problem!\n\nShe was obviously taken aback. She said something about me being fired and a manger. She scurried away. I found my girlfriend and we went to check out.\n\nAt this point it still hadn't really clicked that she thought I worked there. I just thought she was rude.\n\nWe get to the self check out and lady with a Target employee approach me and my girlfriend.\n\nLady: Thats him, that's your stock boy whom threatened me!\n\nMe: Wtf?! I don't work here lady, leave me the fuck alone.\n\nManager: (looking noneplused) You don't work here.\n\nMe: Nope, this chick started bothering me then grabbed me.\n\nGF: He doesn't work here.\n\nLady: Don't you lie to me. You were stocking shelves and told me where to get dogfood.\n\nMe: Leave me alone or were gonna have real problems!\n\nLady: How about I call the police and tell them how you just threatened me!\n\nMe: I fucking dare you! (I show her my ID badge.) Let's see how that works out for you!\n\n(I should mention the PD I worked for is in the same town as Target)\n\nThe manager takes the opportunity and just says, \"have a nice evening\" and motions the woman away, and she follows. \n\nShe just sort of gaped at me when she saw that I was in fact, not an employee of Target, but of the police department she was going to call on me. \n\nNot a big story with fireworks, but still one to tell. \n\nMoral: beware wearing red polos and stay thirsty my friends. \n\n\n*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*.*\n\nEDIT: Thank you all so much for your comments and upvotes! Didn't think my little anecdote would be received so well by so many. \n\nA friend told me he saw this on his r/popular feed, which is quite the milestone in my time as a Redditor.\nNow my final obstacle is to be guilded one day, so wish me luck.\n\nThere were a few repeating comments I did my best to explain, so I'll cover a few here.\n\nFirst, I'm not a police officer, I was a civilian employee of the department - a dispatcher. \n\nSecond, I don't believe I was too harsh. A bit curt and verbally aggressive, sure. Although I didn't appreciate her pulling at my arm and I don't think you would either. \n\nThird, while her grabbing is considered battery, I wouldn't have called the police on her. Worst case is i would have had the store do something. No reason to go overboard because she was being stupid.\n\nAnywho, thanks again!\n\n….......................*\n\nEDIT 2: I can't believe it! My first ever guilded post!\n\nI guess I finally get to say...\n\nTHANK YOU KIND STRANGER!",

We are fraternal if that makes a difference. She’s 5’5.5 and she was 135 pounds at the start of cross country season when we got our physicals but she’s visibly smaller now and I don’t know what she weighs anymore. For medical history, she gets migraines and has medicine for that.\n\nSo we are twins and we look super similar, it’s obvious we are twins, but I’ve always been shorter and skinnier. I was a lot smaller than her at birth and basically never caught up lmao. But that’s the only real difference physically. She always liked being the taller one because she’s 3 minutes older too. When we got our physicals in July though, she got super upset that I weighed 113 pounds and she was 135. She’s also two and a half inches taller than me though and the doctor said our weights were totally perfect. The doctor could tell she was upset and told her not to worry about her weight because she looks beautiful and she’s healthy, and she said she wasn’t worried but I could tell she was lying. And honestly the night before we had eaten at this Greek restaurant with massive portions and it was probably poop weight. Not to be gross. But yeah.\n\nA couple days later she asked our mom to buy grapefruit. Our mom is well meaning and overall a really good mom but she did modeling when she was younger and she’s a complete almond mom. Like she’s always on a diet and talking about how fat she is when she’s not. So she was super happy that Isabel wanted to eat healthier. Isabel explained this whole diet plan of only eating good foods and being super healthy. It sounded stupid to me but I wanted to be supportive. She said she wanted to get to 125. Which her weight before was fine but that was still pretty reasonable so I tried to be supportive.\n\nShe went unhinged. She started watching nutrition influencers on TikTok and insta. So she started off eating this diet of grapefruit and coffee for breakfast, a salad and half a cup of dry cheerios at lunch, and grilled chicken breast with honey mustard and grapes for dinner. After like two weeks of this I found her in our closet eating an entire sleeve of Oreos and a plate of nachos and a tortilla covered in melted chocolate chips, and she was sobbing. I told her she wasn’t eating enough and that’s why her brain made her do that. I helped her clean up and we went for a walk and I thought she was done with the diet, but then she was searching “how to prevent binges” which lead her to following this instagram model named Caroline Deisler, or something like that. Anyway she’s a vegan and then my sister decided this is her goal body and she’s going to be vegan too. My mom was super supportive of this. Over the last two months the amount she’s eating keeps getting less and less. Now she’s living off almost exclusively fruit and honey roasted almonds and coconut yogurt, with the occasional lemon juice and olive oil salad. She told my mom she doesn’t want “bad” food in the house. This sucks for me because I don’t want to live off of rabbit food, but also I’m really worried about my sister.\n\nShes doing some really weird stuff with her food. She chews everything so long it must be paste, she uses tiny plates for everything and refuses to eat off red or yellow plates, and she spends ages arranging her food in patterns. She won’t eat if she can’t drink water with it. She also barely goes to stuff with our friends and me anymore and she says it’s because she’s tired or has homework but she mostly avoids things that involve eating so I feel like that’s probably what she’s actually doing. Her times at cross country keep getting worse instead of better and she looks miserable when we’re running and she’s so angry lately, and I’m pretty sure it’s because she’s hungry. I keep telling my mom I think something isn’t right and she tells me jealousy is an ugly look.\n\nSo this all leads us to last Friday. We were at a football game with friends, and I forgot to charge my phone. I wanted to show one of our friends the dress I was wearing for homecoming because she wasn’t in the group chat, so I took my sisters phone. I opened her pictures to find the dress and there were pictures of her that she took in her underwear but they didn’t look like nudes, it was like she was trying to see how bony she was. And she looks awful. But I knew she would be embarrassed if our friend saw this and so I closed out of photos and opened safari to just Google the store I bought the dress at and it opened to this forum about eating disorders. I pretended I didn’t see it, I looked up the dress, and then I gave my sister her phone and tried not to act weird all night. So then in bed later I looked the site up.\n\nIt’s awful. It’s seriously awful. It’s people talking about losing weight and having competitions and posting their skinny bodies and wanting to be unhealthy. They share tips on not eating and eating less and not getting caught. I don’t know what my sisters username was, I didn’t have time to see so I couldn’t find her profile, but no one on the site was healthy. I was crying reading it because it’s freaking awful.\n\nSo the next day when we were walking home from the gas station I offered her some of my bar, and she said no. I asked again and she said no, she just wanted her Celsius. And I told her I thought she needed to eat something. She flipped out at me and told me to stop being pushy and weird and I told her I found the website. At first she said she was researching for a school project and I was like “Izzy what project we have all the same classes”. She got super pissed at me and she’s barely been talking to me all week and said if I tell anyone she’ll never talk to me again.\n\nI looked up eating disorders. I’m not trying to make this about me but it says they can be really bad for you and make you infertile. It looks like a big deal. And not eating can kill you right? People die of that. I’ve been an absolute mess for the last week thinking about this. She’s ignoring me acting like everything is fine and eating almost nothing.\n\nI’m sorry this got so long. I just don’t know what to do…she told me to let it go because she’s fine and just being healthier and she’ll increase her food when cross country season is done because she can’t run if she’s full. But that sounds…stupid. She told me everyone diets, our mom has literally always been in a diet, pretty much everyone in our friend group has been on a diet or tried to lose weight and I’m overreacting. This is the only place I knew I could ask doctors about this without having to tell them who I am.\n\nCould this make my sister sick or even kill her? Is it my fault because I’m smaller and she felt bad? How can I help her? She’s so angry and so mean lately and I’m really scared for her. I don’t want her to get hurt but I also don’t want her to hate me.\n\n***Some of OOP's Comments:***\n\nCommenter: if your mother won't help with this I'd get another trusted family member to help as well. This can be dangerous and sounds like an ED. You're a great sister for worrying about her and seeking help.\n\n>**OOP:** Is it dangerous enough to call our dad over? He’s like a Christmas/birthday dad\n\nCommenter: \\[...\\] You said your dad is a Christmas dad so I don't know how he can help being so far away but I'd consider reaching out to dad if your mom is unreasonable or minimizes what's happening.\n\n>**OOP:** That’s the worst part he’s not far away- we just only see him on our birthday and Christmas lmao. He lives like 2 miles away. I’ll try to find a time to talk to my mom when my sister isn’t around. The times I’ve brought it up when she’s around in the past they both accuse me of being dramatic and jealous. Plus my sister threatened to tell our mom I’ve vaped a couple times if I brought it up again 😬\n\nCommenter: You need to find another adult that's dependable. It doesn't sounding your dad is that present in your life\n\nIt doesn't sound like your mom cares enough or is too ignorant or just wants to cover her eyes and pretend everything is OK\n\n>**OOP:** My parents are super young and kind of immature. They’re both 33 and 32 so I try not to be too hard on them…like at least they didn’t delete us I guess? But also I kind of think maybe my mom has problems too and actually thinks it’s normal? I’ve just been really anxious trying to figure this out and I’m afraid something bad will happen to my sister if she keeps doing this\n\nCommenter: I don't blame you at all but they need to fucking grow the fuck up and be parents. You say you're 15.... so your parents had you at 18 and 17 respectively and I am assuming they are divorced or never married since they don't live together and your deadbeat \\[and I'm being kind here\\] dad isn't around enough to notice the problem or care. \\[...\\]\n\n>**OOP:** They’re not really bad or abusive but I think my mom almost sees us more like we’re all the same age than that she’s our mom? But yeah I really wish she’d be more of an adult at least for this\n\nCommenter: Do you have any other adults in your life that you trust that could help? An aunt or uncle, grandparents or teacher?\n\n>**OOP:** We don’t talk to my mom’s side of the family since we were like 5. My dad’s parents we know but not super well. But they’re not bad or anything so I think they might help. My sister seems like she really likes our math teacher. Would it be weird if told her?\n\nCommenter: I feel this. I'm a twin too, we are identical. My sister has had a lot of ups and downs with her mental health and it's the worst feeling to be there seeing it and not be able to fix it. Wondering why is she hurting so much when I am (comparatively) ok? Thinking that if I just tried harder I could somehow save her from this. It's not fair, but know that you can't fix this for her, you can just be there supporting her as she goes through treatment.\n\n>**OOP:** Yes that’s exactly it. Like I feel so guilty that she’s having this issue and I’m not… and then I wonder if it’s genetic and I’ll end up like that too? I don’t want to. And usually she’s always been honest with me and we don’t have secrets but she’s pulling away and saying we need space and our own lives now…\n\n**Mini Update in** [Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fr2tnp/comment/lpaeq83/:)**: 2.5 hours later**\n\n**OOP:** Tonight she’s been using this stepper thing to step up and down while we are watching a show and I didn’t say anything because I don’t want to make her suspicious or more mad, but then she kind of tripped on it and sat down and put her head in her lap and said she was going to throw up. I had her lay down and got her some water and a bucket but she’s all sweaty and said she doesn’t feel good and thinks she has a stomach thing…but could this be from her not eating? Is there a different way to help if she’s sick than if it’s because of the eating stuff? I was rubbing her back and it’s all bumpy and boney and I’m really freaked out\n\n*Blood sugar:*\n\nOur mom is asleep. I had to argue with her to get her to suck on a jolly rancher. Hopefully it helps the blood sugar thing if that’s it\n\n**Mini Update in** [Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fr2tnp/comment/lpbs1y6/:)**: September 28, 2024 (8 hours after previous comment)**\n\n**OOP:** After a little she started feeling better and went to bed. She’s still asleep but I can’t sleep\n\n**Another Mini Update in** [Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fr2tnp/comment/lpd3dk7/:)**: September 28, 2024 (5 hours later)**\n\n**OOP:** This morning she thanked me for helping her last night and told me she knows she’s being stupid and said she’d stop and begged me not to say anything. She promised she’d eat more and stop being weird about stuff. I don’t know if I should give her the chance or tell anyway…if I give her a chance and she doesn’t go through with it could something bad happen in that time?\n\n**Mini Update in** [Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fr2tnp/comment/lpddjnp/:)**: 1 hour later**\n\n**OOP:** I sent our cross country coach a text and asked if we can go get smoothies or something later. Hopefully she doesn’t think that’s weird. I just don’t want to talk where my sister might hear. She said she was going to do better and then she ate carrots for lunch\n\n**Update in** [Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fr2tnp/comment/lpf4qv7/:)**: 7 hours later, about 24 from OG post**\n\n**OOP:** Earlier this afternoon my sister fainted like a half hour after she took a shower and she wasn’t answering or waking up and so I freaked out and called an ambulance and she woke up by the time they got there but she couldn’t see anything at first and she hit her head. So now she’s mad at me and won’t let me see her and my moms mad because she said we could’ve just made a doctor appointment if I told her instead of going over her head and making a scene but I knew this was bad. And I know it’s horrible but I hope they don’t let her leave the hospital until she’s better. Thanks for answering my questions. I probably would’ve been too scared to call 911 otherwise. I knew she wasn’t okay.\n\n***Relevant Comments:***\n\nCommenter: You absolutely, unequivocally, did the right thing.  \n\nIf you are able to, I think it might be a good idea to reach out to the team that is seeing your sister and disclose this information. If you are worried about your relationship with her, you can ask them to please not tell her that you said this. She may very well try to hide her recent weight loss and her eating habits from her doctors, and it is incredibly important that they know about this. They may already suspect it or know it based on her presentation, but having your collateral information will be very helpful\n\n>**OOP:** The doctors at the hospital you mean? The paramedics asked me what happened and I told them I think she’s not eating on purpose and she’s lost a lot of weight. Would they know because of that or would I have to tell them again? Also the paramedics said her pulse was low, and her blood pressure. I don’t remember the blood pressure numbers but her pulse was 41. Is that why she fainted?\n\nCommenter: Her heart rate is likely due to nutrition issues and low electrolytes. Either way I'm glad you called the ambulance and took her to the hospital\n\nYou're handing this as well as you can and saved her life.\n\nWhere are your parents in this? Surely they must know now.\n\n>**OOP:** My mom knows. She’s here too. I called my dad and he was mad no one told him sooner\n\n**Comment** [Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fr2tnp/comment/lph1fmd/:)**: September 29, 2024 (Next day, day and a half from OG post)**\n\nCommenter: Nothing to apologize for. This isn’t your fault and you’re the only person in her life who recognizes this for the emergency that it is. Your mom and friends are gaslighting you and only enabling her restrictive eating and delaying her from getting help.\n\nI’m a critical care physician.  \nEvery once in a while someone like your sister comes to the ICU with life threatening complications from starvation. Everything you just described is very alarming. Can’t say medically if she has caused any significant or permanent damage to her body. She will reach that point If this continues. I think she needs help far beyond what friends, family and even her pediatrician can provide.this is they type of thing that requires everything from social workers, psychiatry, psychotherapy and an experienced pediatrician to really get her what she needs.\n\nIs there is anyone in her life besides your mom who uou can confide in? Could be a coach, a trusted teacher, guidance counselor, religious leader. I know you don’t want to go against your sister, but she isn’t in a state where she can make rational decisions for herself. She needs your help.\n\n>**OOP:** Thank you for this. It was a really long night just waiting. But she got admitted and finally said I could come be with her. I told the doctor everything I knew. She won’t eat anything. I called my dad and he and my mom are fighting about how she got this way. She said she doesn’t want everyone to be mad but she can’t eat\n\n**Comment** [Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fr2tnp/comment/lpl7hb0/)**: 12 hours later (2 days from OG post)**\n\n**OOP:** She got admitted here. There’s a lot of blood labs and they’re been trying to convince her to eat but she either doesn’t or she takes it and then flushes it down the toilet. I’ve been trying to tell them everything I can think of that might matter. I don’t understand why she’s doing this and I’m starting to feel kind of mad which I know it’s not her fault but it’s so hard to watch\n\n**Comment** [Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fr2tnp/comment/lplmzvt/:)**: 2 hours later**\n\nCommenter: I'm so sorry... she needs so much help. She's in the hospital and still refuses to nourish herself.\n\nHas she seen psychiatry yet?\n\nAre your parents actually starting to comprehend how serious this is? Or do they need another verbal splash of cold water?\n\n>**OOP:** My dad does. My mom just keeps pleading with her and suggesting giving her salads because it would be easier. The doctor said she’s going to get a tube in her nose if she won’t start eating. I’m not sure if she’s seen psychiatry, she’s seen a few people that I had to leave the room for\n\n**Update** [Comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fr2tnp/comment/lppfpsk/:)**: September 30, 2024 (Next Day, 3 days from OG post)**\n\n**OOP:** My dad made me go home with him to sleep but I got to skip school today. I think he thinks I’m doing the same stuff as her because he keeps pressing to me to eat and watching me when I am. In a little bit we are going back to be with her again though. I’m tired and I’m sad\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fugdhh/what_does_an_ng_tube_feel_like_how_long_does_it/) **1: October 2, 2024 (5 days since OG post)**\n\n**Title:** What does an NG tube feel like? How long does it stay?\n\nHi. I’m 15 and female, so is my twin sister who this is about. She wasn’t eating and lost a lot of weight. She’s 5’5.5 and about 105 pounds. She lost 30 pounds in 2 months. Now she’s in the hospital because she fainted but it’s been a couple days and she refuses to eat and keeps trying to pinch her IV and the doctor said she’s getting an NG tube. I had questions about everything but I didn’t want to ask them in front of her and scare her or have her doctor think I was being nosy or rude, so I wanted to ask here since last time everyone was helpful.\n\nWhat does an NG tube feel like?\n\nHow long does it stay in?\n\nWill she be able to mess with it?\n\nWhy is she just completely refusing everything now? Why doesn’t she just eat?\n\nWhen I was researching anorexia, which is what the doctor said she has, I saw it’s genetic. Does that mean I could end up like her too?\n\nHow long do you stay in the hospital for anorexia? I miss her being home with me.\n\n***Top Comment:***\n\n**DrSocialDeterminants:** It can stay for quite a while. I've seen people leave it for days. That said, she can yank it out at great pain to herself.\n\nI also remember your story as I was one of the docs that posted a response. I'm sorry to see she's still struggling. It's clear from your posts and updates that my concerns were correct and that she's very sick\n\nI would estimate she needs weeks to recover physically from how malnourished she is to get her stable enough to not collapse walking out of the hospital. However, I'm truly concerned that she's a suicide risk to herself as she's shown that even in the hospital, her refusal to eat would be dangerous. I suspect that she will likely be transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility to get more intensive therapy and potentially medications to address her other mental health concerns.\n\nShe's in it for the long haul. That said, even after discharge she will likely need years or therapy and support. She will always have a lingering struggle with food and body dysmorphia. She has a great sister to help support her though and that will be helpful in her recovery.\n\nI don't know the evidence for the genetic risks of eating disorders. We know that sometimes family history is important for things like depression and anxiety but thisnisnt my specialty. More importantly, it doesn't mean you're doomed to have this. I would instead focus my efforts on the environment.... thinking of how to have a healthy relationship with food and your body.\n\nI remember your earlier post about her getting upset that you weighed less. She was also getting her mom to support her dieting. You also said you mom constantly says that she's overweight herself and diets despite not needing to. The first thing for your sister is to work through why she's competing with you regarding weight. Honestly though... if your mom constantly says things like she has, then frankly she needs to stop as that's so unhealthy to say that it definitely can contribute to body shaming and displeasure at your body image.\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fyknt0/my_sister_is_refusing_to_sleep/) **2: October 5, 2024 (3 days later, 8 days from OG post)**\n\nHi…This is my third post. I’m really sorry. I’m just so scared and I don’t know who else to ask because hospital doctors won’t tell me much.\n\nMy twin sister is 15 and female. She went on this insane diet that turned into anorexia and she lost 30 pounds in two months. Then she fainted and got admitted to the hospital. She wouldn’t eat there either so they put a tube in her. She wouldn’t drink anything but she gets fluids in an IV. So now she’s just refusing to sleep. Because they can’t put that in a tube I guess. But all she does is cry and ask me the same questions over and over like if I’m mad at her and if I love her.\n\nShe had a seizure a few days back which was really scary. I don’t understand why she’s doing this and I’m really scared that she’s not sleeping on purpose. What happens if you don’t sleep?? Will you get sick? Can her doctors make her sleep? I don’t understand why she keeps refusing to do basic things. She can’t go to treatment until she’s stable and she says she wants to leave the hospital but it’s like she’s trying to die\n\n***Some of OOP's Comments:***\n\nCommenter: Hi. Dont be sorry about your questions, ask as many as you like!\n\nWhen someone doesn’t sleep for a while, it can mess with them... like making them feel confused or really sad or make it harder for the body to fight off bad things.\n\nThe doctors know what is best for her, and i promise that she is very good hands.  \nThey might have ways to get her to sleep, even if it means giving her some meds for a bit. They’re watching her closely, trust me - especially since she had a seizure.\n\nI know you’re scared and it’s totally okay and totally normal to feel that way. stay close to your sister, even if she seems distant, that can mean a lot for both of u. and dont forget yourself. if you can, talk to some adult you trust, maybe some of the doctors/nurses?\n\nAll the best to both of you.\n\n>**OOP:** I think it is making her feel really sad. She cries almost constantly. She keeps biting her lip to keep herself awake I guess, but it’s swollen and bloody. And when I ask her why she’s doing this and tell her it’s okay to sleep because I’m here too she just says she can’t\n\nCommenter: I just want to chime in here and say that your sister is not doing this to herself, she has a serious illness that results in behavioural changes. Your sister's brain registers food as a threat and she is responding to it in this way. I have seen people with eating disorders force themselves to stay awake because it may burn ever so slightly more calories, or in hospital, are afraid that if they fall asleep, someone may increase feeds/add something to them/push a bolus through, etc.\n\nSome people find it helpful to conceptualise the anorexia as separate to their loved one- or view anorexia as a \"terrorist\" who has taken their loved one hostage. Take care of yourself, and if you have capacity, spend time with your sister so you both remember who she is without the illness.\n\n>**OOP:** I’ve been playing cards with her, and brought our switches, and we are still doing our book club that we’ve done since we were in second grade. I pretty much try not to talk about it unless she brings it up because I don’t want her to feel like I forgot her.\n\nCommenter: You are doing all the right things! Keep on being you, and don’t forget to rest and recuperate yourself - this experience will be just as traumatising for you so be kind to yourself.\n\nI wonder if reiterating to her that you will protect her while she’s asleep, that you won’t let anyone touch her. Maybe holding her will help soothe her enough?\n\n>**OOP:** She just keeps saying she’s too cold to sleep and she wants to go home\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1g22key/how_much_medicine_do_you_give_patients_in_the/) **4: October 12, 2024 (1 week later, 15 days from OG post)**\n\n**Title:** How much medicine do you give patients in the hospital? Is my sister lying?\n\nMy sister is in the hospital for anorexia. She’s 15. She lost a lot of weight and she got a tube in her nose because she wouldn’t eat. It feels like everything has gotten worse since we came here, like being in the hospital made her sicker, and it’s my fault she’s here because I’m the one who called an ambulance on her. But I think I caught her lying about stuff again…\n\nIn her bag she has a ton of pills all in one of the pockets. I found them looking for her chapstick. I asked her about it and first she said it was Tylenol but I told her it doesn’t look like it and there’s more than one kind. Then she said they are just her prescription but she dropped the bottle and it broke so she put them in the pocket. But here’s the thing…it’s different kinds. There’s only one kind in a prescription right? So she’s lying? She’s just not taking anything they give her and she’s putting it in her bag? I thought in the hospital they only give you your medicine for the day, not the whole prescription.\n\nI don’t want to tell on her if she’s telling the truth and make her more mad at me and not trust me but it feels like she’s lying. I know some of the medicine is for sleeping and some is for depression. I don’t know about the other one. If she’s not taking it could it hurt her? Is it worth telling them about?\n\n***Some of OOP's Comments:***\n\nCommenter: She might be stashing the ones the hospital gives her. You need to tell her care team about this. Stashing pills is a warning sign.\n\n>**OOP:** A warning sign for what? It feels like she doesn’t want to get better. It’s like she’s sabotaging everything\n\nCommenter: *it feels like she doesn’t want to get better* yes, that’s what mental illness does. She’s in the right place with people who can medically take care of her, you did the right thing bringing her in.\n\nStashing pills can mean she might be planning to take them all at once to unalive herself. Please tell her care team.\n\n>**OOP:** Fuck. Okay. Thank you. Fuck this sucks.  \n*(later to the same commenter):*  \nSorry I shouldn’t have swore that much it’s rude and it wasn’t at you\n\n*How OOP feels:*\n\nIt’s so stupid and if I think about it I feel angry so I just don’t so I can’t feel anything. I hate this. I don’t know why she’s doing this when she was fine a few months ago.\n\n*Treatment center:*\n\nShe’s not even in a treatment place yet. They won’t take her because she isn’t stable. She’s in a normal hospital\n\n*She needs to be kept under constant observation:*\n\nA nurse was watching her because she kept messing with her tube, but she stopped doing that I think so they weren’t with her all the time the last couple days. But I told the nurse anyway about the medicine and she said she’d take care of it. It feels like the hospital is making her worse\n\n**Update in** [Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1g22key/comment/lrq3c3u/)**: October 13, 2024 (Next Day)**\n\nThe doctor came and asked about the pills. She had prescription water pills that weren’t hers, the sleeping medicine they’ve been giving her and thinking she’s been taking, and a stimulant. She won’t say where she got the prescription ones that weren’t hers.\n\nThe doctor told her they check all patients bags periodically if they come for mental health so thankfully she doesn’t know it was me that told on her. I asked why she’s doing this and she said she doesn’t know and keeps apologizing.\n\nI keep switching between being mad and being heartbroken. It’s hard to figure out how to feel when it seems like she’s doing it herself. I know she’s not. But there’s nothing tangible like a tumor or bad blood lab to blame and it’s hard to wrap my head around. Sometimes I don’t want to be here with her.\n\nShe told me she’s afraid they’re going to make her overweight and I’ll always be the prettier one and I don’t know how to respond to that stuff so I told her I’d like her no matter what and maybe I can eat a bunch of cake so I can be bigger and she can push me around in a scooter. I just miss her. My parents won’t talk about it other than blaming each other. My friends just want all the juicy details.\n\nI’m sorry for rambling so much…it’s just that there isn’t anywhere else anyone actually listens. I know she’s the one that’s sick and not me but it’s really hard.\n\n*Comments:*\n\nCommenter: I wanna give you a hug, you’re a sweetie and you deserve just as much care as you give others\n\n>**OOP**: I would totally take it. I don’t think anyone has hugged me since she got admitted. It’s like I’m invisible now\n\nCommenter: It can help to create some distance by remembering that it's the eating disorder that gets mad and doesn't want to get better. Behind that wall your sister is just sad, scared and sick. \\[...\\]\n\n>**OOP:** I’ve been trying to think of it like that. Or like she’s possessed. We’re Catholic lmao. But I just want her to be okay.\n\n*Getting therapy:*\n\n>My mom accused me of making it all about myself and my dad asked if I was going to starve myself too and if he should buy a second headstone when I asked about therapy but I found an online ai thingy that’s a little helpful\n\nCommenter: Frankly your mom's been in denial the whole time, which is ironic since she's probably a reason that contributed to your sister since you said your mom is superficial about body image.\n\nYour dad is out of line and what a rude thing to say.\n\n>**OOP:** I think he just can’t handle both of us being needy at the same time. He doesn’t really get why she’s doing this either\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1g5czoo/if_my_twin_sister_has_anorexia_could_i_get_it_too/) **5: October 16, 2024 (3 days later, 3 weeks from OG post)**\n\nI’m a 15 year old female. So is my twin sister, of course. She is really sick with anorexia. It started at the end of the summer and went downhill fast, she lost 30 pounds, and she’s in the hospital with a tube in her nose fighting every attempt to help her. It’s like she’s two people. And i don’t understand at all but she said she doesn’t know why she’s doing it either.\n\nI’ve been researching anorexia to try and understand and see how I can help her and I keep seeing article mentioning how there’s a genetic component. At first I kept thinking “that could never happen to me” but my sister thought the same thing and I don’t think anyone tries to be anorexic… I skipped meals a couple days and then tried fasting for a few to see if I could understand why she’s doing this and I guess i sort of felt proud that I was able to stick with the diet but it didn’t feel so good I would want to slowly kill myself in front of everyone I love over it….is there a chance this could happen to me too? As in am I at a higher risk of also ending up like her because of the genetic part? If so, is there anything I can do to prevent it? Watching her is so scary. It’s not even her anymore. She’s been swallowed up by the anorexia.\n\nAs a side note also…is there anything I can do to help her?\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gokcju/can_you_accidentally_make_yourself_anorexic/) **6: November 10, 2024**\n\n**Title:** Can you accidentally make yourself anorexic?\n\nI’m 15, female, 5’3 and 104 pounds.\n\nA bit over a month ago my twin sister got diagnosed with anorexia. She’s in a hospital now and getting better. I was really afraid when she got diagnosed that I would end up like that because I read it was genetic. I didn’t understand at all, I’ve never cared about my body and I still don’t…but I feel like I’ve been fixating on not becoming anorexic so much that I’m actually creating a problem. I went from 113 to 104 in the last month.\n\nI keep getting scared that I’m not eating enough so then I go and eat a lot, like panic eating to try and not under eat and I est so much that I feel sick and embarrassed and gross and at first I was trying to run it off but then I realized I could just throw it up….and I started doing that. I know it’s not good, obviously. And it’s super gross.\n\nBut does this mean I’m accidentally making myself anorexic because of how hard I’m trying to avoid it? I don’t care about my weight…I’m not trying to lose weight but I keep losing it anyway. I’m just stuck in this cycle where I feel scared that I’m not eating enough and I suddenly need to set everything but then after I feel so horrible and I want it gone. My mom keeps seeing that I’m eating a ton and telling me I don’t have to eat for me and my sister and that I’m going to get diabetes…I feel like this isn’t good but I don’t know who to ask about this because it’s going to sound so stupid when my sister was literally almost dead from starving herself to ask if I have an issue.\n\n***Some of OOP's Comments:***\n\nCommenter: Hey OP! I remember you and your posts. I’m so sorry you are struggling. There are a lot of ways that we can have a difficult relationship with food, and you have been through an ENORMOUS amount of stress in the last few months. What you are doing, as you guessed, is not healthy and can become an eating disorder on its own if you don’t get help. But the earlier you get help, the better the outcome. Can you ask your mom to get your own therapist ? If she’s not open to it, could you talk to a social worker at school or maybe at the hospital where your sister is?\n\n>**OOP:** Hi. I remember you too. I feel kind of stupid asking to see a therapist because I don’t want anyone to think I’m copying her or that I want attention :/ I’m really not, but it’s like it I can’t stop thinking about it and I forgot how I used to eat without thinking. But the place my sister is at had a sibling support group that I go to, maybe the therapist who leads it could help?\n\nCommenter: I just saw the sentence about the sibling support group, sorry! Yes, absolutely! Go talk to the therapist! I’m sure that you will not be the first sibling needing more help. I really think this is the best thing you can do.\n\n>**OOP:** I’m going to ask tonight if she can recommend anyone I could see and if she’d help me tell my parents\n\n*How sis is doing:*\n\nThank you. My sister is doing a lot better. She’s a lot less angry, and she talks about different stuff now. I feel like I completely forgot how I used to eat without thinking before and I forget to eat and then panic that I’m not eating enough and then overeat and then want it gone. I haven’t been feeling hungry at all. I’m hoping you’re right that when it’s further away it’ll be easier. I’m afraid I’m going to make things worse for my sister too if I start doing this. She already told me I look skinnier last time I visited :/\n\n**Editor's note:** OOP comment on this post on November 22, 2024\n\nHi. So this is about me. I just wanted to say my sister is okay. She’s not worse anyway. She still doesn’t really want to get better though because she doesn’t think anything is wrong. But physically she’s getting better I think. She looks better to me. Also I’m okay. I figured out how to stop throwing up. I made myself a meal plan and if I follow it I don’t feel super chaotic and anxious and I don’t end up doing that stuff.\n\n**Editor's note 2:** DrSocialDeterminants left a really educational and helpful comment but reddit kept deleting it.

It’s like I’m invisible now\n\nThis is quite literally one of the saddest, most heart wrenching things I’ve ever heard someone say in my 40 years on this earth.  \n\nOOP said her parents are really young. And I know that they say when someone has a child as a teen, they kind of freeze mentally at that age. But holy shit. Her mom is 33 years old and her dad is 34. GET YOUR FUCKING SHIT TOGETHER.  \n\nBoth of her parents are making this about themselves. They’re more worried about how it looks, how they feel, and how this will affect them/their lives, than either of their children. Which actually isn’t difficult to do when they quite literally are willingly incapable of, +/- have an anaphylactic allergy to, giving a shit about anyone other than their own selfish asses. \n\nOOP is more mature than the two of them combined. She has shown more emotional intelligence, and general intelligence than a lot of grown ass adults I know. She is quite literally, single handedly treading water to keep her and her sister afloat. She has done all of this with grace, kindness, courage, bravery, and sensitivity that are beyond amazing.  \n\n**OOP, if you stumble upon this, and read through the comments - I just wanted to let you know:**  You are an amazing young woman. I have two little girls. If they grow up to be half of the wonderful human you are, I would be elated.  You are doing, and have done, everything right.  But please, do not allow yourself to get lost in the shuffle. Obviously your sister is a priority - but that doesn’t mean your needs are any less important.  Your feelings, wants, needs, and concerns ARE important and deserve to be heard. \n\nAnd. Remember, the squeaky wheel gets the grease. If you’re being ignored, be squeaky. Like *REAL SQUEAKY* until your cry for help is heard and something is done about it.  If you’re told you’re just making this all about you, don’t listen to them. Tell them, “Yeah.  Well.  This IS about me right now. And I need help. So what’s your point?”  Never be afraid to advocate for yourself.\n\nAs I said, I am a mom to two little girls. I know very little about what your sister is going through. But. If you need a “mom-for-a-minute”, someone to vent to, ask random questions, or just need some support/encouraging words, message me anytime.  I’m no therapist, but I am good at listening. I’m not just offering to be nice. I mean it. I’m here if you need someone to talk to.  \n\nI will be praying for your sister and sending all the mom hugs and positive vibes I can muster, your way.  *Mom Hugs* 💜",

It usually depends on offers other brands are having, or perhaps if the product they want to advertise is new. \nAs many have said on this thread, it is illegal here to do any kind of commercial or advertisement regarding tobacco products OUTSIDE a tobacco shop. However  inside you can have TVs with advertisements (just stating the product and price, never with comments that might suggest that it is 'healthier' than other alternatives), floor vinyls, etc. You might sometimes even find a person (mostly young ladies) promoting a certain company and giving small presents if you buy something related to them. They are obliged by law to ssk if you are a smoker, and after you say \"Yes\" they can offer you to buy a product from their company. A nice tip is saying you are buying for someone else, technically they cannot keep offering you anything if the product is not for you.\n\nAaanyway, as part of those publicity campaings, the companies sometimes \"skip\" the stand at the shop (very costly) and just add the small present to the package itself. The thing is that MOST tobacco shops here will not give these presents as supposed; they remove the oil, lighter, small flashlight, bottle opener or whatever small item that specific tobacco has as the \"offer\" to then just keep it to themselves or give as presents to other guests (ones they know) or even sell it at the shop (highly illegal, but it happens a lot. Especially with the small lighters, all red, most shops will sell them for .50€ each when they get hundreds for free). \n\nIt also suprises me that some of the \"bigger\" presents that come when buying 10 packs or a big bag of hand rolling tobacco are things such as wine bottles, umbrellas, reusable water bottles, backpacks, tshirts.... Worth noting that it is never worth buying anyting extra just to get the present, as the quality is usually terrible. The only thing worth keeping for me has been a metal water bottle that was given to me by my boss when, surprise, they were removing presents from the packages to give to other customers.\n\n 'Picardía española' some might say; just a bunch of cheap asses if you ask me.",

Researchers evaluated participants’ eating habits through a validated food questionnaire and matched them with medical records, then followed them for a median of 13.5 years.\n\n  \n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40315790/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40315790/)",

    "body": "It finally dipped below 40 degrees for a few days here in South Texas, so I spent most of yesterday making everything from scratch, including learning how to separate a full chicken and making my own stock! \n\nI called my mom after looking up a few recipes to get a little guidance, and she walked me through some of the nuances standard recipes might miss. I also had to buy my first dutch oven, which gave me all kinds of foodie feels. \n\nIn between googling 'is skimming broth important' (see: superduperimportant.png) and making dough, I kept having flashbacks to when my mom would make this for us during the winter. I finally understood why it always took so long and why she only made it a few times a year. I honestly didn't think it was going to turn out nearly as good as hers but I was blown away after the first bite. The lightness of the dumplings, the consistency of the gravy, seasoning so perfect no adjustment was needed... I felt like [this](https://tenor.com/blhC9.gif) trying to fully impart to my boyfriend how the stars must've aligned above our home to transform my humble pot of chicken and dumplings into a southern ambrosia fit for the gods themselves. \n\nWhat dishes have you made from your childhood? How did it go?\n\nEdit #2: [for the naysayers claiming I made this up for karma, here are the stitched together vid clips I sent to my momma](https://streamable.com/w6qbuu) (no sound bc I was making a funny voice)\n\nEdit: had a few people ask for the recipe so here ya go! Obligatory apologies for mobile formatting. \n\nFor the broth and chicken:\n\n3 tablespoons of olive oil | 1 whole chicken, skin on, separated | Salt, black pepper and paprika (for seasoning the chicken, approx. 1 tablespoon each) | 1 large carrot | 2 - 4 stalks of celery (approx. 1 cup) | 2 yellow onions | 4 - 8 cloves of garlic, minced or pressed | 4 bay leaves | 1 tablespoon each of dried oregano, parsley, and rosemary (I used fresh herbs though, so I doubled the measurements) | 4 quarts of chicken broth | 1 quart of water | 1/4th cup flour | 1/4th cup corn starch | 1 cup heavy cream\n\nFor the dumplings:\n\n2 cups flour | 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon baking powder | 1 tablespoon each of salt, black pepper, and dried thyme | 4 tablespoons of butter | 6 oz heavy cream \n\n- heat up your dutch oven/stew pot and add your seasoned chicken. Braise the chicken pieces in the pot for about 8 mins each, then remove, allowing the meat to stick and form a nice fond on the bottom of the pot\n- roughly chop the carrots, celery and onions and add them to the pot. Let them sweat and soften for about 3 - 6 mins before adding in the minced garlic\n- once fragrant, add the broth and place the chicken back into the pot with the lid. Bring to medium heat and let cook for 20 - 30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through. This is also when you want to begin skimming the broth occasionally, and periodically adding in the extra quart of water\n- remove the veggies and chicken (I strained the stock after removing the chicken), then pull the meat from the bones (throwing away the skin) and place it back into the pot. If you let the chicken cook long enough, it should fall off the bone easily. \n- this is also when I add in the parsley/oregano/rosemary/bay leaves in a steam basket and suspend it in the stock. Simmer for 30 minutes to an hour, then remove. Take a quick seasoning check here and add salt if needed.\n- combine the flour, cornstarch and heavy cream into a slurry, adding in some of the hot stock. When smooth, add to the pot and stir, leaving the lid off so that it can reduce and begin to thicken (about 15 - 20 minutes). Be sure to keep checking for scum to skim before you add the dumplings!\n- Take the remaining 2 cups of flour, baking powder, salt, pepper, and dried thyme and whisk them together, making a little well. Add the melted butter plus remaining 6 oz of heavy cream and slowly combine, folding until dough just comes together. Over mixing the dough will result in denser, chewier dumplings. You can add a bit more cream if the dough is a little dry.\n- using a teaspoon, scoop off some of the dough and drop it into the still simmering stock, working around the pot. Cover and allow to simmer for 20 more minutes, until dumplings are floating. Remove from heat and let cool.",

        "body": "My mom was super good at just making things up with what she had in the pantry. There was one she used to make a lot, which we always called the “worm hotdish” because it had chow mein noodles, which looked like worms to us when we were kids. (A hotdish is a casserole to non-Minnesotans). \n\nIt took forever to get her “recipe” from her because she never measured or wrote anything down. Literally her instructions were “add milk until it looks right”. What??? But I finally got her to estimate the amounts. I’ve made it several times now and it turns out perfectly! It’s a big hit with my new husband also. \n\nI’m so glad I persisted because my mom passed away two months ago and it would have broken my heart even more for all of her self-invented recipes to die with her.\n\nETA: wow! This comment blew up more than I expected! Thank you to everyone who both congratulated me on my wedding and also shared condolences for my mom. It’s been a roller coaster of a year, that’s for sure. \n\nA few have asked for the worm hotdish recipe, so here it is. It’s pretty easy. My mom would have loved to know that this got out there! So if you make it and like it, please let me know! As I said, this is just something she made up from the things we had in our pantry. \n\nIngredients:\n\n1 1/2 pounds of hamburger\nOnion powder\nSalt\nPepper\n2 cups instant rice (has to be instant!)\n1 can of corn (don’t drain the juice!)\n2 cups of milk\n2 cans of cream of mushroom soup\n1 can of chicken broth\n1+ cup chow mein noodles\nSoy sauce (I use low sodium)\n\nI make this in a Dutch oven, since I can just use one pot for it all. But you can always brown the hamburger in a pan and then transfer to something that can go in the oven.\n\n1. Brown the hamburger. “Season well” with salt, pepper, and onion powder. \n\n2. Transfer to an oven safe dish if needed. My mom would always spray the pot with cooking spray, but I’ve found I don’t need to. \n\n3.  Add the rice, corn (including the juice), milk, soup, broth, about 6 “good shakes” of soy sauce, and about 3/4 cup of the noodles. It will look like a soupy gray mess at this point, that’s normal. Don’t be scared. \n\n4. Bake at 350 for an hour. Cover the top with the rest of the noodles and bake for another 5 minutes. \n\n5. Serve with soy sauce. I like a LOT on mine, but adjust to your taste. It’s excellent left over also.",

My mother being a saint who never slept would pre-make meals and freeze them when she had time to save us from another night of scrambled eggs or hot dogs done in the microwave, but there were a few dishes my dad actually knew how to whip up including a shepherds pie that his mother used to make him when he was growing up in London. Never knew the amounts of what to put in, just went based off smell and taste. One time we were out of potatoes (a cardinal sin in our household) but we had some sweet potatoes and so he improvised. Call us crazy but a baked shepherds pie with sweet potatoes blows away the ol' faithful version with russets. Seriously, if you ever need a cozy dish, I urge you to try it. My father passed away shortly after I graduated from college and it took me a while to make the dish but now anytime I miss him it's my go to. That's the magic of family recipes, even when they aren't there anymore it still feels like he's with me when I scoop myself a big bowl with some extra cheese and watch the Simpsons like we used to do when it was just the two of us",

It's something my grandma taught my dad who taught my mom, my siblings and me. My grandma now tells me I outdid her on the rice, and she's one of the most narcissistic people I know. \n\n\nI'm not sure what part of the world this recipe comes from, but it's actually kinda simple, and tastes a million times better than just basic steamed rice. \n\nThe magic of this recipe is getting the ratios and math correct. So for 1 cup of uncooked rice, it's 2 cloves of garlic, about 2-3 tablespoons of Canola oil, and 1 cup plus 1/4 cup of water. \n\n\nHowever, the amount of oil I end up using, depends on which pot I'm using. I need enough to coat the bottom, and then add a tablespoon (2 if it's a big batch).\n\n\nWhen I measure the water, I do 1:1 with water to uncooked rice, plus 1/4 cup to 1/2 a cup. When it's in the pot, the waterline should be about 1 inch above where the rice is. \n\n\n\nBefore I put the rice in the pot, I heat up the oil with the lightly smashed garlic cloves with a bunch of salt. Once they are nice and sizzly, I add the rice, stir the rice in the garlic and oil to cost every grain. Then I add the water. \n\n\nI boil the water down until the water line is just bubbling above the rice line. Then I cover it and put it in the back burner on low. I have a little diffuser plate I put it on, but if I'm in a kitchen that doesn't have one, I'll just stack one of the stove grates to do a double one on the spot where I steam the rice. \n\nI let it sit there for 30-40 minutes and it comes out perfect every time. I have done it so many times I can do it in my sleep while blindfolded. I have it down to a total science. We use this recipe for anything we have rice with. We out stir fry on it, mexican food in it, and almost anything that has a good sauce for rice. (It's always about the sauce!) \n\n\nAnyways, making a family recipe to perfection feels so freaking great. Be proud as hell for being awesome!",

    "body": "**I am not The OOP, OOP is** u/More-Size-6733 \n\n**OOP has since deleted her account** \n\n**I am leaving my husband without telling him why** \n\n**Originally posted to** r/Marriage \n\n**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!Infidelity!< \n\n**Thanks to u/Twigz8771 for suggesting this BoRU** \n\n[Original Post](https://reddit.com/r/Marriage/s/6X0TqESi7s)  **Sept 6, 2023** \n\nI found out that my husband was planning to have an affair with a woman from his company that works for another branch. He visits that branch twice a year. And she visits his twice a year. They have been flirting for 6 months and they were going to sleep together last Friday when she was here. \n\nI sent my husband a picture of me with new lingerie about an hour before her plane landed and he was supposed to pick her up. He had already told me he was working late and then going out with his colleagues for drinks and not to wait for him. I wrote that this (I) was his desert after the lobster pasta I’m making (he loves lobster pasta). He was home within the hour. When we were together he said he was glad he chose to come home. \n\nInstead of working you mean? I should hope so! \n\nYeah, I mean of course, he said. \n\nI don’t have the energy to confront him or tell him that I know. I don’t want to hear excuses and apologies. The lease is in his name because I moved into his apartment when we got married and we still haven’t found “our” home that we’re saving for. So I don’t need to worry about that. Our savings and joint accounts are easy to access and divide and I can do that the day before leave. I have found a subcontract today on an apartment for 12 months, if I get picked I can move October 1 already. Then I will serve him the papers and tell him the reason is that I’m bored with our relationship and I have fallen out of love. I think it’s better that way. \n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS** \n\n**WHEN ASKED HOW SHE IS SURE OF HER HUSBAND PLANNING AN AFFAIR/OR IS SHE SEARCHED HIS PHONE** \n\n>It started with a lot of pop up about hotels on our ipad. Combined with a him being busy and texting more than usual I became suspicious so I went through his phone. They have been talking all summer about meeting for sex. She lives 3h plane ride away so now I know why he was searching hotels in our and her city\n\n\n[Update 1 - I have just signed a sublease. I’m leaving my husband at the end of the month](https://reddit.com/r/Marriage/s/KPkIz2VZuX)  **Sept 10, 2023** \n\nHi everyone! I hope you remember be. Before diving in to my boring life, I want to ask you who reached out and asked for my recipe for my lobster pasta. How was it? Please share your dishes with me☺️ \n\nI have now signed the lease (it is a sublease with 12 months then month to month afterwards until the owner can sell his apartment). I’m so happy that i have found it. I feel like I’m born again. I have felt nothing but pain and despair for weeks. Now I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. \n\nI’m still resolute to just leave and not tell him the reason why. I think this is the only way I can cope with this pain without losing my mind or my dignity. \n\nMany asked how that would make me look. Honestly, I don’t care. Those who love me, love me unconditionally and those who judge me, is their opinion really worth it? \n\n[Update 2 - Filed for divorce. First night in my apartment](https://reddit.com/r/Marriage/s/uEwtPuofwA)  **Sept 30, 2023** \n\nI have been on high drive this weekend. No moving on Sundays but I was fortunate to get the keys Thursday. I have been discreetly packing my clothes and yesterday (Friday) the moving truck came and took all my stuff and my furniture that I bought to my new place. I changed my address to my parents’ because I don’t want my husband to know my new adress if he googled it. When I was in my new apartment it looked gloomy and so tiny. I just broke down crying. Like I have postponed my tears and now I could finally feel safe to be vulnerable. Around dinner my husband started bombarding my phone because I left him a note that I was done with our marriage and filed for divorce. \n\nMy plan was to never speak to him again but today after a million messages and missed calls I folded and answered him. He was very confused and in total panic but I just kept saying that I wasn’t in love with him anymore and that I was bored in our marriage. He was confused and begged me to come home and explain. Then he started trying to find other solutions. Maybe I was bored with my job or with our apartment. Maybe we could move and start anew somewhere else. I couldn’t hold my tongue and just said “yeah maybe we can move to [city where the other woman lives], that would be very convenient for you”. He was silent for a second then asked what I meant. “You know, because the main office is there and you have better chances to advance in your career?” Silent again, then he said listen, I don’t care about my career now. I care about you. I love you and I can’t lose you. He will do anything to make me happy. I said the only thing was that he left me alone and understood that it is over because the sooner he realized it was over the better. I hung up. \n\nI probably need a new phone number because I don’t trust myself not answering him again I was so disappointed in myself for talking to him when I decided I didn’t. My parents in law have called and wanted an explanation and I just said that I wasn’t in love anymore and wanted an out. They’re both confused. \n\nAll and all it is better than them knowing the real reasons. Id rather have them confused than sorry for me or worse try to explain his behavior and ask me to forgive him. I’m way better this way \n\nI don’t think there’s a need for lawyers. We don’t own anything together and we don’t have children. I have already taken my half of the savings etc and I never stood on the lease of his apartment. I see no reason to have lawyers. I already sent my divorce papers to court and with or without his signature I will be divorced (in 6 months if he signs too, in 1-2 years if he refuses to sign and I submit a new application every 6 months). \n\n[Lobster pasta recipe](https://reddit.com/u/More-Size-6733/s/euKmeXJ5UP)  **Sept 30, 2023** \n\n2 people \n\nLobster stock \n\n2 lobster shells 1-2 shallot 1 garlic clove 1/2 fennel 1 carrot 2 tablepoons olive oil 1 tablespoons tomato paste 1 dl white wine 200g canned cherry tomatoes 1dl water 1 teaspoons cayenne pepper Salt \n\nAfter straining the stock \n\nAd saffron, 2 dl heavy cream and lastly cognac (or any brandy) ad the pasta and lobster meat. Parsley, cherry tomatoes and sugar snaps (if you want that) \n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP**",

No one needs to know your personal business as to why your relationship ends.  If she wanted to respond the way she did, so be it.  He chose to go outside his marriage and have an indecent relationship with another woman and probably would have only been sorry if he got caught and not that he committed infidelity. So, IMO, she took the first step and decided to leave something she didn’t feel right in.  People can say that she should have communicated with him but he did her a disservice by not communicating issues on his end that eventually led him down the path to an affair.

It details 8 methods for preserving and protecting foods, and it's a follow-up to my post last week on [acidity](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/m06qvh/acidity_is_not_a_single_flavor/).\n\n^(Disclaimer: This post was written while consulting reams of regulatory and industrial food safety documents, but I’m not an expert. If you disagree with anything, please comment with a source so I can research further. Thanks!)\n\n# WHY CARE ABOUT FOOD SAFETY?\n\nThe CDC estimates that foodborne illnesses cause 48 million people to become sick, 128 thousand people to become hospitalized, and 3 thousand people to die each year in the US alone.\n\nThese illnesses occur after harmful microorganisms (e.g. molds, bacteria, and parasites) or viruses (e.g. norovirus) contaminate food. Norovirus, salmonella, and clostridium perfringens are the most common known pathogens each year, and foodborne illness from *unknown* pathogens are four times as common. Meanwhile, illnesses such as botulism are infrequent but deadly.\n\nWhen you consider that the average person in the US is primarily eating consumer goods that have passed the standards of the FDA, these numbers are staggering. With our regular consumption of highly engineered products, it can be easy to carry on without realizing how and why specific foods are safe and for how long.\n\nAs a home cook, you probably deviate from FDA guidelines all the time. But you can only be so ambitious before you drive off the rails of presumed safety and enter dangerous territory. That’s where this guide comes in.\n\n# FOOD SAFETY PROCEDURES\n\nContamination from pathogens that cause food spoilage and foodborne illness can occur prior to, during, or after the cooking process. And contrary to popular belief, many of the worst pathogens cannot be seen, smelled, or tasted.\n\nFood safety procedures are our best defense against these pathogens. They aim to either:\n\n* **Kill or remove** ***existing*** **pathogens in food**. These pose the most immediate risks.\n* **Prevent the growth of** ***new*** **pathogens in food**. This is especially important for foods that you aren’t eating right away (e.g. food you are storing or cooking over multiple hours).\n\nYou’re probably familiar with some food safety best practices (e.g. avoiding the temperature danger zone). But you’re probably also aware of seeming contradictions to those best practices (e.g. *why can bread or jam be kept in the temperature danger zone?*).\n\nIn the content that follows, I attempt to equip you with what you need to know to put it all together and make sense of these seeming contradictions. Specifically, we’ll cover the 4 primary methods for preventing foodborne illness:\n\n1. **With cleanliness**: Some harmful microorganisms and viruses can’t spoil food if you wash them away.\n2. **With temperature control:** Harmful microorganisms and viruses can’t survive at very high temperatures, and microorganisms struggle to survive at very low temperatures.\n3. **With acidity:** Harmful microorganisms can’t grow under highly acidic conditions.\n4. **With water activity**: Harmful microorganisms can’t grow with low water activity.\n\nI’ll detail other methods as well in less detail. The guide will start with the most commonly-used methods, though I have a hunch that the later methods (e.g. water activity) will be more useful to my audience. Let’s do it.\n\n# 1. FOOD SAFETY THROUGH CLEANLINESS\n\nThis is the most boring and obvious food safety method, but stick with me. This method deserves top billing because it is the best means for preventing norovirus, which is the leading cause of foodborne illness.\n\nNorovirus primarily spreads through surface-level food contamination (e.g. via fruits and vegetables grown in contaminated water or via shellfish harvested from contaminated water) and people (i.e. others already infected with norovirus). Simply maintaining clean hands, a clean prep station, and clean equipment can make a huge difference in preventing spread of the virus.\n\nNote that this advice does not apply to washing chicken. Washing chicken can actually *increase* bacteria risk (by spreading salmonella to parts of your kitchen that are not typically heated to salmonella-killing temps). Which brings us to...\n\n# 2. FOOD SAFETY THROUGH TEMPERATURE\n\nPathogens struggle to survive at very low or very high temperatures.\n\n***To prevent the growth of new pathogens***\n\nAs a rule of thumb, new harmful microorganisms can only grow between 40ºf and 140ºf. That’s why we call that range the **temperature danger zone**. Food that is not otherwise preserved should stay out of the temperature danger zone (either warmer or colder). If your food *must* be in the temperature danger zone, it should be there for less than 2 hours total (including the time to warm up or cool down your food).\n\nThat means you can pretty much keep food above 140ºf indefinitely without new harmful microorganisms growing. It also means you should keep perishable foods below 40ºf, though some common microorganisms can still survive this. Pyschrophiles (which is greek for ‘cold loving’) can survive up to -4ºf, and they are often why your food spoils over time even when it is in the fridge.\n\nIn reality, the stated temperature danger zone includes a margin of error. In California, for example, food safety guidelines deem the temperature danger zone from 41ºf to 135ºf. In Australian regulations, foods can be kept below 140ºf for 4 hours (rather than 2) provided they are used or served immediately.\n\nThe differences lie in risk tolerance. The actual temperature where harmful bacteria fail to grow is closer to 126.1ºf, but this temperature is dangerously close to the temperatures where bacteria grow most rapidly. Without a highly calibrated and consistent heating device, keeping your food at that low a temperature is dangerous. For this reason, you’ll often see recommendations where food can be kept at 130ºf if cooked sous vide (on a calibrated device) but 140º otherwise.\n\n***To kill existing pathogens***\n\nMany of a food’s existing pathogens will not immediately die if exposed to temperatures below 40ºf or higher than 140ºf. For that, you generally need either a higher temperature or more time at a controlled temperature.\n\n* **Higher temperature**: Each pathogen has a temperature at which it will immediately die. Salmonella will die when exposed to temperatures exceeding 165ºf. That’s why we were traditionally told to cook a chicken to 165ºf. Norovirus dies at 145ºf. The bacteria that causes botulism can survive temperatures up to 250ºf (which is why low acid shelf-stable foods are canned under extreme heat).\n* **Not as high temperature + more time**: If you can hold food at a consistent temperature, you can rely on temperature *and* time to kill microorganisms at a lower overall temp. For example, salmonella will also die when brought to 140ºf and then kept at that temperature for 30 minutes (or at 130ºf for 6 hours). That’s why we can cook chicken sous vide at lower temperatures than 165ºf provided we cook it for long enough. [Here](https://www.douglasbaldwin.com/sous-vide.html)’s an extremely detailed guide if you want to learn more about this time/temp relationship for different foods.\n\nDifferent foods require different temperatures to pasteurize because foods have varying risk levels when it comes to their existing pathogens. Chicken, for example, is highly susceptible to salmonella while beef and fish (and even duck) are not. This is in part because beef and fish generally come from whole-muscle cuts and so are less exposed to surface contamination. Ground beef, meanwhile, is not a whole-muscle cut, and so surface-level pathogens are distributed throughout the meat. Chicken is also more susceptible to salmonella because it is generally raised in nastier conditions than beef, fish, and duck.\n\nKeeping food at sub 40ºf temperatures (including below freezing) isn’t a great way to kill existing microorganisms and viruses, because some of the worst bacteria (such as the ones that cause botulism) and norovirus can survive at extremely low temperatures.\n\n***To kill parasites in raw fish***\n\nParasites (such as those found in raw fish) can also survive at low temperatures, but they *do* die after enough time below freezing. Specifically, these parasites die after either 7 days at -4ºf or 15 hours at -31ºf. Your freezer likely doesn’t go that low.\n\nIn many jurisdictions (even some home to 3 Michelin star sushi restaurants), it is illegal to serve raw fish without freezing it first. Industrial flash-freezers are used by the restaurant industry to freeze fish at extremely fast speeds to maintain quality.\n\nDifferent fish have different parasite risks based on their build and dietary habits. That’s why shellfish, certain species of tuna, and certain types of farm-raised fish are often exempt in jurisdictions where freezing raw seafood is otherwise required.\n\n# 3. FOOD SAFETY THROUGH ACIDITY\n\nHarmful microorganisms cannot grow under highly acidic conditions. This is particularly relevant for sauces, drinks, and fermented foods.\n\n***To prevent the growth of new harmful microorganisms***\n\nAny food substance that measures 4.6 or lower on the pH scale is generally considered acidic enough to prevent growth of harmful microorganisms and can be kept at room temperature.\n\nThis is why you can ignore the temperature danger zone for your vinegars (2.5 pH) and lacto-ferments (3.6 pH) with adequate acidity. While acidophile bacteria (like lactobacillus) grow at this temperature, they are generally safe.\n\nIf you’re making a dressing, hot sauce, or lacto-ferment, it’s worthwhile to measure the pH before you deem the food shelf-stable. Thankfully, measuring pH is easy and pH strips are super cheap.\n\nIf you make a sauce that doesn’t measure to 4.6 pH, you can simply add more vinegar or acid powder until the pH measures low enough.\n\n***To kill existing pathogens***\n\nAcidity is not an effective means for killing harmful microorganisms or viruses. Instead, acidity merely slows their flow; as soon as microorganisms are returned to neutral water, they regain mobility.\n\nThis is why it’s a common misconception that ceviche is “cooked” by citrus juice. The proteins are denatured as if they were cooked, but existing bacteria won’t die.\n\n# 4. FOOD SAFETY THROUGH WATER ACTIVITY\n\nHarmful microorganisms cannot grow with low water activity. This is particularly relevant for low acid foods, dried food products, nut butter, miso, garum, ganache, and jams.\n\nWhat’s water activity? It’s not moisture content. Instead, water activity is how free the water in a food is to be utilized by other stuff. Since microorganisms need water to function, when the water in food is bound to other ingredients (such as salt or sugar) in a way that microorganisms can’t utilize it, the microorganisms can’t function. Picture water in a bowl as totally free, but water in a sponge as partially bound by the sponge.\n\n***Measuring water activity***\n\nWater activity can be measured with a machine: a water activity meter. Water activity meters produce an output that is a ratio between 1.0 (high water activity) and 0 (no water activity). A water activity of 1.0 means that the vapor pressure of the food is equal to the vapor pressure of pure water. A water activity of 0.8 means that the food has 80% of the vapor pressure of pure water.\n\nMost foods have a water activity above 0.95. Fresh meat and vegetables have a water activity of 0.99.\n\n***To prevent the growth of new harmful microorganisms***\n\nGenerally, items with a water activity level of 0.85 or lower don’t require refrigeration. Mold growth is still possible (though difficult) at water activity levels as low as 0.6, but the FDA only enforces 0.85. This is why you can store soy sauce (0.8) and peanut butter (0.7) at room temperature.\n\nYou can get away with higher water activity levels if keeping your food out of the temperature danger zone. For long term storage in a fridge, it’s still recommended to keep water activity levels below 0.93 (the level where the bacteria that cause botulism fail to grow).\n\n***To kill existing pathogens***\n\nLike acids, low water activity does not kill existing microorganisms or viruses.\n\n***To decrease water activity***\n\nThere are many ways to decrease the water activity of your food:\n\n1. **Adding salt:** Salt is the primary reason why soy sauce is self-stable. Enough salt has been added to soy sauce that the liquid cannot be utilized by harmful pathogens.\n2. **Adding sugar**: Sugar is the primary reason why candies or low-acid jams are shelf-stable.\n3. **Adding other humectants**: Specialized products can decrease water activity without adding saltiness or intense sweetness. Shelf-stable ganache, for example, often utilizes one or more of glucose syrup, sorbitol, dextrose, or glycerol to reduce water activity without making it too sweet.\n4. **Freezing**: Water activity decreases as temperature decreases. Freezing foods will prevent future microorganism growth.\n5. **Removing water content**: Completely removing moisture (e.g. via dehydration or freeze-drying) is a straightforward means to reduce water activity.\n\n***To achieve low water activity without a water activity meter***\n\nWater activity meters are very expensive, but there are multiple methods for safely reducing water activity without a water activity meter. I'm not going to share these here because this is already very long, but feel free to visit my blog if you're interested.\n\n# 5. FOOD SAFETY THROUGH OTHER MEANS\n\nI’ve described the most common methods that home chefs might use to rid their food of unwanted microorganisms and viruses. But there are other food preservation methods as well:\n\n* **Alcohol**: High alcohol percentages destroy bacteria. 70% alcohol is enough to destroy many harmful bacteria upon contact. Lower alcohol percentages will prevent future growth, but the specific percentages for this job are very dependent on other factors.\n* **Packaging techniques**: High temperature canning or aseptic packaging techniques are means to create a hermetically sealed environment where no bacteria exist and no bacteria can enter. These techniques involve sterilizing (via heat in excess of 250ºf) both the container and the food inside such that the product can be kept at room temperature until opened. This is essentially the same approach as confit food storage, too.\n* **Osmosis**: Osmosis can destroy certain bacteria. For example, via osmosis, salt helps to destroy certain bacteria in the early days of a lacto-ferment before the acidity has decreased enough to kill the other unwanted bacteria.\n* **Oxygen or lack thereof**: Bacteria and molds are either aerobic (need oxygen) or anaerobic (need absense of oxygen). When you submerge foods in liquids in a lacto-ferment, you’re preventing aerobic bacteria and molds from taking hold. This is partly why a homemade miso might grow mold on the top but not further down. Some of the worst bacteria — such as those that cause botulism — are anaerobic, so I’ve added a section on anaerobic environments below.\n\n# ON COMBINING METHODS\n\nThe above techniques can work together to achieve added effectiveness, reduced salinity or acidity, or less stringent temperature requirements. This is how something like shelf-stable low sodium soy sauce is possible. For example, foods with pH of 5.0 are shelf stable when water activity is 0.9 or lower.\n\n# ON ANAEROBIC ENVIRONMENTS\n\nBotulism is rare, but it can be fatal — so it’s worth spending a bit of time on avoiding the contributing bacteria: clostridium botulinum.\n\nClostridium botulinum is anaerobic: it needs the absense of oxygen to survive. Cooking environments that lack oxygen include liquids (e.g. brines or oils), sealed cans, and sous vide bags. Any time you store foods like vegetables (e.g. garlic), fish, and meats in these environments, you need to pay particular attention to time and temperature (or acidity) to prevent clostridium botulinum from taking hold.\n\n***To kill clostridium botulinum***\n\nClostridium botulinum dies at much higher temperatures than other harmful bacteria. To reduce clostridium botulinum to safe levels, bring the food to 250ºf (or to 167°f for 520 minutes, 176°F for 75 minutes, or 185°F for 25 minutes).\n\n***To prevent the growth of clostridium botulinum***\n\nThe best way to avoid botulism growth is to keep your food out of the temperature danger zone. This means that storing garlic in olive oil is not a good idea.\n\nEven foods stored in the refrigerator are at risk of future clostridium botulinum growth if the bacteria was not completely destroyed before refrigeration. Foods kept in anaerobic environments should not be kept at at 38°f for more than 30 days or below 36.5ºf for more than 90 days.\n\nAlternatively, you can prevent future bacteria growth by ensuring the food has a pH lower than 4.6. Lacto-fermentation for example is an effective means to prevent botulism in anaerobic environments. Acidity is why you can store that garlic in vinegar with no issues.\n\n# ON TAKING RISKS\n\n>*I've long believed that good food, good eating, is all about risk. Whether we're talking about unpasteurized Stilton, raw oysters, or working for organized crime 'associates’, food, for me, has always been an adventure.*  \n>  \n>— Anthony Bourdain\n\nI still eat raw fish when I can buy it fresh. I still use raw egg whites in my cocktails. And I still like my pork chops cooked a lot closer to medium rare than medium.\n\nUltimately, you can’t eliminate the risk of foodborne illness. But by equipping yourself with an understanding of the possible dangers, you can make more informed trade-offs between danger and deliciousness. And when you’re serving others that might have different risk tolerances, you can adjust your approach as needed. Best of luck, and enjoy the adventure.",

Not to mention prior to the invention of refrigeration.  Where all markets had chicken, pork, beef and fish out in the open regularly.\n\nAs for food prep, washing chicken and other meats in a mixture of salt and water is the standard for all Asian kitchens (even some here in the States) before cooking.  It’s traditional and practical, having worked for these cultures for millenia before rigid standards were adopted.\n\nI’m curious why these millions of people don’t normally get sick from having their food in danger zone temps for longer than hours at a time.  Have their microbiomes developed resistance to foodborne illness, or are they just lucky?",

It was at the humans’ clutches that the traumatized refugees were nursed back to health. They risked life and limb, and lost hundreds of ships in pursuit of our survival. How could they reconcile what they’d seen with the prisoner’s narrative?\n\nThe primates had loathed every aspect of the cattle ship, and acted distraught at the condition of the victims. I had wondered how one could tell when a predator was truly hungry, until I saw the darkness in their eyes that day. There was a bottomless abyss of rage inside their pupils; it was a much-needed reminder of human volatility.\n\n*My service on this vessel was for nothing,* I bemoaned. *What if humans decide to give the cattle back? Have I just helped the Arxur land a game-changing ally?*\n\nThe door to my quarters clicked open, and a weary Carlos strode in with a vegetable platter. He placed the tray on the bedside table, without any sort of apology. The food was soaked in some clear fluid; it felt viscous against my claws as I poked it. Had the omnivores coated the plants in an animal secretion? Maybe it was saliva, or worse…ugh.\n\n“Why the fuck are these vegetables wet?” I snarled, with as much hostility as I could muster. “Disgusting.”\n\nCarlos crossed his arms. “It’s olive oil, Sovlin. Relax. You might even like it; lots of healthy plant fats.”\n\n“I don’t want anything from you...predator.” I grabbed an orange-colored slice, and flung it at his cheek. The human barely reacted, only wiping the oil off with his chest-pelt. “If you still feel empathy, shoot me now. Before I watch your kind turn on every species with a semblance of decency.”\n\n“You’re overreacting. And you are *not* going to refer to me as ‘predator’ again.”\n\n“Why not? You defended the fucking Arxur, then accused me of deception! I don’t want to see your face.”\n\n“Just listen to me, alright? Sixty seconds.”\n\nRenewed disgust flared in my chest, as the guard’s binocular eyes pleaded with mine. I knew humanity didn’t want sapient livestock of their own, but defending the act made them equally culpable. No moral race would rewrite the tragedy of first contact and the unspeakable losses that befell every species.\n\nThe image from my nightmare, of Carlos roasting me over a fire, seemed much more realistic. He just proved that he could see Gojids as food. This man…beast was a traitor to sapientkind, and yet, I had grown attached to him. What happened to throwing the Arxur in the cattle pens, ‘where they belonged?’\n\nI slashed my claws across a pillow several times, and struggled not to turn them on the human. “I will never agree with you. Don’t waste your breath.”\n\n“I’m not asking you to agree with me. I’m asking you to understand.” Carlos eyeballed the decimated pillows, as fluff was flung across my form. “Look, I listened to your spiel on torturing an innocent human, and tried to empathize with you. Don’t you think you can at least try to see where I’m coming from?”\n\n“The grays are your fellow predators. They’re more like people to you than us.”\n\n“This isn’t about the Arxur, Sovlin. It’s about the Federation and how they’ve treated us. The prejudice and the hatred.”\n\n“That is because of the grays. They won’t stop until we’re destroyed! Erased!”\n\n“But can’t you see how it looks from our side? Why we would think you’re capable of killing and terrorizing predators, when you’ve been hellbent on our extinction since you discovered us?”\n\nI chewed at my claws, considering the welcome that humanity had received to the galaxy. Governor Tarva had made them aware of the Federation’s extermination plans; the only reason their species still lived was due to misinterpreted sensor data. The second their survival was discovered, the entire organization convened to discuss a raid on Earth.\n\nThere were entire religions formed around the eradication of predators, including the one on my world. Most individuals the UN tried to contact rejected the idea that humans could be civilized. This was typically due to the belief that their ilk were incapable of empathy, cooperation, or basic bonding. My experiences proved the error of that prior research.\n\n*In Carlos’ paws, I would definitely resent the Federation. Maybe it would seem within the realm of possibility, that we had done a similar thing to other predators.*\n\n“I guess. But I know better than to believe an Arxur’s lies,” I growled. “However bad you think they are…they’re worse.”\n\nThe human lowered his eyes. “I’m not saying Coth is telling the truth. I’m saying he could be, because I know how much you hate our existence. I’ll believe whatever the evidence says.”\n\n“Then I’ll help you prove it wrong. Only because I am sorry for what the Federation has done to humans. I regret how much it has soured your opinion of us…and I know my part in that.”\n\n“That’s all I ask. Are we cool?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Good. Because the captain wants to see you, and I don’t want to explain that you’re pouting.”\n\n“I am not pouting!”\n\nThe predator’s lips adopted a slight curvature, which seemed indicative of amusement. I was beginning to understand how Slanek could read emotions in their snarls; it was just a way of compensating for their missing tails. Did humans ever envy that additional appendage that the rest of us took for granted? It was a miracle they were so graceful and balanced without it.\n\nI shoveled a pawful of vegetables down my gullet, then dismounted from my bed. Carlos steered us back toward Monahan’s office, and we traversed the ship corridors in a comfortable silence. Amazement rippled through me, as I realized my spines were lying flat. The second I noted my proximity to the predator, they returned to full bristle.\n\n*Yikes…that is starting to hurt. Why did I have to think about it?*\n\nThe doors to our destination slid open, and distracted me from the latest dose of fear chemicals. The UN captain was reviewing one clip when we entered, a curt exchange between Coth and Ross. Her eyes were bloodshot, like she had been poring over footage all night. Humans could be obsessive, that was for certain.\n\n“—want peace? What do you see as acceptable end conditions for the war?” the Terran interrogator asked.\n\n“You don’t get it. There is us and them.” Saliva oozed from the reptilian captain’s fangs as it spoke. “There can only be peace when every Federation planet is dead. That is acceptable.”\n\nRoss narrowed his eyes. “What if that is not acceptable to us?”\n\n“Then you’re stupider than I took you for, and you’ll die with the Federation. You can watch the prey-folk neuter your race before your extinction.”\n\nCaptain Monahan punched some notation into her holopad. Her sigh sounded flustered, but she didn’t seem concerned by the extermination threat. If I didn’t know better, I would think that question had been aimed at finding out if diplomatic avenues between us and the grays were possible.\n\n“So there would be no room for negotiation?” the UN interrogator pressed. “Humanity cares for one alien species above all others. They are a part of our pack, and we will not abandon them.”\n\nCoth thought for a moment. Its pupils darted from side to side, as if it were scanning its memory banks. The cold intelligence on display was appalling, and the Terrans’ reckless divulgence alarmed me. Humans were painting a target on Venlil Prime, if they publicized that alliance to the enemy.\n\n*Poor Tarva. The species she saved from certain death is trying to get her killed in return. Careless, idiot monkeys.*\n\n“The Venlil,” Coth decided. “You’ve got to be kidding. That explains their thwarting what should’ve been a simple border raid.”\n\nRoss was quiet. The human maintained eye contact, and waited for the prisoner to continue. He did not confirm or deny the reptilian’s guess, which was affirmation of itself.\n\nThe Arxur slammed its snout against the table. “One of the weakest, most frightful species of them all. The Venlil are beneath you!”\n\n“That is for us to decide.”\n\n“Surely you see that they’re a liability to you? What use could they be? You referred to them as packmates, not food or slaves. That means equals.”\n\n“I meant what I said, Coth. An attack on them is an attack on us. We would die for them, happily.”\n\n“But why?”\n\n“Because they defended us from the Federation, despite the fact that we’re predators. They were the only ones who helped us. Humanity would never repay such a debt with anything less.”\n\nThe Arxur shook its head, huffing with disgust. The abomination was repulsed by the interrogator’s soft rhetoric; this was Ross’ worst miscalculation yet. Still, it was a relief to hear that the humans would stand by the Venlil, if nothing else. I thought they were ashamed of their prey friends for a moment.\n\nA growl rumbled in Coth’s throat. “What is it you’re asking? We could discuss sparing one species, if that’s what you require to join us.”\n\n“That, and the release of every Venlil held as livestock, unharmed,” the human barked.\n\n“You expect us to give up millions of cattle we already have? We’re starving as is. Surrendering any of our existing food supply is a nonstarter.”\n\nCaptain Monahan tapped a button on her console, and the video feed paused. I knew she was the one who directed the interrogator to barter over lives, like any mundane commodity. She hadn’t even reacted to the premise of Venlil as food. These familiar faces were leaning into their predator roots a bit too much, ever since they started interacting with the grays.\n\nFortunately, this foray had gone nowhere; that last statement sealed the finality of a diplomatic impasse. The Arxur would never part ways with their precious quarry, by Coth’s own admission. Regardless, the offer to spare the Venlil further harm was empty talk. The predator would say whatever it thought afforded the best chance of escape.\n\nWould the humans abandon this folly now? It was insulting that they would even pose such questions.\n\nMonahan sighed. “Well, it’s a start. The Federation said the grays were incapable of negotiation.”\n\n“You’re negotiating on whether your *best friends* deserve to have their pups tortured and hunted for kicks?” I spat incredulously.\n\n“Sovlin! You are out of line.” Carlos tugged at my scruff, which snapped my attention to his flabbergasted expression. “She doesn’t answer to you. You said it yourself.”\n\n“It’s alright,” Monahan growled. “If we rescue every enslaved Venlil, I don’t imagine Tarva will care how we achieve it. Especially if that option would negate years of suffering for those people, and save Earth significant loss of life.”\n\nThe UN guard narrowed his eyes. “There is a reason we get along with Tarva. Her government is actually reasonable.”\n\n*Implying that mine is not.*\n\nIrritation swelled in my chest. “So you’re really moving forward with this plan?”\n\n“Nothing has been decided, Sovlin, because it’s not my decision. My job is to weigh options for the UN, and to see if talking is even a possibility. Turns out, it just might be,” the Terran captain replied.\n\n“You didn’t even mention Gojids, or any other species to Coth. Let’s say you save the Venlil. Then, you’re just gonna let everyone else rot?”\n\n“Humanity does not believe any sapient deserves such treatment. We would never be involved with or agree with those practices.” Monahan raised her eyebrows, emphasizing her predatory gaze. “However, if we can only save one race, you should understand why the Venlil are our top priority.”\n\n“It’s still wrong. I refuse to help you trade lives… and bargain with those demons!”\n\n“Good thing that’s not why I summoned you, then. Now that we control the cradle, we’d like your help with the Gojid refugee crisis. They belong with their colonies or the Federation, but it’s not so simple.”\n\nThere was no need for further explanation from the captain. I grasped the dilemma that humanity was facing. It wasn’t as easy as flying this ship to the nearest Gojid colony and dropping them off. An inbound Terran transport would draw shoot-to-kill missile fire, no matter how slow their approach or polite their hail. The same problem would occur at any Federation outpost.\n\n*Using the Venlil as a courier may not work either. They’re considered predators by association, at this point.*\n\nHowever, with the humans potentially in cahoots with the Arxur, we had to get the Gojid refugees out of their custody at once. Judging by the reaction to Coth’s interview, the primates were susceptible to corrupting influences. It didn’t take much to warp their good intentions, and rope them into a dastardly scheme.\n\nThe more I pondered it, the enemy’s motives could stretch beyond escape. The offer of an alliance might be genuine, since the UN impressed so thoroughly in their early engagements. Humans had the power to decide the conflict for either side, and would only grow more dangerous with time.\n\nThe Federation needed to straighten up our act, and make sure the Terrans stayed in our corner. I had to do whatever was in my power to convince our galactic allies not to follow Gojid mistakes. Antagonizing Earth made the child-eaters look more palatable, even to noble soldiers like Monahan and Carlos. Adding a second predator to the Arxur side would turn this war into a demolition.\n\n“Then we contact both my people and the Federation,” I decided. “I still have some sway.”\n\nMonahan grimaced. “How do we speak to your people? Your settlers might need to relocate; we don’t have the resources to protect this region long-term.”\n\n“I’ll tell you how to reach Gojid government channels. If they still exist, that is… be warned, they probably don’t. The last I heard, the designated bunker was looking shaky.”\n\nCarlos rubbed his neck anxiously. “Doesn’t your Prime Minister hate us?”\n\n“Piri had a change of heart. She would be a useful witness with the Federation, regarding this whole debacle. Short of that, I’m probably your best mouthpiece. You know, being one of the few surviving and well-known Gojids.”\n\n“You’re the best? We’re doomed,” the UN guard groaned.\n\nMonahan chuckled. “Let’s see if the PM’s alive before we pronounce our political death, Romero.”\n\n“Look what you’ve got your captain thinking. Political death?” I glowered at Carlos, knowing intimidation would have no effect. “Thanks for the vote of confidence.”\n\nHe flashed his teeth. “No problem!”\n\nWhatever the Terrans might think of my reliability, the remnants of the Gojidi Union needed to do our part. Right now, the Venlil were the only incentive for Earth and her citizens to risk their hides. That needed to change, before it was too late.\n\nI was going to impress upon anyone that would listen that humans were a species worth saving; even if we were saving them from their predator selves.\n\n\\---\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/u19xpa/the_nature_of_predators/) | [Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/wwko7b/the_nature_of_predators_39/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/x2eklf/the_nature_of_predators_41/)\n\n*Early chapter access* *on* [*Patreon*](https://www.patreon.com/spacepaladin15) | *Species glossary* *on* [*Series wiki*](https://www.reddit.com/r/hfy/wiki/series/the_nature_of_predators)",

    "body": "It's safe to say falafel has taken the world by storm. Other than Hummus, it's the most widely known Middle Eastern food and for good reason. The bite sized fritters are extremely crisp and if done right, they're packed full of flavour. Apart from being vegan, they're also incredibly cheap to cook and so they make for a great filling meal on a budget. It's my opinion that falafel made with fava beans are better than the more common chickpea falafel ([Photo proof here](https://imgur.com/a/NzlQGMs)), and it may just be the original ingredient historically used in falafel. It's a matter of contention that can cause rifts between Egyptians (Fava falafel) and Levantines (Chickpea falafel), however [competitions](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/04/the-falafel-battle-which-country-cooks-it-best) and [critics](http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20190715-does-egypt-have-the-best-falafel-in-the-world) have confirmed this [over](https://pulses.org/updates/488-winner-of-london-falafel-festival-competition-recounts-event) and [over](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/en-espanol/sdhoy-egypt-wins-inaugural-london-falafel-festival-2016may04-story.html) again. The resulting falafel have a [crispier exterior, fluffier interior, lighter texture](https://imgur.com/Sp2caGH) and are just way more flavourful. To top it all off, they're [a lot easier to cook](https://imgur.com/fnAhQnb) and if you use this recipe, you can say good bye to falafel that fall apart when frying. \n\n#### As always I have a [full video recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdGMnAt2sRY) where I go into all the details and show off the special techniques that I mention below. If you enjoy the post I'm sure you'll also like the video.\n\nIf you just want the recipe ctrl+f for \"Ingredients\"\n\n## What is Falafel and how is Taameya different\n\nIf you've not had falafel before; they're deep fried fritters that are [usually made from ground chickpeas](https://zaatarandzaytoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-21-at-17.46.46.jpg). This Middle Eastern food is as synonymous with the region, as Pasta is to Italy, and it's become one of the most popular vegan foods in the world. Traditional falafel is made with lots of fresh herbs and onions, which give them a bright green colour as well as a fresh and herby flavour. For the most part falafel is considered a breakfast or lunch food, and most people in Egypt (and the Levant region) will eat [falafel sandwiches](https://imgur.com/qgFhLfT) at least 2-3 times a week. The popularity comes down to a few factors, the flavour, it's price and how filling it is. Firstly it's extremely cheap to make falafel, and while you might get charged $7-10 for a [good falafel sandwich](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-sFqzHGi3qqWyysQx6EYDZSy1KY=/1400x1400/filters:format(jpeg)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13689423/Zooba_4.jpg) (about £8 in the UK), they usually cost about 10c or less in the Middle East and you can probably make 40 pieces for less than $5 ($1 in the Middle East). Secondly, they are packed full of flavour, all the herbs and onions give them a fresh taste, while the addition of coriander, garlic and cumin give them the perfect amount of spice. Finally they're a nutritionally dense food which help keep you full, you've got a decent amount of fibre and protein, but also quite a lot of macro-nutrients and let's not forget the fat from their frying.\n\nEgyptian falafel (or as it's called in most of Egypt, Taameya) is a bit different from the falafel you're probably used to, as nearly all falafel sold in Europe and the US is Levantine falafel. The main difference is that it is made with [split fava (broad) beans](https://foratasteofpersia.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DSCF5930-scaled.jpg) rather than chickpeas (garbanzo beans) and this has a significant impact on the texture of the falafel. If you've ever tried to cook chickpea falafel yourself, you'll know that when the chickpeas are ground they develop a [super fine chopped texture](https://www.seriouseats.com/images/2016/03/20160323-falafel-recipe-01-composite.jpg) that almost resembles bulgur. It can sometimes have a hard time binding together which can lead to them falling apart when you fry them. To get around that, many people add binders such as flour or eggs to their falafel, but that has the negative effect of making the centre of the falafel dense and stodgy. Fava beans on the other hand [turn into a paste](https://imgur.com/bvtCkf1) when you process them. Rather than having very finely minced chickpeas as the base of your falafel, the fava beans are already bound together and so they are able to hold their shape naturally. The fava bean batter also ends up wetter than the chickpea batter, this causes more steam to evaporate when frying which gives it an airy texture. The traditional way of making Taameya involves grinding the beans in a mechanical pestle and mortar, [which also has the added effect of whipping air into the batter](https://youtu.be/c_AU4Sc_fMQ?t=185). To emulate this you can use the beater attachment on a stand mixer, which will [incorporate even more air](https://imgur.com/N7mx3En) and you'll end up with falafel that are light enough to float when frying (they'll still be great if you dont do this).\n\nApart from the texture, Egyptian falafel also tastes different from Levantine falafel. In Egyptian falafel, Kurrat (a species of wild leek native to Egypt) is used in place of the onion, and it imparts a leek like flavour with sweet and mellowed onion notes. To replicate that flavour, a combination of Spring Onions and leeks work really well. In terms of herbs, the batter also needs fresh coriander, parsley and garlic, then it's seasoned with Ground Coriander, Cumin, and Chilli powder. As opposed to the [ball shape](https://imgur.com/tGgWzEu) of most falafel, Taameya is usually shaped into a [hockey puck](https://imgur.com/op2g5nS), and the exterior is coated with sesame and coriander seeds. This shape means you get more crispy surface area but it also allows the insides to cook quicker (they also fit better in sandwiches). Of course this can still be made into the classic ball shape, and the great thing about this batter is that you can just [use an ice cream scoop](https://imgur.com/fnAhQnb) without manually shaping to get your falafel in the hot oil.\n\nThere's a few other types of falafel that we make in Egypt, but the one I think you should know about is stuffed Taameya. These are filled with a spicy onion filling that is made by sweating onions with Harissa and Tomato paste. When placed in a sandwich, they have that perfect spicy balance that you'd usually try to get by adding hot sauce. We also make a Taameya omelette that we call Egga, this is just Taameya batter mixed with a few eggs before frying. It has a strong herby flavour in comparison to a regular omelette and it's a good way to use up any leftover batter. The best way to serve Taameya is in a sandwich. These are typically made with a flatbread similar to pitta, and are accompanied by a tahini sauce and a simple salad. We usually eat this with salty turnip, carrot and cauliflower pickles called [Torshy](https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000628636335-wiqf3p-t500x500.jpg) (Torsu in Turkish), or some pickled fried aubergine. \n\n## Cultural Context\n\nThere are a lot of theories about where and how Falafel or Taameya originated, and it's a very charged topic with most countries in the Middle East claiming to have invented it. The truth is no one really knows where falafel originated but it's very likely that it has an [Egyptian Origin](https://www.historytoday.com/archive/historians-cookbook/falafel). Many Egyptians will say that falafel is a Pharaonic food and that the consumption of fava beans was common place in ancient Egypt, however the practice of deep frying falafel would have been difficult without refined oils. Another favourite theory is that it was first eaten by Coptic Christians as a meat alternative during their fasts, but there isn't any evidence to back this up. The most likely theory is that was invented during the British Occupation of Egypt as the first recipe for falafel appears around this time. One historian claims it may have been inspired by the Indian dish parippu vada, which is like a falafel but made with green peas. This theory holds a lot of weight with me, particularly because the British occupation of Egypt also lead to the creation of [Koshari](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/ik05j7/koshari_is_an_egyptian_dish_that_exemplifies_the/), which itself was an Egyptianization of the Indian dish Kichidi. \n\nThe theory goes that as falafel spread outwards from Egypt, the ingredients that were used also changed based on their availability. The chickpea replaced fava beans in the levant and the spices changed with it. If you're wondering why you've never heard of fava bean falafel, it's probably because nearly all Middle Eastern restaurants in the US and Europe feature a Lebanese menu.\n\n## Flavour Profile\nThis recipe will make Taameya with a herby and fresh flavour that is way beyond anything you could buy premade. The Coriander, parsley, spring onions and leeks all merge together to give the falafel a bright and strong herb flavour with notes of sweetness from the leeks. The cumin and Ground coriander give it that background heat flavour (not spicy) and if your Ground Coriander is very fresh, it will also give a tart citrussy background flavour. You'll also notice this in the topping which coats the exterior of the Taameya, and combined the sesame seeds it adds some crunch.\n\nIn terms of texture, the Taameya is very light and fluffy. The interior will be airy and a bright green colour, whereas the exterior will be crisp and dry making for a satisfying bite. Adding them into a sandwich with some Tahini sauce, and a tomato and cucumber salad turns them into a sensational meal. I'd recommend using fresh homemade pitta bread for the sandwich and making a tahini sauce with lemon and garlic.\n\n## Ingredients:\n\n### Taameya Batter\n* 400g Split Skinless Fava beans. You need the [bag on the left](https://foratasteofpersia.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DSCF5930-scaled.jpg) not on the right. The left has the skins removed and if you make this with the skins the recipe WILL NOT work\n* 100g Spring Onions  \n* 100g Leeks  \n* 50g Coriander leaves\n* 50g Parsley  \n* 4 Cloves of garlic  \n* 2 Tsp Ground Coriander  \n* 1 Tsp Cumin  \n* 1 Tsp Cayenne  \n* 2.5 Tsp salt  \n* 1l (1 quart) vegetable oil for frying  \n\n### Harissa Filling\n* 1 Medium Brown Onion  \n* 1.5 Tbsp of Harissa  \n* 1.5 Tbsp of Red Pepper or tomato paste  \n* 1 Tbsp of Olive Oil  \n* 1/4 Tsp Cumin  \n* 1/4 Tsp salt  \n* 1/4 Tsp Pepper  \n* 1/4 Tsp Ground Coriander  \n\n### Topping\n* 1/4 Cup Coriander seeds  \n* 1/4 Cup Sesame  \n\n## Directions: \n\nI highly recommend watching the video for more precise directions and because there are some techniques for shaping that can only be explained visually https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PdGMnAt2sRY\n\n### To make the falafel batter:\n1. Wash your split fava beans thoroughly with cold water, then place in a bowl and cover with a large amount of water. Allow them to soak for a minimum of 8 hours until doubled in size  \n2. Once doubled in size, drain the fava beans and set them aside  \n3. Wash your leeks, spring onions, coriander and parsley, then roughly chop them up to a managable size for your food processor. Use the white part of the leek and while of the spring onion\n4. Add all of the greens to your food processor and add the beans on top (The weight of the beans will help force the herbs into the blade, and it's a lot quicker than putting the herbs on top of the beans)  \n5. Process everything until a finely minced paste forms (about 2-3 minutes), making sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl a few times. Once it looks homogenous and fairly well minced add the salt and spices  \n6. Continue processing together thoroughly until well combined then set aside  \n\n### To make the stuffing:\n1. Chop your onion into a small dice, then place in a pot over medium heat with 1 tbsp of olive oil  \n2. Saute for about 5 minutes until the onions start to soften then add the Harissa, Red Pepper paste and the seasonings  \n3. Add a small amount of water to form a sauce, then allow it to cook down and thicken (about 15 minutes of cooking time)  \n4. Repeat adding water and allowing the topping to reduce until the onions and sauce are cooked through  \n\n### To make the falafel topping:\n1. Using a pestle and mortar, lightly crush the Coriander seeds till you can smell their aroma. You should split most of the seeds in half but you don't want to grind them into a powder  \n2. Combine the coriander seeds with the sesame and it's ready to use  \n\n### To whip up the batter:\n\nAdd about a quarter of the batter to a stand mixer, and whisk it with your paddle attachement on medium speed for about 5 minutes. When it is light and fluffy it's ready to be used. Use the whipped mixture immediately as it will deflate quickly. If you don't have a stand mixer, you can use a hand mixer, or the whisk attachment on your food processor. A blender may also work and manually whisking it might help. If you can't do this step at all, you can add a 1/4 tsp of baking soda to each cup and a half of batter and whisk it in. That will help fluff it up slightly  \n\n### To shape the falafel:\n1. Wet the palm of your hand or a piece of parchment paper, very lightly  \n2. Place about 2-3 Tbsp (or 1 ice cream scoop) of Batter on the paper/your hand then lightly flatten it using your other hand. Apply very little pressure as you don't want this to end up very thin  \n3. Wet your second hand and press it into the topping, then lightly press the topping to the batter so it sticks  \n4. Flip your Ta'ameya onto your second hand or another piece of parchment paper then apply the topping to this side as well  \n5. Fry the ta'ameya within 5 minutes of shaping otherwise it will deflate\nNOTE: If you are doing this on your hand directly, you'll have to put them in the oil straight away. This can be a bit dangerous as you'll need to get your hand very close to the oil, but if you're comfortable, this technique works amazing. See [the video](youtube.com/watch?v=PdGMnAt2sRY) for the visual technique.\n\n### To shape the falafel the easy way:\n1. Using an ice cream scoop, fill the scoop with batter, then scrape off any excess  \n2. You can dip the top of the scoop into the seeds or you can add them to the scoop before filling it  \n3. Release the falafel directly into the oil  \n\n### To stuff the falafel:\n1. Repeat steps 1-2 from \"To shape the falafel\", using about 2/3rds of the batter amount  \n2. Place about a teaspoon of filling in the centre of the batter and flatten it out  \n3. Add the remaining 1/3rd of batter on top then join the two sides together  \n4. Add the topping to both sides or leave plain to differentiate it  \n\n### To fry the falafel:\n1. Heat your oil to 160c or 320f, then add your falafel in  (I'd recommend using an oil thermometer here, too hot will undercook the falafel and too low will allow it to absorb more oil)  \n2. Once in, baste the top immediately with hot oil so it solidifies. I'd recommend using a spoon to splash them with oil and this prevents the falafel from deforming or falling apart  \n3. Fry the falafel for 2-3 minutes on the first side  \n4. Flip over once browned underneath then fry for another 2-3 minutes  \n5. When that time is up, fry it for 2 more minutes on each side  \n6. Remove from the oil with a spider and drain, before placing it on a paper towel lined tray to dry for a few minutes  \n7. Serve within 5 minutes and enjoy  \n\n### To make a fantastic falafel sandwich\n1. Make homemade pita, store bought is crap and this falafel deserves better  \n2. Make a simple Egyptian salad, with roughly chopped cucumber, tomato, spring onion, parsley and season with lemon juice, olive oil and white vinegar  \n3. Make a tahini sauce according to this [recipe](https://youtu.be/Y7r9HAcR2RQ)  \n4. Split open your pitta bread, and spread in a layer of the tahini sauce  \n5. Add a couple tablespoons of salad to the bread, and some optional salty pickles  \n6. Add a couple of falafel pucks to the bread and enjoy  \n\n## Notes\n* Iraqi falafel is made with a blend of chickpeas and fava beans, you could replace half the fava beans with chickpeas here if you'd like to  \n* Substituting the fava beans with chickpeas will still produce a nice tasting falafel, but you'll have to work harder to keep it together  \n* You should be able to get the split fava beans at any Middle Eastern or South Asian grocery store",

She was a lot older than I am. (I'm 23 and she is 34). I wasn’t looking for anything serious. Just a casual hookup. I made it clear for her. The date went well. She said she is also not looking for anything serious. She is going through a divorce and she has no child. We talked and then she invited me to her place. And we fucked. The next morning I had to go to work. \n\nShe woke me up and said I could use her shower. She made breakfast for me. This was weird because usually when I have a one night stand I am out of that place the next morning. Anyways, she invited me to have breakfast with her. Then when I was about to leave she handed me a lunch box and 20 dollars. She said she had a great time last night and I should travel safe. I did not want to take it but she insisted. She then kissed me on my cheeks and said \"you are such a good boy\". It was awkward. \n\nNow I cannot stop thinking about her. The lunch was delicious. She is a fantastic cook. She said that I don’t need to return the lunch box. I can keep it. This is weird. It made me question about my life. What the fuck am I doing? I haven’t had a serious girlfriend for a long time. She was the first woman I've been intimate with in a long time. I know I said I do not want anything serious. Even she said that. But I'm thinking about calling her. God help me. \n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS** \n\n**NewsboyHank** \n\n>Go with your gut...she sounds like a lot of fun \n\n**[deleted]** \n\n>>Right??

She said she was flattered but she is going through a divorce. She tried to reassure that we were on same page. I told her I really love her style. None of my girlfriends ever made lunches for me. I couldn’t stop thinking about her since that day. Long story short we are dating. And I get delicious lunches every time I spend the night at her place. We have really good intimacy. I know she is way older than I am but I do not care. I found a loving woman. That's all that matters. Btw the picture of today's lunch she packed is in my profile. Check it out. \n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS** \n\n**Exciting_Wallaby_179** \n\n>Moving pretty fast. \n\n>Only been 15 days. \n\n>Hope you don’t end up hurting in the end. \n\n**OOP** \n\n>>We are not serious lol.

Who would've thought a one night stand could lead to this.](https://www.reddit.com/u/Ok_Security7429/s/2xjEcZYIr2)  **Feb 18, 2024 (same day as update)** \n\nIt ia fried rice with chicken strips and mixed vegetables. \n\n[Picture of casserole](https://imgur.com/a/Ea0En8L) \n\n[Recipe for chicken katsu and fried rice.](https://www.reddit.com/u/Ok_Security7429/s/ditpGskmbi)  **Feb 20, 2024** \n\nI'm only posting for the recipe. Damn so many people PM'd me for the recipe. I just want to say thanks to people who send me positive messages. I hope y'all find someone who would make lunches for you too. This will be my last post about it. Now, I will try my best but I do not have the measurements. My girlfriend said she never cooks using a measuring spoon unless it is baking. She mostly eyeballs everything. \n\n**For the chicken katsu:**\nUse chicken breasts. Cut it open and flatten it with a pan. Make sure to cover it with a plastic bag before flattening it.\nSeason the chicken with salt, pepper and paprika (optional). Make sure your chicken is dry. Pat it down with a paper towel.\nPrepare your stuff for breading. In 3 separate bowls or plates take flour, eggs and breadcrumbs. My girlfriend seasons the breadcrumbs with chili flakes. But you can skip it. \n\nCoat the chicken with flour first, then eggs and then coat it thoroughly with breadcrumbs. \n\nFry it in oil. I do not know what temperature you should fry it in but just fry it like you usually do. \n\nOnce the chicken is done, rest it and then cut them into strips. \n\n**For fried rice:**\nIn a pan or wok, heat it with oil. My girlfriend used beef fat but oil works too.\nPut chopped shallots, chili and spring onions (white parts only) and fry them. \n\nThen add pickled garlic instead of chopped garlic. Put kimchi in it but it is optional. Add chili paste too if you like it spicy like I do. \n\nFry an egg in the same pan. Then add rice. Better to use day-old rice. And fry everything together. \n\nAdd soya sauce, sesame oil, white pepper and MSG. \n\nAdd the green parts of spring onions at the end and serve. \n\n**For the sauteed vegetables:**\nUse carrots, red and green bell pepper, mushroom, baby corn and cut them in a Julian cut or cut of your choice. \n\nIn a pan put olive oil and fry the veggies. Once they are cooked, season them with salt pepper and chili flakes. \n\nStir them well. Use lemon juice and a bit of butter. Once you see the veggies are cooked, serve them.\n\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP**",

A partner with significantly more life experience is not only likely to have a higher paying and more stable job, but they are also likely to end up being the one taking care of all the household management and planning simply because they are more familiar with it. This imbalance often gets more extreme if the older partner is a woman. The result is that for the woman it ends up feeling like you have a child instead of a partner. So if you want to keep her, make sure that you are putting just as much effort into it as she does.",

In the Middle East it's extremely popular, and you can get it at restaurants and even takeaways all over the region. The history of the lentil in the region goes back quite literally to the dawn of civilization and I like to think we have mastered the making of lentil soups. To this day it's eaten regularly in households all over the region and I think you should cook it this winter. If you grew up disliking lentils like myself, you may find yourself converted by this recipe.\n\nAs usual I have a [full video recipe](https://youtu.be/oi-dcSkR-FQ) which you can follow and I've linked to all my past r/cooking posts in the comments.\n\n\n## What is Middle Eastern Lentil soup\n[Middle Eastern lentil soup](https://imgur.com/a/bykh8Qj) is made by boiling split red (or yellow) lentils until softened and tender. They're usually cooked with a combination of different vegetables or meat and are spiced accordingly to the taste of each country. The dish is widely eaten throughout the Middle East and is commonly served during the Month of Ramadan, when many people like to break their fast with a bowl of warm soup, it has the benefit of being simple to cook and very filling which make it a perfect Ramadan meal. Lentil soup is also a favorite amongst Middle Eastern Christian communities many of whom fast and adhere to a vegan diet for many days throughout the year including the Coptic Christians of Egypt who fast a whopping 180-210 days. \n\nThe dish itself heavily varies from country to country and even house to house, and is usually made with whatever vegetables are on hand. I find that the use of onions, carrots and tomatoes give it a delicious and well rounded flavor, though it's possible to also add celery or courgettes (zuchinni). In this recipe the soup is blended once cooked into a smooth and creamy texture, with the lentils helping to emulsify the soup until it resembles the texture of a cream based soup. In some countries the soup is not blended, and it can have eggs, beans or even pieces of meat added to it. The moroccan dish [Harrira](https://mayihavethatrecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Vegetarian-harira-soup-2.jpg), takes the soup further, with the addition of chickpeas, meat, celery and spring onions as well as more spices that give it a beautiful brick red color and smokier flavor. Most Lentil soups have fried vermicelli added to them which gives a slight texture contrast just like in chicken noodle soup. In the levant it's also common to add fried bread croutons (like those used in a fattoush salad) to the soup to give it a nice layer of crunch. \n\nI'd recommend first making this recipe with the same ingredients and spices, then put your own twist on it. I think the addition of chipotle peppers and adobo would give it an amazing smokey flavor, or the addition of some fresh herbs and lemon would give it a nice sourness.  \n\n## History\nLentils have been eaten in the Middle East for millenia and are thought to be one of the first foods cultivated by humans, indeed they're considered the oldest domesticated pulse crop. Architectural digs have found evidence of lentil consumption along the Euphrates river going back to 8000BC and they've been mentioned in the holy books of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Ancient Egyptians even left offerings of lentils in tombs to feed the mumified on their journey to the afterlife. The first mention of lentil stew as a dish exists in the book of Genesis 25:34 \"Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew; and he ate and drank, and rose and went on his way.\". Given their historical significance and popularity, it's no surprise that they continued to be popular into the modern day. \n\nIn \"Annals of the Caliphs' Kitchens\" a 10th century cookbook from Baghdad, a chapter called \"Making Dishes of Yellow Lentils\" describes a recipe that closely resembles this one, it says:\n\"Wash and pick over hulled lentil and cook it until it falls apart and becomes mushy. Cook with it round onion, olive oil, and salt. Add some vinegar. You have the option of adding to it sugar and saffron. Alternatively, if you do not like to use saffron or onion, put bruised garlic cloves and a dusting of cumin in the pot after adding the vinegar\". \n\nAfter the introduction of the Tomato to the Middle East, it has kind of become a necessary ingredient in lentil soup which really elevates the flavor of the dish. The introduction of blenders and food processors also eased the process of milling the cooked lentils into a smooth soup, which prior to that was mashed by hand.\n\n## Flavor Profile\n\nThe dish is definitely a wintery tasting dish and despite not containing the usual winter spices, the earthiness of the lentils really make it feel so. The main flavor here comes from the lentils, which give the soup an earthy and nutty flavor. The red lentils in particular don't overpower the flavors of the other components and like a mushroom I find they empower the other flavors in the dish. The garlic is also quite noticeable and it gives a nice pleasant garlicky flavour to the soup. Using both crushed and fried garlic gives you a strong depth of flavor. You also get a little bit of heat from both the cumin and chili powder which takes on a background flavor in the soup, and are tolerable even to someone who doesn't like spice.\n\nOne of the main flavors here actually comes from the addition of vinegar which elevates the flavors of the whole dish, it adds just the right amount of tang and sourness to brighten the dish and rebalance the earthiness of the lentils and vegetables. The vegetables are blended into the lentils and although you can't distinctly taste each of them, they contribute sweetness and a fresh flavor to the soup, particularly the carrots add a bright flavor.  \n\n## Ingredients\n\nMakes 4-6 large servings\n\n* 1.25L (1.25 qt) Vegetable stock, you can also use chicken, meat or even water. If you are using stock cubes rather than fresh stock, then please use high quality ones.\n* 250g (1/2 lb) Split Red Lentils\n* 150g (5 1/4 oz) Carrots (about 1 large or 2 medium)\n* 1 Brown Onion\n* 1 Tomato \n* 4-6 Garlic Cloves\n* 1/2 Cup Short Wheat Vermicelli\n* 3 Tbsp White Vinegar\n* 1 1/2 Tbsp Olive Oil\n* 1 1/2 Tsp Salt \n* 1 1/2 Tsp Ground Cumin\n* 1/2 Tsp Ground Black Pepper\n* 1/4 Tsp Chili powder (cayenne or whatever you have on hand)\n\n## Directions \n\n1. Peel and slice your carrots into large chunks about 1 cm or 1/2 an inch thick\n2. Peel your onion, remove the root and top and slice into quarters\n3. Wash your tomato and slice into quarters, we'll remove the skin later\n3. Peel your garlic cloves, mince 2 of them and set aside, the rest should be lightly crushed\n4. Add your chopped vegetables, the lentils and garlic (the crushed ones not minced) to a large stock pot\n5. Add your stock or water to the pot as well as 1 teaspoon of cumin, turn the heat up to high and bring the pot to a boil\n6. When the pot boils, retrieve the tomato quarters and remove their skin, then add them back to the pot\n7. Turn the heat down to low and allow the soup to simmer for 45 minutes. When done simmering, the carrots should be cooked through and the lentils should be swollen and mushy\n8. Using an immersion (stick) blender, blend the soup and all the vegetables pieces into a uniformly smooth mixture. Once blended it will have a creamy texture that resembles wall paint, remove the soup from the heat and set aside (check the notes for regular blender warning)\n9. In a small pot add 1/2 a tbsp of olive oil on medium high heat and add the 2 minced garlic cloves to it\n10. Fry for about 30 seconds then add the remaining cumin\n11. Fry for another 15 seconds then add the vinegar\n12. Mix and fry for 15 more seconds and add pour the mixture into the lentil soup\n13. Add salt, pepper and Chili powder (optional) then mix the soup well. Taste your soup and check for seasoning, you may need to add another 1/2 tsp of salt if your stock is low in sodium, or add more Chili powder if you'd like it spicier\n14. In a pot add the remaining olive oil and the vermicelli and fry on medium high heat until it turns a golden color. Stir constantly as it can burn easily\n15. Add the fried vermicelli to the soup as well as 1 cup of water to thin the soup out. Bring the pot to a boil once more and allow the vermicelli to cook for 10 minutes\n16. When the time is up, your soup is ready. The vermicelli will have absorbed some water from the soup, so add more water to thin it out until it's thinner than the paint like texture from before. It should be able to coat the back of a spoon without running, similar to the consistency of cooking cream.\n17. Garnish with coriander, thin slices of Chili and nigella seeds\n\n## Notes and tips\n\n* You must use split red lentils for this, brown or green ones have a lot stronger taste and I think the dish won't taste right with them\n* You can serve this over rice and it will be a close approximation to Yellow Lentil Koshari or Kichidi\n* If you have a spice grinder, then toast whole cumin seeds and use them instead for an even more powerful flavor\n* A standard blender can be used in place of an immersion blender, however you need to be sure to either remove the steam vent from the lid, or leave the lid slightly ajar, as it can explode when you blend hot soups\n* The method for making the fried bread croutons is in [my fattoush post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/hjx5o7/every_week_i_cook_a_middle_eastern_recipe_this/)",

Was by myself and don't speak Spanish and the waiter didn't speak much English, but he kept asking 'Sure?  You sure?' and I'm like 'well, yah man es bueno' so he shrugs and goes away.  He comes back in about 5 minutes with this *massive* bowl of lentil soup.  Way more than I wanted, I suppose it's meant to be shared. The bowl was rather ostentatious in appearance too to add to the absurdity.  Think of a tulip glass and then make it stainless steel and about a foot high and a foot wide at the largest part, and decorated with (flaking) gold leaf.  \n\nI had no idea what the fuck was going on.  For a second I thought *mayyyybbe* they were just having a go at the ignorant foreigner but he left me with it.  I peered inside and sure enough it's lentil soup and smells great.  I eat a bit and it's *real* good and I'm hungry after a long day of walking.  So I buy some cheap wine too and just set into this monstrous bowl of soup.  \n\n The waiter kept coming back and trying to communicate with me but I'm an idiot and didn't know the mother tongue.  From what I gather he was impressed with my progress each time.  All in all probably about 5 serving bowls worth of soup and I ate it all.  When I was done the waiter looked in the bowl and was visibly impressed.  \n\nThey didn't charge me for the wine either I noticed.  Either a mistake or just as a reward, not really sure lol.  But anytime I think of lentil soup that memory immediately springs to mind.  Spain's great, would recommend.",

    "body": "Background info: I own my own home, and seven months ago GF moved in. We both agreed that it would be unfair for her to contribute to my mortgage, as I am gaining equity and she is not. The agreement that we came up with is that I am responsible for all house expenses (mortgage, HOA dues, taxes, insurance, maintenance) and she is responsible for living expenses (electric, water, internet, streaming, groceries). We had this all hashed out before she moved in.\n\nNow, obviously I'm paying a lot more. I pay $2000 a month, not including regular maintenance. She pays about $500 a month. This is fine by me, as it is what we agreed to. On to the actual conflict.\n\nGF has started getting annoyed about groceries. We keep a list on the fridge both can add too, and she goes shopping once every ten days or so. She says that I put too many \"luxury items\" on the list and it bothers her to buy expensive items she doesn't like. The main offenders are oils (olive, coconut, peanut, avocado), vegan yogurt (am lactose intolerant) and cashews. I admit that all of these things are expensive. However, I do not go through them very quickly. The large oil containers last over a month each. One large container of yogurt lasts over a week. A large container of cashews lasts about three weeks. Only the yogurt needs to be bought frequently, and the large container is just over $5. Furthermore, I do not eat the cheese or milk products she buys, some of which are more expensive (fancy ice cream bars and cheese dips) than what I like.\n\nGF suggested I buy my own \"luxury goods,\" since she doesn't benefit from them. She eats the dishes I cook the oils with, so this isn't necessarily true. Furthermore, this isn't our agreement. She pays no rent, and she'd be paying a lot more than $500 a month in any other roommate situation. When I pointed this out, she became frustrated, saying that's irrelevant since we aren't roommates. I argued that, in addition to being BF & GF, we are also roommates, and some of our conflicts are those that most roommates face. She hated this comparison and ended the discussion abruptly to leave for work, even though she had 20 minutes before she needed to leave.\n\nAITA? Is there a rule I didn't know about calling SOs roommates? Is expecting our agreement to stay consistent an AH move? GF mentioned that these days everyone needs to tighten the belt. Should I be sacrificing more for our relationship?\n\nExtra info: Got back from work and there were too many comments to read all/answer all, so here's the answers to the questions I saw a bunch of before I got overwhelmed and stopped reading.\n\nOil: I don't drink oil or have high cholesterol. Olive oil and avocado oil are used for sauces, salad dressings, etc... Coconut oil I use for currys and stir fries. Peanut oil for sauces and stir fries. All are bought infrequently in large containers because it's cheaper. No more than one (sometimes none) needs to be replenished each month, as I said. They last a long time. I'm not fat or unhealthy.\n\nExpenses: Utilities are not expensive where we live. We are both passionate about energy conservation and use very little electricity and water. The utilities are still in my name, she just logs into my account to pay them. I see exactly how much they are. It's $120 a month for water and electric. Internet is $60 a month. GF goes Shopping every ten days. She spends about $90 per shop. I've seen receipts. That's $270. IDK why so many of you spend $1000 a month on groceries. I recommend cooking homemade meals like I do. It's very inexpensive. Dried goods like rice, pasta, beans, cost pennies per serving. In season produce that grows in our region is affordable. I don't know how much she pays for streaming, as I didn't have it before she moved in. If it's more than $50 a month, then she should cancel one, because that's ridiculous.\n\nMy finances: I'm not house poor and can afford my mortgage. My mortgage is still cheaper than renting. I do not need my girlfriend to \"subsidize\" my house. I paid all of my own bills before she moved in and would be able to continue doing so without her.\n\nUpdate: After GF got back from her work thing and we had breakfast, we talked about finances as many suggested. Turns out she had a dispute (where she was 100% in the right) with the insurance agency that refers most of her clients. They haven't referred her to anyone since. So she's been making do with word of mouth referrals and had only been getting a fraction of the business she was before.\n\nApparently her parents have been paying her car payment/insurance as well as her phone for the last couple of months, but she's still not making enough. She didn't tell me because she was embarrassed and thought she could find a different insurance company to work with. However, the agent she was working with badmouthed her, so that didn't happen either.\n\nI asked her to move out, since I don't feel comfortable financially supporting her, and she no longer has a stable income. Also, it sounds like she's going to have to move if she wants to keep doing the work she currently does. She agreed to leave by the end of the month. Thanks for all of the advice/perspective.",

    "body": "My post from yesterday was really misunderstood (apparently due to my poor wording—sorry, I’m not a native English speaker). Most people thought that my photos of bread, biscuits, and crepes from our vacation were the only things we ate for 7 people over 13 days… So no, those were just pictures of baked goods I wanted to share, not our full menu, obviously 😅.\n\nSome even begged me to add protein or vegetables… wtf. We’re French, and we eat bread, fruits, and vegetables at every meal—it’s completely normal for us. So reading those comments was really strange. I guess it’s just a bit of a cultural difference.\n\nI didn’t take many pictures of our main meals during the vacation, but I found some of the recipes we made on my website (with some adjustments—like the zucchini in the thali from the first photo, which we swapped for a leek fondue because of the season).\n\nHere is the recipe for the thali (and the other ones are all on my website https://elinestable.com ) \n\nFor 4 servings : \n\n- basmati rice 3/4 (cups)\n- homemade vegan naans 4 - optional\n\nFor the dahl : \n- shallots 2\n- coral lentils 2/3 (cups)\n- tomato coulis 1/2 (cups)\n- turmeric powder 1 (tsp)\n- ginger powder 2 (tsp)\n- coconut milk 1 (cups)\n- garlic 2 (clove)\n- water 3 (cups)\n- neutral oil 2 (tbsp)\n\nFor the potato curry :\n- potatoes 1.3 (lb)\n- blanched or frozen peas 1 1/2 (cups)\n- nutritional yeast 1/2 (cups)\n- water 4 (cups)\n- curry 2 (tsp)\n- salt, pepper\n- neutral oil 2 (tbsp)\n\nFor the zucchini : \n- zucchini 2\n- sesame 2 (tbsp)\n- olive oil 2 (tbsp)\n- Garlic powder 1 (tsp)\n\nCook the rice in a pot of water.\nWe're going to manage the cookings at the same time, so before starting: cut the zucchini in half, then into slices. Peel the potato. Cut it into cubes. Peel and mince the shallot and the garlic clove.\nPrepare the potato curry: In a pan, heat up the oil and brown the potato for a few minutes. Deglaze with water, and add the green peas, nutritional yeast, curry, salt, and pepper. Let it cook until the water is completely reduced and the potatoes are well cooked.\nPrepare the dahl: In a small saucepan, heat the oil. Sweat the shallot in it. Add the garlic and then the raw lentils. Add the spices and allow them to roast for a few seconds before deglazing with water. Add salt and tomato puree, then simmer for about 12 minutes until the water evaporates and the texture of the dahl thickens. Then pour in the coconut milk!\nPrepare the zucchini: In a small frying pan, heat the oil. Cook the zucchini over medium heat for about 12 minutes. Then add sesame, salt, pepper, and garlic powder!\nHeat the naans in the oven.\nOn plates, serve the rice, dahl, potato curry, cooked zucchini, a naan, and some sunflower sprouts.",

    "body": "So I'll keep this as brief as I can. My brother started dating this lady \"Jessica\" in January. The three of us live in the same city, about 3hrs from me & my bros parents/extended family so until recently, I was the only member of his family Jessica had met. \n\nOne of my brother's favourite things to eat is this sweet potato and red pepper soup I make. The relevant info here is that this soup features onions as an ingredient - not enough that you'd eat it and go \"oh wow this sure tastes like onions\", but enough that if you skipped them it wouldn't taste right. I make this soup for him approximately once a week, and Jessica has come to love it as much as he does, without ever mentioning any issues after eating it. \n\nSo, the issue. My brother, Jessica and I traveled to bro and I's hometown for our grandmother's 90th birthday celebration this week. Our mum was catering it - specifically with traditional Indian foods, since that's where she and our grandmother are from. However when we arrived and I offered to help mum with the prep work, I noticed she was making several additional dishes like chicken nuggets, chips and finger sandwiches, and was keeping them well separate from the resr of the food. I asked what that was about and she casually said \"I'm just making sure that Jessica can have something to eat with her allergies.\" I said I didn't know she had allergies and mum said \"yes, she says she's severely allergic to onion, garlic and corriander.\" If you're familiar with Indian cuisine at all, you get why it would be an issue for someone with these allergies. \n\nExcept...Jessica eats my soup. All the time. It has onions, and it's never caused her a reaction. The part where I may have been an asshole is I said this to my mum - which, if you're familiar with Indian mothers, you may understand how that could have been a bad move. She didn't kick off or act aggressive, but she did confront Jessica about lying and ask if there was something wrong with her cooking. Jessica just got kind of red and stammery and eventually admitted that she just \"doesn't like all that curry stuff\" but thought saying she was allergic would be less awkward. Mum got pissed off because she'd taken such efforts to keep everything separate and whatever to avoid cross-contamination, Jessica got pissed off because Mum was pissed off, my brother got pissed off at me fir saying anything in the first place. Everything got rather awkward and Jessica ended up not even coming to rhe party. They now haven't spoken to me all week, except for my brother telling me I'm a gossipy arsehole and I shouldn't have said anything, which...yeah, I kind of get.\n\nWas I an asshole? I didn't intend to cause drama, it was kinda just a surprised \"oh that's weird my soup with onions in doesn't make her ill\". I feel bad for ruining her first impression with our family and embarassing her.\n\nEdit: people keep asking for the recipe so I'll just pop it on here instead of replying to everyone: \n\n Okay so the measurements for the spices are all really rough cause I kinda just eyeball it but this is what I do to make like 4 portions: \n\n-500g sweet potatoes, peeled & roughly chopped\n\n- 1 large red pepper, deseeded and roughly chopped \n\n- 2 onions (I usually use red but any will do) peeled and roughly chopped \n\n- 2tsp cumin \n\n- 2tsp smoked paprika \n\n- 2tsp chili powder \n\n- salt and pepper to taste\n\n- 500ml veggie stock \n\n- olive oil\n\n- Preheat oven to 200C (idk what in F sorry), put chopped veggies in roasting tray and coat with oil and seasonings. Roast in oven for 45 minutes or until veggies are soft. \n\n- Place softened veg into a blender with hot veggie stock and blend to liquid (or put into a large pan and blend with immersion blender). The thickness can vary, sometimes I feel like I have to add more veggie stock here but sometimes it's fine. Also, I find it creamy enough as is with the taters, but you can also add some cream or milk here if you want it extra indulgent.",

He loves the taste so there are things he eats with onions and deals with the consequences. \n\nIf someone says they're allergic to something, don't contradict it.  Just don't.  I've had to go through this exact thing with my family of explaining that ***I personally*** know how to prepare onions so he doesn't get sick but we don't want to take the risk on other people preparing them.  \n\nIt's annoying.  It's stupid to have to defend yourself or your partner.  People act like you're the bad guy for not explaining fully - but why should people have to go into detail on why they don't eat something?  \n\nSaying you're allergic is an easy way to get it across.

People should be able to say what they're willing to put in to their own bodies.  \n\nIt wasn't good of her to lie, but from experience it's an easy shorthand.  \n\nHow do you know that she doesn't have IBS and didn't want to tell your family ***about how she poops***?

Kept the smoker going at 120 to keep warm. Seared off on a ripping hot KJ Big Joe 3 immediately before service. \n\nWorked out great as the end pieces were more done and the middle was perfect medium rare, able to custom slice each piece as the guest came by the carving board.

    "body": "This video, the constant creator did not share his recipe. But with the power of Google, I found something similar, although it looks like he added some mustard and no nutmeg to his.\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n3 tablespoons olive oil\n\n4 large sweet onions, thinly sliced\n\nkosher salt and pepper\n\n1 pound short cut pasta, cooked\n\n3 tablespoons unsalted butter\n\n¼ cup all-purpose flour\n\n2 ½ cups milk\n\n¼ teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg\n\n12 ounces gruyere cheese, freshly grated\n\n4 ounces parmesan cheese, freshly grated\n\n⅓ cup seasoned bread crumbs\n\nfresh thyme, for serving\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS \n\nHeat the olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium-heat. Stir in the onions with a big pinch of salt. Cook over medium, stirring often, until the onions soften, about 10 to 15 minutes.\nDecrease the heat to low or medium-low. Cook the onions, stirring often, for about 60 to 90 minutes, until they are golden and caramelly. If at any time the onions start to burn, low the heat or add a few splashes of water to keep them hydrated.\n\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Boil the pasta according to the package directions.\n\nOnce the onions are golden and caramelly, transfer them to a plate. (Note: if you’re really in a rush, you can add 1 teaspoon of sugar, honey, maple syrup, etc to speed along the caramelization process. Be sure to stir often and check on the progress!)\n\nAdd the butter to the skillet. Once melted, add in the flour, whisking to create a roux. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until it becomes golden in color and starts to smell nutty. Slowly stream in the milk while stirring constantly. The mixture will begin to come together and thicken. Stir in the nutmeg.\n\nStir in almost all of the cheese (reserve a bit for topping) until it is melted. Add in ¾ of the caramelized onions. Stir in the pasta. Toss it together over and over until it is combined.\nTop with the remaining cheese on top along with the remaining onions. Sprinkle with the bread crumbs. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden and bubbly.\n\nRemove and sprinkle with fresh thyme. Serve!",

    "body": "So this fuck up actually happened about an hour ago and I'm still feeling the consequences. \n\nTonight after returning from the gym I decided that I deserved a nice facial and bath.  I made preparations for this evening event and thought a candle sounded nice.  You know, to set the mood and put out them good smelly smells. I got my orange scented candle and trotted off for my bath.  Now sometimes when I treat myself I put a few drops of lavender oil in the bath, but I also have some pure extracted orange oil.  I've never used this in the tub, only to put on my wrists and whatnot, but tonight seemed like a great time to break it out.  I put two cap fulls of it in the hot bubbly water (I'm guessing like a 1/2-1 tsp) and I hop on in to enjoy. A few minutes later my fuck up makes its presence fully known.\n\nWell I'm browsing reddit and enjoying the bath, the back of my knee start burning.  It's mild at first and I figured it was a weird gym related cut reacting to the water.  I felt around and got nothing so like an idiot I ignored it.  Soon it's both of my knees and it feels on fire! I finally figured out it was the oil! I jump up, turn the shower on, and start trying to washing this crap off.  Alas, to no avail, the damage was done!  Eventually the burning spreads from my knees all the way to my butt, inner thighs, lower back, and shoulders.  Everything felt so hot and just on fire. To describe this sensation I'll let you imagine rubbing sandpaper on the worst sunburn you've ever had.  Sounds real nice, right? I was screaming and hysterical in the freezing shower burning my skin off while crying. \n\nThe burning wasn't getting better and I kept seeing visions of my skin falling off.  Terrified and in horrible pain I gathered the strength to call my husband, who wasn't home at the time.  After screaming/sobbing the story as best I could he quickly came to his hot, naked, and wet wife's aid.  (Trust me it was the least attractive I've ever been I'm sure.) We googled orange oil chemical burns and found a few answers but I basically just had to take a half hour long ice cold shower until the burning stopped.  Everything is pretty much better now, the skin feels raw and bumpy but it only stings a little.  I'm just lucky it didn't get in more sensitive areas.  I know now this oil isn't for bath time, and should have been diluted with a carrier oil at least.  \n\nThanks for reading and joining in my pain.  Half way through I made a joke that at least I had a pretty good TIFU now. I figured it was time to pay for how much I laugh at you guys!\n\nTL;DR added orange oil to my bath tonight, reacted to it and got chemical burns, then had to call husband to come home and help me, took a long cold shower to cool off my burns and it still hurts... I completely ruined my relaxing night! \n\nUpdate: Wow, this blew up! Thanks for everyone's concern and tips!  For those telling me I should have used olive oil, I actually did use that after my husband read that soap and water doesn't always work.  It seemed to help get the orange off pretty well. When I woke up this morning everything was completely fine, no trace of the event at all.  I'm glad it's over and I at least made you all laugh and I got some karma out of the deal too. Thanks! ",

    "body": "If you buy a shawarma or grilled meat sandwich at any Middle Eastern restaurant, you've likely had both these sauces without realising. They're so ubiquitous in Middle eastern cuisines and essential for saucing up anything, I've had them with dozens of different foods and have yet to find one they don't go with. [Here's how my sauces turned out](https://imgur.com/a/3Wb4GIW)  \n\n  \nIf you'd like to support me, or prefer video recipes, [here's the link to the full video recipe](https://youtu.be/ifOlf3COK4s)\n\n## What are Toum and Shatta\nToum in arabic means garlic, and it's also the name given to a specific garlic sauce from the Levant region of the Middle East. It's made by finely grinding garlic into a paste, then emulsifying it with oil and lemon to make a fluffy and delicious garlic sauce. It is closely related to the [Spanish Aioli](https://www.sweetandsabroso.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/18-2557-post/Alioli-with-Ingredients01.jpg), though there is a slight difference in colour and texture. The sauce is also called Thomeya in some countries and has become synonymous with Shawarma partly due to the spread of [Syrian shawarma](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ad/98/72/ad9872f27e3c157e178a4f098bf4aec9.jpg) stores throughout the region. Though most countries in the region have their own garlic sauces of some form, few have earned the reputation that Toum has. The primary difference between Toum and most of the other garlic sauces, is that Toum is very simply an emulsion of garlic and oil, other sauces such as the Egyptian Thomeya, or the saudi version usually contain Cream, Milk or eggs. The exclusion of these and the creation of a real stable emulsion, results in a fluffy sauce with the texture of a mayonnaise but 100% vegan, which means it can last a whole month in the fridge without deteriorating.\n\nI've had Toum with all manner of foods, from falafel and shawarma, to pizza and chicken wings, and they've all been great. I find that it's also a great mayo substitute in sandwiches particulary smoked turkey or grilled cheese sandwiches. The only downside to this sauce is that you'll have a serious case of garlic breath for a few hours after eating it, but lifes short and you deserve this sauce.\n\nShatta (pronounced Shut-Ta) is the generic name given to chilli sauce, though it can also be known as Salsa Har (Hot Sauce) and this is usually made using a blend of fresh chillies. Unlike Toum there is no one specific recipe or formula that most people or nations follow and it can vary from restaurant to restaurant let alone city to city. The middle east has a number of famous hot sauces such as North African [Harrissa](https://www.196flavors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/harissa-1-FP.jpg) and [Yemeni Sahawiq](https://www.afewlovelythings.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/zahawiq-1-e1475235413724.jpg) (I don't know why some people spell it Zhug or Schug) but Shatta is definitely the most widely spread. I spent some time experimenting to put together a sauce that tastes similar to what you get in most shawarma stores, or with grilled meat platters and I think it came out perfectly. This sauce uses a combination of different pepper varieties to build heat at different levels, as well as some spices that round out the flavors.\n\nIf you love sauces, I think you should give both of these a try. They're extremely versatile and can be used to fill sandwiches, spice up some grilled meat or vegetables, or even just eaten with some bread as a dip. \n\n## Historical context\nGarlic has been consumed in the Middle East for thousands of years, even being found in the tomb of Tutankhamun. It was said to be a highly revered ingredient amongst the ancient Egyptians and was thought of as both a food and medicine. In the Ebers Papyrus a pharaonic medical text, garlic is said to give vitality, soothe flatulence and aid digestion, mild laxative, shrinks hemorrhoids, and rids body of \"spirits\". Garlic was also used widely in Mesopotamian cuisine, in what is now the site of the Levantine countries, with many recipes still surviving to this day, such a stew with garlic and leeks. \n\nI couldn't find any specific mention of Toum as a sauce going back in history, but my search was partly complicated by the name Toum also just meaning garlic. While the process of Making toum has changed in the past century with the introduction of the food processor and blenders, it has been made by hand for a lot longer. The traditional way to make Toum is by grinding garlic in a mortar and pestle, then slowly adding in small amounts of oil and working it in. Some restaurants still make it this way, though it is a labor intensive process. It also results in a more solid sauce than the food processor does, and it has a more gloopy texture.\n\nThe chilli didn't make it's way out of South America until the 15th century, but it quickly found a home in the Middle East. Many Middle Eastern dishes already utilized heat producing spices such as Pepper and Cumin in large amounts, so it's natural that chilli peppers quickly became a part of local cuisine. The emergence of an alternative to expensive black pepper and the ease of its cultivation, quickly reshaped many dishes in the area. It's thought that by 1569 Hungary (under the rule of ottomans) began cultivating peppers which later became the base of their national dish.\n\nSince the introduction of the Chilli pepper, there are variations which have become synonymous with Middle Eastern cuisine such as Aleppo Pepper (Pul Biber), which is thought to have been cultivated and bred in Aleppo, Syria. It's not clear when chilli sauce became a feature in Middle Eastern cuisine, but it's likely that it spread through the Ottoman empire, where it was common for popular dishes to quickly make their way across the different territories. Unfortunately it's not easy to identify what varieties are mostly used in the Middle East and getting fresh Aleppo Peppers is very difficult. So this sauce is my closest approximation to how a Shatta would taste.\n\n## Flavor profile\n\n### Garlic Sauce\nThe garlic sauce has an extremely strong garlic flavor that obviously comes from the copious amount of garlic used in the dish. Using fresh garlic will give you a sweeter and more milder garlic flavor, while regular supermarket garlic will give you a more sharp and spicy bite that comes from the Allicin within the garlic. As the garlic ages the amount of allicin grows which is why aged garlic is a lot more pungent. The addition of Lemon Juice adds a necessary brightness and sourness that is desperately needed in the sauce. If you use a neutral vegetable oil (as suggested), you won't get any further flavors in the garlic sauce, however some people do use olive oil and of course that imparts an olive flavor on the sauce.\n\nThe garlic sauce is also notable for its texture, it has a fluffy and creamy texture that is similar to creme fraiche. It's quite a thick yet light consistency owing to the emulsified oil within it.\n\n### Shatta (Chilli Sauce)\nThis chilli sauce recipe has a deep and slow burning heat that is common among Middle Eastern chilli sauces. You do of course get a kick of heat when you first eat it, but it slowly builds thanks to the combination of different Chilli pepper types as well as the addition of some \"hot\" spices. Using fresh chilli peppers also gives you the brightness and freshness that you would expect from eating freshly ground chillies, notably when first made, this sauce will be a little sweet and over the next few days the flavors will develop significantly. The addition of Onion, Garlic and Ginger rounds out the flavor of the sauce so that you aren't just getting a ton of heat. Adding Lemon and Vinegar, turns up the acid in the sauce, which helps make it a bit lighter but also enhances the other flavors.\n\nIn this recipe I used Habaneros, Cayenne Peppers and fresh paprikas. The Habaneros add a large amount of deep burning heat and a fresh fruity flavor. The Cayenne Peppers add some medium heat, that gives a sharp immediate kick and a long sustained burn. Finally the paprikas are there for a deeper more mellow flavor, as well as their delicious fresh fruity flavor. I also roast the peppers to bring out their cooked flavors rather than raw, as I find it helps to make the heat less sudden and better sustained. The addition of Cumin, Coriander and smoked paprika, is there to round out the sauce and add some more traditional middle eastern flavors. \n\n## Ingredients\n\n### Toum (Garlic Sauce)\n* 150g (5.3 Oz) Garlic\n* 135g (about 1/2 cup) Lemon juice\n* 600g (21 oz) Neutral Vegetable Oil - Sunflower preferred\n* 1 Tsp Salt\n\n### Shatta (Chilli Sauce)\n* 100g (3.5 oz) Habaneros\n* 200g (7 oz) Cayenne Peppers\n* 300g (10.5 oz) Fresh Paprikas\n* 3-4 Cloves of garlic\n* 1 Brown Onion\n* 3 Tbsp Olive oil\n* 3 Tbsp Lemon juice\n* 1 Tbsp White vinegar\n* 1 Tbsp Sugar\n* 1-2 Tsp Cayenne Pepper (optional and should only be used if your sauce isn't spicy enough)\n* 2 Tsp Garlic powder\n* 1 Tsp Fresh ginger\n* 1 Tsp Ground cumin\n* 1 Tsp Ground coriander\n* 1 Tsp Salt \n* 1/4 Tsp Smoked Paprika\n\n## Directions\n\n### Garlic sauce directions:\n1. Peel your garlic and slice your cloves in half along their narrow side. In the center is a slightly green or yellow section which looks like a small plant, this is the garlic germ and it tastes bitter, pulling it out will make the garlic sauce taste a lot better. \n2. Remove the [garlic germ](https://www.seriouseats.com/2018/03/20180216-bagna-cauda-vicky-wasik-3.jpg) from the center of each clove, it should come out if you bend your clove on either side of the germ, but if you want you can cut it out. You should have 150g after degerming your garlic\n3. Juice about 2 lemons and strain the juice to remove all pulp and seeds, these can cause the emulsification to break and so must be removed.\n4. Place your garlic and salt in your food processor and process until finely minced. This should take about 2 minutes. Every 15-30 seconds scrape down the side of the food processor to get the garlic moving again. The garlic should be very finely minced when you are done with this.\n5. When the garlic is finely minced add a teaspoon of lemon juice and process again for a minute, scraping the bowl every 15 seconds. The garlic should slowly form a thick paste \n6. Add one more teaspoon of lemon and process for another minute or two until a fluffy and fine paste form. There should be no obvious chunks of garlic left and the paste should be well whipped\n7. When the garlic has fluffed up, start your food processor, and slowly drizzle in 1/2 a cup of the oil. You should drizzle it in a flow as thin as a thread, and do not stop the machine until the recipe is completed. It's hard to maintain a constant stream so check my video to see how you can make your own emulsification resevoir out of a plastic cup that will make sure you get a very thin drizzle. As you drizzle the oil in, the garlic will emulsify into a sauce, you should take about 2 minutes with the first half cup.  Do not proceed with the recipe until the first half cup has emulsified and thickened and your food processor contains a mixture that looks like a liquid mayonnaise\n8. Once the first half cup has emulsified you should slowly drizzle in a tablespoon of lemon juice\n9. Alternate drizzling in 1/2 a cup of oil and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice until both have finished. You should drizzle them in as slow as possible. This stage will take about 8-10 minutes. Make sure to wait at least 30 seconds before switching from oil to lemon so that you can ensure it has all been incorporated.\n10. Once completed, place the sauce in a container and place a paper towel directly on the sauce, this will wick away any excess moisture or oil. Let it rest overnight before serving\n\n**I would highly recommend watching the video for this as you need to see the visual queues of when to add your oil and how slow to go with the drizzling, also read the notes below**\n\n### Chilli sauce directions:\n\n**Wear some gloves for this or you will hate your life**\n\n1. Slice the top off of each chilli and remove the pith and seeds\n2. Peel your ginger and slice into thin slivers\n3. Peel your onion and slice into quarters\n4. Place the peppers, onion, ginger and garlic on a baking sheet and drizzle on 1 Tbsp of olive oil as well as 1 Tsp of salt\n5. Bake in a 180c or 350f oven for 20-30 minutes until the chillies are cooked and slightly browned. Remove and let cool before moving forward\n6. Place all the baked ingredients into a food processor and process into a fine paste\n7. Add the remaining ingredients apart from the lemon juice and cayenne pepper, then blend until well mixed and a thick chilli sauce has formed\n8. Taste the sauce and see if it's spicy enough, if not, add the cayenne pepper and blend once more\n9. Add the lemon juice and mix in, your chilli sauce is ready\n10. Place the chilli sauce in a container and refrigerate overnight, the flavors will develop over the next 24-48 hours\n\n## Notes and tips\n\n* The emulsification can break really easily, if your emulsification does not work then check out the serious eats toum video where they explain how you can fix it using an egg white\n* Going slow with your oil and lemon is essential, most food processors will come with an emulsification reservoir that you can add liquid to and it will slowly trickle in. If you don't have one, you can make one by poking a hole in the bottom of a plastic cup\n* Heat is the enemy of an emulsification and so placing your oil in the fridge for a couple of hours before using, will help it setup quicker. You can also place the lemon juice in the fridge as well\n* Make sure your food processor, lid and blades are completely dry before starting. Too much moisture at the start of an emulsification can cause it to break\n* Please wear gloves when handling chillies, I did not and my hands burned for hours afterwards. I tried to clean them with Soap, Vinegar, Alcohol, Lemon Juice, Diluted bleach, Hand sanitizer and nothing really helped that much. Don't be an idiot like me",

    "body": "I hosted Thanksgiving at my home this year. We have several lactose intolerant family members, one of them being my son’s husband, so I made some recipes using oil or olive oil “butter” over real butter, or using lactaid milk so it would be safe. I made sure to put the dairy free items apart from anything with regular milk and butter by having a separate small table for those dishes.\n\nMy son-in-law ended up feeling very ill and my son brought him to the ER that night. Even though I used safe ingredients he still had a reaction to something unknown in the food. My son rang me up from the hospital asking what was in the dishes at the dairy safe table. I told him I used oil, vegan butter, and lactaid. He was upset with me because I put milk into the mashed potatoes. I told him again I put lactaid milk so it would be safe.\n\nMy son-in-law is recovered and doing well. My son, however, is quite upset with me and claims he cannot trust me to cook food for them again because I “mislabeled” the food. He is claiming he has told me many times about his husband’s dairy allergy, and I agree he has which is why I made separate food. It is now to the point where the family doesn’t want me to make any diary free dishes for Christmas because I am “failing to understand.” Instead they have all agreed my sister-in-law will make some of those dishes while my son and son-in-law will make the rest.\n\nI am beside myself because I love to cook for and feed my family. I feel I am being displaced when what happened on Thanksgiving could have been caused by a reaction to anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEditing... I understand my mistake now. It was an honest confusion. Of course I have apologized, and will again, to my son-in-law. I'm not sure why anyone doubts that. They do not want me to pay for his epipen or hospital visit. All they want is for me not to prepare food for my son-in-law any longer, which I understand now. I feel horrible I didn't look up the lactaid but I honestly thought it was safe. No, I didn't try to murder my son-in-law. ",

    "body": "So with the new year, there are probably a lot of people resolving to cook more, cook healthier stuff, or just generally step up their kitchen game. \n\nPart of this might involve new cookware. If you're in the market, you may want to consider cast iron. Cast iron is fairly inexpensive, and is good because properly maintained, it will last forever (no really, like \"pass down to your great-grandkids in perfect condition\" forever) and is about 80-90% as nonstick as \"real\" nonstick pans. Because cast iron retains a lot of heat, it also makes cooking certain things a lot better / easier. It can also go in the oven, on a grill, or even a campfire, so it's versatile. \n\nCast iron is great, but pretty much every time it comes up on Reddit, and ESPECIALLY on other websites, a lot of misinformation about cast iron and how difficult it is to use / maintain gets thrown around. \n\nThis article gets it pretty much right, however: https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/11/the-truth-about-cast-iron.html\n\nStill, the myths and misinformation persist.  Even fans of cast iron seem to be putting in too much effort, if you ask me. \n\nPeople say: Cast iron is hard to clean, you need a chainmail thing, or you have to scrub it with salt, or you can't use soap, etc.  None of this is true. (don't use steel wool, though.)\n\nPeople say: Can't cook acidic things like tomato sauce in cast iron.  Not even remotely true. I make tomato sauce like, weekly in mine. \n\nPeople say: You have to keep oil in it or re-season it every time you clean it.  Nope. Maybe every few months.\n\nPeople say: you can't use metal utensils with it, it will damage the seasoning.  WRONG. \n\nRather than go through each one and try to debunk it in detail, I'll just describe how I use cast iron.  I've been doing most of my cooking in a cast iron pan for about 8 years now and I'm still a huge fan of it, even though I have a handful of \"nonstick\" pans at my disposal. \n\nHow to be good at cast iron: \n\n1. Get the biggest pan you feel works for your arm strength.  One bad (?) thing that IS true about cast iron is it's heavier.  Some places today are making nicer, thinner pans - worth a look.  \n\n2. Read this: http://sherylcanter.com/wordpress/2010/01/a-science-based-technique-for-seasoning-cast-iron/ - it's mostly right about how to season the pan.  One thing not covered in there is how to avoid getting bits of lint from paper towels, cloths, etc stuck in the seasoning.  If you figure it out, please let me know.  It doesn't ruin it but it bugs me. \n\n3. Add one or two layers of seasoning to the new pan.  (NOTE: one thing Cantor's article doesn't cover is 'breaking in' the pan after seasoning.  I don't understand the chemistry very well, but for whatever reason, trying to fry an egg on a freshly seasoned pan goes HORRIBLY for me every time.  Like it bonds to the seasoning and just wrecks it.  Sticks worse than if you just tried to cook on bare metal. Cook a few not-very-sticky things with lots of oil before going back to eggs.)\n\n4. Cook some stuff. As long as you use a decent amount of oil or other fat to cook (which you should do anyway) you won't have problems with sticking, even fish can be cooked in cast iron if you're careful.  If your food is sticking there is something wrong with your seasoning, or the pan is dirty. \n\n5. Using a flat-edged metal spatula, scrape off as much stuck-on food as you can while you're cooking. (This should only be a little bit here and there depending on what you cooked.)\n\n6. After you're done cooking (you can do this any time, doesn't have to be right away) heat up the pan on the stove, pretty hot but not smoking or burning the remaining food.  While it's still hot, spray the pan with water in the sink or run water over it in the sink.  This steams off stuck-on food.  While it's still hot, use a scrubbing brush to remove any remaining stuck-on food.  Should take about 30 seconds.  About 2/3 of the time, this is enough to get the pan clean enough to use again. If any stuck-on food remains, just scrub the pan with a sponge and soap like you would anything else. \n\n7. Dry the pan off thoroughly. (another thing that's true about cast iron - it's a bad idea to leave it wet). \n\n8. Go back to step 4. \n\n9. If you find that the pan is starting to stick more, make sure it's *thoroughly* clean and go back to step 3.  For an extra clean, I use a magic eraser after the coarse scrubber, and lots of soap.  (NB: You can kind of cheat by seasoning on the stove for a few minutes.  What I do for a half-assed seasoning layer is put on a nice thin coat of oil, heat until it starts smoking, wipe it AGAIN to remove excess, then turn off the heat and put a lid on the pan. I do this maybe once every 2-3 months. )\n\n10. If the pan is well and truly fucked for some reason, soak it in lye (pure potassium or sodium hydroxide) overnight to remove all of the seasoning, and start over at step 3, except do 5-6 layers intead of 1-2. If it has major rust you may also need to soak in a vinegar solution.  (Note: lye is dangerous, don't fuck with it without goggles and shit)\n\nThis is the general SOP I've come up with to make use of cast iron with a minimum of effort.  If you think about it, the only thing that varies from a 'nonstick' or steel pan is that you have to fix up the seasoning once in a while. The fact that you CAN do this is really the whole advantage of cast iron.  Rather than replace the pan when the nonstick properties fade, you can fix it yourself using regular-ass vegetable oil and a paper towel. (they say flaxseed oil is the best, but I haven't found that it matters very much.  Just use a very pure / refined oil, olive oil with lots of bits of olive floating in it is not good, for example)  Not exactly rocket science. \n\nI find that this is an easy trade-off for a pan that doesn't involve PTFE or similar crap, and isn't going in the trash if the nonstick coating gets scratched.  Cast iron seasoning is actually a lot tougher than teflon or similar coatings. \n\nI've cooked most of my food in cast iron for years.  My $20 pan from Aldi has outlasted the fancy Scanpan nonstick I got as a gift by several years and shows no sign of slowing down. \n\nAnyway, hope this is helpful if anyone is planning to upgrade their kitchen gear this year. \n\n",

One myth that I keep trying to break on r/castiron is that simply cooking bacon or other fatty foods in the pan is the same as seasoning.  It is not.  Seasoning requires a very thin layer of fat to be heated at a high enough temperature, and for long enough, to polymerize and carbonize.  Once that happens, it is extremely durable (try to scrub off the baked on oils inside your oven with just soap and water).\n\nBut my experience also concurs with yours that a freshly seasoned surface is not as non-stick as one that has been used for a while.  \n\nI'd also urge people with the time and inclination to check flea markets, antique stores (often overpriced, though) and even garage sales (estate sales at older homes can be great) for the older iron with the machined cooking surfaces.

One of the most versatile food types with potential for being the tastiest meals bringing any kind of flavour and texture combination.\nI’d be more concerned about people who are not passionate about sandwiches. I’d also like to point out OP’s hypocrisy in feeling strongly enough to make this post then questioning the passion of commenters.\n\nEdit 2: A burger is a sandwich. If you think about it for more than 10 seconds and disagree, you’re an idiot. I’m more inclined to forgive your position here if it was about hot dogs where at least there’s potentially a debate to be had. \n\nEdit 3: Butter is just a specific medium for the addition of fat/flavour to a sandwich and is also used for cooking. A drizzle of any nice oil is a totally legitimate alternative to butter on a sandwich, as is mayonnaise and countless other sauces. I’m not going to judge you for this one because it’s definitely more prevalent if you’re truly seeking out sandwich greatness. \n\nI hope this thread prompts you to further explore the greatness of sandwiches.",

And the sand is a good percentage ground glass. It’s a garbage dump but it’s also fantastic and quite spectacular. Like I imagine this giant hill of garbage to be.",

    "body": "I'd qualify myself as a decent cook; it's one of my favorite hobbies, but I'm nowhere near the level of anything that would be considered remotely professional. That's why I was so happy with the way this steak turned out. \n\nI've had my fair share of \"nice steaks\" from good restaurants, but I don't eat a ton of steaks anymore (maybe once every other month or so). However, at my local grocery store yesterday, they had a special going on that was $13.99 for a bone-in ribeye. I thought it was too good to pass up, so I got one that was about 1.3 pounds. \n\nGot home and immediately sprinkled with kosher salt and then set on a wire rack in the fridge to dry brine for around 3-4 hours. 45 minutes before cooking, I took the steak out to bring up to room temperature. I ground some pepper and seasoned all over (like I had done previously with the salt). \n\nI set my oven to 270F. On a baking sheet, I crushed about 7-8 cloves of garlic and spread them out about the size of the steak, then covered with thyme sprigs and drizzled olive oil over it. I rested the steak on this garlic/herb bed to put in the oven (instead of on a wire rack) and cooked until the center was about 115F. \n\nI decided to do a reverse sear, so I got a cast iron real hot. This is where the real game changer happened. I cooked a whole duck for Thanksgiving this year, so I saved a lot of the rendered duck fat. After taking the steak out of the oven, I seared both sides in the duck fat for about 45 seconds each to form a nice crust and bring the temp up to 130ish for med rare. \n\nAnd that's how I made the best steak I've ever had in my entire life. \n\n(I made a twice baked potato as my side and before baking the second time, mixed the potato in a bowl with sour cream, duck fat, salt, pepper, and rosemary)\n\nThanks for reading lol.",

A trick of the trade the difference between the porterhouse and a T-bone is the fillet mignon is larger in the Porter House, and a porterhouse fillet needs to be more than an inch and a quarter wide. T-bones are cheaper then porterhouse so look close at the T-bones and find the biggest fillets . Most of the time meat cutters are busy so they aren’t doing the wrapping and sometimes the rappers get sloppy. trick number two  when buying steaks always by choice, it absolutely has to say choice with a USDA label . Some stores trick you with labels that say cutters choice or the grocery store Choice. Certified Angus is a breed of animal it has very little to do with flavor and to be choice it needs to say USDA choice. If you’re going to cook a roast long and slow it doesn’t really matter if it’s choice or not. Trick number three if you are shooting for organic steaks some grocery stores sell Australia tenderloins they cannot sell them as organic but just like they’re lamb they’re putting these animals out in the fields and they’re not spending a whole lot of money on grain and they will only have minimal antibiotics,They’re about half the price of regular tenderloins even not choice tenderloins.
