    "body": "WHY YSK: It's often cheaper and gives you control over ingredients. Keep in mind that for the everyday person like myself, I'm talking about basic items like shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, styling products, etc.\n\nThere are probably many sites but I live in the USA and have only used Making Cosmetics. While I haven't made my own whole products, I have bought items to replace expensive products. The first thing I bought about 5 years ago was a product to replace a pricey \"wrinkle blurring\" item I'd been using for a while. The name-brand item cost me around $15 for a 7-oz tube. I was able to buy a 15-oz jar of the powder (which lasted me over a year) for about $10 at the time.\n\nBecause I don't know anything about (or have the equipment) for complex formulation of products, I stick with the basics. I buy hair conditioner bases, curl cream bases, skin care oils (to add to existing products), and other simple-to-use additives, and use my home blenders and basic tools to mix things. The last thing I bought was some hydrolyzed silk protein that I add to my hair and skin moisturizers. I also sometimes buy fragrances and flavors to add to existing products.\n\nThe thing is, you have to use common sense or do your own research. I'm just a consumer with zero experience in product development. If you want to get serious, you can contact M.C. for help with any formulation. They sell containers and applicators, etc. If you are so inclined, you could create your own line of products. The site has resources and will assist you (for a price).\n\nI hope this might help some of you save some money or maybe get creative.",

In high school, Tresemmé was my holy grail shampoo/conditioner combo bc of the softness I got from it, but my roots ALWAYS ended up greasy af by the next morning bc I have combination hair and my scalp is always greasy af. \n\nI decided to give them a try again, but this time with their Amplified Volume set. I had really high hopes for this because both products include hydrolyzed silk, which my hair seems to love… and I was NOT disappointed. \n\nI used my Pantene Volume shampoo first, and followed up with the Tresemmé Amplified Volume shampoo for my second wash. My scalp still felt extremely clean, but my hair itself felt very, very silky already. Then I applied the conditioner and let it sit for a few minutes and rinsed. \n\n\nThe knots *melted* out of my hair. My hair didn’t feel heavy at all, even while wet. \n\nI followed up with my Tresemmé Pro Pure leave in detangler and my Tresemmé Keratin Smooth heat protectant spray, and blow dried with a round brush. \n\nMy roots don’t have that weird “piece-y” look they get when products are too heavy, my scalp still feels clean, and my lengths are SO SILKY. My test for how well a product has delivered slip on dry hair is to detangle, and then brush straight back down my part and see if I can do it with no tangles. And I could, super easily. I cant remember the last time my hair has felt this silky while dry, tbh! I’ll update in the morning to see how my roots are looking when I wake up. Usually if a shampoo is too heavy, I’ll know pretty quickly 😂\n\n",

There's little evidence to support any claims that the new ingredient is the secret.

There is a brand that every Summer (sometimes they skip 1 or 2 years) they come up with a Shampoo that is always the same but they sell it as brand new shampoo with a huge marketing behind it and every damn time the client feels it is new. I am surprised no one notices it... \n\nAlso, I've seen a brand using exactly the same shampoo for 5 types of the same sub-brand line, just changed the scent and obviously the packages were different. It was enough for people to think they are all different, different bottle color and scent = different!\n\nAnother thing is, there are products with tiny bits of salt (or other ingredients, I've seen the method vary a bit) and with a substance that will become solid if you rub against you're skin. These products have really amazing smells and are sold this way: they rub it in your hands, give you a massage (contact with client, super friendly, trying to reach out for you) and rub it until that substance starts to get solid and they say \"you see? this is your dead skin. no product in the market does this\". You can rub it all night and see same results... it's not your skin. So they sell this crap claiming it's Japanese salts with particles of mountain something something for 200€ or more. I've seen in airports this products being sold like candies...\n\nAnother trick is to sell with the language... most brands, specially the most expensive ones, have creative writers making you believe you are getting the best and most fancy product... let me try to write something they would despite not being as good as them hahaha: \"New hair shampoo, with particles of moon dust, Amethyst and salt. Your hair will be shiny and beautiful as the moon. Specially made with Amethyst for an incredible touch feeling. The only product in the market with this. Try now\"... this kind of bullshit would make ladies run to get it from the shelves...",

Vulgare\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5590070/\n\nIt's an essential oil with a distinctive herbal scent, blue as fuck and features a lot of anti-bad-stuff words in the study's abstract results & conclusion section. In a stupid article I shouldn't have read  (totally separate, not the study linked above), they suggested there's a natural retinol (or Vitamin A) in Blue Tansy. I can't really tell if that NIH study I've linked corroborates that statement. If your background's in this and *you* can tell, let me know!!!\n\nPeony and passion fruit extracts sounds like something you'd only get for the scent (and in fact Damask Rose, when googled, first thing to pop up is the Jo Malone perfume). Idk what Royal Jelly is. If cactus water is anything like my Thayers' Cucumber-scented Toner then I could be into that.\n\nManuka Honey. \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4837971/\n\n>Honey has been tested in vitro on a diverse range of pathogens, particularly those that can colonize the skin, wounds and mucosal membranes, where topical honey treatment is possible. To date, in vitro assays have found manuka honey can effectively inhibit all problematic bacterial pathogens tested (summarized in Table ​1)\n\nOne of my favorite oils, Jojoba: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24442052\n\nYou'll notice that \"They'll all have some rosy story about some ancient tribe in a far away land used XYZ for ABC\" is actually featured in a way in a lot of these NIH cites, their favorite being \"<Ingredient> has been used for centuries in <insert vague regions here>\" in their introductions. So it's not just the glossy skincare/beauty magazines here.\n\nBut finally, active/activated charcoal. One of my favorite things to talk about because as far as I can tell there's been no studies on it and dermatologists are just like \"ha idk yeah might work\" as cited in [this NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/04/fashion/mens-style/charcoal-grooming-products-face-cleansing.html). I swear there's another one that explicitly states the dermatologist is chuckling and shrugging. \n\nLots of other ingredients (including the ones I've cited) still haven't been researched nearly enough by modern medicine and it's halfway because nobody really *needs* to. They're all marginally beneficial, they're all low-risk re: irritants (depends on an individual's skin sensitivities/allergies), they're all cleared by the FDA as *not* generally harmful. Nobody's restricting the public's use of these ingredients - nobody needs to - which means the public is more than welcome to figure out these things \"work\" on their own.\n\nSomeone mentioned they might as well smear the stuff in their fridge all over their face. That's an apt way to imagine how most docs and public health officials see what we're doing. And ain't nobody gonna fund a whole research study on whether each ingredient in that user's fridge is doing some good to their skin. Another analogy to this is like asking a doctor/researcher to evaluate a very specific workout regime of yours with no goal other than \"to stay healthy.\" The doctor/researcher is just gonna be like \"look, I don't know. Just exercise whatever way you want often enough and you should continue to be healthy.\" (lol)\n\nAnd why would we? Why would anyone fund research into substances that claim they can *only* help perfectly healthy people look even more perfectly healthy? Like, medicine just has *way* bigger fish to fry. And we can make do either experimenting with whatever bizarre new fun products are out there... or using stuff that *has* been studied extensively, mostly because their applications have deeper significance for the medical community than just \"a pretty person gets to look prettier with this thing\"\n\n**TL;DR**: This is a catch-22 bc medical scientific research is a zero-sum game. Yes, I wish for more science behind what to put on my already-healthy face to make it look nicer, but holy hell the state of how shallow and vain we've become as a society if that concern were ever to be given more funding and priority than almost any other line of scientific inquiry.",

I spent $75 on two bottles of shampoo and two bottles of conditioner (because it was a sale. they’re originally more than that) \n\nAgain, this was almost a full year ago and my hair is still relatively thin, and i can never get it to grow past a certain point. It’s been an endless cycle of me having the dead ends trimmed off, having my hair grow back to right around my shoulder blades, and then it just **stops** \n\nOne benefit of this brand, however, is that they’re vegan, with all matthew ingredients, and cruelty free. That’s the only reason i still use their products. \n\nGranted, i’m in no way an expert on the matter, but i could be the one damaging my own hair and then accusing the products of not working. I will admit that i’ve had my fair share of having me hair bleached and dyed crazy colors before. Which i get is totally damaging.",

Fermenting antioxidant rich ingredients such as ginseng, green tea etc. breaks down the antioxidants/complex molecules that are beneficial to our skin into smaller molecules, which allows it to be absorbed into the skin easily. Not only that, yeast/bacteria ferments produce additional metabolites (AHAs, peptides) that provide additional benefits such as whitening, hydration, skin repair, you name it!\n\nEdit: forgot to put my favorite fermented product!! I love the Manyo Factory Galactomyces Niacin Special treatment. :) \n\n2nd Edit: here are the links to some scientific literature articles on fermented cosmetics which were found through PubMed! You do need access to the database if you want to read them in its entirety, but you can get some brief information on the topic just through the abstract.\n\nFermenting red ginseng enhances its safety and efficacy as a novel skin care anti-aging ingredient: in vitro and animal study.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23126662\n \nEvaluation of tyrosinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of Angelica dahurica root extracts for four different probiotic bacteria fermentations.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254340\n\nSkin resistance to UVB-induced oxidative stress and hyperpigmentation by the topical use of Lactobacillus helveticus NS8-fermented milk supernatant.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598022\n\nBifidobacterium-fermented soy milk extract stimulates hyaluronic acid production in human skin cells and hairless mouse skin.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12637786",

    "body": "Hey there! So I have extremely damaged hair that is breaking off every time I brush it (got a straight perm when my hair was bleached). In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I’ve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or “glucoside”.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or “methosulfate” (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application. (Volatile just means they evaporate quickly):\n\n-Cyclomethicone\n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n##Easy to remove silicones:\nThese condition the hair, provide UV protection, and wash out with sulfate free surfactants:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate)\n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n##Resilient silicones:\nThese silicones can be removed with a sulfate AND some sulfate-free surfactants:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n##Cationic ingredients List:\n(Anti-static ingredients)\nThese ingredients usually end in “-imonium chloride”. These are in basically every conditioner to reduce static in hair:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate (this is NOT a sulfate, it’s an anti-static)\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n#Sulfates:\n\n##Mild Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are best used to remove volatile and easy to remove silicones. They can only remove resilient silicones with multiple washes, unless paired with many different sulfate free surfactants (a shampoo that has 3-4 or these in their ingredients list):\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n-Sodium Cocoate\n\n-Potassium Cocoate\n\n##Sulfate free surfactants that can remove resilient silicones:\n\nThese can remove resilient silicones, but not on their own, so usually a shampoo will use a combination of 2-3 of these:\n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate\n\n##High Strength Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are technically sulfate free, but they are **just** as thoroughly cleansing as sulfates, so they can still strip hair dye. Best used for removing resilient silicones\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n##Sulfates that remove resilient silicones:\n\nStrong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Do not use if you have colored hair, as it will fade your color\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n#Understanding Protein in Hair:\n\nHair is made of protein, proteins are made of amino acids and peptides. Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt’s best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the “feeling” of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this “protein overload” is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair.

Hydrolyzed collagen, hydrolyzed wheat protein (5th and 6th ingredient)\n\n##I’ve included this product list more for myself because it is very hard to find products with varying protein types and sizes.\n\n##The above information about protein and sulfates was found on Science-y Hair Blog!\n\n#Ingredients for Scalp Health:\n\n##Aloe Vera Gel:\n\nAloe is a great natural scalp soother and also helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it’s wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

    "body": "About a month ago, I picked up the Trader Joe's Nourish Oil-Free Antioxidant Moisturizer.  Note that TJ's also sells an intensive moisturizer, which contains oil.\n\nIt's a watery lotion that is light yet moisturizing.  If I apply too much, it feels annoyingly wet on my skin for about a minute until it dries.  After that, it is perfectly comfortable.  Since it's summer here, I don't need a heavy moisturizer.  I really like this and would definitely buy it again.\n\n[Photos](https://imgur.com/a/6AvUUKs)\n\nPros:\n\n* Inexpensive at 6 oz for $6\n* Contains a bunch of different antioxidants\n* Lightweight\n* Fragrance-free\n\nCons:\n\n* Antioxidant concentration might be low.  Many are listed after the preservatives.  Not necessarily a bad thing, just unknown.\n* Clear container might let light in, which might make the antioxidants less effective\n* Pump might not be super sturdy?  I knocked mine off my counter and the pump came off.   I was not able to get it back on, so I had to transfer the lotion to another container.\n\n\nIngredients:  Water, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Ethylhexyl (Octyl) Palmitate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Polysorbate-60, Cetearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Cetearyl Glucoside, Sodium PCA, Ethylhexyglycerin (Preservative), Shea Butter Fruit, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E Acetate), Xanthan Gum (Thickener), Tocopherol (Antioxidant), Sorbic Acid (preservative), Soluble Collagen, Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5), Ascorbyl Palmitate (Vitamin C Palmitate), Pomegranate Extract, Ginkgo Biloba Extract, Coffea Arobica (Coffee) Seed, Chamomile Flower/Leaf Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sorbitan Stearate, Phytonadione (Vitamin K1), Menadione (Vitamin K3), Hydrolyzed Silk, DMAE (Dimethylaminoethanol), Copper PCA, Retinol (Vitamin A), Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A Palmitate), Ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q10),Thioctic Acid (Alpha-lipoic acid), Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3), Polysorbate-20, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Phospholipids\n\nPossible dupe?  [Skin Resource MD Oil Free Antioxidant Facial Moisturizer](https://skinresourcemd.com/collections/face-moisturizers/products/oil-free-facial-antioxidant-moisturizer#goto).  The packaging and ingredients look similar enough.  The ingredients are not listed 100% the same, but it seems that it would at least be very similar.\n\nI hadn't seen a review on this moisturizer here before, so I thought I'd write one.

I uploaded these pictures a long time ago, about 2 weeks after my first haul, with the idea that I would use the products for six months and then post reviews. Any swatches were also taken at that same time. Six months are up, so I hope my info will help you make better decisions for your skin, body and in turn, your bank account. I will give my thoughts on the product, then leave it a rating out of 5 on the general feel, price and finally, my personal rating (not reflective of the previous ratings). Every link is non-affiliate and I'm posting this on my own accord. The only product that won't be reviewed is the Etude House Precious Mineral BB Cream Cotton Fit Samples, as they were a gift.\n\nAdmittedly, as I'm re-reading this I clearly see things I could have done to make this more coherent and easier for you all to understand, but it's a lot of writing and I learned as I went along. I felt like some gossip magazine columnist towards the end, so I'm 100% sorry if that's cringey or off-putting. If I do another review set in future, I hope it'll be better written.\nGoing in order from the photos:\n\n\n*SKIN CARE*\n\n\n**Mizon Original Skin Energy Hyaluronic Acid 100** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_dbe8149455.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/mizon-original-skin-energy-hyaluronic-acid-100-30ml.html?search=mizon%20100)\nThis feels similar to Hada Labo original but it's a super small bottle, only 30 ml compared to HL's 170 ml. Way longer ingredient list as well, but my skin swallowed it. It has ceramides and cholesterol, peptide, anti-inflammatory and -aging plant extracts, and adenosine as well as the titular hyaluronic acid (listed as sodium hyaluronate). On RRS it's listed at $10 USD, a 76% discount from $40 USD. I forgot about this when I bought a different hyaluronic acid serum and then pushed it back even more once I got Hada Labo. Turned to it last month when I felt like my skin just couldn't hold moisture, and I don't think I'll go back. It has not broken me out, and I use it right after my BHA/AHA.\n\nfeel: 5/5\n>this feels so good to apply. I want to say it smells very, very faintly like some kind of butter/fatty oil? lmao it's not a bad smell at all, it's almost floral. The texture is super slippy and thin, again, like Hada Labo lotion. After application, my face is soft and smooth. It's like my face sucked the stuff into it within a minute.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$9.77 for 30 ml. for what this serum does, less than 10 bucks for 30 ml is an absolute steal. God bless RoseRoseShop.\n\npersonal rating: 5/5\n>I love it. So dearly, I love it. I'll definitely be repurchasing this once I buy from RRS again, and while I'm hesitant to call out holy grails, this is probably mine for moisturizing.\n\n----------\n\n**Tosowoong Syn-Ake Natural Pure Essence** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2dc0196695.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/tosowoong-syn-ake-natural-pure-essence-100ml.html)\nThis was good. It's main purpose seems to be anti-aging. Nothing I remember as truly remarkable, but that might be because I'm barely an adult and thus don't really have any fine lines to speak of. Funnily enough, I don't see anything resembling syn-ake in the ingredients. I still ended up buying this because it has a pretty good-looking formula, which it even touts on the box. Fourth ingredient is niacinamide, and other stars include two different ferments, peptide, centella extract, betaine, hyaluronic acid, and many berry extracts. Despite how unwowed I might seem, I ended up using this up within the 6 months I had it. I suspect it's effects are similar to my Missha FTE Intensive, as in lightened PIH, evened tone/less redness and general lack of irritation. It took a while to see these effects, but because this was used in conjunction with so many new products with brightening ingredients I'm not 100% sure it was the culprit.\n\nfeel: 5/5\n>Liquidy and clear, smells like nothing. Spreads like any other serum, no complaints here.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$11.80 for 100 ml.\n\npersonal rating: 4/5\n>For me personally, it just doesn't do much. I don’t have any age reversal to see, and even if it did help with my skin tone, I have other products that I know for sure do that. All in all, it's a solid \"good\" from me. If anybody out there with more mature skin and/or fine lines has used this product, please let me know what it did for you!\n\n----------\n\n**Mizon Intensive Skin Barrier Serum**\n[CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_38f5180403.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/mizon-intensive-skin-barrier-serum-50ml.html?search=Mizon%20Intensive%20Skin%20Barrier%20Serum)\nThis did nothing for me. When I ordered this haul, I had sickly dry winter skin and was desperate for moisture, so what better product than something with \"skin barrier\" right in the name? Turns out, this was hell in a pump. I didn't check the ingredients and was left with a serum that might as well have been smelly pimple slime. I had closed comedones all along my jaw and cheeks, my skin was dry again a few hours after application and the smell made me feel a little sick every time i used it. I've not experienced this with any other AB product. This is more of a testament to using CosDNA zealously than anything else. My bad. To my confusion, the first time I tried to use the pump applicator it wouldn't work. On the bottom of the container, there is a removable cap-looking thing with a notch on the edge that I used to pry it off and fiddle with the stopper that helped to push the product up. Only then was I able to use the pump.\n\nfeel: 2/5\n>Nothing special. Slightly opaque, classic serum consistency. The smell of this is citrusy and reminds me of cheap candles. I'm not one to mind fragrances, but it makes me feel like I need to drink a glass of water and lie down.\n\nprice: 2/5\n>$15.61 for 50 ml, list price is ~$25. Even discounting my personal experience with it, this serum is unimpressive for being one of the more expensive items in this haul. The major ingredients seem to be all filler with a few extracts and some HA tossed in as an afterthought.\n\npersonal rating: 1/5\n>Would not recommend. I have since chucked the bottle, I can’t even use it as a body treatment or hand cream it smells so bad.\n\n----------\n\n**Enprani Dear By Moistfull Booskin** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_0868211750.html) [Product Link](https://us.memebox.com/dear-by-moistfull-booskin)\nI don't really understand this product. It's a very acclaimed toner, which is why I bought it, and I do like it for days when I wear makeup but it puzzles me. My skin never felt dry after using it, but it never felt moisturized either. When I used this before serums, emulsions, creams, etc. it did help them to sink in faster, but over the day my skin felt slightly more parched than usual. I think this helped me to realize that I am really not a toner person. It's typical for me to skip that step most days now, but I do use this when I wear foundation or bb creams/cushions and it does help them wear longer. If you wear makeup often, I would definitely recommend this.\n\nfeel: 4/5\n>Water consistency but with a texture that's like less-stringy snail slime or joseon cream? Yes! Feels good to put on. The smell is strong, like flowery fabric softener. I'm told it's rose scented but I don't know what rose smells like. It dries down to what I would call a matte finish and feeling. Points lost for the eventual dryness and strong smell.\n\nprice: 4.5/5\n>List price now on Memebox is $20 for 120 ml, but I think I paid $18 for this? Regardless, I've used this toner for 6 months and I'm probably only down 20 ml. Worth the investment if it works for you.\n\npersonal rating: 4/5\n>As far as toner goes, I think this will be my go-to forever for makeup prep. I love the smell and the feel, and if I didn't have combination skin, I think this would be perfect. I would recommend this to those with oily skin.\n\n----------\n\n**Mizon Snail Recovery Gel Cream** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f37d220631.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/mizon-snail-recovery-gel-cream-45ml.html)\nIt's okay, however I much prefer my Cosrx Snail Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence over this. It did help with my acne scars at the time and it's WAY cheaper than cosrx, so I would never be overly harsh on it. I notice some peptides and plant extracts at the bottom of the ingredients, so that's neat. I think this is a good cream for those who want to dip their toes in the pool of snail products without investment. This was my very first haul, after all, and this cream was my gateway to snail. I use this for my legs and other body parts and have nothing bad to say about it.\n\nfeel: 5/5\n>Cool and jello-y without the messy stringiness of pure snail. Slightly opaque with an earthly cosmetic smell. Dries like a dream.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$4.20 for 45 ml, a total steal.\n\npersonal rating: 4/5\n>Overall, I just have a better snail cream that I prefer over this one. Would still repurchase this as a cheap snail body cream since it's a blessing for ingrown hairs.\n\n----------\n\n**OST C20 Original Pure Vitamin C20 Serum** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_e7e3205117.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/o-s-t-c20-original-pure-vitamin-c20-serum-30ml.html?search=c20)\nThis stuff stung like a quick slap to the face every time I used it, but I'm told that's normal. It smells like sharp orange juice and is thick and sticky. It dries like that too, feels like a second skin and not in a good way. It oxidized super fast in the 4 month period that I used it. I stored it in a dark place and in fairly low temperatures. I did like the effects it left me with: a more uniform texture, lightened dark spots, a not-quite-oily-but-definitely-not-matte glow However, the hassle surrounding vit c is too much for me to deal with every day, especially for only 4 months of use.\n\nfeel: 2/5\n>Real, real gross. Very pungent citrus scent. On your skin, it feels kind of like what evaporated sea salt looks like if you feel me. I have to wipe off residue by applying my next step with a cotton pad.\n\nprice: 4/5\n>$11.23 for 30 ml. Not terrible, by far. I'm sure that if you use this serum very diligently you'll be able to use it up before it's the color of maple syrup.\n\npersonal rating: 3/5\n>It's okay. I know that vitamin c isn't supposed to be hydrating or even comfortable, but I feel like there are better, more stable formulas out there, and when people on the sub circlejerk about how unstable this stuff really is, they aren't kidding. If I were to try vitamin c again, I would not repurchase this product.\n\n\n*MAKEUP*\n\n\n**Etude House Precious Mineral BB Cream Cover & Bright Fit in W02 Light Beige** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2571201744.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/etude-house-precious-mineral-bb-cream-cover-and-bright-fit-35g-spf30-pa.html?search=Etude%20House%20Precious%20Mineral%20BB%20Cream)\nAND\n**Holika Holika Nabi Cream SPF 25 PA++ in Cottony** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_e6f1197705.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=60408&search=holika+nabi)\nTo be up front, I don't wear makeup very often and I have very little to compare this to. My skin's texture is fairly even, but I find my complexion is sallow with dots of PIH here and there, plus the discoloration of faint freckles. Have some [swatches](https://m.imgur.com/a/J0xdx) in artificial light, flash and natural light. Left to right is just primer, then just bb, then bb on top of primer blended out. \nThis will be a bit longer of a review. I used this in conjunction with the Holika Holika Nabi Cream, so I will group these together. I really like this bb cream and primer. They work well together, do not break me out and the color matches me nicely. It looks quite orange at first, but paired with the primer I feel it evens out to a pinky-peach shade. I do not understand undertones, I get very frustrated trying to figure them out for products and my own skin (I still understand heck-all about whether I'm cool, warm or soylent green). So, if anybody out there has this bb cream or would like to make an educated assumption based on the photos on what undertone it is, please let me know and I'll put it in bold.\n\nThe Etude House bb dries down to a semi-matte finish. It does not feel oily or overly-dry at first, however I do mist my face with a moisturizing toner as I like a more sheer look. Depending on how much you layer, you can get moderate to full coverage. However, I would not recommend more than two layers because you can get real cakey real quick. For reference, I always wear one light layer. I find that wearing this without a facial mist dries out my normal/oily combo skin, accentuating both dry and oily parts of my face. Again, this is a somewhat matte formula, so it’s dry by nature. It wears well for about 10 hours, which is when it starts to wear off a little patchy and become overly-shiny. I like this so much that I am looking to purchase the moist version cushion.\n\nThe Holika Holika primer is super nice. It's tinted purple, which gives a subtle brightening effect. The cream feels lightweight and smoothing, like a good primer should. While not feeling tacky, it still helps bb cream to adhere to the skin and last longer. I don't think I would recommend this to those with large pores since it seems to be more of a color correcting product and the smoothing and filling effect is minimal. The Nabi line has 3 shades: Cottony, Vitality and Shiny. Cottony is purple, Vitality is pink, and Shiny is beige. In the imgur album, I listed the one I have as Vitality since that's what I ordered, but now I'm pretty sure that I had Cottony all this time? I didn't think much of it at the time since I'm bad with color and I really liked the results I got with it. This may be the only mishap with RRS I've had to date, and it ended up being a gift since pink makes me look overly-red (EH Face Blur, I love you.... but why?).\n\nfeel: 4.5/5\n>The primer is excellent for what it does. I do not have enlarged pores, so it's really convenient for me to have a primer that acts as both a color corrector and makeup base without being heavy. Etude house makes my favorite bb creams, and it's nice to find a color that matches my semi-light, mystery-undertoned skin while wearing beautifully. The only complaint that I have is the slightly short wear-time and the dryness of the standalone cream. If you like matte/semi-matte products, I would recommend this because it's still a lot gentler than other matte foundations I've tried. Both of these smell like makeup, not overly perfumed or sickly but just kind of like setting powder.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$5.83 for 35g (bb cream) & $7.83 for 50g (primer). Super economical, and it's still amazing. I wear makeup sparingly, so these both will probably last me just under their full 12 month shelf lives.\n\npersonal rating: 4.5/5\n>I'm not one to settle on one product, especially with skincare, but I really feel no inclination to try out any other primers. Between this and my Etude House Face Blur, I'm all good. Would definitely repurchase. For the bb cream, I'll probably use this one all up before trying out its moist cushion type. I really love Etude House for makeup: really good formulas, my skin has no problems with it and all their products look really pretty. Would repurchase from the same brand/makeup line.\n\n----------\n\n**Etude House Dear Darling Tint in 01 Berry Red** [Product Link - Ingredients are not on CosDNA, but can be found in the \"Ingredients\" tab on its Memebox page](https://us.memebox.com/dear-darling-tint-01-berry-red)\nSkipping ahead a little here, but this is still makeup I suppose. I am kind of impartial to this line of tints. They are very pretty and stain well, but they don't last through me biting my lips and applying balm all the time. I am forever searching for one that will, but these do a good job for now. I own two of their tints now. Have [more swatches](http://i.imgur.com/d3r9zxe.jpg) with Berry Red on the left and Vampire Red on the right. The berry red smells sweet, like some kind of fruity candy. It wears well for about an hour before I've bitten or rubbed it off.\n\nfeel: 4/5\n>Smells amazing, decently pigmented and beautiful color. This is a gel type tint, and application can be streaky. The applicator and rim can also become very messy. Color probably lasts longer if you don't eat your lips throughout the day.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$6 for 4.5g. It does run out kind of fast, but for Memebox it's a solid price for the product amount.\n\npersonal rating: 4/5\n>I like this, but I don't like having to reapply all the time. I'll probably keep looking for a tint that survives my lip biting and moisturizing habit. I recommend it to those who can generally leave their lips alone.\n\n\n*CLEANSING*\n\n\n**Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser**[CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_5319235682.html) [Product Link](https://us.memebox.com/low-ph-good-morning-gel-cleanser)\nI love this cleanser. It's my holy grail for body wash and my go-to for gentle wash after chemical peels. It's a perfect, simple gel cleanser. It does not strip my skin of moisture, it helps keeps my body blemish-free and it lasts for-damn-ever. Seriously, I use this every day and I only just ran out of my first bottle. It contains no sls, but it does of course still have other surfactants and \"sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\". I tend to follow [Fifty Shades of Snail's theory](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2015/08/23/review-tosowoong-enzyme-powder-wash/) on acidic cleansers and harsh surfactants anyway, and this cleanser clocks in at around 5.5 pH.\n\nfeel: 5/5\n>Like most low-pH cleansers, it leaves my skin feeling clean, but not dry. It smells noticeably like tea tree oil, (which is a scent I love very much so it scores even more points) and it lathers lightly using just your hands or moderately if you use a washcloth or exfoliating gloves. I use the body shop's brand of exfoliating gloves in conjunction with this, and my skin is always smooth and happily clear of any kind acne.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$10 for 150 ml. RoseRoseShop has it listed for $6.07 and Jolse for $8.80 at the time of writing this review. is gud price friend.\n\npersonal rating: 5/5\n>Holy Grail status achieved. I used to suffer from some pretty frequent breakouts on my back and butt (if you know me personally and are reading this just know that my butt is smooth as hell now, heck outta here) until I started using this cleanser, and now that I combine it with exfoliating gloves I have literally none of the problem spots or painful cysts that I'd been getting since puberty. I will forever continue to purchase this product and have bought 2 more bottles since running out of my first one a couple days ago.\n\n----------\n\n**Holika Holika Soda Pore Cleansing Cleansing Soda Water** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f87f134194.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=60172)\nThis palindrome of a product name belongs to my current eye makeup remover. I bought this product (as well as the Holika Holika primer) after seeing it in the routine of an AB/skincare youtuber named Elaine Mokk. Love her content and reviews despite it being less \"this works, here's why\" and more \"this was cute, it also happened to be a decent product this time\". Anyway, this cleansing water's main ingredients are water and alcohol. I suspect this is why I have problems with it. Not because I'm sensitive to alcohol, which I'm not, but because for me, the purpose of this product as an eye remover means that when it gets in my eye, it's a shitshow. It stings substantially and I end up rubbing my eyes like a madwoman trying to get it over with. I thought that maybe I was using too much product, and while using less made it more bearable and in most cases kept it from getting past my lashes and into my delicate corneas, the pump on this thing is a nightmare. No matter how gently and slowly you try to press the plunger top, you always press too hard and end up with a wet cotton round and a dry office-stare of contempt at the bottle. I thought that I would use this up to avoid being wasteful, but considering that I'm already worried about the integrity and health of my eyes, I think I'll be giving this away or selling it on ABExchange to somebody who would use it for the face instead. It's not bad at removing makeup, it's just not good for eyes.\n\nfeel: 1/5\n>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$6.63 for 150 ml. A great price if you can make it work for you.\n\npersonal rating: 2/5\n>I'm only giving it a 2 because it still removes makeup well. Otherwise, it's totally unenjoyable for what I wanted to use it for. Side note, I used this on my face to remove foundation a few times and found that it worked pretty good, about the same as my camellia and jojoba oil blend. I just don't see myself giving that up for this product, though.\n\n\n*MISCELLANEOUS*\n\n\n**Skinfood Argan Oil Silk Hair Mist**\nThis product apparently no longer exists. It's not on the site I bought it from, it's not on the skinfood website or CosDNA and if you google \"skinfood argan oil silk hair mist\" you get one defunct Skinfood US listing and literally 4 pictures on the images tab that show the product I have. I suppose the argan oil hair line has been reformulated and the mist fell under the radar or it was an exclusive. I'm betting on the former.\nLong story short, I have a love-hate relationship with this. When I bought it, I had no idea what was in it, what problems it claimed to target or what its reputation was. I've been doing no-poo since I was 15 years old and using 100% undiluted baking soda on my scalp, straight scooped out of the orange box and dumped it on my head until I wizened the hell up and used the rest of the time I spend on my hair up to this point doing damage control. Now that the hair that was once on top of my head is at the bottom, I've got basically straw for ends. I was in a state of denial about needing a haircut after not having had one for over 9 months and was looking for some help with fried ends and breakage. This mist is very nice. It smells very floral, if argan oil smells like what I think it smells like, then this smells like that. I remember one of the claims was that the main extract in the formula is broccoli extract. It also claims to have hydrolyzed silk. Whatever it was (and I know what it was), my hair looked amazing. It was sleek and kempt, no flyaways, the broken hairs around the crown of my head stayed down and my ends didn't look as much like a dollar store paintbrush. I used it often.  I took it upon myself to translate the ingredients on the back via google translate's draw feature, plugging in the hangul one at a time.\n\n>Purified water, Ethanol, Glycerin, PEG-Q150, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Dipropylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Polysorbate 20, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Glutamic Acid, Dimethicone,\n\nI stopped at dimethicone, which is a big \"don't\" ingredient for my hair and the whole point of the no shampoo method. I like this mist a lot, but not enough to go back to conventional shampoo and conditioner. I’m also not sure if the effects of it were really as great as I thought they were or if it was all the reintroduction of silicone. Since the stuff is out of production anyway, I don’t think it matters. I’ll probably sell/give this away too.\n\nfeel: 5/5\n>Lightweight, smells great, helps with styling and general appearance.\n\nprice: 4/5\n>$6.43 for 145 ml, which is not bad but considering mists are supposed to be used liberally, you’d go through this fairly fast.\n\npersonal rating: 3/5\n>I’d use this product if it was friendly to my preferences. The ingredients don’t look impressive aside from hydrolyzed glycosaminoglycans, which is an amino sugar that supposedly promotes growth and extends the life cycle of hair. Maybe I’ll try it again and end up changing my routine to incorporate it just to see if it helps.\n\n----------\n\n**Mizon Acence AC Care Solution Mark X Blemish After Cream** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_3050164581.html) [Product Link]( http://www.roseroseshop.com/mizon-acence-ac-care-solution-mark-x-blemish-after-cream-30ml.html)\nThis is an after-care cream that’s meant to be used on spots that have just been squeezed. That’s all I can gather from the little infographic that RoseRoseShop has. I used this on both blemishes that had been drained and ones that had not and I was surprised at how well this worked. My dark spots faded much quicker and after using it there were no recurrences of any of the pimples that I squeezed. It did not irritate my skin. This cream does leave a really waxy residue, though. The directions say to let it absorb into your skin, but it never fully does. Maybe that’s the way it’s supposed to be, but if you use it before bed it can get smeared on your pillow, face and hair. The ingredients are all very promising and effective, which I generally find is a theme for Mizon products. Let’s say a blemish takes 1 week to heal over completely; with this cream applied once every night, overnight, the time is shortened to around 4 days.\n\nfeel: 3/5\n>The effect of this product comes with a price: super waxy, oily film left behind. If you are sensitive to olive oil, try this at your own risk. At one point, I thought this cream was breaking me out, but I have used this many times after that and found that I was wrong.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$4.93 for a 30 ml tube.\n\npersonal rating: 4/5\n>I like what it does for my trouble spots and can tolerate any greasiness that comes with it. I said I used it on both squeezed and closed spots, and I can definitely tell that it’s more effective on a drained area than one that still has gunk beneath the surface.\n\nThat’s it!

This was my first sunscreen I bought after leaning about photoaging! My first baby! And we were off to a good start. It’s a white watery gel-like texture, light weight, invisible, but quite shiny (some might call this a dewy finish, but I prefer a skin-like finish). A good poster child for the typical Asian sunscreen, I guess. It is not water resistant, and you'll notice this as you sweat throughout the day: It’s like your sweat becomes heavier since it mixes with the sunscreen (you can’t see this of course, but it sure feels like it). I was also worried about touching my face throughout the day, because I felt I might rub the sunscreen off. I can’t remember it ever stinging my eyes, but I’m not entirely sure. The biggest drawback for me was the prize and how inaccessible it is in my country. At this point in time, I also hadn’t learnt about the proper amount of sunscreen you have to use, so I was probably underapplying, and the sunscreen can therefore have appeared lighter-textured in my memory. It contains a lot of fragrance and many ingredients, in general, so that could be irritating. A little bit of science: If you look at the UV filters, there are several UVB filters; many UVB (290-320 wavelength/nm) filters also “bleed into” and filter some UVA II (320-340) as well. The Uvinul A plus filters both UVA II and I (340-400), but it’s also the only UVA filter in this sunscreen, and it’s also the last ranking UV filter on the ingredient list, even though I’ve read that the upper limit for Uvinul A plus is 10% (of the total product). So, is there enough UVA protection? I don’t know, but it’s probably okay since the Pa is four pluses, so I wouldn’t worry too much about it. Packaging is nice and it has a pump, and you get 75 ml, not only the standard 50 ml.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Avène Hydrance OPTIMALE UV RICHE Rich hydrating cream**\n\n* \\- **SPF 20, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **40 ml/1.35 Fl.OZ**\n* \\- **Probably suitable for darker skin tones**\n* \\- **France**\n* \\- **Ingredients:** AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA).

It does not have high enough UV protection, and it is not designed to be used as a sunscreen, and therefore you will end up underapplying. I bought it because I was looking for a day cream at the time. I wanted something for my dry skin and this day cream worked in that regard. But never did I ever apply close to the amount of sunscreen you have to apply to get the labelled SPF and UVA protection. It is on the heavier side, so applying a quarter teaspoon to your face would not feel nice. Trust me. And even then, you’d only get SPF 20. I would not recommend anyone to use this product as a daily SPF product. It also contains fragrance even though it says it’s suitable for sensitive skin.\n* \\- **Score:** 2/5\n\n**NIVEA SUN UV FACE ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS SPF 30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I must have gone though three of these. It has a lot in common with the MAKE P:REM one, and it also shares some of the same problems. It has a similar texture: white watery-gel, which turns translucent on top of the skin. It’s like a glycerine-rich moisturiser. I think it’s less shiny as well – more skin-like finish. The problem arises when you sweat: your sweat starts feeling even heavier than normal. I think I experienced some eye stinging with this sunscreen (nothing major), largely caused by it not being water resistant. It’s important to note that the reason it is so cosmetically elegant is also why it’s not water resistant. I was also scared to touch my face and accidently rub it off while wearing this one, too. It’s smells like sunscreen. If you’ve ever purchased a NIVEA sunscreen, you’ll know what I mean. And the fragrance doesn’t go away immediately either. My biggest problem at the time, was also that I wanted to find a SPF 50 sunscreen, and this one is only SPF 30. I think I’ve recently seen a SPF 50 version of this since, so if you live in Europe, I guess it’s worth giving it a shot. Looking at the ingredient list now, I see that it contains a lot of avobenzone. Avobenzone has a bad rep, but you cannot deny how effectively it protects against UVA when photostable. Avobenzone on its own is not photostable and will start degrading (and be used up) when exposed to the sun or UV light. In this sunscreen, however, (and most non-American sunscreens) it has been stabilised by another UV filter: In this case by Tinosorb S. I think this sunscreen might have much higher UVA protection than the EU requirement, which makes sense since it’s advertised as “ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS”.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Piz Buin Ultra Light Dry Touch Face Fluid SPF 30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Sweat and water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

This sunscreen survived me walking all around Madrid for a week in the middle of summer. Boom. What a trooper. The texture is a thick liquid, not a cream, so the opening is narrow so you can pour some into your hand or tilt your head backwards and pour it directly on your face. It dries to an almost powdery finish – it truly is dry touch. If you have dry skin, you should probably moisturise beforehand. It was also easy enough to reapply when I was out and about in Madrid; So, layering it wasn’t a chore. If you don’t apply it evenly it might dry down with some flakes even – that’s how dry it is. But I didn’t feel like it dried out my skin in the process, but that is of course a very personal observation. I would have been perfect if it was SPF 50, a little less expensive, and fragrance free. If you’ve ever tried a Piz Buin sunscreen, you’ll recognise their trademark fragrance at once: masculine and sunscreen-like. It does bring back good memories of summer and beaches for me personally, though.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**THE BODY SHOP Vitamin E Day Lotion SPF30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

And it’s not water-resistant, so it will on glide on your face as you sweat. But the absolute worst thing about this is how much it stings your eyes. I could barely open them in broad daylight, and I had to go back home and wash my face to get it off. Do not, under any circumstances apply this close to your eyes. I don’t know what caused it: maybe all the perfume, or the UV filters? Also, the way this product smells, is absolutely abhorrent. Old lady perfume, and it’s so strong.

I have very pale skin (and am therefore really scared of “universal tints”), but it blended perfectly into my skin tone, perhaps with the slightest bit of coverage. Since it’s a mineral sunscreen, I’m sceptical if it’ll blend into darker skin, even with the tint, so that’s something to keep in mind. It might also have photo flashback, you have been warned. Even though it is silicone based, I wouldn’t describe it as “silicone-y”, if you know what I mean; it has a skin like finish. However, I don’t think I ever applied enough of it to truly know what its finish is like… First and foremost: the packaging. When I bought it, they still used a dropper – I repeat a dropper. This did not work, as the product would spill over, clump up at the inner edges of the bottle’s mouth, etc. And since it clumped up at the sides, I honestly don’t know if I’ve lost some of the UV protection of the product, since it’s no longer a completely homogenous liquid. They later changed the dropper to a pump, but it’s still embarrassing that they ever sold it with a dropper. What were they thinking? You also spend quite a bit of time applying it evenly on your skin, due to its consistency and tint. You kind of have to apply it like a foundation. Since it’s only 30 ml, it means that you should be finishing one of these in less than a month – and only if you’re just applying it to your face. At least it doesn’t have any fragrance! It does have an iffy smell to it, which goes away. Taking into consideration the cost, the packaging (even though it has improved) the fact that it’s not a SPF 50, PA++++ product, you’re left with a very mediocre sunscreen. It could however serve as a daily serum on top of your sunscreen, if you’re very extra.\n* \\- **Score:** 3/5\n\n**Altruist Dermatologist Sunscreen SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I had really high expectations for Altruist, same as many others, and I was let down. It isn’t that bad of a sunscreen, but it’s also not that good. At this point in my quest for the Holy grail sunscreen, I realised I had to up my UV game. SPF 30 wasn’t enough, and I wanted as high of an UVA protection as possible. With the EU’s regulation of UVA protection (in a nutshell the UVA protection has to be 1/3 of the SPF), you could, in theory, end up with SPF 30 sunscreens that had higher UVA protection than your SPF 50 sunscreen. And as a consumer, you simply wouldn’t know the difference. Anyway, Altruist SPF 50, has perfect UV protection, and no fragrance and such. In theory it’s the perfect sunscreen. I mean, look at all those filters (seriously why are there so many, did the chemists make a bet or something?) But in practice? Not so much. First and foremost, if you have darker skin, this might leave a white cast due to the titanium dioxide. Some people have mentioned this in their reviews and some people have also mentioned it stinging their eyes (I can’t remember noticing this). Secondly, the reason I didn’t like it, is because of the texture. It’s the same sort of texture as the MAKE P:REM and NIVEA mentioned above, just less cosmetically elegant. I thought it would dry down or sink into my face, but it never did. I would wait for 20 minutes, and I would still be sticky and a little bit shiny. What worked was putting a lot of translucent powder on top, then I would finally achieve a more skin like finish. Pro tip: Translucent powder can actually make most sunscreens bearable. Since it didn’t dry down, I felt as I would rub it off if my face touched anything. Maybe this sunscreen would work for people with dry skin? Since applying this sunscreen, waiting, applying powder, would take such a long time, I ended up just using a different sunscreen. And I guess that says it all. It also has a “chemical” smell to it, but that didn’t bother me.

This sunscreen utilises a new technology called Organogel™. It contains no water, and thus it doesn’t have to dry down, and you only need 1/5 the amount of a normal sunscreen. You heard that right: 1/5! So, you only need a pea-sized amount for your entire face! But I used a little bit more than that, because real peas are actually very small, so when people say pea-sized, they usually mean 2-3 real peas. A photo from their website illustrating what they meant by pea-sized confirmed my suspicion. But it’s still a very small amount! The texture is that of a see-through slightly orange-y gel. It’s oily, but it doesn’t move on your skin (also when you sweat). And it’s completely see-though so I can with confidence say it’ll suit every skin tone. It doesn’t completely dry down, though, but it does seem to sink into your skin a little bit, if you wait a couple of minutes. You can feel the gel on your skin when you touch it, but you wouldn’t notice you had anything on otherwise. Since it isn’t water based it also feels sturdier than the others I’ve tried, so I wasn’t as scared of it rubbing off when touching my skin. I think it might work very well as a primer. It has a slight “chemical” smell, it also doesn’t contain any perfume or any nonsense like that. It’s on the pricier side, but one 100ml bottle is actually the equivalent of 500ml of normal sunscreen, when you think about it, so I think the prize is justifiable. This was the sunscreen I kept on using when the Altruist one wasn’t working for me, by the way. It’s definitely the quickest sunscreen to apply of all the sunscreens I’ve ever used. A con is that is a little bit difficult to gauge if you are using enough, and that you’ve applied it evenly. Turns out there are two versions of this sunscreen: An American one and a New Zealand one. I somehow ended up with the American one, and it has worked just fine for me. The NZ version uses non-FDA approved filters, but it still has the same UVB and UVA protection listed, but I would still recommend you buy the NZ version, since there must be a reason why they chose to not just use the same formulation as the American one, right? Since I bought my bottle, they have also released many new products, like an SPF 50+. If the SPF 50+ behaves the same way as this one, I think I might have given it a score of 5/5. But keep in mind that it does not have a dry-touch finish (more of an immovable oily finish), but at least it has a sturdy one.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**The Balm BALMSHELTER TINTED MOISTURIZER (Shade: Lighter Than Light)**\n\n* \\- **SPF 18, broad spectrum**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **64 ml/ 2.15 Fl.

Note that this tinted moisturiser is much lighter than any of The Balm’s other products labelled “Lighter Than Light”. It’s really is a pale shade (it appears darker before you spread it over your skin), and it blends perfectly into my skin: I’ve never seen a tinted moisturiser or BB cream this fair before. However, it is so sheer, that the tint almost doesn’t matter. A little goes a long way, and that’s why you shouldn’t really use BB creams, tinted moisturisers and foundation as UV shields. I intended on using this on top of my sunscreen, but since it has next to none coverage, I never find myself reaching for it. If you’re pale as I am, and you want to experience the novelty of owning a tinted moisturiser, this is a good pick. No fragrance, and I haven’t used it close to my eyes.\n* \\- **Score: 2/5**\n\n**La Roche-Posay ANTHELIOS SHAKA ULTRA-LIGHT SPF 50+**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50+, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), PPD 42**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

This sunscreen was bought in Europe. America/Canada/Australia/Asia might have a different version of this sunscreen, because of the country’s different restrictions on UV filters and sunscreen criteria (especially American sunscreens). These versions are not always equal, both in UV protection and cosmetic elegance. It also turns out that I have bought two versions of this sunscreen: A new and an older version. I actually bought the newest version first – and I loved it. I couldn’t understand how people hated it (the skincare community is very split when it comes to the Shaka fluid). Of course, everyone’s skin is difference and can have a lot to say on how a sunscreen feels and behaves on the skin. It’s a fluid, so you have to shake it thoroughly. It takes a little bit longer to apply, since it’s a fluid. It dries down matte, and you can’t see that you’re wearing anything. Easy peasy. Its biggest downfall is the prize (I bought it on sale) and that it only comes in a tiny 50ml, so you can’t buy it in bulk, so to speak. But this was the newest version (as of this year)… and then I ended up accidently buying the older version online (which might still be in production?), and oh boy, was that a different experience! Not dry-touch, but oily! They looked so similar, but I instantly felt the difference on my face, because it didn’t dry down. Absolutely horrible in comparison, I felt so gross. You can tell the new version from the old from the packaging: The newest version has “ANTI-OXYDANT” written underneath the “UVB + UVA” text. It has a similar texture as the Piz Buin mentioned above, but I personally think the Piz Buin is superior in texture: even more dry-touch. But the shaka outshines almost all sunscreens in terms of UVB and UVA protection, and it doesn’t have any irritating fragrance to boot. I thought this would be my final HG sunscreen, because it couldn’t get any better in terms of UV protection and cosmetic elegance.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5 (new “ANTI-OXYDANT” version, 2019) (old version: 4/5, because it still has great UV protection, okay?)\n\n**EVY TECHNOLOGY SUNSCREEN MOUSSE SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I found it. Perfect texture, high UV protection, and relatively affordable. It also comes in a 100 ml bottle, not a 50 ml, which I appreciate. According to EVY, their sunscreens work differently than other sunscreens, because they don’t lay on top of your skin and form a film, but instead they sink into the skin (stratum corneum, I presume). Because of this, they’re very water resistant and sturdy. You shake the bottle, turn it upside down, and squeeze out a golf ball-sized blob of mousse. (This mousse holds its shape pretty well and you can play with it.) Then I just rub the mousse into my face: first it turns into a light-weight white cream… and then it disappears into the skin. After a couple of minutes, there is no trace of it, but if I’ve applied to much there might be some stickiness. It certainly feels like it sinks into the skin, because it’s very hydrating. The other sunscreens I’ve liked, I’ve liked for their dry-touch finish, but with EVY I don’t need to worry about it, because I can’t feel it on my face when I touch (well, technically my face feels like it’s been hydrated) and it doesn’t do anything when I sweat. A Youtuber reviewed EVY and said that the Boots star system is only marketing – it’s not. While we have a universal measurement of UVB: SPF, we’ve later realised that UVA also causes skin damage and cancer, but we still haven’t been able to agree on one universal measurement or requirement. The Boots Star Rating system with a maximum of 5 stars requires much higher UVA protection than the European Recommendation, where the UVA protection only needs to be 1/3 of the SPF. Gothamista, however, really liked EVY. It has no fragrance, but a light aerosol smell that goes away. Because of the packaging, no preservatives are needed. It also contains some antioxidants. I’m already on my third bottle of EVY, and I will continue to purchase it in the future.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5\n\nSome sunscreens I’ve heard good things about and might want to try one day: Anessa sunscreens, Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50 PA ++++, Ultrasun sunscreens, Bioderma Photoderm Max Cream SPF50+.",

        "body": "Protein chemistry is pretty complicated (definitely over my head) but there are differences between the proteins you'll see in products and most of it comes from the size of the proteins. However whether or not you'll actually notice this difference is another question. Proteins in haircare products work by forming a film on the outside of the hair. Most of the time you'll see hydrolyzed protein because makes it easier to mix in to the formula, but also easier to rinse out. Protein products make the biggest impact when used in a leave in for this reason. \n\n[This article](https://cosmetics.specialchem.com/selection-guide/formulating-hair-care-solutions-for-repair-and-protection) has a guide on picking proteins when making haircare products.

        "body": "Oof. Depends on the type of keratin, the type and mix of the other proteins, the type of damage you are targeting and the delivery system.\n\n u/will2461 already said it: proteins are complicated. So I'd like to complicate even more :) The magic we would want is a protein that mirrors our own and can attach to it in a mirror image where it has missing bits and pieces. There are a number of things to this, but I'll highlight composition, molecular weight, and electric change.\n\nThe first part, composition, is why many products use multiple proteins. Hair keratin is made up of a bunch of amino acids in different proportions. Most natural sources of protein are not  bioidentical to keratin, so you mix and match to get a good dose of half-cystine (reduced cystine) proline, serine, etc etc. There are products available to formulators that set out to create a bioidentical mix of amino acids, so you end up with vegetable keratin, for example.\n\nThe second part is molecular weight, or how big, on average, the molecules are. In short, proteins are huge vis-a-vis hair molecules, thus they get hydrolized. Once hydrolized, the liquid is a soup of amino acids, peptide and assorted sized chunks, no longer arranged in a single protein molecule. The average size of all this is important to hair. If you are after film-forming cuticle protection, larger molecular weight is good. For functions that require cortex repleninshment, smaller molecular sizes can actually penetrate the cuticle into the cortex.\n\nLastly, areas of damage in the hair fiber exhibit negative charges. To be substantive to hair proteins need to have enough positive charge to attach to those areas and resist rinsing. On top of 'normal' substantivity, proteins can be quaternized, which increases that positive charge so they attach to keratin with a stronger bond.\n\nThe ideal then is a mix of small and larger molecular weight amino acids covering the gamut of keratin, in a delivery system that allows for it to stick around either bc of no rinse or bc it is strongly chemically attached to the hair fiber.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sources**\n\nThis is all knowledge I learned a while back, so had to hunt down sources,  and this is a mix of academic knowledge, blogs and industry insider. Take with skepticism, do your research, etc:\n\n[Chemical Composition of Different Hair types](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-25611-0_2), in Robbins, C.

    "body": "Barrister & Mann is the brainchild of William Carius (/u/BostonPhotoTourist) who began his company in March 2013. Barrister & Mann was recently named 2015 artisan soap maker of the year by [Nick Shaves](https://youtu.be/qTz5jAn-XX8). For more information about the company, please read the opening of my other reviews of their soaps. Here is the most recent review [published](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wet_Shavers/comments/3u7gck/soap_review_barrister_mann_le_grand_cyphre/).\n\nAs always, I will provide my complete honest review and I have not received any compensation or preferential treatment for my review. This is strictly for the community to use as a tool in making informed decisions. Most importantly, these are my opinions and mine alone. If you do not like them or disagree with them, I respect that and ask that you do the same.  \n\nPlease note that I often review products from the same artisan and to save myself time, the introduction, packaging and lather may be identical or slightly tweaked. The uniqueness normally will be found in scent, price and overall.    \n\n**Packaging:**  \n[Night Music](http://imgur.com/a/FVPRA) arrives in a mess black bag and comes wrapped in a black tissue paper sealed with a heart sticker. The soap comes in the new standard B&M translucent polypropylene tub with matching screw top lid. The label affixed to the lid is a deep charcoal with a beautiful heart-like logo. The artwork is amazing and it shows B&M’s attention to every single detail with regards to packaging. The label contains the soap name, scent notes, company website and soap weight, which is the most common size for B&M, 4 ounces. On the interior of the lid, the top label can been seen through the translucent lid and the ingredients are listed along with the company address and Made In America slogan. This is something new that I have not seen done by anyone else in the business. There is nothing more about packaging that needs to be discussed as most are already familiar with the offering.\n  \n**Lather:**  \nNight Music continues the transition away from the original “white label” soap base and opts instead for the new and improved “Glissant” soap base. This soap base has been the subject of countless reviews of late and the consensus is that this sets a new standard in the tallow soap base space. The ease of lather, cushion and slickness are at the pinnacle of artisanal offerings. The only soap base that I have used to date that rivals this is the Mickey Lee Soapworks soap base (formerly their Special Edition soap base). With a 10-15 second load of my synthetic Plisson type brush I am able to go straight to the face, adding water to the brush on each quadrant and can produce a stellar lather that is protective and slick. The post shave feel of the soap is among the best available as well. It is moisturizing to the point where an aftershave is optional, but that would take away from the fun of the experience. Another under discussed benefit of the “Glissant” soap base is that it allows newer wet shavers some leniency with lather production. It is less thirsty in general than the previous soap base, but it also is very tolerant of water which minimizes the likelihood that a less experienced user will drowned the soap. The soap also loads into the brush easily which benefits new wet shavers who have a tendency to under load their brush before making a lather. The versatility of this soap base will be welcome to both experienced wet shavers as well as newcomers to the hobby. \n  \n**Scent:**  \nAs with almost every B&M scent, Night Music continues the tradition of being a complex scent blended with a perfumers mentality. The scent is described by Will as *”blended heaps of vanilla with peppery bergamot and silvery iris to form the core of the fragrance, then layered the whole thing on top of 5 different musks to create the raunchiest, naughtiest fragrance we’ve ever smelled in shaving. We finished it off with just the tiniest fraction of strawberry, so light that you’d probably never even know it’s there, to sweeten the design and make it just a little bit more fun.”* So what does that mean? To my nose, I am immediately met with the musks, the supporting actor of this piece. These pungent smells linger as you build your lather but weaken as the main character, vanilla enters stage left. The scent is rounded out by the spiciness of the bergamot with the iris and strawberry playing the role of extra in this short film. From a broad perspective, this scent reminds me of both Leviathan, with the raunchy musk type notes but also smells of Lavanille, with the deep vanilla core. Hate it or love it, the scent is well crafted and lends itself to a full olfactory journey. The scent reminds me of the aroma of a port wine. Not the taste, which is far too sweet for this soap, but the deep rich aroma of a handcrafted port.\n\n**Price:**  \nAt $25.00 for 4 oz of soap, this is soap comes in at $6.25/oz. The ingredient list is as follows: Potassium Stearate, Aqua, Glycerin, Sodium Stearate, Potassium Tallowate, Sodium Tallowate, Potassium Ricinoleate, Potassium Shea Butterate, Sodium Ricinoleate, Coconut Milk, Sodium Shea Butterate, Fragrance, Carthamus tinctorius hybrid (Hybrid Safflower) Seed Oil, Potassium Palm Kernelate, Allantoin, Lanolin, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Citrate, Tocopherol Acetate, Hydrolyzed Silk Protein. This soap is clearly priced as a luxury product based on the price per ounce over $6.00. For many, this is the downfall for Barrister & Mann products. You can argue that the high end, American sourced ingredients drive the cost of the product. The performance of the soap isn’t matched by many in my opinion, but as an example, Mickey Lee Soapworks retails for $16.00 for 4 oz of soap which equates to $4.00/oz. Is B&M 36% better than MLS in terms of performance? Not by my account, but we all have the right to purchase what we like and can afford and I am lucky enough to be able to afford this soap.  \n  \n**Bottom Line:**  \nNight Music is a well crafted soap with packaging and performance that are at the very top of available products. The scent, as discussed above, is a journey in itself, because of it’s complexity and uniqueness. These qualities transform, Night Music into an experience more rather than a singular categorization. This is much like the hobby in general. For the untrained individual, shaving is nothing more than using a sharp blade to remove whiskers on a routine basis. To a wet shaver and hobbyist, the task becomes so much more. Whether it is your personal time to reflect, a chore that you now enjoy or an enhancement of an event, the experience for many has become ritual. Night Music delivers on the promise of providing a comfortable and enjoyable part to your ritual. \n",

    "body": "Hey guys. About a month ago I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeganBeauty/s/KwkOtfk3gp) outlining my curly hair struggles since going vegan. Several people provided tips (which was so amazing 😭) and for the last 37 days I’ve been experimenting. I just wanted to update you guys on what I “changed” about my routine to get it looking how it does now and also to share what I learned in general..\n\n1. Vegan Protein\nSo the shea moisture conditioner I used (and loved) before going vegan had silk protein in it. When I discovered it wasn’t vegan I switched to Giovanni curl habit conditioner, not realizing it had zero protein in it (didn’t know anything about moisture/protein at the time). Naturally my hair changed over time (not to my liking). Redditors on my last post commented I needed protein so I bought hydrolyzed vegetable protein drops from Amazon to add directly to my conditioner. Although these helped to a certain extent, I noticed my hair was not even close to how it was before. I felt discouraged because it became sort of apparent to me that it very well could be that the protein that works best for my hair simply happens to be silk protein ([an article I read on the differences between protein sources](http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2013/09/more-about-protein.html)). Silk is an amazing material with amazing properties so this didn’t really surprise me. To my surprise, however, I found VEGAN hydrolyzed silk protein drops online. Basically they genetically modify yeast to produce silk proteins. Amazing. Brilliant. Luxurious. I was super excited when I found the product. I’ll link it [here](https://www.bulknaturalswholesale.com/products/hydrolyzed-vegan-liquid-silk-cruelty-41274). Long story short the use of this product turned my hair around immediately and I think it’s so cool that the silk worms have been spared in the production of this product, a product of which humans “learned” to produce frOM the silk worms themselves.\n\n2. Sticking to Curly Hair Brands\nSomeone recommended sticking to curly hair brands as opposed to brands that just-so-happen to have curly hair products. Because of this I switched my conditioner from Giovanni curl habit to the [Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Deep Moisturizing Conditioner](https://www.sheamoisture.com/raw-shea-butter-restorative-conditioner/764302280217/) which isn’t too different from the shea moisture conditioner I used before becoming vegan. \n\n3. Controlling Protein/Moisture Balance\nThrough experimenting with different ratios of [pumps of conditioner:drops of protein] I’ve found that I can somewhat directly control the protein/moisture balance of my hair. This has been a major strength of using a deeply moisturizing conditioner that lacks protein coupled with the protein drops. \n\n4. Diffusing\nDiffusing with low heat has been a godsend. My curls turn out tighter and less frizzy. Plus my roots have more volume. \n\n5. Lighting Lighting Lighting\nIn my last post the images I was comparing my hair to had inconsistent lighting. I realize that that sorta put me in a position to judge the perceived differences quite harshly. This time I made sure to include two pictures of the same hair day taken just moments apart in different lighting. Looks quite different even though it’s exactly the same.  Lighting aside, I was just judging my hair, my journey, etc. in general which I think ultimately is what got the best of me, not my hair itself per-say (see attached meme🫶).\n\nMy current routine by the way (that which produced the hair in the images attached):\n\n1. No shampoo\n2. 10 pumps of Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Deep Moisturizing Conditioner + 12 drops of Vegan Hydrolyzed Silk Protein (scrub scalp)\n3. Rinse out completely in shower, use fingers to rake hair under running water upside down to form the curls\n4. Pat/scrunch gently with t-shirt \n5. Pat/scrunch Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment into hair\n6. Diffuse\n\nThank you everyone!",

I wonder how it'll be! It seems very gentle so far. Maybe I'll wake up tomorrow with smoother skin, ready to sweat it up again in this humidity!

I wouldn't say the Milky Gel is *super* waterproof, it's pretty good for humid days but nothing like sports sunscreens, but I do enjoy using this one as it doesn't slide off the face quickly but feels light.\n\n[My full review](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeautyAdvice/comments/c1zy1e/what_did_you_trybuy_this_week_18062019/erm8a12/)",

This is strictly for the community to use as a tool in making informed decisions. Most importantly, these are my opinions and mine alone. If you do not like them or disagree with them, I respect that and ask that you do the same.  \n\nPlease note that I often review products from the same artisan and to save myself time, the introduction, packaging and lather may be identical or slightly tweaked. The uniqueness normally will be found in scent, price and overall.    \n\n**Packaging:**  \n[Night Music](http://imgur.com/a/FVPRA) arrives in a mess black bag and comes wrapped in a black tissue paper sealed with a heart sticker. The soap comes in the new standard B&M translucent polypropylene tub with matching screw top lid. The label affixed to the lid is a deep charcoal with a beautiful heart-like logo. The artwork is amazing and it shows B&M’s attention to every single detail with regards to packaging. The label contains the soap name, scent notes, company website and soap weight, which is the most common size for B&M, 4 ounces. On the interior of the lid, the top label can been seen through the translucent lid and the ingredients are listed along with the company address and Made In America slogan. This is something new that I have not seen done by anyone else in the business. There is nothing more about packaging that needs to be discussed as most are already familiar with the offering.\n  \n**Lather:**  \nNight Music continues the transition away from the original “white label” soap base and opts instead for the new and improved “Glissant” soap base. This soap base has been the subject of countless reviews of late and the consensus is that this sets a new standard in the tallow soap base space. The ease of lather, cushion and slickness are at the pinnacle of artisanal offerings. The only soap base that I have used to date that rivals this is the Mickey Lee Soapworks soap base (formerly their Special Edition soap base). With a 10-15 second load of my synthetic Plisson type brush I am able to go straight to the face, adding water to the brush on each quadrant and can produce a stellar lather that is protective and slick. The post shave feel of the soap is among the best available as well. It is moisturizing to the point where an aftershave is optional, but that would take away from the fun of the experience. Another under discussed benefit of the “Glissant” soap base is that it allows newer wet shavers some leniency with lather production. It is less thirsty in general than the previous soap base, but it also is very tolerant of water which minimizes the likelihood that a less experienced user will drowned the soap. The soap also loads into the brush easily which benefits new wet shavers who have a tendency to under load their brush before making a lather. The versatility of this soap base will be welcome to both experienced wet shavers as well as newcomers to the hobby. \n  \n**Scent:**  \nAs with almost every B&M scent, Night Music continues the tradition of being a complex scent blended with a perfumers mentality. The scent is described by Will as *”blended heaps of vanilla with peppery bergamot and silvery iris to form the core of the fragrance, then layered the whole thing on top of 5 different musks to create the raunchiest, naughtiest fragrance we’ve ever smelled in shaving. We finished it off with just the tiniest fraction of strawberry, so light that you’d probably never even know it’s there, to sweeten the design and make it just a little bit more fun.”* So what does that mean? To my nose, I am immediately met with the musks, the supporting actor of this piece. These pungent smells linger as you build your lather but weaken as the main character, vanilla enters stage left. The scent is rounded out by the spiciness of the bergamot with the iris and strawberry playing the role of extra in this short film. From a broad perspective, this scent reminds me of both Leviathan, with the raunchy musk type notes but also smells of Lavanille, with the deep vanilla core. Hate it or love it, the scent is well crafted and lends itself to a full olfactory journey. The scent reminds me of the aroma of a port wine. Not the taste, which is far too sweet for this soap, but the deep rich aroma of a handcrafted port.\n\n**Price:**  \nAt $25.00 for 4 oz of soap, this is soap comes in at $6.25/oz. The ingredient list is as follows: Potassium Stearate, Aqua, Glycerin, Sodium Stearate, Potassium Tallowate, Sodium Tallowate, Potassium Ricinoleate, Potassium Shea Butterate, Sodium Ricinoleate, Coconut Milk, Sodium Shea Butterate, Fragrance, Carthamus tinctorius hybrid (Hybrid Safflower) Seed Oil, Potassium Palm Kernelate, Allantoin, Lanolin, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Citrate, Tocopherol Acetate, Hydrolyzed Silk Protein. This soap is clearly priced as a luxury product based on the price per ounce over $6.00. For many, this is the downfall for Barrister & Mann products. You can argue that the high end, American sourced ingredients drive the cost of the product. The performance of the soap isn’t matched by many in my opinion, but as an example, Mickey Lee Soapworks retails for $16.00 for 4 oz of soap which equates to $4.00/oz. Is B&M 36% better than MLS in terms of performance? Not by my account, but we all have the right to purchase what we like and can afford and I am lucky enough to be able to afford this soap.  \n  \n**Bottom Line:**  \nNight Music is a well crafted soap with packaging and performance that are at the very top of available products. The scent, as discussed above, is a journey in itself, because of it’s complexity and uniqueness. These qualities transform, Night Music into an experience more rather than a singular categorization. This is much like the hobby in general. For the untrained individual, shaving is nothing more than using a sharp blade to remove whiskers on a routine basis. To a wet shaver and hobbyist, the task becomes so much more. Whether it is your personal time to reflect, a chore that you now enjoy or an enhancement of an event, the experience for many has become ritual. Night Music delivers on the promise of providing a comfortable and enjoyable part to your ritual. \n",

This is just reference for you guys! :)\n\nMost hair needs some amount of protein, especially damaged(sun, wind, heat, bleach, etc) hair. Normal hair, or protein sensitive hair does not need large doses of protein all the time. If your hair feels stiff, frizzy, and dry, then your hair might be getting to much protein.  \n\nFor some fine/damaged curlies, protein will make your curls spring to life like never before!! Careful- It can be addicting and turn into a case of \"too much of a good thing\".  Don't worry- if you go overboard on protein treatments, you can just do a good deep conditioning treatment to help counteract the protein overload. :)  So if you have damaged hair that needs protein, how often should you do it?  If it's an INTENSE level of protein, once a week. If it's a conditioner that has some protein in it, every other day or even every day(if it's low enough on the ingredient list) will be fine.  This is why hair porosity is important: Low porosities probably do not need any protein, normal could use some protein, but high porosity LOVES protein. :)\n\nOKAY. Here's the list of commonly used proteins.  Looked for the actual word \"protein\", \"keratin\" or for the word \"hydrolyzed\" to indicate a protein in most cases.\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed casein\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed collagen\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed hair keratin\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed keratin\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed rice protein\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed silk\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed soy protein\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed wheat protein\n\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl silk amino acids\n\n* Cocoyl hydrolyzed collagen\n\n* Cocoyl hydrolyzed keratin\n\n* Hydrolyzed keratin\n\n* Hydrolyzed oat flour\n\n* Hydrolyzed silk\n\n* Hydrolyzed silk protein\n\n* Hydrolyzed soy protein\n\n* Hydrolyzed wheat protein\n\n* Hydrolyzed wheat protein\n\n* Keratin\n\n* Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed collagen\n\n* TEA-cocoyl hydrolyzed collagen\n\n* TEA-cocoyl hydrolyzed soy protein",

I have high porosity/protein loving hair, granted, but this has turned my stubborn ends soft and wonderful! Usually my curls dry out pretty easily, but they stayed hydrated! Although, I did use too much the first time and ended up with slightly oily looking curls, but damn if my hair was not super soft and defined. It also was curlier than usual for a wash n go. I can’t wait to see what happens with gel. 10/10\n\n**Other thoughts:** \n\n1. I really appreciate that you can use this on wet or dry hair \n\n2. The consistency is on the thinner side, but not runny at all unless you put water in it. \n\n3. I will cherish it forever. This is a HG for me. \n\n",

    "body": "Hello IMAM!\n\n I have been lurking for over a year now, and decided I should probably introduce myself. I've been on Etsy since 2015, after the birth of my first son. This year, now that I have 2 little guys running around, I decided to go through a re-branding and dedicate myself to my business. \n\nI specialize in handmade soaps with some other products such as lotions, emulsified sugar scrubs, and lip balms. My products are not vegan, because I put cruelty-free tussah silk in my soaps, cruelty-free hydrolyzed silk in some of my lotions, and I use locally sourced beeswax in my lip balms. However, I would be happy to point you to the products that are vegan, and if you're interested I could craft something just for you that is vegan friendly. \n\nSomething else that I do focus on is eco-friendly packaging. I'm pretty passionate about reducing plastics where I can. All of my lotions and scrubs are packaged in glass jars, my lip balms are packaged in compostable Kraft paper tubes, and my soaps do not come plastic-wrapped. They come in 100% recycled paper boxes. \n\nFor most of my skincare, I do focus on dry skin conditions. I was always plagued by dry skin - so that's where I got started with my formulations. I don't use pre-made bases. I source every ingredient and love working on my recipes to make sure I'm creating excellent products. \n\nPlease feel free to ask any questions. \n\nIf you have the time, I'd love it if you could look at my social media and website. You can even check out my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm02X9Qrcp14UXIGDNBUqrw?view_as=subscriber) to see how I make our soaps. \n[website](http://www.sirenheart.com)\n[facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sirenheartsoap)\n[instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sirenheartsoap) ",

I realized it contained alcohol and have since switched to Lait U. I did enjoy Lait VIP o2 but I don’t believe in using products with alcohol for extended periods of time so that’s why I decided to switch and Lait U is very gentle. \n\n- I was recommend complexe iribiol for pimples I get from time to time. Yes, it clears it up very quickly, but the second ingredient is alcohol denat and I would get rough patches on my skin if I used it multiple days in a row. \n\n- I do love Masque Vivant although it also contains denatured alcohol. Since I only use it about 3 times a week for about 30 min I have decided it’s of low risk to my skin since the alcohol is a little bit lower on the list. \n\n- Masque vip o2 does seem to make the skin around my eyes a little brighter but I have a pimple right near my eye that won’t seem to go away. After looking at the ingredient list and seeing mink oil as the 5th ingredient it makes sense since mink oil is very comedogenic. \n\n- I love lotion MC 110 N*1, and since I doesn’t contain any alcohol I will continue to use. It really plumps my skin and gives me a glow. It is meant to be used after your P50 lotion (toner). \n\n- I was recommended P50 PIGM400 for my skin and it does lighten my skin and make it feel super balanced. After looking at the ingredients though, it also contains denatured alcohol and therefore after I finish this bottle I will move on to the regular P50 (without phenol) since it doesn’t contain alcohol. \n\n- The placenta serum is probably my favorite. It hydrates and heals my skin and I also use it on my eyes during the day. \n\n- The PIGM400 serum is just ok. It also contains alcohol and I feel like my other products have lightened my dark spots from recents acne more than this serum. It also contains some ingredients that can cause acne. \n\n- Creme Dermopurifiante makes my skin glow when I use it and it does great with skin that is acne prone but it also contains alcohol so for me, using it long term is a no go. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "[Video](https://youtu.be/fv6wNRm3zGQ)\n\nHighland Springs Soap Co. (http://www.highlandspringssoap.ca/) is an artisan based in Cranbrook, British Columbia. The brand is run by Mary and Chris Troniak. Mary is a chemist by profession and uses her expertise to delivery skin beneficial recipes in shaving soap, handmade soap and personal care products. HSSC will release their tallow based soap to the wet shaving masses, tomorrow, December 13, 2019. To make this even more special, this soap was collaborated with Australian Private Reserve, who design the scent for the grand release. Highland Springs Soap Co. can be purchased direct from their website, West Coast Shaving (https://www.westcoastshaving.com/) and Stone Field Shaving Co. (https://stonefieldshave.com/).\n\nEclipse is a leathery, musky fragrance by design. Featuring notes of; bergamot, dried fig, carnation, mimosa, cedarwood, cocoa, white rum, blond tobacco, Russian leather, narcissus, pink pepper, geranium, lavender, benzoin, sandalwood, civet, oud, amyris, cistus and black musk, the scent is animalic, but inviting. This masculine accord is well suited for the cold months that lie ahead. Mrs. Ruds is neutral on this scent. Strength of scent is mid-strong out of the container and remains as such once lathered. ry That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Zoologist Perfumes /Chiseled Face Civet Trouble as a comparable scent profile.    \n\nHighland Springs Soap Co. tallow soap base is a very soft formulation, much like a croap. Ingredients are listed as: Beef Tallow, Stearic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Glycerin, Parfum, Hydrolyzed Silk Peptides (Silk Peptide), Tocopherol. This is a thirsty tallow base that demands hydration. When properly hydrated the lather takes on the consistency of sour cream. Slickness is elite in terms of primary slickness and very good in terms of residual slickness. The post shave attributes of this base are excellent. My skin was left well hydrated with a silky feeling after the rinse. The ShaveScore for Highland Springs Soap Co. tallow is a 95. For similar performance in a soap base, I suggest First Line Shave.  \n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Highland Springs Soap Co.

    "body": "[Video Up!](https://youtu.be/lLqZYxsBQv4)    \n\n---\n\nBarrister & Mann (https://www.barristerandmann.com/) recently released it’s traditional February special edition soap. This year, they moved away (hopefully temporarily) from Night Music and unveiled Sinfonia. This special edition is available now through February 28, 2018 and can be purchased direct or  through several third party retailers, such as Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/).\n\nSinfonia is a relatively simplistic scent, especially considering Barrister & Mann’s usual deeply complex accords. This two note accord consists of jasmine and apricot. The scent opens with the jasmine, which to my nose is a sharp, aromatic white floral. This beautiful scent is then enveloped in a light, refreshingly sweet smell of apricot. Despite this scent’s simplicity, on the surface, it really shines and shows a mastery of balance that few artisans in this community have. Scent strength is mid both off the sample and remains mid through the lather building and shave. The most similar scent I can find to compare this to is Dapper Dragon Jasmine & Vanilla.  \n\nThis special edition is produced in the glissant base (Potassium Stearate, Aqua, Glycerin, Sodium Stearate, Potassium Tallowate, Sodium Tallowate, Potassium Ricinoleate, Potassium Shea Butterate, Sodium Ricinoleate, Coconut Milk, Fragrance/Parfum, Sodium Shea Butterate, Carthamus tinctorius hybrid (Hybrid Safflower) Seed Oil, Potassium Palm Kernelate, Allantoin, Lanolin, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Citrate, Tocopherol Acetate, Hydrolyzed Silk Protein). This base is well known for its excellence in performance in all wet shaving metrics. The soap loads easily into a brush and has a very wide hydration range. The ideal lather is that of the consistency of sour cream, with a nearly identical density and sheen. The slickness and residual slickness are among the absolute best and the post shave leaves absolutely no need for a post shave product. The resulting shavescore for this base is 97. For similar performance experience, I suggest; Catie’s Bubbles and Talbot Shaving.  \n\n---\n\n\n\n ****Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, \nsponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.* \n \n* Soap - Barrister & Mann Sinfonia (purchased)\n\n* Brush - Wolf Whiskers RCE#43 Juliet (purchased)\n\n* Razor - ​Worcester Razor Co. “Royal Worcester” (purchased)\n\n* Post - Barrister & Mann Awesome (meetup freebie)\n\f\n",

The brand is run by Mary and Chris Troniak. Mary is a chemist by profession and uses her expertise to deliver skin beneficial recipes in shaving soap, handmade soap and personal care products. The company focus is above and beyond providing a great grooming experience. Their aim is to provide a skin nourishing, safe experience that becomes part of an overall skin care routine. Highland Springs Soap Co. can be purchased directly from their website, West Coast Shaving (https://www.westcoastshaving.com/) and Stone Field Shaving Co. (https://stonefieldshave.com/).\n\nReflections is an homage to Guess Man. This casual fragrance features notes of; Lavender, Armoise, White Pepper, Ginger Root, Nutmeg, Siberian Blue Fir, Peru Balsam, Sandalwood, Amber, Suede and Musk. Having never smelled the fragrance this pays homage to, I can only assume it is a close representation. To me, the fragrance is extremely wearable and presents a masculine vibe that feels like it has mass appeal. Mrs. Ruds approves of this fragrance for all occasions, including the ever important date night. Strength of scent is mid-strong off the puck and remains mid-strong once lathered. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Siliski Soaps - Masculine Musk as a comparable scent profile.    \n\nHighland Springs Soap Co. tweaked their tallow base to address the first iteration being very soft. The base is now of mid firmness. Ingredients are listed as: Beef Tallow, Stearic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Glycerin, Parfum, Hydrolyzed Silk Peptides (Silk Peptide), Tocopherol. This is a thirsty tallow base that demands hydration. When properly hydrated the lather takes on the consistency of sour cream. Slickness is elite in terms of primary slickness and very good in terms of residual slickness. The post shave attributes of this base are elite. My skin was left well hydrated with a silky feeling after the rinse. The ShaveScore for Highland Springs Soap Co. tallow is a 99. For similar performance in a soap base, I suggest Zingari Man Sego\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Highland Springs Soap Co.

    "body": "Barrister & Mann is the brainchild of William Carius (/u/BostonPhotoTourist) who began his company in March 2013. The soaps quickly became the quintessential product to own in order to get a luxurious and classy shave. Will, is devoted to producing soap of the highest quality and that is proudly hand made in the United States. This includes the sourcing of his ingredients. Barrister & Mann offers soap, alcohol based aftershave toniques and non alcohol based aftershaves (Kyovu). The site has a dedicated area for lady wet shavers and also has a budget line of soaps, dubbed Latha. Barrister & Mann can be purchased directly from their [website](http://www.barristerandmann.com/) or from other third party resellers such as [Shave Revolution](http://www.shaverevolution.com/collections/shaving-soap/barrister-mann) or [Maggard Razors](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product-category/soaps-creams/barrister-mann/).  \n\nAs always, I will provide my complete honest review and I have not received any compensation or preferential treatment for my review. This is strictly for the community to use as a tool in making informed decisions. Most importantly, these are my opinions and mine alone. If you do not like them or disagree with them, I respect that and ask that you do the same.  \n\nPlease note that I often review products from the same artisan and to save myself time, the introduction, packaging and lather may be identical or slightly tweaked. The uniqueness normally will be found in scent, price and overall.    \n\n**Packaging:**  \nLe Grand Chypre (LGC) comes in a dark green polypropylene tub with the same color screw top lid. This packaging is one of the gold standards for soap presentations. The soap fills the tub about ¾ full which provides ample room for loading the soap. The tub is 3.94” wide, perfect to allow swirling just about any brush to load without making a mess. The label on the lid is an is a charcol/black background with metallic dark green writing, a very classy presentation. The company logo, website and ingredients can also be found on label.  \n  \n**Lather:**  \nLGC utilizes a new formulation of the legendary B&M “white label” soap base. This formulation, code named “Glissant” was designed for even more slickness. There appear to be other benefits to this new formulation as the soap loaded into the bristles of the brush more quickly. It also seems as though the amount of time it takes for the lather to explode into a voluminous and slick substance has been reduced. I never imagined any soap base could be better that B&M “white label”, it has been my absolute favorite for some time. The “Glissant” base might have changed the standard. The lather feels lighter although it is more voluminous and the slickness is unlike any soap or cream that I have ever tried. There are about a hundred adjectives of praise I could throw at the slickness, but you really just need to experience it for yourself. Post shave feel matches that of “white label” although it does feel a bit lighter in terms of texture. Regardless of the rest of this review, LGC deserves to be tried by anyone who desires to see a game changing lather. From Barrister & Mann themselves; *”Engineered for slickness and ease of latherability, we christened the new soap \"Glissant,\" and re-considered every inch of our original formula to make sure that we had gotten it just right. Those who tested the new base were delighted by its tremendous creaminess and lubricity, and, after 16 separate iterations, we completed the formula just in time to finish the soap on schedule.”*\n  \n**Scent:**  \nThe scent on LGC is in typical B&M fashion, elegant and complex. Straight away I was met a sharp citrus burst, most notably bergamot and lemon. As my olfactory nerves fired more feverishly, the notes of labdanum and patchouli became present. From there it was all over for me, I smelled whiffs of peach, a floral note and even some woodiness. Just when I thought my nose had graduated to “good smeller” this scent humbled me back to the “it smells” category. Here is what B&M says about the scent, which by my account is far more beautifully described than I can; *”We began with a base that the world hasn’t seen for nearly 50 years: Mousse de Chyprée, one of the legendary creations of the House of DeLaire, whose formula we found buried in a rare perfume treatise. We built our very own chypre accord around it, weaving in notes of bergamot, lime, labdanum, and a touch of patchouli to produce an elegant, citrusy heart for our masterpiece. From there, we experimented with different materials, eventually deciding to follow in the footsteps of Jacques Guerlain by incorporating a fraction of peachy Persicol, blended with notes of rose, frankincense, cedar, and various musks and other perfume compounds to construct an elegant, slightly fruity, freshly floral design perfectly suited to the refined shaver.”* This scent is vastly different from the scent that I have been reaching for of late. I will need more time with it to decide if it makes my most loved scents list. Right now it sits on the good scent list. Scent is mid off the puck and remains mid through the lather.\n  \n**Price:**  \nAt $25.00 for 4 oz of soap, this is soap comes in at $6.25/oz. Yes, this is an expensive soap because of the high end ingredients. The ingredient list is as follows: Potassium Stearate, Aqua, Glycerin, Sodium Stearate, Potassium Tallowate, Sodium Tallowate, Potassium Ricinoleate, Potassium Shea Butterate, Sodium Ricinoleate, Coconut Milk, Sodium Shea Butterate, Fragrance, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Potassium Palm Kernelate, Allantoin, Lanolin, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Citrate, Tocopherol Acetate, Hydrolyzed Silk Protein.\n  \n**Bottom Line:**  \nWill has put his heart and soul into this creation and it is evident by the refined and sophisticated scent profile which he has constructed. The “Glissant” base is truly a **next level lather** in terms of both performance and ease of use. LCG will be polarizing in my opinion because it is a sharp turn from the masculine and dark scents that many wet shavers reach for this time of year. LGC is bright and vibrant and it surely will have plenty of wet shavers reaching for it in their rotation. The performance alone warrants anyone who is curious to obtain some and give it a try. Congratulations to Will and Barrister & Mann for yet another work of art.",

Have you had any major changes in climate or the amount of time you're spending outdoors?\n\nI'd also recommend adding a bonnet to your conditioning routine every now and then -- use your deep-conditioning treatment, and then wrap your hair in plastic wrap. Attach the bonnet to your hair dryer and let the heat set it in (YMMV based on the conditioner, so it'll involve a little experimentation). I have [this bonnet dryer](http://www.amazon.com/Gold-Hot-Bonnet-Dryer-Attachment/dp/B000YC3VHS/ref=sr_1_14?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1392309024&sr=1-14&keywords=soft+bonnet+dryer), and while it makes me feel silly, it does the trick. \n\nI might also go through your routine, removing a product for a week at a time to see if something is not working well with your hair. Either that, or go back to just shampoo/conditioner for a bit and add in things one at a time. \n\nOne last thing about flatironing -- does it work on the lowest setting with one pass? Hair can handle heat, but it's better not to be exposed to heat for a long time. If you're having to go over your hair several times on low heat, you're tugging on it more than necessary and should use a higher temperature for a shorter amount of time.",

With my pixie, my hair sometimes felt like a Labrador retriever's coat. About a month ago I started using a baking soda scrub to \"wash\" my hair and then a vinegar rinse to condition. I still shower every day but only do my hair twice a week. I've never had so many good hair days as I'm having now. And the friends with long hair that have switched to this say that you could actually see where they made the switch in their hair growth; it looked that much healthier. \n\nThere are several methods to start the switch to no-shampoo.

The company began focused on making a shaving soap that could lather well in Alberta, where the water is notoriously hard. Midnight & Two prides itself on using all-natural, skin rich  ingredients and has been featured in several prominent publications such as; Playboy Magazine, Sharp Magazine and The Globe and Mail. Midnight & Two can be purchased directly on the company’s website or visit this link for their stockists network - [https://www.midnightandtwo.com/pages/where-to-buy](https://www.midnightandtwo.com/pages/where-to-buy). \n\nNo.6 Gin is the signature scent of Kent of Inglewood, a distributor of M&T products. This scent is all juniper berries to my nose. As the name would indicate, it is designed to remind the user of the popular spirit. This scent is not in my wheelhouse and as you would suspect, Mrs. Ruds does not approve of the scent as well. Strength of scent is mid-strong off the metal tin and remains this way once lathered. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Cold River Soap Works Juniper as a similar scent profile.  \n\nMidnight & Two uses a vegan based soap consisting of the ingredients: Distilled Aqua, Stearic Acid, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Shorea Stenoptera (Illipe) Butter, Elaeis Guineensis (Palm) Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Garcinia Indica Seed (Kokum) Butter, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Cannabis Sativa (Hemp) Seed Oil, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Hydrolyzed Silk Protein, Essential Oils (Fragrance), Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract. The soap is mid firm and like many vegan soaps, is of average thirst. Lather creation is easy and when you arrive at the proper dialed-in state, the lather resembles whipped cream. The slickness of this soap is good in terms of both primary slickness and also in terms of residual slickness. The post shave is good as well. Use of a proper post shaving product would be recommended in my experience. Given the performance and my experience, the ShaveScore for Midnight & Two checks in at 85. For similar performance in a soap base, I recommend Blackship Grooming.\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Midnight & Two No.6 Gin (loaner)\n* Brush - Omega Evo Silversynth Marble Ego (purchased)\n* Razor - Max Sprecher (loaner)\n* Post - Midnight & Two No.6 Gin (loaner)",

Turns out, I had no clear idea of what to go for, since many ingredient's names had no sense for me. Were they alchohol? Silicones? Maybe both of them? Since there's no signal inside the stores, I couldn't even use the ingredients bot.\n\nI got out and checked reddit back and found the holy list of products... except there's an extreme lack of content in the italian list. Having no idea about what to buy, I went back home and started reading more on the wiki. After reading a good amount of articles, I wrote a guide for myself, so I can understand if a product should be the one I need or not. Might as well share it here.\n\nBeing the guide to myself, it's made in my native language (italian). I could make a translation, but you'd notice that it's no more than the content of a couple of wiki pages summarized, so I think it would still be a good idea to go read those, since they're surely better written than mine. Aside from that, in this guide there's the full content of the intro, with all the explanations of all the techinques added (SOTC, Plopping etc.), a list of all the main ingredients you should find on a product, understanding what is nice to have and what should be avoided (among alchohols, silicones and humettants), some dedication about porosity and how to care for your curles during sleep and when you don't wash them. This should hopefully help any italian who gets here to fill the holy list of italian products easily. There you go:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrima di cominciare, leggerai diverse volte il termine \"sgranocchiare\". Si intende tamponare gentilmente i capelli partendo dalle punte, alzando le ciocche fino alla cute, quindi strizzare.\n\nRoutine per lavare i capelli \\[le tecniche in parentesi quadra sono opzionali\\]:\n\n\\- **Reset shampoo** (solo una volta. Solfati, no siliconi) \\[se possibile V05 clarifying, ma va' bene  anche uno della linea Ultra dolce (es. quello alle 5 erbe) o Fructis (es. il Cucumber Fresh) della Garnier. (da riusare non più di una volta al mese)\n\n\\- **Balsamo** (no solfati, no siliconi). Non aver paura di abbondare. Pettina i capelli con il balsamo ancora in testa.\n\n\\- **Sciacqua** via il balsamo, continuando a massaggiare. Puoi valutare di lasciare un po' di balsamo in testa\n\n\\[S2C\\]: dopo il balsamo, aggiungi porzioni d'acqua come se fossero un prodotto. Strizza l'acqua nei capelli per sciacquare poi via il balsamo.\n\n\\- Prendi molto **gel** (no solfati, no siliconi, no alcol) e usalo sui capelli ancora bagnati\n\n\\- **Asciuga** \"sgranocchiando\" con una maglietta in cotone o asciugamano in microfibra. Asciuga col diffusore da lontano, temperatura media.\n\nPer aumentare il volume, puoi mettere dei fermagli sulle radici dei capelli.\n\n\\[Plopping\\]: appoggia una maglietta in cotone su un mobile. Appoggia la fronte sulla maglietta. Lega la maglietta attorno alla testa e solleva nuovamente la testa.\n\nDopo 10 minuti, leva la maglietta e usala per asciugare \"sgranocchiando\" i capelli.\n\n\\- **A capelli asciutti**. \"sgranocchia via\" la \"croccantezza\" causata dal gel, con le mani\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[SOTC\\]: se i capelli risultano crespi, puoi aggiungere un olio, massaggiando dalla punta verso la radice, quando i capelli sono perfettamente asciutti.\n\n\\[Super Soaker\\]: usa tutti i prodotti insieme. Sciacqua usando poca acqua alla volta.\n\n\\[Finger coiling\\]: definisci i ricci applicando il prodotto riccio per riccio. Avvolgilo intorno alle dita e ripeti con il riccio successivo.\n\n\\[LOC\\]: utile sui ricci annodati. Prevede l'utilizzo di balsamo, olio e crema, nell'ordine che ho scritto\n\n\\[Rake & Shake\\]:  dividi i capelli in ciocche e applica i prodotti sulle lunghezze pettinando i capelli con le dita. Una volta alle punte, afferra la  ciocca e agitala per \"riattivare\" i ricci.\n\n\\[Shingling\\]: dividi la testa in 5-6 sezioni e focalizzati su una alla volta, applicando il prodotto aiutandoti col pettine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Alcol:**\n\nAlcuni alcol sono totalmente da evitare (Ethanol alcohol, Ethyl alcohol, Propanol alcohol, Alcohol denat., Isopropyl alcohol, Isopropanol alcohol, Benzyl alcohol)\n\nAltri sono permessi, in quanto non causano danni. Anzi, possono addirittura portare benefici (Cetyl alcohol, Cetearyl alcohol, Stearyl alcohol, Lauryl alcohol)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Siliconi:**\n\nSon divisi in categorie. Alcuni di questi possono essere presenti senza problemi, altri meno perchè possono accumularsi. Oltre ad accumularsi, comunque, portano benefici vari.\n\n1. Evaporativi. Evaporano nel giro di due ore al massimo, quindi non si accumulano.\n\n\\- Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane, Hexamethyldisiloxane, Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, cyclomethicone (quest’ultimo e altri ciclo-XXX-silosani non sono solubili in acqua, ma evaporano comunque rapidamente, quindi non sono un problema)\n\n2) Facili da lavare. Non evaporano e possono essere presenti nel balsamo. Alcuni di questi, però, possono essere resistenti all'acqua (specie se calda) e potrebbero richiedere uno shampoo coi solfati perchè vengano rimossi.\n\n\\- Methicone e Dimethicone e Dimethicone copolyol (buoni se non hanno ingredienti cationici),silica, silequioxanes, siloxysilicates (es. diisostearoyl trimethylolpropane siloxysilicate) (questi sono pesanti),diphenyl dimethicone, dimethiconol, disiloxane, Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane, Lauryl methicone copolyol, Phenyltrimethicone, Trisiloxane\n\n3) Difficili da lavare, ma non si accumulano. Si accumula solo in un primo strato. Gli strati successivi eliminano i precedenti, quindi l’accumulo non è troppo. È comunque meglio evitarli, se possibile.\n\nDimethicone crosspolymer, Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer, Aminopropyltriethoxysilane, Aminopropyl Dimethicone (senza surfatante cationico), Amodimethicone (senza surfatante cationico), Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone, Dimethicone, Dimethicone PEG/PPG, o -dimethylsiloxane, in presenza di un altro catione polimerico come bromuri, cloruri o polyquaterni.\n\n4) Difficili da lavare, si accumulano. Da evitare totalmente. Per essere rimossi si richiede l’uso ripetuto di shampoo con solfati.\n\nBehenoxy dimethicone, Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone, Cetyl dimethicone, Cetearyl methicone, Dimethiconol hydroxystearate, Polysilicone-18 Cetyl Phosphate, Propyl Dimethicone, Stearoxy dimethicone, Stearyl dimethicone, Stearyl methicone Trimethylsiylamodimethicone\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Umettanti:**\n\nDa evitare in zone calde e umide, in quanto tendono ad assorbire troppo e rendere i capelli troppo secchi.\n\nGlycerin, Propylene Glycol, Honey, Agave nectar, Sorbitol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed silk protein, Fructose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Come trattare i ricci nei giorni in cui non li lavi:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dormi con i capelli avvolti** in una sciarpa in seta, oppure legali in modo da formare una coda partendo dalla cima della testa (metodo ananas)\n\nSe hai i capelli molto lunghi, puoi fare trecce.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ogni giorno** puoi trattare i tuoi capelli in più possibili modi, a seconda dell'umidità dell'ambiente in cui vivi e la porosità dei ricci:\n\n0) Bagna completamente i capelli, aggiungi un po' di balsamo (eventualmente S2C) e gel. Praticamente lavali di nuovo.\n\n1. Usa uno spray per spruzzare il balsamo (o anche solo acqua) per inumidire, poi \"sgranocchia\" un po' i ricci.\n2. Bagnati le mani con gel diluito, oppure balsamo diluito, oppure anche solo acqua, e \"sgranocchia\"\n3. Valido se hai tempo per asciugarti bene e se hai capelli corti; prendi l'acqua con le mani e \"sgranocchia\" le punte, eventualmente aggiungendo un po' di gel, poi asciuga (eventualmente plopping)\n4. Cerca una sezione particolarmente crespa, bagna le mani, aggiungi una goccia di gel e applicalo sulla sezione (eventualmente finger coiling). \"Sgranocchia\" tutti i ricci un po' in generale.\n5. Agita i ricci e \"sgranocchia\" mentre sei a testa in giù. Puoi anche incasinare i capelli un po' ma evita di far passare le dita lungo i ricci o rischi di fare un disastro.\n\nIn particolare, quando fai attività sportiva, è una buona idea usare un po' di balsamo, ed eventualmente sostituire il gel con creme per ricci.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Porosità:**\n\nI capelli possono in genere avere bassa, media o alta porosità.\n\nQuesti due link sono i modi migliori per identificare la porosità dei capelli: [https://www.curlsbot.com/porosity/](https://www.curlsbot.com/porosity/)\n\nOppure  [http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/hair-porosity-how-to-measure-sort-of.html](http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/hair-porosity-how-to-measure-sort-of.html)\n\nBassa porosità:\n\nI capelli impiegano più di 2 secondi a bagnarsi, anche sotto il getto diretto dell'acqua\n\nL'acqua rimane sopra i capelli invece che bagnarli\n\nI prodotti non vengono ben assorbiti, perciò si accumulano di più in mezzo ai capelli\n\nI capelli impiegano molto a seccarsi\n\nI capelli sono più resistenti a trattamenti chimici (come il colore)\n\n\\- Lavali sempre con acqua calda\n\n\\- Usa gli heating cap\n\n\\- Metti i capelli in una cuffietta per la doccia in plastica e usa un asciugamano riscaldato\n\n\\- Usa prodotti più leggeri, specialmente se usi gli oli, in quanto tenderanno ad appesantire molto i capelli. (Oli leggeri: jojoba, argan/argania, grapeseed/semi d'uva, sunflower/girasole, sweet almond/mandorle dolci). Eventualmente non usare affatto gli oli.\n\n\\- Usa con una certa regolarità un prodotto che elimini gli accumuli sui capelli. Il prodotto dev'essere un po' aggressivo ma non quanto un comunque shampoo.\n\nAlta porosità:\n\nSi bagnano immediatamente anche con poca acqua\n\nI capelli assorbono rapidamente qualunque cosa\n\nI capelli si asciugano velocemente dopo essere stati lavati\n\nAccettano facilmente prodotti chimici (come il colore), ma possono espellerlo altrettanto facilmente.\n\nPossono sembrare pesanti e secchi\n\nSi annodano facilmente\n\nTendono a essere crespi\n\n\\- Usa oli pesanti (castor/ricino, olive, coconut/cocco, flax/lino, hemp/canapa, jamaican black castor/ricino nero giamaicano) e oli che chiudono le cuticole.\n\n\\- Usa settimanalmente una maschera per capelli\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Altre generalità:**\n\nGli ingredienti principali di cui tenere conto sono: solfati, siliconi, polyquats, umettanti cocco. proteine, (in genere i capelli tendono ad accettare o rifiutare gli ultimi due tipi di ingredienti). Evita il calore diretto e i prodotti Pantene.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsigli da u/GIUlianab\n\nSe vuoi provare a seguire il CG per adesso prova a guardare tra i prodotti Omia e de I Provenzali, dovrebbero avere almeno balsami e maschere senza  siliconi (le maschere della Omia sono buone) e shampoo senza solfati e siliconi. Io personalmente sconsiglio il co-washing, specialmente se  vivi in un luogo con acqua molto dura. Usare uno shampoo delicato (senza solfati o con questi in basso nella lista degli ingredienti, in quanto dovrebbe indicarne una bassa quantità) è sempre meglio secondo me.\n\nLa Biopoint di recente ha lanciato una linea senza siliconi, solfati e  parabeni, se la trovi ed è nel tuo budget puoi provarla, la Garnier ha lanciato le maschere hair food (solo non lasciarle agire per un minuto, non fanno una cippa in un minuto) e se non sbaglio il balsamo Splend'Or è  CG. \n\nQuello che per me ha funzionato davvero è stato usare una vecchia  magliette di cotone per asciugare e plopping, mettere una stoffa di raso sopra il mio cuscino quando dormo, dormire con \"l'ananas\", lo S2C, lo  scrunching e applicare tutti i prodotti sui capelli gocciolanti.",

    "body": "[Video Up](https://youtu.be/cxoBES70keQ)  \n\n---\n\nEleven Shaving (https://elevenshaving.com/) is the rebranded Sapone Di Palo. The artisan recently overhauled the entire branding, packaging, soap base and aftershave base. These improvements have been getting a lot of positive feedback from the wet shaving community and early reviews of the new soap base point to major improvements over previous iterations. The artisan offers shaving soap, aftershave splash as well as aftershave balm. The name Eleven refers to Lock and Dam no. 11 located in Dubuque, Iowa where the artisan grew up. In addition to direct purchase, Eleven Shaving offerings are available at Maggard Razors (https://www.maggardrazors.com/) and Top of the Chain (https://topofthechain.ca/).\n\nLime & Basil is simply stated a lime forward scent with a hint of basil. Using Mexican lime, which is very bright and crisp with just the right amount of basil to add some herbaceousness to this accord, the scent becomes ideal for warm weather use. This scent is perfect for those that enjoy citrus forward scents and for those that enjoy what I call, “smile” scents. It is so bright and refreshing that it just puts a smile on your face. Scent strength on Lime & Basil is mid-strong off the sample and remains this way through the lathering and shaving experiences. Similar scents to this are Stirling Soap Co. Lime and Mike’s Natural Lime.\n\nEleven Shaving has overhauled their soap base, coincidently, the offering is base number eleven in the iteration. The new ingredients list features tallow and is listed as: Stearic Acid, Water, Tallow, Glycerin, Potassium Hydroxide, Castor Oil, Mango Butter, Sodium Hydroxide, Fragrance, Shea Butter, Apricot Kernel Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Sodium Lactate, Allantoin, Vitamin E, Hydrolyzed Silk. This soap is of medium firmness and has no issues loading into your brush fiber of choice. The soap is not overly thirsty and whips into a lather very routinely. When dialed in, the lather resembles whipped cream. The slickness on this new base is good, both primary slickness and residual slickness. The post shave is good as well. Because of the addition of vitamins and skin food, the post shave feeling is quite luxurious on the skin. This is a well rounded soap base with nothing lacking. The shavescore for Eleven Shaving’s soap base is an 89. This classes it with other solid offerings like Mickey Lee Soapworks and Chiseled Face Groomatorium.  \n\n---\n**Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.* \n \n* Soap - Eleven Shaving Lime & Basil (free sample)\n\n* Brush - ​Maseto Shaving 30mm 2 band (purchased)\n\n* Razor - Wade & Butcher “Clear” (gift)\n​\n* Post - Stubble Buster Coastal (purchased)\f\n",

Tucuma butter is a pretty hard, brittle butter from my understanding, so I'm concerned that this would leave the bar too soft if I straight up replace it with coconut oil. If I want to do that, should I increase the amount of cetyl alcohol, and lower the oil, to harden it more? If so, how much? I also have stearic acid and glyceryl stearate I could incorporate as  additional hardeners if those would be better. \n\nThank you in advance for your input!",

    "body": "Hello and welcome to this very special installment of The Great Spice Off! What is The Great Spice Off?\n\nI love the scent of Old Spice, so much so that it's the only aftershave I use as I don't really feel a need to splash anything else on. But, as we all know, Old Spice no longer makes shaving soap. They do still make a cream but that's hardly a great soap and it doesn't actually smell like Old Spice. As such my plan is to test out all the Old Spice options that are out there on as many bases as possible both to try out a variety of bases from different soapmakers and to report back to you on who really nails the scent.\n\nI'll be shaving three times with each soap, using a variety of brushes and razors, and blades. Yes, I know that means it won't be exactly scientific but this is going to take a while and I want to use all my other shit too. Soaps will be rated on a few factors and given points from 1-5 for each.\n\n* **Oldness:** How much does the soap smell like OG Old Spice. This is the more analytical scent analysis and I'm comparing to an OG Old Spice aftershave I have and the Shulton aftershave from India.\n* **Spiciness:** This is the je ne sais quois of Old Spice. Does the soap make me feel the nostalgia, warmth, and whatever it is about the scent that works. Is there something special about it that makes it stand out? Does it invoke a memory or make a new one? The most subjective of this list.\n* **Lather:** You know, can I make a shave soap out of it.\n* **Shave:** How's it work on the ol' face while shaving.\n* **Post:** How's the scent profile after the event. How does my face feel.\n\n# [Eleven Shaving Unscented/Hendrix Classics & Co Commander](https://i.imgur.com/1Fvyt3Z.jpg)\n\nWelcome to what is probably the most unofficial special edition of the Great Spice Off I'll do. Yes, even more unofficial than the totally official [Remote Learning](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/16a3t7s/the_great_spice_off_summer_break_soaps_remote/) one. There are few reasons for that, the first being that this soap isn't even scented at all. That's right, as the name boldly proclaims Eleven Unscented is, in fact, unscented. (Pro tip for the pros out there: just name your unscented soap unscented. It makes it so much easier to find.) How then could it possibly be part of the Great Spice Off? Well, that's where the second part of making this very unofficial comes in.\n\nI'm using Hendrix Classics & Co.'s scent yourself Commander scent oil in the Eleven's Julien base, which u/hendrix-classics-co sent me way back after I reviewed his [Commodore Old Spice](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/y7o1ac/the_great_spice_off_hendrix_classics_co_commodore/) dupe. Confused yet? Well, you can go read my intro to Hendrix in that review as it all pretty much still stands, but the TL;DR is that Hendrix offers a scent yourself line (or use to, it's been taken down recently for a bit of a refresh) in which you get the scenting oil directly from him and then scent your own soap. The theory being is you'd get his unscented soap and then have a stock pile of different scents you can then use. I, however, am using it as an excuse to review a different base and, after polling the community, and randomly selecting one Eleven was the winner.\n\nNot only all of that, but Commodore isn't even an Old Spice dupe. It's an Old Spice Pure Sport dupe, a scent I have next to no experience with and made no effort to learn about. But its name has Old Spice in it and so.... here we are. Let's also add the caveats that I'm adding a scent oil to a base in a way the soapmaker did not plan for, meaning any results from my tests could be totally tainted. That is, however, why I did one shave without the scent in it to be a bit more fair, but that only makes everything even less above board. In short, trust nothing I say... honestly, that's probably good advice for this series in general.\n\nThat all being said, I am, also, always right and my opinions are the correct ones so lets get down to it. Eleven Shaving was founded by Paolo Licciardi sometime in the mid-teens as Sapone di Paulo, which is Italian for Soap by Paolo. His grandfather was an Italian barber and he named everything with Italian names. However, reading things in Italian is evidently very confusing for all of us simple-minded wet shavers. We, honestly, aren't too great at reading English let alone pronouncing other languages so he routinely heard people mispronounce the name or simply not say it at all. Thus, in 2018, he rebranded to Eleven soaps, named after Lock and Dam no. 11 located in Dubuque, Iowa, near where Eleven is based. Numbers are presumably easier for English speakers to speak than Italian words just don't ask us to add them together.\n\nWhat I absolutely adore about this, is that he took this lesson of KISS into every aspect of the brand with a recent redesign of his labels. I usually make mention of the tub design at the end but I have to just applaud the entire design theme behind Eleven Soaps new looks. Big, bold, simple label designs in big bold iconic fonts with no clutter, on clear tubs. In a world of wet shaving branding that's getting overrun with AI designs and stupidly busy labels or half-assed designs done in Word, Eleven's branding stands out fantastically. Not only is that mantra found in his branding but it seems at the core of his scenting as well, with minimal scents that hit a few key notes but never get crazy. I absolutely love that he took a rename to simplify things (the previous labels were just color coded) and worked that into his entire ethos and brand identity. It's really cool and fantastically refreshing. The Unscented soap has a simple, shades-of-blue, fleur de leaf, which might be the most abstract of his labels given most of the others have a simplistic image of whatever the main scent is (a lemon on lemon, an orange on orange, pine trees on cedar).\n\nOf course, I'm not really experiencing his scenting so all of that gushing is just about looks and not shave and as such let us move onto the soap itself. u/CanadaEh97 , who suggested Eleven, claims that they just came out with a new base but I can't find any information on that as Julien seems to be pretty old. The Julien base leans closer to the soft, sticky side of things but isn't an incredibly soft base by any measure. It's tallow-based, with an ingredient list of: Stearic Acid, Water, Tallow, Glycerin,  Potassium Hydroxide, Shea Butter, Kokum Butter, Castor Oil, Mango Butter, Sodium Hydroxide, Fragrance, Grapeseed Oil, Apricot Kernel Oil, Hydrolyzed Silk, Sodium Lactate, Allantoin, Tocopherol Acetate. Nothing we haven't seen before except maybe the Apricot oil. I'd love an honest breakdown of what benefit all these different oils from different things do. Is Apricot that different from, say, banana oil (the latter obviously being how they make banana shaving soaps)?\n\nTo go back to the scent -- because this intro just needs to be even longer -- Old Spice Pure Sport is technically a riff on Old Spice from the makers themselves and probably the second longest-running Old Spice scent out there. You can easily find it on store shelves even in America in both deodorant and after shave splash. I don't have any and if I brought home another bottle of Old Spice I wouldn't be living in my house anymore so I'm not even going to pretend to comment on the accuracy of the scent to the one you can pick up in stores. There's also not much debate online of the scent having changed over the years in any way (it's nowhere near as old as the OG) so having a dupe of it seems a bit odd other than a way to get it into your shaving soap. People describe the scent as Old Spice but with sporty scent in it and... I don't care.\n\nTo explain he process a bit for these shaves, I put three drops of Commodore into my first and second shaves using different amounts of soap as I do for these reviews. For the final shave, I used no scent to experience Julien on its own.\n\n**Oldness - 3**\n\nThis is definitely an Old Spice scent. In fact, it's probably more Old Spice than some of the direct dupes I've done but it's also definitely not an old spice scent. It's like 50% an Old Spice scent and 50% not one in a way that, unlike other riffs on Old Spice, makes it somehow very different. Whereas the riffs I've tried kind of layer into Old Spice this is almost just like two scents running into each other. It's strangely both Old Spice and not at all.\n\n**Spiciness - 1**\n\nIf you couldn't tell by my general apathy in describing the scent above (and my lack fo desire to write more words, which I really like doing) Commander and, I assume, Pure Sport is just not for me. This is strange because at this point I am desperate for people to play around with the Old Spice scent (u/mammothben, I will never stop. Why won't you love me!?) and here is like the original Old Spice riff. It just doesn't work for me at all despite being pretty well enjoyed by those who enjoy smelling things and obviously liked enough by the general masses to be one of the few legacy scents that P&G still makes.\n\n**Lather - 4**\n\nJulien is big and thirsty and even when I used my smallest scoop I used too much. It just never stops growing. Most lathers hit a point where they start becoming slick and sloppy and kind of don't get bigger anymore. Julien does not. Julien goes on forever. If you continued lathering Julien it would eventually consume the world. It's possible that with the right amount of soap it would hit the sweet point and land a five here but I couldn't find it. Still, it's a big, easy lather ain't nuthn to scoff at.\n\n**Shave - 3**\n\nEleven has a good cushion to it, probably from getting bigger and bigger, which allows even aggressive blades to feel like great on your face but I don't think it was strikingly great. Similarly, the slickness is good, delivering a smooth shave, especially when you use less soap and can feed it enough water. It may have just been a dialing in issue with using too much soap but my shaves never hit that truly great slickness that the best soaps have. And please remember to caveat this with the fact that I was adding something in that could have somehow changed the end result but I got the same feeling on my third, no scent shave.\n\n**Post - N/A**\n\nI don't feel fair giving points for post here because it combines both scent and post shave feel, which here are delivered by two separate products. That's not to mention that the scenting is manual so any issue I had with it would could be easily changed by my own hand. I will say that Eleven left my face feeling pretty refreshed (totally the apricot, I'm sure) but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\n**Lack of Scent - 5**\n\nYea, that's how unofficial this is. To make up for the N/A in Post Shave there's an entire extra rating section in here. Things have gone over the rails and we're in the crazy train now, fellas. I had no idea where to go into this and the intro was getting to long but when Eleven says unscented they mean it. I have smelled a few unscented soaps before and they all have some sort of scent, even if it's just small. Eleven Unscented isn't unscented, it is the absence of scent. When I closed my eyes and stuck this tub in my nose it was like nothing was there. I'm pretty sure it removed any other scents I might be smelling. It was like the shaving soap equivalent of reaching a perfectly clear mind and total peace.\n\n**Final Verdict: 16**\n\nNothing. Meaningless. Scores don't matter and the points are made up. The scent isn't from the soapmmaker, the soap isn't from the scent maker, and I made up an entire category. Fuck it!\n\nI'm sorry. You're experiencing a bit of an existential crisis here. I found out that I'm not actually as done as I thought I was with all this after even more soaps are cropping up. It's possible there will be 5-6 more Great Spice Offs and I'm having trouble coping with it when I thought I had finally reached the mountain top. I hate you all.\n\n**Previous Great Spice Offs:**\n\n1.

Any others who use/ have used their products? \n\nHey, first time poster here but a huge fan of the sub! I've been through many products the last year or so trying to find new products for my hair that fit me. I have long silky and straight hair but it gets easily split ends and can get very tangled in the mornings..\n\nI have recently tried a new brand though - the biosilk shampoo and conditioner plus silk treatment. I have paid much for hair salon shampoo and conditioners but these did not work as good as the biosilk products. I'm very surprised how good they work for my hair, the shampoo and conditioner makes my hair instantly combable after showering, which I've never experienced before! So long story short, why does the products work for me? Are the ingredients good long term? Any others who use or have used the products? If so, what was your experience with them?\n\n\nIngredients in the shampoo:\nAqua/Water/Eau, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Polysorbate 20, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Silk, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Symphytum Officinale Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Extract, Parfum/Fragrance, Benzyl Benzoate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone.\n\nIngredients in the conditioner:\nAqua/Water/Eau, Cetyl Alcohol, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Amodimethicone, Hydrolyzed Silk, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol , Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Trideceth-8, Citric Acid, Benzophenone-3, Symphytum Officinale Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Extract, Fragrance (Parfum), Benzyl Benzoate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol.\n\n\nI noticed the conditioner has citric acid and cetyl alcohol in it, I've heard acid can let good moisture in the hair as well as bad stuff..\nAre the ingredients good for my hair/scalp? Should I continue using it without worry?\n\nThanks for replies in advance!!",

For background, I am a stylist, and had a former coworker who always advised not to use conditioners with hydrolyzed wheat protein if you have hair extensions. I got new human hair extensions installed in November, and didn’t look at the ingredients in the conditioner I was using (rookie mistake I guess?). I noticed that my extensions are full of split ends, despite using what I thought were good products. Checked my conditioners, most of them have hydrolyzed protein of some sort, and even my hair spray has hydrolyzed wheat protein 😫 \n\nJust wondering if anyone can explain why the hydrolyzed proteins would damage the extensions, and if it is only hydrolyzed wheat protein that could be damaging, or if any hydrolyzed protein would do the same damage (I’ve seen hydrolyzed soy protein, hydrolyzed oat protein, hydrolyzed silk, and hydrolyzed keratin on the product labels I checked). My understanding is that the extensions don’t require the extra protein that damaged or natural hair does, and the extra protein causes the extensions to break from being over-protenized.",

It wont feel better if I use more. It will just make it brittle. \nMaybe you can try making your own conditioner? Something with oils perhaps. Food for thought!",

On paper, It looks like I pick the right things, but my hair is so sad now. It's just lackluster. Limp, kind of flat, feels dry no matter what I've tried. My curls are just wavy now. Nothing else has changed  as far as the style, dye, or routine.\n \nI don't mind paying  for pricey products that work, but I don't even know where to start at this point and I don't want to keep paying tons of money for more products that aren't doing anything for me.

She told me that “Love Beauty & Planet“ is their most vegan friendly brand but I have yet to receive the email she promised with more info, I might chase up later today\n\nI also, yesterday, spoke to a Proctor & Gamble, a lovely lady called Olivia was the agent, they make my shampoo (Head and Shoulders).  They do no animal testing and invest a lot of their profits into animal welfare but cannot guarantee anything they make is fully vegan, they do their best to try to source ingredients from veggie sources but when there is a shortage they will revert to animal products.  I made a post on this yesterday and some kind Redditor provided me with the following link if this is on anyone else’s agenda.\n\nhttps://metro.co.uk/2018/05/18/guide-100-vegan-cruelty-free-shampoo-conditioner-7081038/\n\nWell on to the topic at hand, this morning I called my deodorant manufacturer, Nivea, to see if their products were vegan friendly.\n\nGents, I am happy to confirm that Nivea Men, Black and White, Invisible Original is totally animal byproducts free and is not tested on animals.  The agent i spoke to, Rebecca, said the only place they test on animals in their range is China as it’s a legal requirement there.\n\nShe said not *all* their products are free form animal byproducts, but kindly sent me an an email of which ingredients to avoid, I’ll copy below for your benefit! I hope you find it beneficial.\n\n>Dear Matt,\n\n>Thank you very much for your call.\n\n>Whilst most ingredients used within our Beiersdorf product ranges are synthetic or plant derived (non-animal sources) there are a handful of ingredients that are animal derived. We can confirm that the Glycerin used within our products is however vegetable based and we do not use any egg based ingredients. Due to the presence of animal derived ingredients in a selected number of our products, we do not claim that our products are Halal or Vegan friendly.\n\n>As per our telephone conversation please find below the list of animal ingredients that we use in our NIVEA products:\n\n>Carboxymethyl Chitin  crustacean\n\n>Cera Alba  bee (x)\n\n>Cholesterol sheep, woolwax\n\n>Cholesteryl Chloride sheep, woolwax\n\n>Cholesteryl Nonanoate sheep, woolwax\n\n>Cholesteryl Oleyl Carbonate sheep, woolwax\n\n>CI 75470 cochineal insect\n\n>Glyceryl Lanolate     sheep, woolwax\n\n>Hydrolyzed Collagen codfish swim bladder\n\n>Hydrolyzed Keratin sheep, wool OR cashmere goat, wool\n\n>Hydrolyzed Milk Protein cattle, milk\n\n>Hydrolyzed Pearl freshwater pearls\n\n>Hydrolyzed Silk silk worm\n\n>Lactose cattle, milk\n\n>Lanolin  sheep, woolwax\n\n>Lanolin Alcohol     sheep, woolwax\n\n>Mel bee\n\n>Ostrea Shell Extract oyster shells\n\n>PEG-8 Beeswax    bee\n\n>Serica Powder silk worm\n\n>Sine Adipe Lac cattle, milk\n\n>5Sodium Tallowate cattle, tallow\n\n>Soluble Collagen pork\n\n>Synthetic Beeswax bee",

There was a baby shampoo product we used to use that made the boys' coarse hair quite soft. I thought we had run out of that shampoo, but yesterday I found an unfinished bottle which I tried in my daughter's hair tonight.

You want strong UVA protection.  That's going to be your #1 defense against wrinkles.\n\nNiacinamide could be an easy thing to add to your routine.  It's in CeraVe PM (if you want to switch from the Trader Joe's one) or The Ordinary sells a 10% niacinamide serum.\n\nYou could also switch the retinol to tretinoin (the prescription strength version).  My sebaceous filaments went away with tretinoin, plus it's the gold standard for anti-aging.   You can get plain tretinoin from a doctor, or a compounded tretinoin cream with 4% niacinamide from Yoderm or Curology.\n\nSounds like you're off to a good start though!",

    "body": "Barrister & Mann is the brainchild of William Carius (/u/BostonPhotoTourist) who began his company in March 2013. The soaps quickly became the quintessential product to own in order to get a luxurious and classy shave. Will, is devoted to producing soap of the highest quality and that is proudly hand made in the United States. This includes the sourcing of his ingredients. Barrister & Mann offers soap, alcohol based aftershave toniques and non alcohol based aftershaves (Kyovu). The site has a dedicated area for lady wet shavers and also has a budget line of soaps, dubbed Latha. Barrister & Mann can be purchased directly from their [website](http://www.barristerandmann.com/) or from other third party resellers such as [Shave Revolution](http://www.shaverevolution.com/collections/shaving-soap/barrister-mann) or [Maggard Razors](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product-category/soaps-creams/barrister-mann/).  \n\nAs always, I will provide my complete honest review and I have not received any compensation or preferential treatment for my review. This is strictly for the community to use as a tool in making informed decisions. Most importantly, these are my opinions and mine alone. If you do not like them or disagree with them, I respect that and ask that you do the same.  \n\nPlease note that I often review products from the same artisan and to save myself time, the introduction, packaging and lather may be identical or slightly tweaked. The uniqueness normally will be found in scent, price and overall.    \n\n**Packaging:**  \nLe Grand Chypre (LGC) comes in a dark green polypropylene tub with the same color screw top lid. This packaging is one of the gold standards for soap presentations. The soap fills the tub about ¾ full which provides ample room for loading the soap. The tub is 3.94” wide, perfect to allow swirling just about any brush to load without making a mess. The label on the lid is an is a charcol/black background with metallic dark green writing, a very classy presentation. The company logo, website and ingredients can also be found on label.  \n  \n**Lather:**  \nLGC utilizes a new formulation of the legendary B&M “white label” soap base. This formulation, code named “Glissant” was designed for even more slickness. There appear to be other benefits to this new formulation as the soap loaded into the bristles of the brush more quickly. It also seems as though the amount of time it takes for the lather to explode into a voluminous and slick substance has been reduced. I never imagined any soap base could be better that B&M “white label”, it has been my absolute favorite for some time. The “Glissant” base might have changed the standard. The lather feels lighter although it is more voluminous and the slickness is unlike any soap or cream that I have ever tried. There are about a hundred adjectives of praise I could throw at the slickness, but you really just need to experience it for yourself. Post shave feel matches that of “white label” although it does feel a bit lighter in terms of texture. Regardless of the rest of this review, LGC deserves to be tried by anyone who desires to see a game changing lather. From Barrister & Mann themselves; *”Engineered for slickness and ease of latherability, we christened the new soap \"Glissant,\" and re-considered every inch of our original formula to make sure that we had gotten it just right. Those who tested the new base were delighted by its tremendous creaminess and lubricity, and, after 16 separate iterations, we completed the formula just in time to finish the soap on schedule.”*\n  \n**Scent:**  \nThe scent on LGC is in typical B&M fashion, elegant and complex. Straight away I was met a sharp citrus burst, most notably bergamot and lemon. As my olfactory nerves fired more feverishly, the notes of labdanum and patchouli became present. From there it was all over for me, I smelled whiffs of peach, a floral note and even some woodiness. Just when I thought my nose had graduated to “good smeller” this scent humbled me back to the “it smells” category. Here is what B&M says about the scent, which by my account is far more beautifully described than I can; *”We began with a base that the world hasn’t seen for nearly 50 years: Mousse de Chyprée, one of the legendary creations of the House of DeLaire, whose formula we found buried in a rare perfume treatise. We built our very own chypre accord around it, weaving in notes of bergamot, lime, labdanum, and a touch of patchouli to produce an elegant, citrusy heart for our masterpiece. From there, we experimented with different materials, eventually deciding to follow in the footsteps of Jacques Guerlain by incorporating a fraction of peachy Persicol, blended with notes of rose, frankincense, cedar, and various musks and other perfume compounds to construct an elegant, slightly fruity, freshly floral design perfectly suited to the refined shaver.”* This scent is vastly different from the scent that I have been reaching for of late. I will need more time with it to decide if it makes my most loved scents list. Right now it sits on the good scent list. Scent is mid off the puck and remains mid through the lather.\n  \n**Price:**  \nAt $25.00 for 4 oz of soap, this is soap comes in at $6.25/oz. Yes, this is an expensive soap because of the high end ingredients. The ingredient list is as follows: Potassium Stearate, Aqua, Glycerin, Sodium Stearate, Potassium Tallowate, Sodium Tallowate, Potassium Ricinoleate, Potassium Shea Butterate, Sodium Ricinoleate, Coconut Milk, Sodium Shea Butterate, Fragrance, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Potassium Palm Kernelate, Allantoin, Lanolin, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Citrate, Tocopherol Acetate, Hydrolyzed Silk Protein.\n  \n**Bottom Line:**  \nWill has put his heart and soul into this creation and it is evident by the refined and sophisticated scent profile which he has constructed. The “Glissant” base is truly a **next level lather** in terms of both performance and ease of use. LCG will be polarizing in my opinion because it is a sharp turn from the masculine and dark scents that many wet shavers reach for this time of year. LGC is bright and vibrant and it surely will have plenty of wet shavers reaching for it in their rotation. The performance alone warrants anyone who is curious to obtain some and give it a try. Congratulations to Will and Barrister & Mann for yet another work of art.",

I've not shampooed in a couple years and make my own rinses and clay masks.\n\nI'm getting that \"itch\" to add something sudsy back to my hair since my original routine was clay wash 3 months, 1 shampoo, clay wash 3 months, etc.\n\nI add things like herb and proteins to my masks and cetrimonium chloride (I just wanted to test it out).  I use a lot of moisturizer and oils on my hair.  I'm 4c so my hair probably behaves differently than many of you.  Mechanical cleaning with a brush is not an option for me, though I will occasionally use a goat hair brush to distribute sebum...does it?  Still not sure.\n\nI'm considering getting a soap bar (which I'd purchase), but I think that it could be fun making a cleanser myself, hence the question about these foaming surfactants.  Is this a DIY itch that I can scratch and still stay nopoo?\n\nI should add that I also use yucca root regularly and soapwort root sometimes.  Natural and slightly bubbly, but not I'm not sure if they're enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA:  Descriptions of each\n\nFoaming Oats (Sodium Lauryl Oat Amino Acids) is a very mild anionic surfactant, containing 28% - 32%  active matter.  It has a very soft foam, making it a great choice for  foaming facial cleansers.  It is also a great choice for shampoos and  micellar waters.  With it's neutral pH (6.5 to 7.5), it will not sting  the eyes.\n\nFoaming silk (Sodium Cocoyl Hydrolyzed Silk Protein) is made from hydrolyzed pure silk fibers. This amber brown  liquid is perfect for mild cleansing with its natural lathering  abilities.  Excellent in hair care, skin and facial products. \n\nFoaming Apple ( Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids) is a very mild anionic surfactant, containing 29% - 34%  active matter.  It has the same lacy glove foam as Foaming Silk, making  it a great choice for foaming facial cleansers.  It is also a great  choice for shampoos and micellar waters.  With it's neutral pH (6.5 to  7.5), it will not sting the eyes.

        "body": "I'm not familiar with the foaming cleansers you've mentioned so I have no opinion about them. \n\nI do have some questions though! My main troubleshooting technique is to find the heart of the real problem and I'm wondering what yours is. Why are you wanting a foaming cleanser? What are the needs you have in your routine that it could help with? You said you aren't sure if soapwort and yucca are foaming enough. What do you mean by that? \n\nCan you explain more about your routine? I haven't seen many people here with type 4 hair and I'm very interested! My understanding is that those with type 4 often don't produce much sebum, and what they do is difficult to spread. It certainly needs much more moisture, protein and heavy oils to help seal it.\n\nHave you considered using a comb instead of a brush? I vastly prefer mine, it flows through my curls sooo much easier than brushing and it cleans and spreads sebum very well.\n\nI saw a video once of a type 4c who did only water washing. She did scalp massage both dry and wet, and then would finger preen, not to remove sebum but to spread it. She did mention that it took a long time to spread it, but that she could feel it when it finally did. She called her hair 'anti-gravity' hair, and I've honestly loved the phrase and the hair type since. She discussed how much better her hair felt and how it held the curl definition more. I don't recall whether she did anything more, like moisture treatments, but I imagine she must have because even my 3b curls get dry without then. \n\nI've been interested in learning more about how type 4 can do natural haircare ever since then. I know it's possible because everyone did it before modern product took over the world, but it has even more specialized needs than type 3 curls do.",

Also, there's no harm in completely washing it out and starting over to try again. \n\nI think the bumpy period doesn't just happen in the beginning, but with any new product you try. I've been doing this almost two years now, and there's still times where I completely over leave-in/gel and have sticky, gross hair. There is no right answer or trick, you just have to process of elimination that shit until you get it right! haha Experiment with different amounts - like, next try less gel but the same amount of leave-in. If that doesn't work, switch, if that doesn't work, try less of both. Your hair will like completely unique methods, products, and styles, so there's really no telling until you try it out! :)",

    "body": "Hey all, newbie here. I was recently referred to this sub from r/HaircareScience. I had been following advice from there but after asking for some help assessing my routine to combat frizz I was pointed this direction for more specific guidelines for my type of hair.\n\n​\n\nYou can find my original post here if you'd like to read a bit about my routine (I'd rather not repost it here word for word):\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/9cajac/looking\\_for\\_some\\_help\\_evaluating\\_my\\_routine\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/9cajac/looking_for_some_help_evaluating_my_routine_to/)\n\n​\n\nI've been looking through the info you peeps have compiled in the wiki (Lots of material, I must say. Thoroughly impressed) and am already considering some revisions to my routine. However, there is one particular conundrum that I just can't get out of my head (Pun very much intended.)\n\nBrushing. There's a whole thing around these parts about how brushing 'destroys the curl pattern' (I'm not sure I even understand what that means) and I've even seen some posts of before/after brushing side-by-side pictures of hair that do indeed show a negative effect of brushing. On the other hand, and this might just be a natural initial resistance to change after having grown accustomed to habits I've been fostering for years... I still simply cannot fathom how just... not brushing could even work to begin with.\n\n​\n\nI will explain. My hair is excessively prone to tangling. I like to say that it gets tangled from just EXISTING. If i comb before shower, there will be some tangles after I come out. If I comb in the shower, it will be tangled after it dries. It always gets tangled overnight while I sleep, if I ever go out and leave my hair free in the wind, it becomes a tangled mess (So I tend to wear it in a loose ponytail when I'm outdoors). Now, It has gotten better ever since I started to look into taking better care of my hair... at this point, though my hair still gets tangles from just about anything... they're not so bad and I can mostly live with it.\n\n​\n\nHowever, they still accumulate enough that i HAVE TO brush everyday. if I just go a couple of days without brushing, i cease to have frizz and develop more of a natural crown of knots. Sometimes it gets so bad, that it's just impossible to comb through (I've very much had to use scissors to MINIMIZE hair loss from massively knotted hair in the past, in my teen years. Thankfully lately I've kept it more under control, but that's only because I have gotten in the habit of brushing everyday).\n\n​\n\nFurthermore my hair gets super dry from rinsing it (even without shampoo), so I tend to simply not touch it at all in the shower (except for washing days usually 2 or 3 times per week). Instead, I brush on dry hair in the evening. Now you guys would tell me to NEVER brush dry... but, my hair ends up frizzy and dry regardless of whether I brush wet or dry, and brushing dry seems to minimize damage most of the time.\n\n​\n\nI just don't quite understand. I see people here saying that they hated being told that their hair would be better if they combed it... when in fact combing it made it worse. I had a similar experience, except my hair doesn't actually get any better when I don't comb it, on the contrary, it gets worse and I feel that brushing helps smooth it a little bit (even though it remain frizzy overall).\n\n​\n\nI feel like maybe my problem stems from somewhere else, and I am focusing too much on treating the symptom (the tangling) rather than the underlying cause. I've vaguely read in the wiki that easy tangling might imply I need some more protein in my hair, perhaps? But my leave-in conditioner is based on hydrolyzed silk protein... I use it more sparingly because it also has some milder silicones but still. It's all a bit overwhelming and perhaps It's starting to become a bit of an 'emotional' matter to me, rather than just an objective one. In fact, maybe this whole post is more a rant than anything (going to mark it with a vent flair, I suppose)\n\n​\n\nWould appreciate any thoughts/comments/observations/explanations, etc.\n\nMany thanks in advance and hope you all have a good day.",

I thought it was bullshit or that my hair was different - I really thought tangles were just my hair type (I have coarse strong not silky hair).  It wasn't damaged, why would not brushing do anything?\n\n\nOh I was wrong.  I did stop brushing and began only detangling wet hair, with fingers and wide tooth comb, treating my tough hair like delicate hair, basically.   Once I had a full crop of this gently treated hair, oh my god, it was so much less tangly.  I never dreamed I could have tangle resistant hair but I do.\n\n\nMy guess is that there was microdamage making the hairs more rough and sticky.  It never \"damaged my curl pattern\" but absolutely brushing makes brushing necessary, and giving up brushing makes hair smoother and not as prone to tangles.",

I thought the first time my hair would get super rat-nest like underneath because I wasn’t brushing it, so I went back to my old ways of straightening it and brushing every day. \n\nI decided to give CG another go, this time using more conditioner during my routine and not rinsing it all out when I was done showering. This gave more moisture to my curls and now I don’t get tangled anymore. So really, I was getting tangles because of the lack of moisture, not because I wasn’t brushing. \n\nI suggest following the quick routine to a T for a week, then decide if you still need to brush!",

The most effective of these is efinaconazole, and all others (ciclopirox, amorolfine, tavaborole...) are less effective. \n\nLaser treatment does little except improve the nail appearance, but there is little evidence that it can produce complete cure (normal nail + negative mycology culture). Read [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28294418](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28294418).\n\nThere is only anecdotal evidence supporting surgical removal of the nail, and no randomized controlled trial evidence of superiority over any other approach.\n\nThe most effective treatment is terbinafine 250mg daily for 90 days. As for being realistic, here is the result from one clinical trial: Results of the first toenail trial, as assessed at week 48 (12 weeks of treatment with 36 weeks follow-up after completion of therapy), demonstrated mycological cure, defined as simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 70% of subjects. Fifty-nine percent (59%) of subjects experienced effective treatment (mycological cure plus 0% nail involvement or greater than 5mm of new unaffected nail growth); 38% of subjects demonstrated mycological cure plus clinical cure (0% nail involvement).\n\nEven with this, all people likely become reinfected within their lifetime. If treatment clears for a year or multiple years, this is considered success. Note that one of 400,000 people develop serious liver damage from terbinafine, and laboratory studies do not predict this toxicity ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042257](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31042257)). \n\nLess effective than oral terbinafine is itraconazole and less effective than this is fluconazole.

    "body": "\n(Sorry for the format, I’m on a phone that keeps trying to autocorrect everything I type)\n\nIs it possible to have a bad batch of BTMS-50 or am I truly just missing the mark completely? I hope to get feedback on this question because it’s driving me absolutely bonkers. Ingredient recommendations are also VERY welcome. \n\nI’m trying to formulate a leave in conditioner for dry, curly, color treated hair. My water percentages were starting off at 60% and have continued to drop with each attempt, along with a few ingredient changes but nothing drastic. \n\nEvery end product is constantly leaving me with powdery, waxy, yet oily feeling hair.  I thought BTMS-50 was so amazing at conditioning hair 😅. Only plus side is that the first three attempts had absolutely no slip but with the addition of the Natrasil, guar gum, the food grade kind and glycerine, my slip is passable. But I still have waxy feeling hair. I also switched from a oil Infusion of olive oil, coconut and sunflower oil to simply just coconut oil and the oiliness is slightly more tolerable.\n\nI’m so confused because my hair loves products with BTMS-50 and Cetearyl Alcohol and right now it’s hating it. It just sits on top of the hair and leaves lots of residue and no moisture. \n\nI really do not want to include  Cetrimonium Chloride do to the irritation it can cause even at its low percentage. But I am looking into Caprylic/Capric Tryglyceride and Propanediol Dicaprylate for additional ingredients. \n\nThis is my most recent draft of that formulation, this is now the 6th attempt. I removed the Cetearyl Alcohol and the Hydrolyzed Silk Protein in this version. I thought removing the Cetearyl Alcohol would reduce the waxy, powdery feel but nope. \n\n2.5 oz Batch \n\nWater - 81% \n\nCoconut oil - 4.425% \n\n(BTMS-50) Behentrimonium Methosulfate - 4.225%\n\n(Natrasil) Hydrogenated Ethylhexyl Olivate - 2.3%\n\n(Honeyquat) Hydroxypropyltrimonium Honey - 2%\n\nGlycerin - 1.5%\n\nCapuacu Butter - 2.5%\n\n Radish Seed Extract - .50%\n\nPEG-50 Shea Butter - .50%\n\nPlum seed oil - .32%\n\nGoji Berry Extract - .23%\n\n(Optiphen Plus) Phenoxyethanol (and) Caprylyl Glycol (and) Sorbic Acid - .5%\n\nGuar Gum (non-ionic) - .4%\n\n(Tocopherol) Vitamin E - 0.05%",

        "body": "I think there are some formula issues here. A leave-in conditioner (in my two project experience lol) is not the easiest thing to make—the ingredient ratios are less forgiving than a lotion or cream, and you need to be fairly precise in the heating and cooling, too.\n\nMost leave-in conditioners have a much smaller % of oils than this formula. A condition won’t really “condition” as well without having a surfactant in it.Typical a combination of a low HLB and a high HLB are used. (Editing: That was from my notes for my oily hair. Condition agents can be emollient, surfactants (quats), humectants, silicones, and cationic polymers.)\n\nBTMS-50 is a good ingredient — I don’t think it’s the issue.",

The BTMS was way too slippery and light on its own. Can you try just a plain 5-7% BTMS & water experiment and see what happens?\n\nSomething to consider -- maybe pare this formula down to a super super simple version to get the balance of your conditioning agents sorted out without so many things to measure (and extra costs). Like just go down to water (sum up your whole water phase and use that %), BTMS-50, your main oil (in this case, coconut). Maybe the capuacu butter too, and if you're just messing with the texture and not intending to use it, you can skip the preservative until you know what ratios you like. I have a hunch that the butter is causing the waxy feeling though.",

Why \"natural\" ingredients are not better and synthetic ones are not \"toxic\" (to understand what preservative and actives to use)\n3. How to make a formula and how to find what is the best percentage of ingredients to use\n4. What is the pH level (helps to understand what ingredients can be combined and what preservative to use)\n5. What are the marketing ingredients and why they are in INCI list (to understand that too few ingredients have actual behind and others are just for an appealing product label)\n\nGood source of info is Wiki on this sub and you can also use search functionality for additional info on the topics about or to get a list of other useful resources.\n\nThen you will have an idea on what ingredients you need for the result you want and how to combine them with rough formula.

    "body": "Purple shampoo never toned well for me, so I've been on the hunt for purple conditioners that function effectively and are CGM-approved. There are not many in the recommended products list, and adding semi-permanent dye to my conditioners, as the guide recommended worked very badly (I had color in it months later!). So I went on a search for approved conditioners and this is what I found!\n\n*My hair:* Definitely wavy and not curly, relatively fine, color-treated but weirdly protein sensitive despite that (????), naturally dry, high porosity, long. My coloration isn't dramatic - I basically go from a dark blonde to having honey-colored highlights. \n\n**Pura d'Or ColorHarmony Purple Conditioner** - This one is nicely pigmented - I can leave it on 3-5 minutes and be toned, though I usually leave it 7-10 - and moisturizing. My hair generally feels nice and soft afterwards. It has glycerin, though not high on the list; regardless it works best for me if I use it within the 30-60 dewpoint range. It has some protein, but not too much - my hair has never gotten strawlike after it as long as I moisturize adequately. I really recommend it. \n\n*Ingredients**:*  Decolorized Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice\\*, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract\\*, Glycerin\\*, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetearyl Alcohol (1-Hexadecanol, 1-Octadecanol), Colocasia (Taro) Esculenta\\*, Biotin, Avena Sativa (Oat) Bran Extract\\*, Citrus Aurantium (Orange) Peel Extract\\*, Ethylhexyl Olivate, Squalane, Bambusa (Bamboo) Vulgaris\\*, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil\\*, Keratin, Biotin, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Saponins, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Zinc Sulfate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Oil\\*, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil\\*, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Oil\\*, Xylityl Sesquicaprylate, Citric Acid, Ext. Violet 2 (CI 60730). \n\n**dHue Cool Blonde Conditioner -** This one is less pigmented - reports are that it doesn't tone well for certain people - and has more protein; overall I enjoy it less and find it more drying, but I have it in my arsenal because it's glycerin free and I need it for \\~30 and 60+ dewpoints. I've kind of just worked out how to use it - every 2nd or 3rd wash, leaving it in for 10 minutes, followed by a moisturizing, protein-free conditioner (so I condition twice overall *on top of* a leave-in). With that in mind, it works perfectly fine; it tones decently and my hair still looks nice. \n\n*Ingredients:*  Water/Aqua/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Distearyldimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Silk Amino Acids, Hydrolyzed Silk, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance (Pa\u001drfum), Citric Acid, CI 60730, Acid Violet 43 (Ext. Violet 2). \n\n**Note on the Shampoos:** The shampoos associated with these conditioners have questionable ingredients for CGM and are pretty drying. I do find they're good clarifying shampoos every month or two, but wouldn't personally use them on a regular basis since my hair is already dry.\n\nHope this helps!",

    "body": "# Recommended Product Ingredients\n\n​I always have clients review their hair care routine with me during appointments, which helps me recommend better products for their needs. The most common issue people share is experiencing a loss of effectiveness in their products over time. This results from a need to balance cleaning your hair with moisturizing it. Below I've provided a guide to help balance your hair care routine based on the recommendations I usually give my clients, complete with a list of the most effective ingredients for each category. I purposely left non-detergents (soaps) off of the list because they use oils to remove contaminants, which I've found does not clean hair as well.  (This is the full blog but if you want to screenshot the ingredient lists the post is a bit better organized on my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-recommended-product-ingredients.html))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Surfactant Cleanser **Definition:** Surfactant cleansers are detergents or cleaning agents. They work by surrounding and lifting residue off of the hair strand so water can rinse it away. On a product's ingredient list you generally see them listed towards the top. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Detoxes, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used by all hair types. Helpful for oily hair. See [How Often Should I Shampoo?](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html) ​for frequency.\\*\\*Ingredients:\\*\\*​\n\n* Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n* Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n* Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n* Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n* Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n* Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n* Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n* Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate \n* Ammonium lauryl sulfate ​\n* Ammonium laureth sulfate\n* Sodium polystyrene sulfonate\n* Cocamidopropyl betaine\n* Coco betaine\n* Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine\n* Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n* Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n* Sodium lauroamphoacetate\n* Sodium sulfosuccinate\n* Cocamidopropyl betaine\n* Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n* Sodium lauryl sulfate \\*\n\n*\\* Sodium lauryl sulfate is not recommended for daily use.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Non Surfactant Cleanser **Definition:** This cleaning agent does not completely lift oil and grease off of the hair strand, meaning it does not fully remove them. Doing so lightly cleanses your hair while also retaining moisture (i.e. conditioning it). It is not recommended for use with silicones, mineral oil or petroleum products because these ingredients deposit a [residue](https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/493588) under the hair's cuticle that require a surfactant cleanser to remove. I usually suggest using a clarifying shampoo once a month with this type of cleanser. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Detoxes, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair. See [How Often Should I Shampoo?](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html) ​for frequency.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil\n* Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil\n* Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil\n* Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil\n* Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Detox **Definition:** While similar to the Cleanser category, the Detox category is stronger. These cleansing agents remove product build up and help with demineralization of the hair. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used once a month by all hair types. Helpful for oily hair.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Disodium EDTA (Ethylamine Diamine Tetraacetic Acid)\n* Pentasoidum Pentetate\n* Sodium phytate\n* Phytic acid\n* Citric acid (needs large enough quantity to be effective)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Humectants **Definition:** T​his ingredient helps retain moisture from water by attracting it to the hair strand in humid climate conditions. However, in dry weather humectants have the opposite effect and will transfer moisture from your hair into the atmosphere. This can leave your hair dehydrated, which may not be what you want depending on its current state.*Tip: Humectants are complementary to silicones and plant oils.* **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** Can be used daily by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair. Using a detox once a month is recommended with this category.\\*\\*Ingredients:\\*\\**Hydrolyzed Proteins*\n\n* Hydrolyzed Elastin, silk, keratin, collagen \n* Peptides (wheat, oat, soy...)\n* Amino acids (wheat, oat, soy) or glycine, alanine, proline, etc.\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (source of protein, i.e. keratin, silk, rice, soy)\n* Cocoyl hydrolyzed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (source of protein)\n* Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (source of protein)\n* Hydrolyzed oat flour\n\n*For Use In Humid Weather​*\n\n* Vegetable glycerin\n* ​Sorbitol\n\n*Plant Gels*\n\n* Panthenol\n* Flax Seed Gel\n* Okra Gel\n* Aloe Vera\n* Hydroxyethylcellulose\n* Pectin\n* Xanthan Gum\n* Guar Gum\n* Marshmallow Root\n* Slippery Elm​\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Soluble Silicones **Definition:** This ingredient coats the hair shaft to lock in moisture, reduce frizz, add slip, and give hair the coveted soft and silky feel. Soluble silicones can be washed out with non surfactant cleansers. **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** Can be used daily by all hair types. Using a detox once a month is recommended with this category. \n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Any silicone with PEG as a prefix\n* Bis-peg/ppg-16/16 peg/ppg-16/16 (This is an emulsifier - not for shine or lubrication)\n* Cyclomethicone\n* Dimethicone copolyol\n* DEA PG-Propyl PEG/PPG-18/21 Dimethicone\n* Dimethicone PEG-8 Phosphate\n* Dimethicone-PG Diethylmonium Chloride\n* Hydrolyzed Silk PG-Propyl Methylsilanediol Crosspolymer\n* Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n* Hydrolyzed Wheat protein/hydroxypropyl polysiloxane and cystine/silicone co-polymers\n* Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Silanetriol\n* Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol\n* Lauryl methicone copolyol\n* PEG-40/PPG-8 Methylaminopropyl/Hydropropyl Dimethicone Copolymer\n* PEG/PPG-14/4 Dimethicone\n* PEG/PPG-20/15 Dimethicone\n* PEG-12 Dimethicone\n* PEG/PPG-20/15 Dimethicone\n* PPG-8 Methylaminopropyl, Hydroxypropyl Dimethicone Copolymer\n* PEG-7 Amodimethicone\n* PEG-8 Disteramonium Chloride PG-Dimethicone\n* PEG-33 (and) PEG-8 Dimethicone (and) PEG-14\n* Silanetriol\n* Silicone Quaternium-8\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Plant Oils **Definition:** This ingredient is used to retain moisture, condition hair, protect from damage and minimize dryness. **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** Can be used daily by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair.  **Ingredients:**\n\n* Coconut (Cocos Nucifera) Oil \n* Sunflower (Helianthus Annuus) Seed Oil\n* Olive (Olea Europaea) Oil\n* Argan (Argania Spinosa) Oil\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Preservatives **Definition:** Additives that prevent spoilage. Most consumer products contain preservatives because without them any water-based solution will eventually grow mold or bacteria. **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** A routine is not applicable for this category since it's included in most products, but pay attention to whether your products cause scalp irritation. That could be a sign to switch to, or alternate with, preservative free options.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Sodium Benzoate\n* Potassium Sorbate \n* Benzoic acid\n* Dehydroacetic acid\n\n*​Sources:* [*Cationic Compounds in Cosmetics*](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/search?q=surfactants)*, Science-y Hair Blog*[*Detergents Which Remove: Silicone*](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2016/05/detergents-which-remove-silicones.html)*, Science-y Hair Blog​*[*Essentials of Hair Care Often Neglected: Hair Cleansing*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3002407/)*, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)*[*Glycerin and Humidity*](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2015/02/glycerin-and-humidity.html)*, Science-y Hair Blog*[*Film Forming Humectants - What They Are And Why You Need Them*](http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2014/07/film-forming-humectants-what-they-are.html)*, Science-y Hair Blog*",

    "body": "Heyyy, first time poster here but longtime lurker!  So...I should have known better...BUT I added multiple products into my routine and now I don't know which one is breaking me out :(\n\nLittle info: I *think* I have combo skin but not totally sure.  My skin is never super dry or super oily.  But very acne prone in my T-zone (and sometimes a little oily) and then sometimes I have dry patches on my cheeks and around my nostrils.\n\nOk, anyway, so these are the products I've recently added:\n\nThe first is **IT Cosmetic's \"Your Skin but Better\" CC cream (SPF 50)**.  I bought this 3 days ago; I have used it 4 times.  I absolutely fell in love with it right away.  Perfect color match, love the coverage, and that it has SPF.\n\n\nHere is the ingredients list:\n\n\n*Water, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dimethicone, Butylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Cetyl Peg/Ppg-10/1 Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Magnesium Sulfate, Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Laurate, Stearic Acid, Calcium Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sorbitan Isostearate, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium Edta, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Punica Granatum Seed Oil, Pinus Sylvestris Leaf Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Niacinamide, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Cholesterol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Water, Lactobacillus/Honeysuckle Flower/Licorice Root/Morus Alba Root/Pueraria Lobata Root/Schizandra Chinensis Fruit/Scutellaria Baicalensis Root/Sophora Japonica Flower Extract Ferment Filtrate, Perfluorohexane, Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Chrysanthemum Indicum Flower Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Perfluorodecalin, Morus Alba Fruit Extract, Magnolia Kobus Bark Extract, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sprout Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Cinnamomum Cassia Bark Extract, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract, Pentafluoropropane, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Steareth-20, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Colloidal Oatmeal, Hydrolyzed Silk, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, N-Hydroxysuccinimide, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Tocopherol, Thiamine Hcl, Riboflavin, Retinyl Palmitate, Pantothenic Acid, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Niacin, Folic Acid, Chrysin, Carnitine Hcl, Biotin, Ascorbic Acid, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Chlorhexidine Digluconate. May Contain: Iron Oxides (Ci 77492, Ci 77491, Ci 77499).*\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next new product is **Jack Black Epic Moisture MP10 Nourishing Oil**  I've used a sample of this twice now.  2 days ago, I used my DE Babyfacial, which I also recently bought but I've used several samples of this before so I know it's not the culprit.  I do know, however, that the DE Marula Oil that they give you with the babyfacial *does* break me out so I didn't use it after the facial, like they suggest.  Instead, I grabbed the Jack Black sample and I loved it so much! It sunk in right away and just felt so good.  I did this at night then went to bed.  I then used it a second time, yesterday, during the day. BTW, yesterday is the day I noticed my break out.\n\n\nHere is the ingredient list:\n\n\n*Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethiconol, Hydrogenated Ethylhexyl Olivate, Jojoba Esters, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Hydrogenated Olive Oil Unsaponifiables, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Citrillus Ianatus (Watemelon) Seed Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Prunus Insititia Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Sclerocarya Birrea (Marula) Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata (Baobab) Seed Oil, Fragrance (Parfum), Ascorbyl Palmitate, Retinyl Palmitate, Schinziophyton Rautanenii (Manketti) Kernel Oil, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Citral, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool.*\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third product I added is **Marc Jacob's Dew Drops Coconut Gel Highlighter**  I've only used this twice.  I wasn't a big fan.  \n\n\nHere is the ingredient list:\n\n\n*Water, Mica, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, Glycerin, Tromethamine, Parfum/Fragrance, Lecithin, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, Dimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Dimethiconol, Simethicone, Hexylene Glycol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium Edta, Tocopherol, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Diisostearyl Malate, Butylene Glycol, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Calcium Sodium Borosilicate, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Calcium Aluminum Borosilicate, Panthenol, Withania Somnifera Root Extract, Silica, Isostearyl Alcohol, Malic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Tin Oxide, Coumarin, Linalool, Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Iron Oxides (Ci 77491), Carmine (Ci 75470).*\n\n\n\nSooo, obviously I'm hoping that the MJ Highlighter is the culprit, since it's the most expensive and my least favorite. But, I have a feeling it's one of the first two :(\n\n\nIf you need any additional info, let me know! I'd love to figure out what it is that caused the breakout so I can continue to use the other products that don't break me out.",

We have some information we want to share with you.\n\nDMDM hydantoin is a formaldehyde-releasing preservative that's in some hair and skin products. Most people don't have issues with this, but it is possible to be allergic to formaldehyde, which means you'll [likely](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0536.1988.tb02802.x) also react to DMDM hydantoin. Your doctor or an allergist would be able to confirm this. We obviously don't know if that's what's happening here, but hair loss is a known side effect of allergic reactions that cause contact dermatitis.\n\nFormaldehyde is a known carcinogen, but in tiny amounts in a rinse off product, it's not likely to have a health impact in the grand scheme of things unless you are allergic.\n\nUnlike the DevaCurl allegations, the DMDM hydantoin controversy (and any related lawsuits) is tied to this specific ingredient. If you do happen to have issues with hair loss and DMDM hydantoin, you should consider checking for a formaldehyde allergy just in case, as there are [several other ingredient](https://www.contactdermatitisinstitute.com/formaldehyde.php) you might be sensitive to as well.\n\nIf I'm wrong, I probably just picked up on a keyword in your title (Please ignore me!).\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "body": "Hi! First off, I really appreciate the resources that have been compiled to help beginners improve their hair routines, find great products, and learn cool drying/styling techniques! I appreciate the person or people who put the CG Product Lists together. :)\n\nToday, after consulting the CG product lists, I almost bought 3 Shea Moisture products “for thick, curly hair” (which is confusing — does it mean it’s for people who have thick, curly hair, or that the result of using it is thick, curly hair)? Though I would love to know the answer, I digress.\n\nSo here’s the deal. The Shea Moisture Curl and Shine shampoo & conditioner, and the Curl Enhancing Smoothie - these products say that they contain “Silk protein” on the front of the bottles. Now, the ingredient this refers to is Sodium Lauroyl Hydrolyzed Silk. I don’t expect this would be PETA certified, because the creation of real silk entails killing the silkworms in their chrysalis stage...which isn’t vegan, or even vegetarian. I’m a vegetarian who objects to the killing of living creatures for human use. It’s confusing the way it’s labeled, too, because they don’t test on animals (shown by the Leaping Bunny symbol) but the products contain ingredients that require killing living creatures to obtain. :( I couldn’t find a list of PETA certified products online. Does one exist?\n\nSo I’m pondering this, and I’m wondering if maybe the products were reformulated to include the silk ingredient. OR maybe the manufacturer is just using old labels, which apparently is legal (I am not 100% sure of this as I did not find a fact checking source to confirm it). So after removing this ingredient in a reformulation, meaning it would now be vegan, the label could still list the ingredient even though it’s not in the product. Super confusing. I know the CG list mentions the caveat that things may have been reformulated after the list was made. I just don’t know how to find out whether it was reformulated, or not.\n\nI may seem to be splitting hairs here, but the distinction about this ingredient matters a lot to me. I’d really love to try Shea Moisture curl products because I’ve heard and seen such great results with the Shea Moisture curly hair line on this subreddit. Oh, and my local CVS has this brand, which is convenient!\n\nIf you have read this far, thank you for reading. Any info about this would be helpful!",

I know that there was someone who mixed topical Finasteride with lipids to give it a higher molecular weight, but that still goes systematic. My other post was about a hydrophobic topical Finasteride which would be harder to do, but why not just mix topical Finasteride with something that physically cannot penetrate the scalp. Like the molecule pp405 is using. They claim that their solution will stay topical in the scalp. Why not use that molecule with topical Finasteride. \n\n I asked chat gpt for some other examples of bases and they gave me this: Polyquaternium-11 (or Polyquaternium-7):\n\t•\tPolyquaternium compounds are large-molecule, water-soluble polymers that are commonly used in hair and skin products. They form a thick, non-penetrating layer on the skin and hair. Polyquaternium-11, in particular, has a high molecular weight and is often used for conditioning, moisturizing, and forming protective barriers.\n\t•\tIt creates a flexible, smooth layer that doesn’t allow active ingredients or environmental elements to penetrate deeply.\nHydrolyzed Silk Protein:\n\t•\tSilk proteins have a high molecular weight and can help condition and protect the scalp without deep absorption. When hydrolyzed (broken into smaller fragments), they still have large molecular structures and stay on the surface, providing a smooth coating effect.\n\t•\tThese proteins also help improve the appearance of hair without penetrating deeply into the skin.\n\nWe quite literally have the mechanism that stops hairloss but 1-5% of people get sides from them (some think higher). Why is no company exploring a side effect free Finasteride?! Please someone poke holes into this argument. Not sure why a bunch of different bases with a topical Finasteride wasn’t tested or at the very least the molecule that pp405 is using can’t be used in topical Finasteride ",

Used to have some problems with flakes until I figured out to rinse more thoroughly when co-washing.

Wash with [Neutrogena Anti-Residue Shampoo](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/anti-residue+shampoo.do) at most every 2 weeks, but mostly just when my hair is feeling jank. Use [Batiste Dry Shampoo for dark hair](http://www.walgreens.com/store/c/batiste-dry-shampoo/ID=prod6153021-product) as needed between co-washes, usually just a couple spritzes. After showering whether I washed or not, I add a couple spritzes each of [It's a Ten](http://www.walgreens.com/store/c/it's-a-10-miracle-leave-in-product/ID=prod6051737-product) and [OGX Renewing Weightless Healing Dry Oil](http://www.walgreens.com/store/c/ogx-renewing-weightless-healing-dry-oil-spray/ID=prod6098276-product) when my hair is about 65-75% dry and let it finish air drying. I brush with a boar hair brush before the shower, and I don't touch it when I get out of the shower and use my fingers when working in my leave-ins.

I'm a fairly new maker, and my first attempt was based on [this Humblebee Orange Blossom face cream.](https://www.humblebeeandme.com/orange-blossom-face-cream/)\n\n[Google Sheet with my first attempt, next attempt, and breakdown of the BB face base ingredients](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SFlRKCNcQ1Bq9XD4BbY-uPipEAhSg0e9rlsQOrF8yMo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThe formula I used for my first attempt, in grams:\n\nwater 40\n\nglycerin 3.7\n\nhydrolyzed silk protein 1\n\nrose water 30\n\nallantoin 0.3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nevening primrose oil 5\n\nargan oil 2\n\nfractionated coconut oil 3\n\nshea butter 5\n\nBTMS-50 5\n\ncetyl alcohol 3\n\nlanolin 5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nvitamin E 1\n\ncap-5 preservative 0.2 (I think this is too low, got confused with the instructions)\n\ncedar oil 0.2\n\ngeranium oil 0.05\n\nfilm fix 0.5\n\nsilicone elastomers 0.5\n\ncyclomethicone 5\n\n110.45 g total weight. Sorry for putting absolute weight instead of percentages, I couldn't make it copy nicely from GDrive.\n\nThe cream this made is really lovely, the cedar blends into the rose and geranium and smells amazing, and it's definitely hydrating. It feels just a bit less thick than the Bobbi Brown cream, but it is considerably less rich and doesn't have the slippy silicone priming effect. On the skin, it takes a minute to absorb but skin feels hydrated afterwards, if slightly tacky/filmy. I want it to be richer, slippier, and have a smoother application.\n\n I was confused about how/when to add the cyclomethicone so I just blended it in after cooldown but then I realized that the cyclomethicone and the dimethicone crosspolymer were probably already together in silicone gel form. I'm a cheapskate who uses [anti-chafing gel instead of buying it from TKB](https://www.amazon.com/Monistat-Chafing-Relief-Powder-Protection/dp/B00AXVJF52/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=anti-chafing+gel&qid=1668896839&rdc=1&sr=8-2), so I'm going to try adding that in to my next attempt.\n\nFormula I'm proposing for my next attempt, with your help and feedback, in percentages this time:\n\nwater 26.3% \n\nrose water 26.3%\n\nglycerin 2.6% \n\nhydrolyzed silk protein .88%\n\nallantoin 0.26%\n\nTotal water phase 56.5%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nevening primrose oil 4.4%\n\nfractionated coconut oil 2.64%\n\nshea butter 4.4%\n\nBTMS-50 6.15%\n\ncetyl alcohol 1.76%\n\nstearic acid 1.76%\n\nlanolin 7.03%\n\ntotal oil phase 28.1%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nvitamin E .88%\n\ncap-5 preservative 0.5 %\n\ncedar oil 0.2 %\n\ngeranium oil 0.05%\n\nfilm fix 0.44%\n\nsilicone elastomers 0.44%\n\nsilicone gel 13.2%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure when exactly to incorporate the silicone gel. My gut tells me it's cooldown ingredient bc of the low flashpoint of cyclomethicone, but I've never added it to an emulsion. If it actually should be considered part of the oil phase, I think I'd have to up the BTMS by a few grams. Anyone have experience with this? Any other feedback or suggestions?",

There are various polymers in the product that would help achieve that (carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic acid) so you'll want to add something like that. \n\nUsing a conditioning emulsifier is going to give this a pretty different feel to the original too, I'd imagine (also, I'm not the biggest fan of cationic surfactants in face products). Maybe I'm wrong, but I wouldn't think BTMS would work too well in a primer. \n\nHopefully others here with more experience with the dimethicone crosspolymers, etc, could advise on amounts and processing of those ingredients, and how to get the performance you want from them. If you could provide the INCI for the last few ingredients, that would help (for example, silicone elastomer could be a few things).\n\nThere's not a lot of crossover between your ingredients and the product's, so I'm not sure you can achieve something very similar without some fairly big changes.",

Sepimax zen is my go to and easiest one to use for beginners and pretty much fool proof. I would drop the oils down to a max of 5% and replace the rest with lighter esters and increase the silicone elastomer to 3-5% for the “priming” effects :)",

    "body": "I have a quandary with my curly coiffure, and after hours of researching and soft attempts at de-matting my hair, I've come to the point where I feel like reaching out to Reddit is a good idea. I'm using a throwaway account because of the gulf of dismay over which this mat hangs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've got hair somewhere between 2b and 3c, though the tightest curls are only ringlet-types close to the front of my head.  Free, it's down past my nipples in the front and below my shoulders in the back. The back of my head is something closer to 2c/3a, or was - it's now more or less a neglected gnarl reaching between my shoulder blades. It's no simple snag between a few errant strands as seem to be commonly designated as mats in many other places.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith things as such and after much research, I wanted to personalize my questions for you guys.  I found all the other threads I explored left me with just as many questions as answers. So whether you have a similar personal experience or not, whether you have a passion for or profession in hair, the gnarly snarl on the back of my head demands attention.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**(FORMER) ROUTINE** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI did dry finger detangling, and conditioned between once a week to once a month with Trader Joe's Tea Tree Tingle.  Shampooed every month or two.  Occasional coconut oil deep condition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHad a drastic move towards the end of COVID, struggled with routine and mental health afterwards. Routine resembled the above when it existed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE STORY**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had a week of neglect in February which led to tangles.  Winter is especially dry here, and I had remote work for which I'd hastily awaken and jump on the computer. Kept my hair back, concentrated on work, and found knots after the week was up. I took it to the local salon, and they managed all but a more unruly snarl on the back of my head.  They weren't quite up to it.  I went on my way, hoping to deal with it soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI looked into removing the mat from my hair on my own, and of course came across Love 518 Salon and all those hair detangler tech videos in the meantime.  I deemed that given my other financial obligations, asking a trusted friend to help me was the affordable course of action. So I got a couple of bottles of Kinky Curly hair detangler/leave-in conditioner and a couple rattail combs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt took longer than expected to attempt unraveling this enigmatic mat living on the back of my head.  After nearly 8 months, I finally arranged help from my friend. Suffice it to say, after a couple hours of work and a couple smaller  peripheral knots turning to near-stone,  my friend lost a bit of confidence. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs of now, the back of my head has matted into a neglect gnarl, and I've come back to researching and even considering booking a flight some drastic distance to have someone handle the mat.  The thing is, I'm still split on whether to simply reconsider the tricho-tactical approach and take a more measured approach at home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, in the hopes of illuminating the way forward, I thought I'd ask some questions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE QUERIES**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI appreciate general advice, but I'm hoping someone might have more particular pointers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I've both made a light attempt at de-matting, and done a bit of research using reddit, forums, and various videos already, I've come upon certain snags that you might be able to help me work through from the safety of your keyboard, haha.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*When I mention the conditioner/water I used, I must specify that in my test run I applied the leave-in/detangler Kinky-Curly Knot Today and water spritzing separately without combining the two in a spray bottle and applying them as such.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. There seems to be a split between approaching mats dry or wet. My hair is between 2b and 3b on the whole, and is quite dry. In fact, I haven't washed the mat on the back of my head for a few months for fear that it would further tangle. Given my previous attempt with room temp water and leave-in conditioner tightened which only tightened the given knots, I'm wondering if I should in fact attempt the whole thing dry. I know my hair is dry, and I know that dry damaged hair takes on water in a haywire way, so I'm in turn thinking any use of water might only exacerbate the issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Given my hair type, the mat being both dry and oily, and the mat already undoubtedly holding a degree of shed skin, I'm worried about build-up/tightening of the mat. Lathering on conditioner is something I'm slightly apprehensive about \\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. When my friend attempted working through some peripheral knots, we used Kinky Curly Knot Today leave-in conditioner/detangler and a spray bottle with room-temp water. As it tightened in that instance, I'm also wondering about the degree of saturation I should employ (if any at all) and how to time the detangling itself. Might I:\n\na) completely saturate the matted hair with conditioner + water and wait x minutes before using a rat tail?\n\nb) completely saturate only a segment of hair with conditioner + water and wait x minutes before using a rat tail?\n\nc) completely saturate the matted hair with conditioner alone and wait x minutes before using a rat tail?\n\nd) completely saturate only a segment of hair with conditioner alone and wait x minutes before using a rat tail?\n\ne) spritz a segment of hair with conditioner + water and use rat tail?\n\nf) forego conditioner and just do the whole mat dry using a rat tail?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Many commenters on other similar threads mention saturating the hair with conditioner and combing from the ends.  While there are stray strands, the mat is fairly wide, so there is not a particular end. When free, The back of my head is closest to 2c, but it's really anywhere between 2b and 3b. Again, this is ultimately not a simple snag between a few errant strands and is a neglect gnarl.\n\nAny advice on how to approach such a tangle with (rattail) comb techniques?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. I used and still have Kinky Curly Knot Today leave-in conditioner/detangler for this issue.  Perhaps I should use some other conditioner, or even some other type of conditioner, whether water-based or whatever.  I've read about Cowboy Magic, but that contains hydrolyzed silk and I'm an (evidently) dirty vegan. I'm looking to escape the dirty part, but not the vegan part, so I'm not going to use Cowboy Magic.  If anybody has any suggestions for a (type of) conditioner befitting my hair type, I can look into them in terms of ingredients and such.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. Alternatively, if I should do the detangling dry, I've read in multiple places that a form of oil should be applied.  Again, I'm a bit worried about build-up given the mat is in some interstitial dimension both dry and oily, but perhaps there is some ideal oil for this.  I think coconut oil might be a bit too heavy for my hair in this compromised situation, and I know from past experience that it indeed causes build-up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a feeling I might be forgetting some question, but I'm sure this will generate enough helpful discussion. Apologies for subjecting you to redundant/exhaustingly exhaustive statements on the nature of the hair, I just wanted to take care being precise. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm also fully aware cutting one's hair is general advice on such matters, but I'm looking for specifics outside of that, haha.  Also, I wear this shame beneath the crown of my head, so no need for any attempts to outdo this heinous creation with foul words. You can't possibly do worse than this eldritch horror has for my self-esteem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you to any and all who take the time to read and respond.",

    "body": "It's been at least a year since I've used either shampoo or conditioner that contains silicone's. The only source of silicone's I've been getting are the water soluble silicone's found in the [TRESemme TRES Two non aerosol hair spray](https://www.amazon.com/TRESemm%C3%A9-TRES-Aerosol-Spray-Extra/dp/B00XYS8QS8) (Alcohol Denat., Water, Ethyl Ester of PVM/MA Copolymer, Fragrance, Aminomethyl Propanol, Triethyl Citrate, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Diisopropyl Adipate, Ascorbic Acid, Linalool, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropanol, Amyl Cinnamal, Hexyl Cinnamal, Citronellol, Geraniol) and the [TRESemmé Heat Tamer Spray](https://www.amazon.com/TRESemm%C3%A9-Tamer-Spray-Thermal-Creations/dp/B01MYH8KJS) (Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Amodimethicone, Peg-12 Dimethicone, Propylene Glycol, PVP, Fragrance (Parfum), Polysorbate 20, Cetrimonium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Benzophenone-4, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA, Hydrolyzed Silk, Ascorbic Acid. Tocopheryl Acetate, Panthenol, Biotin, Niacinamide). I've tried to find alternative heat protectant sprays that are either CG-friendly or partially-CG, but this is the best I've been able to find that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. I do some minor heat styling and occasionally some more heavy-duty heat styling, and I don't think I'd ever give up the heat completely. \n\nMy hair seems to only be feeling worse and worse as the months tick by. I've used several different CG products, ranging from heavy to light. Because my hair has been feeling very coarse, rough, and dry in the shower, I figured I would next try going protein-free as much as possible, because my hair seems to be showing signs of protein overload (even though I don't believe any of the products I use are high in protein). I've been using globs of shea moisture conditioner lately to try and detangle my hair in the shower and make it feel at least somewhat normal. I'm not exactly sure what type of hair I have. The top layers are very wavy while some sections of hair underneath have been fairly straight lately. Frizz is also a *huge* problem for me. \n\nAnyhow, the other night I decided to use a standard bottle of Pantene conditioner, just to see what would happen. As soon as I put it in my hair, I was *shocked*. My hair hadn't felt so smooth and silky in a very, very long time. That matted, coarse, rough and tangly feeling I had been dealing with for weeks just disappeared and I was able to actually run my fingers through my wet hair with ease. When I woke up today my hair didn't look too different, although it did seem to be slightly less frizzy and my waves seemed to be somewhat more defined. \n\nI don't know what to do with this information. I want to keep my hair healthy and nurture it, but at the same time, I hate having hair that feels so bad all the time. Shampooing irregularly, shampooing regularly, using a clarifying shampoo, none of it really seems to help. Because I also use heat on occasion, I'm starting to wonder if it would be a good idea to just throw in the towel and use a conditioner with silicone's... after all, those extra silicone's would only further protect my hair, right? \n\nI'm sorry if this question is a bit blasphemous for this sub, but I guess what I'm trying to get at is whether or not it's possible to nurture wavy/curly hair and keep it healthy *without* giving up silicone's completely. Are the two really mutually exclusive? \n\nTLDR; been struggling with gross feeling hair for well over a year now, decided to use some Pantene conditioner with silicone's in it just to see what would happen and was shocked at how nice my hair felt immediately.

    "body": "I have thick, curly, hair that's very dry and frizzy unless I use lots of leave-in conditioner and oil. I'd say my hair is 2c at its maximum curl potential when I don't use any heat. I'm not interested in maintaining my curly hair because straight hair will be easier to manage when I'm busier. I'm planning on washing it weekly and then going to the hair salon where they'll blow dry it then go over some pieces with a flat iron\n\nI am planning on using lots of protein and silicones to prevent heat damage\n\nThis is how I plan on taking care of my hair:\n\n\\- Shampoo hair with Hask Keratin Protein Smoothing Shampoo. It has a mild sulfate (sodium c14-16 olefin sulfonate) to wash out the silicones and I think it has 7 different proteins (keratin amino acids, cocoyl hydrolyzed keratin, keratin, hydrolyzed keratin, hydrolyzed collagen, hydrolyzed corn protein, hydrolyzed soy protein) and is moisturizing\n\n\\- Apply Garnier Ultimate Blends Hair Food Banana 3-in-1 and leave it in hair for 15 minutes with heat. It has no protein and is just moisturizing\n\n\\- Apply Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen & Restore Treatment Masque and leave it in hair for 15 minutes with heat. It has 2 proteins (hydrolized wheat protein, hydrolyzed keratin) and is moisturizing\n\n\\- Apply Hask Keratin Protein Smoothing Conditioner and wash it out after a few minutes. It has 1 silicone (dimethicone) and I think it has 5 different proteins (keratin amino acids, keratin, hydrolyzed keratin, hydrolyzed collagen, cocoyl hydrolyzed keratin) and is moisturizing\n\n\\- Apply Hask Biotin Boost Thickening Conditioner and wash it out after a few minutes. It has 3 silicones (dimethicone, dimethiconol, cyclopentasiloxane) and 1 protein (hydrolyzed collagen) and is moisturizing\n\n\\- Apply a little bit of Chi Silk Infusion Serum on wet hair as a heat protectant. It has 2 silicones (cyclopentasiloxane, dimethiconol) and 4 proteins (hydrolyzed corn protein, hydrolyzed soy protein, hydrolyzed wheat protein, hydrolyzed silk)\n\n\\- Apply sweet almond oil on ends daily for silky looking hair\n\nHere are my questions:\n\n1. Am I moisturizing my hair enough?\n\nMy hair always feels dry unless I use a leave in conditioner and oil when it's wet. I can't add water to my hair after straightening it because it'll go curly. I'm thinking of switching the Garnier and Shea Moisture conditioners with the Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil Intensive Hydration Masque because it has more humectants but it only has 1 protein (hydrolyzed rice protein). What do you think of this switch? Is there a better way to make sure my hair stays moisturized?\n\n2. Am I using too many silicones?\n\nI can only use a little bit of the heat protectant because I used a normal amount last time and the hair stylist at the salon said I had to wash it out and she stripped all of the silicones from my hair, so I want to make sure that I'm using enough silicones other than just the heat protectant. I'm thinking of using 2 conditioners because I prefer the ingredients in the first one but it doesn't have enough silicones. I prefer my hair to be flat when it's straight but I don't want it to look greasy and weighed down, so is using 1 conditioner enough? If so, which conditioner is the better choice? I'll use sweet almond oil on my ends to reduce frizz after straightening my hair because it doesn't have any silicones and tolerates heat well (I'll have to go over my hair with a flat iron for a minute each morning)\n\n3. Am I using enough protein?\n\nIt looks like I listed a lot of protein, but is this truly enough? I'm getting my hair done at the salon where they'll blow dry my hair straight then go over the pieces they couldn't get with a flat iron and I can't control the heat. I can't really use low heat at home either because it takes much longer than it would if I used 200 degrees celcius in my experience\n\nMy goal is to have hair that looks silky and healthy and to retain length. I'm not very interested in retaining my curl pattern because I know it's almost impossible when I'm using this much heat\n\nThank you for reading through this long post and I would greatly appreciate any feedback on my current plan :)",

Keratin and other proteins in excess start to have the opposite effect that you want if used too often, and too many different kinds are layered. Have you tried only doing protein masks and using protein shampoo/conditioner every couple weeks, or whenever your hair feels like it needs a pick me up? I don’t have the same hair type, but I do know that protein overload with hair is very real and a lot of times people don’t realize it is an issue\nI wish you the best of luck with your hair journey!!

    "body": "And just like that, the summer of babes is officially over. Autumn is here, and while it starts a little warmer than usual, the season is marked by sudden changes in temperature and the arrival of harsher weather conditions that can be a challenge for hair care. This may be the time of year when your natural hair suffers the most from the drop in temperature, but fear not! Here are some hair care tips to help you make sure your hair stays healthy and thriving this season.\n\n## Why Is Autumn So Bad For Natural Hair?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ifbrj002txs91.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=052882aece347396cfd74d75f15331051b37f4b1\n\nAutumn means terrible weather conditions. Wind and harsh cold air can draw moisture from your hair and cause it to tangle. But once you're indoors, the air gets dry again. All this drying can accelerate frizz, breakage, and split ends, and the shock of extreme temperature changes can put extra stress on the hair.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/grx1vmm5txs91.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=290e241147b2eb1901c96eb97480b1fb76f7d76d\n\nIf that wasn't enough, hats, scarves, and sweaters are made of insulating material, and they do keep your body warm—but they can pull on your hair and even break it from side to side. There seems to be no escape, whether you're indoors or out.\n\n## 10 Steps To Protect Natural Hair In Autumn\n\n## 1. Use hairstyles that protect your natural hair\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjibhmy6txs91.png?width=447&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e6476d248f6395f1a92662d834b74d3f508ab42\n\nWind and cold/dry air can draw moisture from hair, making it brittle, weaker, and more prone to breakage. Protective hairstyles reduce hair handling, which will prevent breakage, and they securely curl ends and strands away from wind and cold air.\n\n## 2. Don't ignore your hair in a protective hairstyle\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ykiyqcf8txs91.png?width=444&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e484c218dd1d06892d52727da04c1b4244d2bcf\n\nA protective hairstyle will help your hair retain more moisture than exposed hair, but your hair will eventually dry out even with a protective hairstyle. You need to perform minimal maintenance on your hair, such as applying a light moisturizer and light oil to the roots every few days to keep them hydrated.\n\nPay attention to your hair and try to refresh or change your style frequently. We sincerely recommend that you change or redo your styles every two weeks.\n\n## 3. Moisturize your hair with steam\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yemwazbbtxs91.png?width=437&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec26093e01e3a3a32089c25c66d3e739829265f6\n\nSteam is warm, airborne water particles that can easily penetrate and moisturize your hair. This makes steaming a great way to keep your hair from getting too dry in the winter. One of the easiest ways to treat your hair with steam therapy is to take a hot shower, then throw away the shower cap. Just make sure you don't leave the house with wet hair!\n\n## 4. Double your hair nourishment\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/89sh8plctxs91.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ec9414c61e81f0ba6e2d2e2f69966790c71f02e\n\nYour hair needs protein, nutrients, and vitamins to grow and stay strong and healthy. Eating healthy foods year-round is a good idea for healthy hair (and body), but it's also especially important to prevent dry and cold air in the fall.\n\nLikewise, you may not be as sweaty or thirsty in the fall as in the summer, but be sure to drink the same amount of water. There is no better way to keep your hair hydrated and moisturized than by providing water directly to your body.\n\n## 5. Pay attention to knitted hats and scarves\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ec5ewxpdtxs91.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=caace385ebe7f0fbb58426c04837fad4463e6a6e\n\nRough material can get caught in your natural hair and cause breakage. Don't worry, just put a thin silk cap between your hair and hat. This may seem like an inconvenient step, but your hair will thank you! (You can do the same thing with a scarf—wrap a thin silk scarf around the outside of the scarf to protect your hair from friction.)\n\n## 6. Keep away from heat\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rublrmqftxs91.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fea07bc35cd52a7393133d043cbf58f7cffd05c\n\nSteaming hair is fine, but put away flat irons and keep your blow dryer in a cool setting for the season. These tools remove moisture from the hair, a process accelerated by the wind and dry air outside.\n\n## 7. Keep away from drying chemicals\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jvbpshzgtxs91.png?width=471&format=png&auto=webp&s=96b67c60ed2642ddc36457ea2823b40f1971d703\n\nMany hair care products contain ingredients that strip the hair of oil and moisture that hair can't handle in the fall! Before washing, conditioning, moisturizing, or styling your hair, check your hair care product's ingredient list. Check out our list of ingredients to avoid in hair products.\n\n## 8. Please never ignore deep conditioning\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jjdi3u0jtxs91.png?width=441&format=png&auto=webp&s=f873e3532c74f3bf24250182c280229f45f7c30d\n\nA deep conditioner can give your hair the functionality it needs for fall, allowing moisture and nutrients to penetrate every strand. It is recommended that you use a deep conditioner with all-natural ingredients, the more you care for your hair, the more it will be protected.\n\n## 9. Lock in moisture with an anti-humectant\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hnfjku3ktxs91.png?width=446&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4da8c30a9d424c4cd634b9370da591c513e7f69\n\nAn anti-humectant is an oil or butter, or any product that seals moisture into the hair. Anti-moisturizers protect your hair from losing moisture in the dry winter air. It's especially important to use an anti-moisturizer after washing or moisturizing your hair. We recommend olive oil or jojoba oil, or other oils that are liquid at room temperature.\n\n## 10. Use protein properly\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5clyubnltxs91.png?width=440&format=png&auto=webp&s=660ba55b0252b838e0c776750fdf8b82c439a473\n\n[**Natural hair**](https://www.hiarthair.com/shop/) is made up of keratin, a special type of protein that allows our hair to bounce and frizz. However, keep in mind that protein and moisture go hand in hand. Too much moisture can cause hydraulic fatigue, while too much protein can cause stiffness and breakage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sd27bsrntxs91.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=92f3af3780664ad94bb5bd81598f49871b32cede\n\nUse smaller-sized proteins in your hair, such as amino acids and peptides, which penetrate your hair and support your natural proteins. Larger-sized proteins, such as hydrolyzed silk and wheat protein, form a film around the hair and can dry to low porosity hair.\n\nOnce the temperature starts to drop, monitor your hair to make sure you don't have too much protein in your hair. Protein overload is harmful but accelerated in cold weather. Look for hidden protein ingredients like hydrolyzed protein and silk protein in your leave-in products, especially if you have low porosity and are protein sensitive.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o02k4i2ptxs91.png?width=440&format=png&auto=webp&s=32ce7f7b377fe684556b1981f15a2f684b365460\n\nAutumn is changing, the leaves change color and the heat turns into the fresh air. You should also bring about change. Clean out your closet, set your schedule, and most importantly, take good care of your hair.

    "body": "If you’ve got curly hair, you know the struggle: you want defined, frizz-free curls that last all day, but without that stiff, crunchy feeling some gels leave behind. Not all gels are created equal, especially when it comes to textured hair that craves both **hold** and **hydration**. Choosing the [best curly hair gel](https://zaphiranature.com/blogs/curl-advice/curly-hair-gel) means finding a product that balances moisture with structure, so your curls stay bouncy, shiny, and soft to the touch.\n\n# 🌿 What Makes a Great Curly Hair Gel?\n\nThe best curly hair gel should do more than just “freeze” your curls in place. Look for a formula that:\n\n* Enhances your natural curl pattern\n* Locks in moisture and prevents frizz\n* Provides long-lasting hold without flaking\n* Contains nourishing ingredients like aloe vera, flaxseed, or panthenol\n* Doesn’t weigh your curls down or cause buildup\n\nA great gel should be the final step in your routine — applied on top of a[ leave-in conditioner for curly hair ](https://zaphiranature.com/products/hydrating-detangling-conditioner)or [curl cream](https://zaphiranature.com/products/curl-defining-cream) to seal in hydration and provide structure for your style.\n\n# ✅ What to Avoid in Curly Hair Gels\n\nNot all gels are curl-friendly. Here’s what you should avoid:\n\n* **Alcohol-based gels**: These can dry out curls and lead to breakage.\n* **Heavy silicones**: They may coat your hair and block moisture over time.\n* **Synthetic fragrances**: These can cause irritation, especially on sensitive scalps.\n\nInstead, stick to natural, curl-safe ingredients that work with your hair’s needs, not against them.\n\n# 🔍 Application Tips from Curl Experts\n\nTo get the best out of your gel:\n\n* Always apply it to **wet hair**.\n* “Rake and scrunch” the product through sections for even distribution.\n* Let curls air-dry or diffuse on low heat.\n* Once dry, **scrunch out the crunch** (SOTC) to break the cast and reveal soft, defined curls.\n\n# 🌿 Recommended: Zaphira Nature’s Curl Defining Gel\n\nIf you’re in the UAE and searching for a salon-quality, hydrating curl gel, look no further than **Zaphira Nature’s** [**Curl Defining Gel**](https://zaphiranature.com/products/curl-activating-jelly).\n\n🧪 **Why It Stands Out:**\n\n* **Aloe vera & flaxseed extract**: Offers a natural hold and shine.\n* **Hydrolyzed silk protein**: Strengthens and protects curls from frizz.\n* **Vitamin B5**: Adds softness and elasticity.\n* **Zero alcohol or harsh chemicals**: Perfect for even the most sensitive scalps.\n\nUnlike many commercial gels, this formula keeps curls defined for 48+ hours without stiffness or residue, and it smells naturally clean, not overly perfumed. It's especially effective in the UAE humidity, where many gels either melt or dry out curls.\n\n🛍️ Available online [via Zaphira Nature UAE](https://zaphiranature.com/collections/all), this gel works beautifully when paired with the brand’s leave-in conditioner or curl cream for an elevated curl routine.\n\n# 💡 Final Tip from the Pros:\n\n“Layer your products smartly — use a leave-in to moisturize, then seal with gel. That’s the magic combo for long-lasting, frizz-free curls.”\n\nWhether you’re heading to the office or out in the desert heat, having the **best curly hair gel** in your routine can be a game-changer. Try it for a week — and let your curls do the talking. ✨",

Usually, hair products contain natural ingredients that are best suited to include the nourishment & additional support that your scalp requires.

As a result, the most required oil has one of most ingredients that help maintain hair.\n\n**2**. **Hair Color**\n\nIf the items are not suited for your type of hair, these will not function. You must first identify the style of your scalp.  This should make you aware of the situation of your hair & scalp.  For example, a hair oil designed for an oily scalp could be used on the dry scalp. However, it'll have the reverse effect and might cause additional damage to your hair. This is one of the important point to keep noticed.\n\n**3**. **Spending Plan**\n\nYour budget is the essential aspect of all. Perhaps the very first point you should think about before beginning your review. Variation and better, fresher alternatives emerged with technological progress. However, with more factors comes a higher price. You may always start by narrowing down your selections based on your budget and then seek items. A lower price does not necessarily imply ineffectiveness. However, it may offer fewer features than other products. You may establish a budget and look for choices within it.\n\nThe list is unlimited, but the examples above should indicate what you can expect. This contains all of the critical variables you must consider before deciding on the final result.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe conducted an extensive study on the items and also have produced these types of items available. There are several choices available, but you must consider a few factors before buying a product. The mentioned elements decide the best products for yourself & the one which will best fit you. If you ever do not examine the criteria listed above, your purchase will be in vain.\n\nIt is also critical to keep your hairstyle with natural treatments.

    "body": "I'm hoping that someone can answer this question for me.  \n\nWhy is hydrolyzed keratin and other proteins in hair styling products which can cause protein overload as it builds up over time?  I understand having protein in a rinse out conditioning treatment, but to have keratin and/or other proteins in the WHOLE product line (leave-in, moisturizer, blow-dry/heat protectant spray, serum/oil, gel, and etc.) seems like overkill.  Also, unless one is searching for this exact question, the information about keratin is mostly \"good\" and when one does search for this, the damage has already been done (speaking from experience).  Take for instance, I have natural curly/coily (3c/4a) hair and decided to use Chi brand products (Infra, Keratin, Argan, Aloe, and Luxury Black Seed) in rotation.  I may straighten my hair once per year (I used the Chi Keratin line for this), if that, otherwise, I was using the Luxury Black Seed or the Argan, unless I use a demi-permanent color (every 3 months) then I would used the Infra line.  I did a mini-chop after 13 months of transitioning my hair back in October 2022. At first, my hair was loving these products with the rotation, but after several months, I noticed that my hair was becoming extremely dry and brittle, feeling like straw.  I then switch to different \"hydrating\" brands like Moroccanoil, Biolage, and etc., but none of those helped.  I've even tried clarifying several times as well as using bentonite clay treatments, which didn't help.  The damage is done now.  \n\nToday, my hair is more balanced now that I've realized this and cut keratin out completely and protein from my hair regimen for now, with the exception of the occasional 'hydrolyzed silk' being in finishing hair oil/serum.  So, going back to my original question, why is keratin and other proteins in the whole product line when it can cause damage due to keratin/protein buildup? Why not just have it in the conditioner only? I am genuinely confused by this, especially with trusted hair brands (Chi is not the only brand that does this).",

I do agree though that it can be confusing and damaging to someone who's not clued in the whole protein/moisture balance. Now that I think about it I think I only ever used one line before and it was actually a line that had a clarifying shampoo, protein rich conditioner and as a third step a moisturizing conditioner and it was way before I've learnt anything about protein/moisture stuff.",

    "body": "Hi friends!  I am thinking of making my own shampoo bar to deal with allergies since I am nervous about trying industrial products that contain many ingredients.  So I did some research and have decided that due to my inexperience with formulations and production, I would be best off starting with shampoo bars. I started with this formula as a base: [Soapmaid SCI Shampoo Bar](https://www.soapmaid.com/blogs/news/crafting-your-own-luxurious-shampoo-bars-with-sodium-cocoyl-isethionate-a-diy-recipe-guide)\n\nI decided that I don't want so many oils sitting around the house so I have modified the recipe to just use 3 I have at home:\n\n* 100g Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate (SCI) powder\n* 20g Coconut Oil\n* 20g Sunflower Seed Oil\n* 19.5g Jojoba Oil\n* 0.5g Vitamin E Acetate\n* 20g Distilled Water and/or hydrolyzed proteins and/or aloe vera\n\nFor the water, I was thinking that I could substitute some of the following: hydrolyzed silk,  hydrolyzed elastin (vegan), hydrolyzed collagen (vegan), keratin (vegan), aloe vera.  \n\nI have the following questions:\n\n1.  Collagen, elastin, and keratin are normally animal derived.  The ones for sale at my local shop are plant (soy) derived.  Are these worth using or are they useless since they are simulated from soy?\n\n2. According to [this page](https://www.makingcosmetics.com/blog-15.html?lang=en_US) at Making Cosmetics, only keratin shows up as useful in haircare formulations even though I have seen industrial shampoos marketed with silk, collagen, and aloe vera.  Are elastin, silk, and collagen worth using?\n\n3.  Since I am substituting water based protein mixtures, do I need to add a preservative?  \n\n  \nThank you so much for your help!",

        "body": "Stop using ChatGPT to make a formula. It's always wrong. It will probably never be correct. \n\nHere are just a few of the problems:\n\n1. There's no actual heat protectant present. Most products use some kind of polymeric protectant that helps prevent visible damage from heat. Methacrylate copolymers and PVP are pretty common and can help. \n2. The purpose of the alcohol is to help it evaporate quicker. Many of these use agents to build pressure so you can spray the product. It isn't required, but the alcohol is a strange and unnecessary thing to add. Especially if it's at such a low percentage. It's ability to keep things solvated seems small. \n3. Silica, alumina, and titanium dioxide are really strange things to add. They'll act as colorants and dispersants, but they don't serve a function of getting the hair to be protected from heat like that. \n\nWhat you're actually making is a weird lotion that I wouldn't use as a heat protectant at all. This is a seriously difficult thing to formulate as you'll need to test it for efficacy and you might be giving yourself a false sense of security.",

        "body": "This formula does not make sense. I'm gonna break down why so that you can make a heat protectant that makes sense. \n\n\\*It will be crazy expensive to buy all those ingreidents, you're better off with your $7 bottle of CHI. I don't even know if you can get all of them from DIY suppliers. \n\n\\*There's literally nothing in there that needs to be heated to 70C. The alcohol will flash off when heated to 70C, so it won't even be in your formula by the time you're done. Why is it being added before heating? \n\n\\*There are way too many presevratives. 1% phenoxyethanol AND 1% hexylene glycol AND 1% caprylyl glycol? CHI is probably using a blend of those three that TOGEHTER are 1-1.5% of the total formula. I'm not even sure the system can hold that much preservative as none of them are that water soluble. I guess that's what the polysorbate 20 is for? But if so, why isn't the phenoxyethanol included in the P20 premix?\n\n\\*Silica, alumina, and titanium dioxide are all particulates that need to be suspended. There is nothing in this formula that provides suspension. These items will sink to the bottom and likely stick together in a big clump. They have no reason to be here. If they're all on your bottle of CHI, it's probably a highly specific material where one/all of them are being used as substrates for another ingredient. If you source them all individually they will not work the same.\n\n\\*Titanium dioxide is a colorant. That's why it has a CI number--CI numbners are for pigments and colorants like iron oxides, carmine, etc. 3% titanium dioxide will leave your hair looking dusty and white. There are nano grades of titanium dioxide that have better transparency, but those are used as sunscreens and also are not 100% transparent. Sunscreens are not the same as heat protectants, as they screen out two different parts of the light spectrum. \n\n\\*Why is it asking you to adjust the pH of a hair spray to the pH of skin? pH of hair products is typically more acidic than skin products, around 4-5. \n\n\\*I'm assuming the CHI product is fragranced. PPG-20 Methyl Glucose Ether is likely in there as a fragrance fixative. It has other properties, such as being a humectant, but is not necessary for the purpose of a hair protectant when you already have propanediol. It can also reduce the tackniess of a product, but tackiness can be reduced by just using less of the ingredients that cause the tackiness in the first place (like polysorbate 20, other humectants, hydrolyzed silk proteins, etc). \n\n\\*Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is your main heat protecting ingredient. It is the only thing in the formula, other than the humectants, that is actually doing anything for your hair. There is so much filler here it's unreal. \n\n\\*Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is anionic. Cocodimonium Hydroxypropyl Hydrolyzed Keratin is cationic. The two will likely react to precipitate out. There goes your heat protection and your fancy keratin (and all the money you spent on both). CHI is probably either using the keratin ingredient at a veryyyy low level (0.01% or less) OR is using a homogenizer to break down the particle size of the precipitate and possibly filtering it out. Or both. \n\n\\*No brand has ever used 1% silk and 2% quaternized keratin in a product and sold it for $7. Those are expensive ingredients. \n\nHere's the outline of a formula that actually makes sense:\n\nWater QS to 100%\n\nSodium polystyrene sulfonate -- not sure about how much of this, you'll need to do some research on appropriate use level for heat protection. \n\nEuxyl PE 9010 1% -- as a phenoxyethanol preservative, or you can use another or  suitable preservative at the appropriate use level.\n\nPropanediol 2-4% -- as a humectant\n\nPotassium sorbate OR caprylyl glycol, either at 0.2% -- as a co-preservative (you only need 1! potassium sorbate is way cheaper and easier to work with.)\n\nHydrolyzed silk blend if you want it, use level completely up to you (CHI probably has it at like 0.5% or less)\n\nAlcohol Denat. 5-10% -- added at the end in order to make the spray dry faster on your hair. It can also be omitted. More alcohol = faster drydown. This part is completely up to your preference. \n\nCitric acid -- QS to adjust pH to 4-5.\n\nThat's it. No silica titanium dioxide or anything, since it's unlikely to work the same in a DIY formula. \n\nInstructions: Sanitize all equipment and work area. Add ingredients to your beaker in the order provided, mixing well between each addition The sodium polystyrene sulfonate is a powder and will take some time to go in, just let it mix for a while. The phenoxyethanol preservative is the same, keep mixing until all it's blobs go in. If it's not going in you can premix it into 0.5-1% polysorbate 20, but try without first. The propanediol should help to solubilize it as well. Don't heat anything, just simple mixing should do the trick.",

    "body": "[SH-RD Protein Cream](https://www.shrdindia.com/collections/protein-cream): The Best Hair Protein Cream for Damaged Hair Restoration\n\n\n\nIn the world of hair care, few products have earned as loyal a following as [SH-RD Protein Cream](http://shrdindia.com). Known as one of the [best hair protein creams](https://www.shrdindia.com/pages/best-hair-protein-cream-for-damaged-hair-restoration), this revolutionary treatment has become a go-to solution for individuals dealing with dry, damaged, or chemically-treated hair. Whether you're a salon professional or a beauty-conscious consumer, SH-RD offers the protein-rich nourishment your hair craves.\n\nBut what makes SH-RD Protein Cream stand out in the crowded landscape of hair treatments? And how can this product help people searching for the best way to **repair and protect hair** from daily stressors?\n\nLet’s explore the key benefits, ingredients, and use cases of SH-RD Protein Cream, along with real-world results that make it a top-ranking choice on **Google** and in the beauty industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n# What Is SH-RD Protein Cream?\n\nSH-RD Protein Cream is a **leave-in hair treatment** developed by Taiwanese dermatological brand Shaan Honq. \"SH\" stands for the company name, and \"RD\" stands for **Rosemary and D-panthenol**, two of the product’s core ingredients. This cream is enriched with a blend of **silk protein complex**, **vitamin B5 (panthenol)**, and **sunflower seed extract**, providing both deep nourishment and protective benefits for all hair types, especially **damaged, over-processed, or color-treated hair**.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Who Is It For? (Target Audience)\n\nSH-RD Protein Cream is ideal for:\n\n* Individuals with **chemically treated or heat-damaged hair**  \n* Salon professionals looking for a **reliable post-treatment conditioner**  \n* Men and women facing **dryness, frizz, or split ends**  \n* People exposed to **UV rays, pollution, and saltwater**  \n* Those who frequently use flat irons, curling wands, or hair dryers  \n\nIf your hair is lifeless, brittle, or prone to breakage, this product is specifically designed for **you**.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Why SH-RD Is Considered the Best Hair Protein Cream\n\n# 1. Replenishes Protein Loss\n\nHair is made primarily of keratin protein. Chemical treatments, sun exposure, and heat tools can strip away these proteins, weakening the hair shaft. SH-RD replenishes this protein loss with **hydrolyzed silk protein**, restoring strength and elasticity.\n\n✅ **Example**: A customer with platinum-blonde hair reported a 50% reduction in breakage within two weeks of regular use, thanks to the fortifying action of silk protein.\n\n# 2. Deep Moisturization Without Greasiness\n\nUnlike many creams that leave hair oily or heavy, SH-RD offers a **weightless finish**. It absorbs quickly and seals moisture into the cuticle, leaving hair **smooth, shiny, and manageable**.\n\n✅ **Example**: After daily application on towel-dried hair, users noticed silkier texture without limpness or residue—making it ideal even for fine or thin hair types.\n\n# 3. UV & Heat Protection\n\nSun damage and styling tools are leading causes of hair dullness and dryness. SH-RD acts as a **protective barrier**, shielding hair from **UV rays, chlorine, and thermal damage**.\n\n✅ **Supporting Evidence**: The product contains **sunflower seed extract**, a natural UV filter that reduces oxidative stress and color fading.\n\n# 4. Split-End Prevention & Repair\n\nThe nourishing cream forms a **cuticle-sealing film** that helps reduce split ends and frizz, leading to smoother ends and less tangling.\n\n✅ **Real Feedback**: A professional stylist noted that clients using SH-RD between salon visits returned with 30% fewer split ends, reducing the need for frequent trims.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n# How to Use SH-RD Protein Cream\n\n1. **Apply a pea-sized amount** to clean, towel-dried hair.  \n2. Distribute evenly from mid-length to ends (avoid scalp for oily-prone hair).  \n3. Style as desired—no rinsing required.  \n\nPro Tip: For extra damage control, use it as a heat protectant before blow-drying or straightening.\n\n\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nHair damage is inevitable in today’s fast-paced, style-conscious world. From heat styling and color treatments to environmental exposure, your hair needs more than just shampoo and conditioner. **SH-RD Protein Cream is the ultimate solution**—an all-in-one product that **repairs, protects, and beautifies** your hair from the inside out.\n\nWhether you're recovering from bleach damage or simply want to maintain healthy, glossy strands, **this protein cream is worth the investment**.\n\n**Try SH-RD today and discover why it's the best hair protein cream on the market.**\n\n",

    "body": "Okay, so hear me out — I never thought I’d be raving about *nail polish remover*, of all things. But after years of using harsh removers that left my nails dry, brittle, and crying for help, I finally tried the [Cutex Strength Shield Nail Polish Remover](https://amzn.to/43fey5L)… and it changed the game for my at-home nail care routine.\n\n# 🧴 What Makes It Different?\n\nMost nail polish removers? They get the job done but leave your nails feeling like sandpaper. The Cutex Strength Shield formula is totally different. It’s **infused with Vitamin E, Pro-Vitamin B5, and Hydrolyzed Silk**, which means it *actually nourishes your nails while removing polish*. Yep — you can wipe off your chipped color and end up with [healthier-looking nails](https://amzn.to/43fey5L) than before.\n\nIf you’re someone who loves to do your own nails (gels, acrylics, or regular polish), this stuff is a legit lifesaver. It doesn’t strip your nails or leave that chalky, dried-out look. Instead, they feel smooth, clean, and way more hydrated.\n\n# 💡 Real Talk: My Results\n\nAfter about a month of using Cutex Strength Shield exclusively, I noticed:\n\n* Less peeling and breakage\n* My nails *actually grew* instead of constantly splitting\n* No more harsh chemical smell (it's still acetone-based, but way less intense)\n* It even works well on stubborn polish layers\n\nI used to dread removing polish because I knew it meant damage. Now? It's just another step in my self-care routine that feels like... actual *care*.\n\n[Cutex Strength Shield Nail Polish Remover](https://preview.redd.it/nvy47kdxgb3f1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d0be90997e9ba36f676845cb6aa91608ab35955)\n\n# 🛒 Where to Buy It?\n\nI found mine on Amazon [Cutex Strength Shield Nail Polish Remover](https://amzn.to/43fey5L), but it’s also available at most drugstores. The 6.7 fl oz bottle lasts a while, and it’s super affordable — definitely a bang-for-your-buck type of product.\n\n# 🧴 Final Thoughts\n\nIf you’re tired of polish removers that wreck your nails, **Cutex Strength Shield** is 100% worth the switch. Whether you’re doing weekly manis or just touch-ups here and there, it helps keep your nails strong, smooth, and way less stressed.\n\n✨ Clean polish removal + nail health = YES PLEASE.\n\n# 🧠 TL;DR\n\n* **What it is:** Cutex Strength Shield Nail Polish Remover (6.7 fl oz)\n* **Why it’s awesome:** Infused with Vitamin E, B5, and Hydrolyzed Silk\n* **What it does:** Gently removes polish *and* strengthens nails\n* **Best for:** Dry, brittle, or weak nails after frequent polish use\n\n#  Keywords 😉 :\n\n[Best nail polish remover for healthy nails](https://amzn.to/43fey5L), [Cutex Strength Shield review](https://amzn.to/43fey5L), **vitamin-infused nail remover**, [how to remove polish without damaging nails](https://amzn.to/43fey5L), [moisturizing nail polish remover](https://amzn.to/43fey5L)",

Had to switch to baby shampoo and medicated shampoo to get it somewhat under control.\n\nSo... experiment. Maybe another product from that brand works better for you, maybe you need to try something different.",
