    "body": "Naisipan kong dumaan sa Watsons ngayong araw para bumili ng lotion, dahil paubos na yung ginagamit ko. Nakita ko tong lotion na 'to ng Luxe Organix na naka B1T1 for Php 405, kaya naisipan kong subukan. 2 variant yung binili ko, itong Retinol + Gluta, tsaka yung Niacinamide + Arbutin. \n\nTLDR:\n\nMay microfoaming, malakas ang fragrance, heavier skin feel kumpara sa ibang serum lotions sa Market, mali-mali ang IL, mislabeled dahil imbes na retinol, Retinyl Palmitate ang laman base sa IL. \n\nUnahin muna nating tingnan ang packaging. Sa unang tingin, di nalalayo material sa packaging ng mga serum lotion ng Vaseline. Tho, yung sa Vaseline, rounded yung tabas ng seal ng tube sa both sides, samantalang itong sa LO ay pointed. \n\nSa itsura naman mismo ng laman, off-white na medyo madilaw yung kulay ng lotion. Medyo clumpy din yung itsura pagkalabas nito sa tube, at madali ding mag-break yung emulsion upon skin contact. Malakas yung fragrance nya na dominated ng floral notes. Unang naisip ko nga nung naamoy ko e amoy poon, dahil sa sobrang floral. \n\nMedyo matagal ipahid sa balat, kumpara sa ibang serum lotion na nasubukan ko na. Naka-observe din ako ng microfoaming during application nitong lotion. Ang microfoaming ito yung nagkakaroon ng puti-puting streaks sa balat habang pinapahid ang isang product, kadalasan mga emulsion gaya ng lotion at creams. Ang microfoaming ay dulot ng pagkaka-trap ng air sa product habang ipinapahid sa balat. Kung ikukumpara ko ito sa ibang serum lotion na nagamit ko na (Vaseline Gluta-Hya Serum Burst Lotion, Smoochkins Nia-Arbutin Nano White Serum Lotion), ito yung pinaka heavy ang skin feel. Hindi ko masyadong na-feel yung pagka serum lotion. And lastly naka-experience din ako ng pamumula at pantal sa braso ko after ko gamitin itong lotion na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list. \n\nWater (Aqua), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Myristate, Fragrance, C15-19 Alkane, Stearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Triethanolamine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Glutathione, Polysorbate 20, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ceramide NP, Mannitol, Pentylene Glycol, CI19140, Phosphatidylcholine, Retinyl Palmitate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Polyglyceryl-10,  Citric Acid, Tocopherol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nHindi na talaga nawala ang mga errors sa IL ng mga local products. Di yata talaga uso ipa-check man lang sa regulatory personnel ang IL na ilalagay sa final layout ng packaging bago ang ipa-mass printing. Para sa product na ito, hindi Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol ang tamang INCI name, kung hindi Cetearyl Alcohol. Next, Polyglyceryl-10, what? Incomplete yung ingredient name. Ang daming Polyglyceryl-10 esters na nag eexist, wag nyo na kami paghulain. (Side Note: Ang Polyglyceryl-10 esters ay kadalasang ginagamit as non-ionic emulsifier sa cosmetics.). \n\nPangalawa kong napansin, CI19140. Ang CI19140 ay isang dye na kilala din bilang Tartrazine Yellow or FD&C Yellow #5. Ito yung nagbigay ng medyo madilaw na kulay sa lotion na ito. Konektado ito sa kasunod kong punto. \n\nIkatlo, bakit Retinyl Palmitate ang nakalista dito sa IL? Kaya nyo ba nilagyan ng Yellow #5 ang lotion na ito para magmukhang may retinol, kasi nakakapagdulot ng paninilaw sa mga product ang retinol kapag ihinalo ito? Ngayon, ano ba ang problema kung retinyl palmitate ang nakalagay, imbes na retinol? Ito kasi yun: maliban sa obvious na mislabelling sa product na ito, mas mababa ang potency ng retinyl palmitate kaysa sa retinol. Sa buong retinoid family, ang mga retinyl esters kagaya ng retinyl palmitate ang may pinakamababang potency, dahil kailangan pa nito ng isang extra conversion step (retinyl palmitate -> retinol). Tandaan, ang mga retinoids, kailangang ma-convert into retinoic acid para ma-activate ang retinoic acid receptors natin sa balat at makuha ang benefits. \n\nRetinyl esters -> Retinol -> Retinaldehyde -> Retinoic Acid\n\nKada conversion step, bumababa ang potency ng isang retinoid, kaya sa kaso ng retinyl palmitate, na isang retinyl ester, eto ang may pinakamababang potency. \n\nMay peptides din pala itong lotion na ito: Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9 at Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11.\n\nAng acetyl tetrapeptide-9 ay isang signaling peptide na nagbibigay ng message sa fibroblasts sa ating dermis na magproduce ng collagen (specifically Collagen Type 1) at proteoglycans, na mahalaga para mapanatili ang structure at mapanatiling tight (hindi sagging) ang balat natin.  Nakakatulong din itong mabawasan ang appearance ng fine lines sa mukha, dahil na rin sa stimulation ng collagen at proteoglycan production. \n\nKung ang dermis ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, ang epidermis naman ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-11. Kagaya ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, signaling peptide din ito na nagbibigay ng mensahe sa epidermis na mag-synthesize o magproduce ng Syndecan-1 at Collagen XVII. Kapag mataas ang dalawang ito sa balat, nag-iimprove ang elasticity ng balat. \n\nKaramihan ng mga nabanggit na benepisyo ng dalawang peptides na ito ay base pa lamang sa mga in-vitro studies na naisagawa na. Wala pang gaanong in-vivo clinical studies na lumabas kaya medyo skeptical pa din ako sa mga peptides na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo lastly sa product claims. \n\n* Retinol + Gluta\n\n* Whitening Serum Lotion\n\n* Lightening\n\n* Firming\n\n* Hydrating\n\n* 24 hr Supple Smooth\n\n* 3X Peptide Youth Repair + Hyaluronic Bright + Ceramide Glow\n\nUnang claim pa lang, sablay na. Wala namang retinol tong lotion na 'to. Pinaglololoko ako nitong LO e. \n\nSa claim na lightening at whitening, medyo duda ako. Mukhang glutathione lang ang pwedeng masabi ng brand na ito na skin lightening ingredient. Pero duda ako sa efficacy ng glutathione na makapagpa lighten ng skin topically. Maraming limitations yung mga published studies tungkol sa efficacy ng topically applied gluta, gaya ng mababang bilang ng participants sa studies at sobrang iksi na study period. \n\nSa claim na firming, mukhang inilagay ito gawa nung mga peptides. Sa hydrating claim, meron namang hydrating ingredients (glycerin, hyaluronic acid derivatives, olive oil, Plukenetia Volubilis oil, tsaka Ceramide NP). Same din dun sa mga sumunod na claims, dahil sa presence ng mga nabanggit na ingredients. \n\n\nFinal words:\n\nHindi ako masaya sa nabili kong lotion na 'to. Hindi kasing lightweight at fast absorbing nung iba kong nasubukan na serum lotions. Amoy poon yung fragrance. May microfoaming during application. Nagkapantal ako sa braso. Mali-mali ang IL. Pero yung pinaka disappointing sa lotion na 'to e yung claim na may retinol daw, pero retinyl palmitate lang ang nasa ingredient list. May paglalagay pa ng yellow dye para magmukhang may retinol. Napakalaking red flag para sa akin ang pagmi-mislabel ng product.\n\nAyun lang. Salamat sa pagbabasa. At laging maging mapanuri sa mga binibili at balak nating gamitin na products. \n\n",

Yellow dye appears to have been added to the lotion to give the appearance of fully evolved retinol being an ingredient as retinol usually makes creams look yellow.\n* The peptides used claim to target fine lines and elasticity, but only proven by in-vitro studies (i.e. in controlled lab environments) vs. in-vivo (i.e. on living organisms)\n\nThank you for this in-depth review, skincare\\_chemist19!

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

    "body": "Hello! After struggling for so long to find moisturizers for my extremely clog-prone skin that cannot handle fatty alcohols, I've created a list of moisturizers that are least likely to break out acne-prone skin out based on the lack of common pore-clogging ingredients and ingredients many want to stay away from just in case.\n\nProducts listed have NONE of the following ingredients:\n- cetearyl alcohol\n- cetyl alcohol\n- stearyl alcohol\n- myristyl alcohol\n- oleyl alcohol\n- cereareth-20\n- shea butter\n- mineral oil\n- petroleum\n- plant oils with comedogenic rating >1\n\nProducts are divided between fungal acne safe and unsafe. All products show whether or not they have silicones, too. \n\nNone of these products have ingredients with a comedogenic rating over 1, except some do contain tocopherol as the last or near last ingredient. The amount is so minimal that it's not likely to cause clogging. Still, *please note that comedogenic ratings are not the basis for how your skin will react!!!* Some of these products may break you out, just like some products with ingredients with higher comedogenic ratings may not break you out. Check all product ingredients before purchasing to check for your sensitivities!\n\nSo far, the list includes 57 moisturizers. If you know of any more or see a mistake I've made, please comment! I will update this list accordingly.\n\nThanks!\n\n[Link to spreadsheet is here!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dQy_YKHMEd8Nfhsr32wUMql6o4TuO9CnRNWyli8kLIA/edit?usp=sharing)\n",

Acne prone. Daily Tretinoin use. \n \nREVIEW:\nI got this a few days ago and am very pleased with it so far. It replaced my Pyunkang yul ato cream blue label in the tube. The packaging is very sleek hard plastic and the wording is imprinted on the outside-they say this is to make it easier to recycle and save from extra plastic labeling. I have also used the gel cream and this is really night and day and not comparable at all imo. It comes in a pump bottle and pumps about a pea size each. I use 2 pumps for my whole face and neck. I struggle with very dry skin that is dry in the morning if I don’t use a very thick moisturizer at night. This keeps my face dewy and moist all night. It’s not thick like a shea butter cream and it spreads very easily. It smells exactly like oats like if you get a handful of ground oats and smell it, that’s what this smells like. It leaves a nice glow but not a greasy finish. My hair doesn’t stick to my face when I use this if that makes sense. It’s a great price point the bottle is bigger than it looks the photos. \n\nThis is my first time doing a review so let me know if I missed something and I’m also happy to answer any questions!",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

        "body": "My Mom had subtype 3, with thickened skin. She had it really badly her whole life. I have some rosacea but have done my best to try to not wind up like her.  Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

    "body": "Edit: title should be fatty alcohols not fatty acids but autocorrect thinks for me and sees me type acids a lot so naturally I must’ve meant acids. SIGH. \n\n**WARNING: LONG BUT I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE IT WORTH.**\n\nHey all!\n\nSoooo, years ago, I was a big advocate for the [idea that some people cannot use fatty alcohols](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1y3ql7/simple_tip_for_those_of_us_who_cant_use_fatty/). This was due to my experiences with CeraVe Cream, CeraVe Lotion, Cetaphil Cream, and Cetaphil Lotion, primarily. More, I was using Ziana (.025% tretinoin + clindamycin), which I have a strong suspicion in retrospect was the cause of a form of folliculitis for me (perhaps chemical folliculitis -- there are several types of folliculitis but in this case, acne that is not \"acne,\" but rather born of continuous irritation of the hair follicles). Of course, like *everyone* going through acne, I blamed every skin product I was using except the prescription active that was *designed* to make my acne better. After all, a doctor gave it to me, and a doctor wouldn't give me something that would make me \"sicker.\" \n\nUnfortunately, it turns out that by the time I started to figure this out, it was all way too late. To this day, I have light pitted scarring in places from an 8 month moderate-to-severe zit explosion on my face that never ceased. It has taught me a lot and pressed me to learn a lot about how skin *actually* functions. I was told the entire time I was breaking out that it was just \"purging,\" only to realize what a misnomer \"purging\" kind of is -- implying the skin is holding onto infections waiting to churn out of it's layers rather than comedones -- open or closed -- that are visible, as well as microcomedones that are the beginning of an acne spot but invisible to the naked eye. At the time, purging to me implied that there were acne spots in the deeper layers of my skin waiting to come out. \n\nSo in the process of me flailing, I felt like this class of ingredients that are otherwise harmless were my bane: fatty alcohols. These are stearyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, and cetyl alcohol. After all, they turned up in *everything* that was breaking me out, including the cleansers, so surely it had to be them, right? \n\nFor example, at one point, I was using Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser + CeraVe Cream. What do these products have in common?\n\n**Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser**\n&amp;gt; Water, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, **Stearyl Alcohol**, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben.\n\n**CeraVe Cream**\n&amp;gt;Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20 And **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauryl Lactylate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n\n---\n\nSo being the ingredient hound I am, I connected the dots to \"must be fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives.\" After all, everything else I used had had these ingredients too.\n\n**CeraVe Lotion**\n&amp;gt; Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceteareth-20 and** Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\n**Cetaphil Cream**\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Petrolatum, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, PEG-30 Stearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Propylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n**Cetaphil Lotion** *note - I believe this used to have macadamia nut oil in it when I used it and has since been reformulated. \n\n&amp;gt; Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ceteareth-20, **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Dimethicone, Sodium Levulinate, Sodium Anisate,Caprylyl Glycol, Benzyl Alcohol, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer\n\nHappy, I thought, \"This must be it! I solved it!\" So I cut out fatty alcohol products (which, as I am sure many of you know, is a *massive* pain in the ass) and [tried to facilitate others in doing the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ufvym/megalisting_products_without_cetylcetearylstearyl/). In fact, I feel like I was the primary champion of \"it might be fatty alcohols!\" back when this sub was only 25k people, and being as we were all learning from eachother and trusted eachother, many people trusted me in that assumption. After all, I had the proof (supposedly) to back it up.\n\nSo I used the lightest products, such as EltaMD PM (which is a wonderful product, don't get me wrong!). Unfortunately, my skin was parched *all of the time.* It was just sick. It kept breaking out for years after, bottle after bottle of EltaMD PM. Life happened, I was removed from the mod group for inactivity, and I just kept on with it - disappearing from this sub for a long-ass time.\n\nAnd then I started thinking... *what did I use before my skin started down this road?*\n\nBefore I knew jack-all about skin, I used Olay pretty religiously. Olay Regenerist, in the pot, with the fragrance. Yep. This stuff:\n\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Isohexadecane, Niacinamide, Isopropyl Isostearate, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Nylon-12, Dimethicone, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Sodium Peg-7 Olive Oil Carboxylate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ceratonia Siliqua (Carob) Fruit Extract, ** Stearyl Alcohol**, Polyethylene, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Dimethiconol, Polyacrylamide, Fragrance, Peg-100 Stearate, Propylparaben, Cetearyl Glucoside, **Cetearyl Alcohol,** C13-14 Isoparaffin, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, C12-13 Pareth-3, Laureth-7, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica.\n\n*\"[Wait a fucking minute](https://media.giphy.com/media/iAYupOdWXQy5a4nVGk/giphy.gif),\"* she thought. \"That shit has cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol and coconut derivatives all the shit I am avoiding. How the fuck did my face not explode then?\"\n\nSo I did something insane: I tried a cream with fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives that was being recommended on this sub at the time (lol). Some of you may recognize this:\n\n**Cheryl Lee MD Ceramide+**\n&amp;gt;Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Coconut), Petrolatum, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Polyglyceryl -10 Pentastearate, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Isostearyl Isostearate, Cetyl Alcohol, 1,3 Propanediol (from Corn), C10-30 Cholesterol/Lanosterol Esters, Ceramide 3, Phytosphingosine, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Niacinamide, Glycyrrhetinic Acid (Licorice Root), 1,2 -Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Gluconolactone.\n\nAnd you want to know something?\n\n90% of my acne healed in a week. 90% of the acne that had been causing me scars and *ruining my fucking life for years* healed in a fucking **week**. I looked back at all the ingredients for all the products that I had avoided and all the ones I had just been able to use fine as a teenager and by fucking god, what did I miss? **Ceteareth-fucking-20** (sans the cleansers -- I still don't know why my skin hated Cetaphil Gentle, but it turns out that it has broken out with every creamy, non-sudsy cleanser ever, so I've resigned myself to using gentle SLES cleansers for life).\n\nI felt like such a massive asshole. \n\nSo that brings me to now, when I decided on a train on a vacation in NYC to start a skin blog. I had spent those years researching my ass off about skin not to even see what a massive fuckup I had made. I had been able to help my BF bring his eczema 80% into control with bleach bath washes and solve my mom's chronically dry skin and my friend's weird case of eczema on his ring finger, but not my own skin. \n\nI came back to this sub after ~5 fucking years (4 of them AFK) and I still see a lot of people avoiding *all fatty alcohols*. I'm making this post to tell you that it might not be all fatty alcohols. It may be cet-20, like me, or it may be those fatty alcohols in combination with other ingredients (combinations of some ingredients can change molecular sizes, some manufacturers use different sources or molecular sized products, like larger or smaller hyaluronic acid, for example). There's so much complexity with skincare, skin, and ingredients that it usually isn't *one whole class of ingredients*. In short: **your mileage may vary**. This is why spot testing is important, one product isn't for everyone, and while ingredient labels are important for weeding out culprits, you also need to do a bit of research on how ingredients work with others to change how they interact on the skin. \n\nSince then, I've spot tested many of the products I flat-out ruled out and 1. it turns out everything with cet-20 does explode my face, 2. it turns out macadamia nut oil also explodes my face (in the cet lotion), and 3. turns out I can use 50% of the things I thought I couldn't (like jojoba oil!).\n\nI'm so happy that many of you have found this sub educational, but **please** consider what you've used in the past (skincare for face, makeup, EVERYTHING) and don't neglect those products when cross-identifying culprits. It changed my life and it might change yours.\n\nSome takeaways, with bullet points because I love bullet points:\n\n* Don't rule out entire classes of ingredients. Skin is super individual and it may be one stupid ingredient.\n* Don't take all of your skincare advice from the Internet, and if you do, try to diversify. Reddit, acne.org, MakeupAlley, medical journals -- get in there and become your own advocate.\n* Sometimes, skin is just an asshole and you won't be able to figure out what it hates. Example: My skin has issues with CeraVe healing ointment and foaming wash, despite them lacking cet-20. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n* Sometimes, what is considered \"good\" or \"best\" for skin isn't good or best for your skin. Example for me: creamy cleansers. They're definitely recommended *everywhere* for *every* skin condition, esp rosacea (which I have), but my skin fucking loathes them all. No idea why, and that's okay.\n* Just because an ingredient is \"good\" for skin doesn't mean it is good for your skin. Example: Me and high % niacinamide = zits. Me and low % niacinamide = k.\n* Just because it's a prescription doesn't mean it can't fuck you up, fam. I thought prescription = good, no problems here, won't cause issues. I have literal scars to prove me wrong. Instead of assuming all is well, **TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR IF SHIT IS UP AND IF YOUR DOCTOR IS LIKE HEY SHIT IS FINE BUT YOU STILL THINK SHIT IS FUCKED, GO TO ANOTHER DOCTOR**. I wish I had done this. Instead, my doc kept urging me to use it every single night. Went to a new doc and he was like, \"Oh no, your skin is very sensitive, that is wayyyy too harsh.\" Listen to your gut.\n* Almost alll skin rules are more like guidelines (except the baking soda, lemon juice, harsh harsh scrubs stuff - that's all still true since they can all throw your skin very out of whack). Example: I do better with light physical exfoliation once a week than AHA any day.\n\nThanks, and I'm sorry for being such a massive, incorrect asshole. I'm doing my best to correct my errors now (and hopefully go to esthetics school though BF is pushing me to do dermatology).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",

There needs to be someone on the medical side who can vouch for us not being complete loons about our skin. \n\nYes I have to agree with the sentiment of your post.... over the last few years my skin has been freaking out over every little thing. Too hot, too cold, aha, bha, B3, HA, phenoxyethanol the list goes on. \n\nFor 7months I used Tretinoin 0.025% and built up slowly (I thought), the purge happened. Traumatic. Then just unhappy skin.... but it is gold standard for my issues right? My face said no. \n\nAfter becoming ill last year, severely for 6+ months, all skincare and Tret use went down the drain. Just SS once a day, used as moisturiser. Rarely even washed my face in the evening I was too exhausted. \n\nWhat this did, apart from giving me Cc's and what have you. Was a chance for my skin to repair my moisture barrier on my face. Since medication has helped with the symptoms of my illness,  I have been able to use 1 product in my routine with phenoxyethanol as the main preservative, without it giving me painful pustles and nodules everywhere I experienced before. \n\nI have realised that the rash of whiteheads where ever I use a product with HA in and determined was the HA also happens with high levels of BG. So now planning to test a large molecular weight HA serum to see if I have the same issue without the BG. PG is fine... Propanidol is great. \n\nB3 🤔 causes flushing in my skin. And I'm not really interested in trying again.... \n\nBHA, again let me try again at some point. But method of application might be the issue here. \n\nSo vitamin c seemed out of the lexicon for my skin. I now have a silicone based C vit lined up to trial. \n\nFragerance/ essential oils can still mess me up doh. \n\nMoral of this story for me? Concentrate on keeping healthy skin barrier. The rest comes after.... so cleanse (favourite step), treat (calming, hydrating, emollient and then the acne/PIH target), protect. This approach has been working for me so far.",

    "body": "Over the years, I've grown increasingly frustrated by the hair care advice I've come across. Things never seem to work the way they're supposed to, and people seem to exclusively rely on anecdotes and personal experiences when giving their recommendations, often repeating things they read in a beauty mag or blog where the main goal is often to sell hair product or push dogma.\n\nSo I've done some digging, to learn a little bit about the real chemistry and science behind your hair care products, to dispel some myths and get to the truth of what's going on with your hair.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387693/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4458934/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19467087\n\n#What is hair?\n\n>*Hair is an integrated system with a peculiar chemical and physical behavior. It is a complex structure of several morphological components that act as a unit. The hair shaft of mammals is divided into three main regions: Cuticle, cortex and medulla. The medulla is present in corser hair like grey hair, thick hair and beard hair, and it is absent in fine hair of children. There is more medulla in the coarser hair of Asians than Caucasians. The medulla may be involved in the splitting of hairs since it provides an area of weakness as a pathway for the propagation of cracks along the axis of the fiber.*\n\n>*The cuticle is a chemically resistant region and consists of flap overlapping scales (keratinocytes) like shingles on the roof. The shape and orientation of the cuticle cells are responsible for the differential friction effect in hair. The cuticle is generally formed by 6–8 scales thick for Asians, slightly less in Caucasians and even less in African hair. A thinner cuticle layer makes African hair more prone to breakage.*\n\n[Image](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1083/7638/files/Hair-Anatomy-e1421050694589.png?v=1505924657)\n\n\n#Why do we shampoo? Is it necessary?\n\nOver time, your hair will develop a build up of dirt and other pollutants (eg: campfire smoke, minerals from hard water) as well as sebum, sweat and dead/peeled skin.\n\nPrior to the 1930's we simply used bar soap to wash our hair. The issue with this is that it would often leave a residue/soap scum on the scalp and hair, which is uncomfortable and aesthetically unpleasing. Shampoo was the answer.\n\nIn recent years, you may have heard that you don't need to shampoo, and that it causes your hair to produce more oils. This is untrue- there is no evidence to support the claim that using shampoo stimulates production of sebum on the scalp, including shampoos that contain sulfates and silicons.\n\nMost proponents of no-poo substitute shampoo with an alternative such as ACV or a specially formulated conditioner that effectively serves the same purpose.\n\n#How does shampoo work?\n\nThe main active ingredient in shampoo is a type of molecule called a surfacant. This is typically a sulfate, with the most common being Sodium Laureth Sulfate and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. You may have heard that all sulfates do is \"create suds\" and damage your hair, this is incorrect.\n\n>*Residues are nonsoluble fats (sebum) that do not dissolve with water. In order to be removed from the hair shaft, surfactants present a hydrophobic molecular portion, and another hydrophilic. The former will chemically bond with the fat, while the latter will bond with the water. The surfactants are generally composed of a chain of fatty hydrocarbons (tail) and a polar head. The polar extremity is capable of giving this portion of the molecule hydrophilic traits that allow it to dissolve in water and wash away the residues.* \n\nWhat this basically means is that one end of the surfacant will attract water, and the other will repel it and attract sebum, allowing it to be washed out of the hair along with the shampoo.\n\nSurfacants can be classified into four groups: Anionic, cationic, amphoteric and nonionic.\n\n[Here's a classifications chart of common surfacants.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387693/bin/IJT-7-2-g001.jpg) \n\n* **Anionic detergents:** Among the most popular surfactants, they are named for their negatively charged hydrophilic polar group. Derived from fatty alcohols, they are very good at removing sebum from the scalp and hair. However, the excessively cleaned hair is harsh, rough, dull with frizz and prone to tangling. Among them, different classes of detergents are available with certain selective properties.\n 1. **Lauryl sulfates:** Popular primary cleansers, they work well in both hard and soft water, produce rich foam, and are easily rinsed. They are excellent cleansers, commonly used in shampoos for oily hair. As the hair becomes harsh and rough, careful selection of a secondary detergent and possible use of a conditioning agent is always required as part of the shampoo formulation. Examples of this class include: Sodium lauryl sulfate, triethanolamine lauryl sulfate, and ammonium lauryl sulfate\n 2. **Laureth sulfates:** These are another class of excellent detergents with good cleansing ability and foaming property which are useful for normal-to-dry hair. Examples of this chemical class are: Sodium laureth sulfate, triethanolamine laureth sulfate, and ammonium laureth sulfate\n 3. **Sarcosines:** They are generally secondary detergents, as they do not remove sebum well from the hair to justify as primary cleansers. They are listed as the second or third on ingredient list of detergents. Excellent conditioners are used in conditioning shampoos and dry hair shampoos. Examples are: Lauryl sarcosine and sodium lauryl sarcosinate\n 4. **Sulfosuccinates:** These are strong detergents commonly used as a secondary surfactant in oily hair shampoos. Examples are disodium oleaminesulfosuccinate and sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate.\n\n* **Cationic Detergents:** In contrast to anionic detergents they have a positively charged polar group. They are poor cleansers and do not lather well and are not compatible with anionic detergents, limiting their utility. However, they are excellent at imparting softness and manageability to chemically damaged hair and so are primarily used as daily shampoo for damaged hair such as in case of permanently dyed or chemically bleached hair. Examples are: Long-chain amino esters, ammonioesters, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride.\n\n* **Amphoteric Detergents:** Having both positively and negatively charged polar group, they behave differently at lower pH (as cationic detergent) and at higher pH (as anionic detergent). Subgroups include the betaines, sultaines, and imidazolinium derivatives. They are used in baby shampoo and for those with fine and damaged hair because they don’t cause stinging in the eyes in children, foam well and leave hair in manageable state. Examples are: Cocamidopropyl betaine and sodium lauraminopropionate.\n\n* **Nonionic Detergents:** They have no polar group and are among the mildest of all cleansers and aid to improve the antistatic qualities of a shampoo. They can be combined with ionic detergent as a secondary cleanser. Examples are: Polyoxyethylene fatty alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol esters and alkanolamides.\n\nAll shampoos contain some variation or combination of these substances to wash your hair. Some sulfate-free shampoos may contain none, but this means that they are basically not effectively cleansing your hair. (most sulfate free shampoos will simply use a surfacant that doesn't contain the word \"sulfate\", though)\n\nHigh end shampoos from salons contain these same ingredients, with the main difference being perhaps nicer smells and a much stronger concentration that requires dilution in water before use.\n\n#####How often should I shampoo?\n\nYou probably do not need to shampoo every day, and you do not need to go weeks without shampooing. Shampoo your hair when it is oily or dirty. Experiment with different shampoos and take a look at the active chemicals that are doing the heavy lifting. \n\n#The benefit of conditioner\n\nModern shampoos are extremely effective. Unfortunately, heavily cleansed hair is not desirable to most, as it is harsh, hard to manage, prone to tangling, and looks dull.\n\nThe solution to this is a conditioner, which are sometimes included in the shampoo itself. \n\nA conditioner is any substance which is intended to enhance feel, appearance, fullness, lubricity, shine, and general manageability of hair. \n\n>*Conditioner molecules contain cationic surfactant which gives a positive electric charge to the conditioner. The negative charge of the hair is attracted to the positively charged conditioner molecules, which results in conditioner getting deposited on the hair, especially on areas where there is degree of weathering. This is true for damaged hair as they are even more negatively charged. Thus, conditioners reduce the static electricity. They also flatten the cuticle scales over the hair shaft, reducing the friction between hair fibers, increasing the reflectance of light which improves shine and color. The smooth feel resulting from conditioner use gives easier combing and detangling in both wet and dry conditions. Conditioners temporarily seal split ends and mend trichoptilosis.*\n\nConditioners will contain a wide variety of ingredients:\n\n* **Cationic surfactants:** Cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, behentrimonium or propyltrimonium, stearamidopropyl dimethylamine. They are considered the backbone of a conditioner\nPolymers: Mono and polypeptides like hydrolyzed proteins (amino acids), polypeptides derived from collagen and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)\n\n* **Bodying agents and thickeners:** Fatty alcohols (e.g. cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol), waxes (e.g. carnauba wax and paraffin wax), or gums (e.g. guar gum) and salt (sodium chloride)\n\n* **Emollients/oily compounds:** These include natural or synthetic oils, but also esters and waxes. Natural oils used in conditioners are, for example, jojoba oil, olive oil, or grape seed oil. The most frequently used synthetic oils are silicone (e.g. dimethicone, dimethiconol, amodimethicone and cyclomethicone) which are even superior to natural oils in terms of film formation, shine and luster. Asian countries have large hair diameters, therefore a higher concentration of silicone is used as compared to that for Caucasian hair (3-5% vs 0.5%)[1]\n\n* **Auxiliary emulsifiers:** Ethoxylated fatty alcohols (e.g. polysorbate-80 or ceteareth-20) which are non-ionic agents seem to be particularly effective at providing emulsion stability if it cannot be acheived by catiionic agents alone in a conditioner.\n\nThe big bogeyman you may notice is silicons. It is not bad for your hair, and not all silicons are equal. If you use a good shampoo with a good surfacant, build-up is not a concern and you likely don't need to worry too much about this. The backlash against silicons cropped up when people decided to eschew sulfates in their shampoo. Many people quickly realized that without proper cleansing, some silicons would build up in the hair over time.\n\nLike all things related to hair care, the key is balance. A fairly comprehensive resource for different types of silicons and how they behave is [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/) on /r/HairCareScience*, keep this in mind when deciding on which hair product to purchase for your hair.\n\n*while /r/HairCareScience has some good information on it and the moderators know their stuff, be wary of basically every comment from the users, as most of them are simply giving others anecdotal advice and spreading bogeymen.\n\n#How to wash and condition your hair.\n\nThe way you apply these products to your hair is undervalued, and doing it properly may have more benefit than you might suspect.\n\nShampoo should be applied starting from the front and working your way to the back. Applying it directly to the top of the head will create friction and cause tangling. \n\nOnce the shampoo has been rinsed from your hair, it's recommended to gently towel dry your hair before applying the conditioner. Conditioner should be applied on the length of the hair, avoiding the scalp.\n\nLeaving conditioner in your hair is not necessary, once the product has been spread over the surface of your hair it has done its job and may be rinsed out completely.\n\nAfterwards the hair may be gently towel dried. \n\n(If your hair is curly, there may be extra steps such as applying a leave-in product while hair is still wet. Using such products on straight thin hair may result in it looking oily and dull.)\n\n#TL;DR?\n\n* Wash your hair when it's dirty/oily. \n\n* There is no evidence to support the claim that sulfates stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil than normal.\n\n* Sulfates are not bad for your hair, but may cause it to look dry and become hard to manage. \n\n* Use conditioner or use a less effective surfacant to combat the above problem.\n\n* Silicons are not bad for your hair, most good shampoos will prevent any build up from happening.\n\n* The key to good hair care is not going \"no poo\" or \"sulfate/silicon free\", it's finding the right balance of chemicals to wash your hair and keep it looking good. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I believe your statement to be true that sulfates themselves wont stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil. However, washing your hair too often will substantially raise the rate at which your scalp produces oil and thus the rate at which your hair gets greasy. There are two main reasons for this. The first reason is that when you wash your hair and scalp, you'll also inevitably stimulate the skin in that area, creating friction which results in more blood flow that will make the sebaceous glands \"work better\". The second reason is that by washing your hair you'll also remove the oil from your scalp. Leaving your skin in a dry condition. Dry skin will make your sebaceous glands work overtime to fix exactly that problem, as their main function is to lubricate and waterproof your skin. \n\nTldr: Don't wash your hair too often, it will get your hair greasy fast. It can also cause dandruff in the long term by overstimulating the sebaceous glands.\n\nSource: Studied hairdressing and am a barber.",

Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

    "body": "Third in my series aimed at compiling recommendations offered from members of the AB community for addressing common skin concerns. If you missed it, the previous installations of the series can be found here: \n\n1.\t[ROSACEA, REDNESS, and IRRITATION]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4v2uii/best_products_for_common_skin_concerns_series/)\n\n2.\t[OILY SKIN and ACNE]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4vidxl/best_products_for_common_skin_concerns_series/)\n\n\nProducts, tips, or advice that come up frequently will be listed in **bold.** I have grouped everything that's toner -> ampoule since the lines can get kind of blurry in those categories, and oil-based and foaming cleansers are also grouped. I have included Western products in order to be inclusive of the advice found on this subreddit. I have tried to place those items lower on the list in each category to give prominence to Asian items, given the nature of this sub.\n\n\nPlease feel free to add to the comments - if you see your HG for dry skin isn't listed, tell me! I would love for this to be a working document that is edited as needed, so we can also consider converting into a similar format as it exists over on r/SkinCareAddiction\n\n**PLEASE NOTE**: What follows is a compilation of the advice given on this subreddit to address conditions associated with dry, over-exfoiated skin, and other symptoms associated with a damaged or impaired moisture barrier. It is not a substitute for medical advice or the advice of a dermatologist, nor are they indicative of my own preferences or what I would personally advise. Before trying any new product, it behooves you to check ingredient lists, take note of personal or individual sensitivities, patch test, and introduce only one new product at a time\n\nIF YOUR SKIN IS BROKEN, CRACKED, FISSURED, BLEEDING, OR ASSOCIATED WITH SWELLING, EXQUISITE TENDERNESS, FEVER, PUSTULES, OR PUS, PLEASE LEAVE THE INTERNET AND SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION FROM A HUMAN BEING. IN PERSON.\n\n**For those of you experiencing dryness and sensitivity as a result of prescrpiption topicals,** its important to communicate your skins response with your healthcare provider. You may need to be scaling back your dosage, frequency, or both, or may need to consider alternate treatments. Please do not rely on Dr. Internet for addressing issues with a prescription. \n\n**Another Note:** You’ll notice some overlap between this and previous lists in this series, especially the rosacea/redness post. Lines do get blurry, but I tried to focus my sources/threads as much as possible. These lists are compiled with the newbie/beginner in mind, and due to their “crowd-sourced” nature, will lean towards inclusion of more popular, “mainstream” products. As always, these compilations are starting points for discussion, and the most fun part for me is including feedback as it rolls in, so **please, share what has worked for you.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Cleansers, Cream Cleansers*\n\n* Banila Co Clean It Zero in Purity\n\n* Botanic Farm Grain Ferment Cleansing Sherbet \n\n* Clinique Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm\n\n* Skin Food Rice Water Bright Cleansing Oil \n\n* Illi Total Aging Care Oil Cleanser\n\n* DHC Cleansing Oil\n\n* XeraCalm A.D Lipid-Replenishing Cleansing Oil \n\n* History of Whoo Gongjinhyang Cream Cleanser\n\n* L'Oreal RevitaLift Radiant Smoothing Cream Cleanser\n\n* Mandom Bifesta Cleansing Lotion\n\n* Missha Super Aqua Fresh Cleansing Milk\n\n* Andalou Naturals Probiotic Cleansing Milk\n\n* Skinfood Green Tea Cleansing Milk\n\n* **Hada Labo Tokyo Hydrating Facial Cleanser**\n\n* **Cerave Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n* Papa Recipe White Flower Enzyme Powder Cleanser\n\n* **COSRX Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser**\n\n* Innisfree Jeju Bija Anti-trouble Cleansing Gel\n\n* Tosowoong Enzyme Powder Wash – some have found this too harsh, for others, its the only thing their skin tolerates.

Petrolatum (Vaseline) is the gold standard, but a good rule of thumb is to go as heavy and occlusive as your skin can handle without clogging pores. \n\n* Many facial oils are not occlusives. Read more about oils and occlusion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3v6yb8/psa_for_your_winter_dryness_most_oils_arent/)\n\n* What occlusive you eventually choose is largely individualized. Some rely on petrolatum-based balms, for others this results in bad breakouts. As always, patch test and add only one new product at a time. \n\n* What works for your skin can rapidly shift depending on climate, season, and region. Pay attention to signs of how your skin is responding to these various factors so you can adjust your routine accordingly. Be ready to change things up\n\n* You might be here because you’ve over exfoliated. You can generally tell this because 1) you just upped your acids, and 2) your skin is newly very sensitive to even mild products. You can read more here on [how to tell if you’ve damaged your moisture barrier.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/33xhax/what_are_the_signs_to_look_out_for_for/) Learn your lesson and when you restart, GO SLOWLY. Many people with lots of acids in their routine got there after sloooowly ramping up and allowing their skin to adjust. And consider [joining a support group ;)]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3tac9m/can_we_have_a_support_group_for_overexfoliators/)\n\n* If your dry skin is new and likely the result of new or increased actives in your routine (especially rein-A and other retinols, BHA, andor AHA) BACK OFF THE ACTIVES until your moisture barrier heals. DO NOT TRY TO “POWER THROUGH.” Scale back on your routine to the bare essentials, focusing on mild products, hydration, and occlusive creams. \n\n* Consider your cleanser. Tightness, dryness, and sensitivity that seems to be resistant to all the layers of hydration and creams may be the result of a cleanser your skin hates. Many with dry skin recommended avoiding foaming cleansers and using a cleansing milk as their second cleanser. Also consider cutting back to once-a-day cleansing, or simply rinsing your face with water. \n\n* Another recommendation was to save washing the face for evening\n\n* Consider eliminating anything that foams. \n\n* Please consider seeing a dermatologist if you can. Topical steroids may be something to consider if your skin is really suffering. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSources:\n\n[Help with Dry Skin and Double Cleansing]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4ca5e2/help_with_dry_skin_and_double_cleansing/)\n\n[Looking for a Gentle, low pH Second Cleanser for Dry Skin!]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4alfwn/looking_for_a_gentle_low_ph_second_cleanser_for/)\n\n[Cure for dry skin for retin a user- Vaseline]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/42zbt5/cure_for_dry_skin_for_retin_a_user_vaseline/)\n\n[Best toner and essence for normal-dry skin?]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/44bnvp/best_toner_and_essence_for_normaldry_skin/)\n\n\n[Looking for a moisturizing mist for winter and dry skin?]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/47ksng/looking_for_a_moisturizing_mist_for_winter_and/)\n\n[Dry skin product recommendations]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3e9yik/dry_skin_product_recommendations/)\n\n[What cushions do you recommend for my dry skin?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/45lue2/what_cushions_do_you_recommend_for_my_dry_skin/)\n\n[Sheet mask recommendation dry skin](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/38ekvx/sheet_mask_recommendation_dry_skin/)\n\n[Warning: Unpleasant Acne Pictures.

It's also low-ph! I use this as my second cleanser after an oil cleanser. DHC Cleansing Oil works really well. They don't dry me out like a lot of cleansers do.\n\nCleansing is the hardest part to get right for me. But I think the above combo really works, so I'm afraid to change it up much :)\n\nI am absolutely in love with the COSRX Snail Mucin Essence. Also, the Rice overnight pack is actually really good. I've not tried the Honey Ceramide one yet, but I'm loving the Rice pack.\n\nI am not sure how overlapping Dry/Sensitive/OverExfoliation are, because I have dry skin and I find that it's only sensitive when my skin is dehydrated/broken barrier.

        "body": "Not AB, but Earth Science has a cream cleanser that I believe is fatty alcohol free and is around pH 5.5. I also plan to try out some non-foaming cleansing gels in order to check out what alternatives are out there for those with drier skin. First on my list is a kose cleansing gel, which I saw was described as weakly acidic. \n  \nAlso, I have dehydrated-prone and acne-prone skin that leans dry. Right now I'm using shea butter as a final step since no other facial oil has worked out for me, and it's going pretty well so far! I have the NOW Foods Shea butter tub. It can be a bit hard to spread, so I stuck a chopstick in and \"whipped\" it for a looser texture. However, it still tugs a bit when being applied to the skin. I found the best way to apply it is to take some of the whipped shea butter in my hand, warm it up and then apply it - either by spreading, or pressing my palms to my face.  \n  \nI've tried all sorts of sleeping packs and oils, but I'm finally waking up with skin that isn't dry or dehydrated. Vaseline also works decently, but shea butter seems to be the right mix of occlusive and emollient for my skin. Over the course of the night, some of it absorbs and I wake up with pretty good skin (much better than before, I can definitely say). I still might go back to playing around with vaseline during the winter months. We'll see how it goes.   \n  \nAnyway, the point of this tangent is that I recommend adding shea butter to the facial oil list haha. I know there's actually a shea oil, but I've never tried it and I believe the components of shea butter that are beneficial for dry skin are removed in the process of making shea oil. So it should be a bit lighter, if anyone is interested in a lighter take on shea butter.   \n  \nLastly, [this post about occlusives](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3v6yb8/psa_for_your_winter_dryness_most_oils_arent/) might be of interest to those with dry skin.   \n  \nETA: Wanted to clarify that I use lots of hydrating layers, but they mean nothing without a good occlusive.   \n  \nEdit: words",

        "body": "Not sure if my skin passes for dry because I usually try to deal with the dryness as soon as it appears and keep it as normal as possible. \n\nThings I use and I have found that work for me: \n\n* Tony Moly Aquaporin Moisture Foam Cleanser - this is a really basic cleanser, it's not even low pH, but I find it very gentle. \n* Vivant Skincare Green Tea Antioxydant Cleanser - this one is the gentlest cleanser I've used, it's low pH but it's so pricey. I will probably replace with Sulwhasoo Snowise next. It's the only cleanser I've used that leaves my skin like I haven't washed it but clean (if you know what I mean... xD). \n\nMy favorite creams for my driest moments during winter are: \n\n* Sulwhasoo Essential Firming Cream - I order sample jars of this on eBay and it comes out very affordable. This is my favorite moisturizer for normal/dry skin. It simply leaves my skin super hydrated and glowing, even if I step all the other steps in my routine. \n* Mizon S-venom Wrinkle Tox Cream - this cream is amazing as an occlusive, I absolutely fell in love with it! It left my skin so amazingly soft and hydrated. \n* Yves Rocher Nutrive Végétal 24h Comfort Nourishing Cream - this is a recent fave, for the price of 12€ for two tubs of this, it's perfect. I really like this line by YR for normal/dry skin, for those of you interested in trying non AB EU skincare, I'd highly recommend them, they are super affordable as well. \n\nMy favorite sleeping pack is: \n\n* Sulwhasoo Overnight Vitalizing Mask - this mask is magic for dry skin and soon as I start using this after getting dry patches they disappear. And it also helps for brighter skin tone. \n\nFavorite facial oil: \n\n* Pure cold-pressed avocado oil - I used this before I started using the Sulwhasoo sleeping mask. A 250 ml costs around 4€ in the supermarket, so I'd highly recommend it to everyone with dry skin. \n\nToner I am using for a while: \n\n* Yves Rocher Nutrive Végétal Velvety Toner - this is a really great locally available toner for me and for the price of 8€ for two bottles, I'd call this a pretty amazing deal. \n\nI am really interested in adding new stuff to my stash. I'd like to get a new toner and at the moment I am really hesitating between the Kikumasamune and the Hadalabo Hyaluronic Acid one, I would love if someone could tell me how they performed for them. \n\nI'd also like to buy serums/essences because I am only using actives at the moment. I am interested in Mizon Hyaluronic Acid Amoule, Cosrx Snail Essence, Cosrx Galactomyces Essence, Scinic Snail AIO, Scinic Propolis Ampoule, basically the choice is hard here. \n\nI've used couple of different gel creams but I don't find they are that amazing for dry skin, just a good thing to layer as a moisturizer. Ones I've used are \n\n* Mizon Watervolume Aqua Gel Cream \n* Mizon Aloe 90 Soothing Gel\n* Mizon Snail Recovery Gel \n* 3W Clinic Snail Mucus Soothing Gel \n\nFavorite sunscreens: \n\n* Bioré UV Perfect Milk - this is really great for dry skin, I imagine it will be my go to sunscreen during winter. \n* Missha All Around Safe Block Waterproof Sun \n\n\nOther random things that worked out for me: \n\n* Layering several layers of moisturizers instead of using one heavy layer of a moisturizing cream. I don't know why exactly that works the way it works, it might have to do something with the skin absorbing the ingredients more easily that way. \n* Careful with actives! It took me 3 months to build a tolerance to be able to use vitamin C daily (and once per day only) so I learned it the hard way, my skin doesn't like too much actives. I only use AHA once/twice per week and my skin looks really great right now. \n\n\nSorry for the non AB suggestions!",

(Occlusives are ingredients that lock in moisture, serving as a physical barrier between your skin and the outside world.)\n\nThe thing is, most plant oils aren't actually great occlusives! They're still often phenomenal ingredients at moisturizing, healing, and soothing, but they won't serve as occlusive agents. That means you can use them earlier in your routine, before creams (or even before sheet masks, to really push that oily goodness deep in your skin!). It also means if you want an occlusive layer, you should look for something with one or more of the following ingredients.\n\n**List of occlusive agents:**\n\n* Petrolatum (the most occlusive - 99% reduction in trans-epidermal water loss)\n\n* Fatty alcohols like cetyl and stearyl alcohol\n\n* Hydrocarbon oils like mineral oil, silicones (esp. dimethicone and cyclomethicone), and squalene\n\n* Wax esters like beeswax and lanolin\n\n* Vegetable waxes like candelilla, carnauba, and palm kernel\n\n* A few key oils, usually ones that are high in oleic acid and have a thicker, greasier feel: olive, rice bran, macadamia, castor, and soybean oil, plus shea butter\n\n* Cholesterol\n\n* Lecithin\n\nHappy occlusing!\n\n**EDIT**: based on [this chart](http://www.floratech.com/Uploads/pdfs/occlusivitychart.pdf) shared by /u/vanityrex, I've made some edits to the above list.\n\n**EDIT 2**: based on [this paper](http://www.probotanic.com/pdf_istrazivanja/ulje_jojobe/Primena%20biljnih%20ulja%20u%20kozmetici.pdf) linked from /u/surrealist_comb, I took jojoba oil off the list.",

    "body": "So, this is a bit scary for me to post. I'm a mod here and I've been a lurker on the MakeupAlley skin boards for years now, but my skin has always been a pretty sensitive issue for me. After all, with all the knowledge I have, my skin should be the epitome of perfection. Well, [it used to be](http://i.imgur.com/odM4hmx.jpg)...\n\nSee, my skin was very kind to me in my teens, relative to most people's experiences. I had a lot of issues with clogging on my forehead (as I see very frequently here) but that began to clear up in my adult years. \n\nRegardless, like many women, I was on a quest for magazine-style perfection, and in early 2011, when I visited a dermatologist for a biopsy, she prescribed me Veltin (tretinoin and clindamycin, similar to Ziana) for my mild acne.\n\nIt was the most expensive prescription I have ever purchased, literally and figuratively. Unfortunately, I wasn't given any real instructions, so I slathered it all over my face.\n\nWhat followed was a miserable year of the worst breakouts I've ever had. My previously unblemished skin turned on me, and the harder I tried, the worse it became. I remember having spots that were so large they practically merged, like some mouth sores do when they're close to one another. They'd linger for weeks, and when I'd extract them, what came out wasn't a normal colour (sorry -- gross, I know). In short, my skin had become grossly irritated. As if that wasn't bad enough, my skin would just peel off like a snake shedding its skin. I'd slather my face in CeraVe cream, running to the bathroom the next day only to see more spots ontop of old spots. \n\nI began crying myself to sleep and avoiding mirrors. My appearance had become a huge, festering wound in my life. I no longer felt \"pretty.\" I slathered on sunscreens, creams, oils and other potions, hoping that the \"purging\" period that everyone assured me I was going through would finally come to an end.\n\nBut it never did. I broke out like this for the entirety of 2011. I don't have any pictures of this period, but it was much, much worse than any of the worst pictures in my album. \n\nBy Oct-Nov of 2011, my mom, sick of seeing me moping about and engulfed by my acne, made an appointment for me at her trusted dermatologist. He took me off of the Veltin immediately and prescribed a round of antibiotics (Solodyn) as well as clindamycin.\n\nThings got better. I stopped hating my skin so much. It became less of a CONSTANT fixation in my mind. Those with bad skin know that you begin looking at everyone around you and wondering, \"Why can't my skin just be beautiful? Are they looking at me? Do I have another zit coming up? Can they see it? Oh god, oh god...\" Finally, I began thinking less like that and things began returning to normal.\n\n...And then I came off of the antibiotics.\n\nAt first, it was fine. For months, I'd just get the occasional spot, but nothing tremendous.  Then it began to snowball, and I'd get a couple spots here, and then more there.\n\nI began to get experimental. I tried AHA, BHA, and creams people swore by. Unfortunately, I am possibly the least consistent person with skincare since I am surrounded by so much of it on a daily basis due to this sub. I'm like a squirrel looking for the best acorn in a pile of promise -- they all look so good, which do I pick!? *HNNNGH!* BUT I WANT TO TRY THEM ALL! \n\nYou can already see where this is going: straight to hell in a handbasket.\n\nMy skin started to hate me again. I saw my mom's dermatologist once more in May-June of this year, and was prescribed another round of antibiotics. I took a month's worth before realizing how miserable they made me -- constipated, mostly -- and asked to be taken off of them.\n\nI remember being really upset again around this time. As those who recognize me here know, I am very, *very* sensitive to many common ingredients, such as (but not limited to) cetearyl, cetyl, and stearyl alcohol; jojoba, almond, coconut, argan, olive, and macadamia oil; algae extracts; squalane/squalene (humectant); and a good number of essential oils. This means that a majority of creams, oils, serums, cleansers, sunscreens, and even \"acne-friendly\" creams are out. \n\nI felt completely out of options. Hopelessness set in. I remember feeling so angry and depressed about how I could help others with their acne, but even with all that I knew, *I couldn't fix my own skin.*\n\nWell, to make this long story a bit shorter, I began testing out previously sworn-off ingredients and products once again. I decided that I had over-reacted with so much being swapped in and out of my routine constantly. My mom kept assuring me that I knew SO much at this point that I couldn't look at anything objectively anymore and just panicked at the slightest thing (you were right, mom).\n\nSo I began taking pictures to track my progress with ingredients and products. This is how I started to finally figure out what was actually helping or hindering my skin. I also stopped trying to apply my vast amounts of knowledge to my skin problems all at once and instead began to tackle things one at a time and in a VERY SIMPLE way: track progress in photos, cleanse, use BHA or AHA, let things be, moisturize, stop fretting so much.\n\n[Things have gotten better. Much better, actually.](http://imgur.com/a/2sbih)\n\nI'm trying not to get my hopes up (I've had a LOT of false positives), but I could cry with happiness when I see my skin these days. I don't wake up to 3-4 more spots anymore, just progress. \n\nSince I know you're probably curious, here's my current routine:\n\n**AM**\n\n* Cleanse with water and a washcloth/flannel\n* Pat on Vit C Serum ([NuFountain 10%](http://nufountain-fresh-cosmetics.amazonwebstore.com/Made-Fresh-NuFountain-C10-10-Vitamin/M/B002VLSBF2.htm))\n* Pat on moisturizer if feeling a bit dry ([Elta MD PM](http://eltamd.com/product/pm-therapy-facial-moisturizer/)). I only use a pea-sized amount.\n* Apply sunscreen if going out for longer than 15m ([Skinceuticals Physical Fusion](http://www.skinceuticals.com/_us/_en/category/physical-fusion-uv-defense-spf-50.htm))\n\n**PM**\n\n* Remove makeup/sunscreen with whatever I have on hand (Clinique TTDOB, baby oil, Albolene). Remove/wipe away excess.\n* Cleanse with Cetaphil Daily Cleanser (contains SLS but it is honest-to-god the ONLY thing I've found that works, and I keep coming back to it when other cleansers fail me)\n* Pat on vit C serum, let it dry while I get changed for bed\n* Apply [Paula's Choice 2% BHA LIQUID](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/aha-and-bha-exfoliants/_/Skin-Perfecting-Two-Percent-BHA-Liquid-Exfoliant/) (the one that feels a bit heavy and filmy -- this stuff is my HG) with a cotton square\n* Play [League of Legends](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/) past my bed time\n* Pat on Elta MD PM\n* Pat on Vaseline to any dry spots\n* Zzzz...\n\nI'm also taking 50mg of Zinc, which while I know is anecdotal for many, I do feel that it helps with my skin.**\n\nWhile my response isn't common -- I've yet to find anyone who had such a bad, long-term reaction from tretinoin -- please let my story be a cautionary tale for anyone who seeks perfection in any form. If I had learned to love my skin the way it was, or to try gentler methods first (such as the BHA we recommend so frequently here), I may never have gone through any of this. \n\n**tl;dr -- Wanted unobtainable perfection, paid a heavy emotional price, learned to appreciate my skin (with all of it's flaws) again.**\n\n[ALBUM LINK AGAIN IF YOU MISSED IT EARLIER](http://imgur.com/a/2sbih)\n\n**Please note that high doses of zinc messes with your copper levels and you shouldn't take it if you are taking anything that depletes copper OR if you don't get enough copper in your diet as is. Note that dietary changes and effects resulting from them are nearly exclusively anecdotal, which is why we try to refrain from giving any advice like that in this sub. \n\nEdit: Tried to clean up my crappy grammar a bit. \n\nThank you for all the love, guys. I know that my acne isn't as bad as some, but with limited treatment options, I felt incredibly hopeless for a really, really long time. If you're struggling with acne, regardless of how mild, *please don't give up.* There's hope out there, even if you're as wildly sensitive as me.\n\nEdit 2: Added valuable links.\n\nEdit 3: I am the Queen of Edits. For the curious, [here's a list of some of the products I tried in my quest to fix my skin](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1op52m/nearly_3_years_and_over_2000_worth_of_skincare/ccu8xj7).\n\nEdit 4: Holy nutsacks, someone gave me gold. You just made my evening, whoever you are. Thank you. ",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

    "body": "This has been said on this sub many times, but I have seen lots of comments and posts recently by people who are unaware, so I thought it was time for a PSA.\n\nFor some people, skincare products containing fatty alcohols (common ones are cetearyl, cetyl, and stearyl alcohol) may cause breakouts or clogged pores. They have a 2 (out of 5) comedogenicity rating on [cosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/). Cerave in the Tub, Cerave AM Lotion, and Cerave Lotion (+ many other products) contain these ingredients.\n\nYou might consider eliminating fatty alcohols from your routine if you are using products with them, you didn't patch test, and your acne is getting worse or not improving. If your acne improves after excluding FAs from your routine, then that is a clue FAs might not work for you.\n\nOf course, YMMV. These ingredients are fine for a lot of people, but for some people they might cause problems.\n\nEdit: clarity\n\nEdit 2: I determined FAs were the cause of my breakouts because I broke out from several products and when I compared the ingredients lists they all contained FAs. If you are breaking out after trying *only* Cerave, then it could be any ingredient in the product list that is a problem for you. You might choose to eliminate FAs based on this information, but  you might also choose to try a moisturizer with FAs from another brand. Breaking out from Cerave alone is not a guaranteed indicator that FAs are the problem.\n\n**Bottom line: patch testing & adding products one at a time will help you avoid these problems altogether.**",

I feel like we get a lot of people who say stuff like this when they first join the sub (including me!). Fatty alcohols are in MOST moisturizers, so it makes sense. If you're in this situation and really desperate for some acne relief you might want to skip even trying products with them. The good news is that this doesn't mean you can't wear moisturizer at all, it just means you have to be a bit more picky.

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

    "body": "as discussed in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5aqahi/unpopular_opinions_fall_2016_edition/), the [four-product starter haul](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4gltx6/newbies_why_your_first_haul_should_only_have_four/) that is currently subreddit gospel may not apply well to people with dry skin. herewith, after some discussion with various folks including /u/C_Chrono and /u/theCuriousAmerican, a proposed starter haul guide for dry-skinned newbies.\n\n---------------------\n\nARE YOU A DRY-SKINNED PERSON WHO IS NEW TO AB AND DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO BUY?\n\ntry these 4 (well, 5) products first, numbered in the order in which to introduce them to your skincare routine. buy samples or decants on /r/asianbeautyexchange if you can--it's cheaper than buying full-sized products that turn out not to be right for you. introduce things *one at a time*, at least a few days apart; isolating changes to your routine lets you see what's helping/hurting. (you are \"supposed\" to patch test for two weeks to see if something irritates you, especially if acne-prone.) if anything tingles, burns, or causes bumps/clogged pores, stop using it immediately: none of these ingredients are \"actives\" (i.e., chemical exfoliants) and therefore cannot cause purging, so it's irritation. now, to the products! \n\n---------------------\n\n**the tl;dr version.** if you really just want a list of stuff to try first without all the explanations and potential variations, here are some recs that may or may not work for your specific face. \n\nAM: \ndon't wash your face; spritz with water or swipe with simple brand micellar water (if the pH of your tap water is high--more on this in the comments)\n\napply kikumasamune lotion high moist (via spray bottle or with your hands--it's a thin liquid despite the name)\n\napply cerave cream in the tub or dr. jart+ceramidin cream\n\napply canmake mermaid uv gel or another alcohol-free sunscreen\n\nPM: clean your sunscreen and/or makeup off with either banila co clean it zero cleanser, simple brand micellar water, or a cleansing milk/cream (see discussion in the comments)\n\nspritz with water (if the pH isn't too high)\n\napply kikumasamune lotion high moist\n\n[sheet mask if you want]\n\napply cerave/dr jart cream or (if everything else irritates you or you're really dry) vaseline\n\n---------------------\n\n**the long version: products to buy (decants of) first, and introduce one at a time, in this order***\n\n(1) A HYDRATING TONER (/\"LOTION,\" IF JAPANESE)\n\n* what? a thin liquid product containing humectants, ingredients that draw moisture to the skin. common humectants are glycerin, butylene glycol, propylene glycol, and hyaluronic acid. you will use this both morning and night.\n\n* why? to help hydrate your skin; many dry-skinned people have skin that doesn't produce much oil (\"dry\"), and many also have skin that doesn't contain much water (\"dehydrated\"). a hydrator can make your skin more comfortable quickly.\n\n* how do i choose which one(s) to buy? \n\n(a) have you ever had a bad reaction to skincare products in the past? check out the ingredient lists and see if there are ingredients in common--those might be problems for you. if you have a sensitivity to butylene glycol, your best bet may be a non-AB product: **heritage rosewater and glycerine toner.** (if someone has a glycerine-only AB product to rec, shout in the comments and i'll update!) \n\n(b) too much hyaluronic acid(/sodium hyaluronate) can make you drier, so it might be less risky to go with one that doesn't have hyaluronic acid too high in the ingredient list (higher = more of it). **kikumasamune lotion high moist** is extremely popular in this sub and is HA-free. so is the non-AB **mario badescu rosewater aloe herb spray**, which is cheap and easy to obtain in stores in the US (at ulta, for example).\n\n(c) is your skin damaged, peeling, or flaky? if so, it will benefit from ceramides+cholesterol (skin-repairing ingredients) in addition to a humectant. **rosette ceramide lotion and meishoku ceracolla lotion** have that ingredient combination--NOT the gels from the same lines, the \"lotions\" (liquids).\n\n(d) there are many other beloved potential options if you feel up for some research. if you are in europe and open to something non-AB, /u/Ronrinesu's got [an idea for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5koy14/4product_starter_haul_dry_skin_edition/dbqj2ok/).\n\n---------------------\n\n(2) A MOISTURIZER (\"cream,\" \"emulsion\") \n* what: a thing containing some amount of oil to \"seal in\" (occlude) the moisture (water) you are adding to your face with step 1, or else it will dry right back out again. you will use this after your toner both morning *and* night. \n\n* why: dry skin is lacking oil. oil helps seal in water and make your skin soft and able to like, move around without cracking. you need oil.\n\n* how do i decide which one to buy?\n\n(a) [this awesome post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3v6yb8/psa_for_your_winter_dryness_most_oils_arent/) lists occlusive ingredients, i.e., those that help seal in moisture. you will want to look for creams that contain ingredients like this.\n\n(b) as with toners, if your skin is flaky or peely, you will want a cream with ceramides+cholesterol. many people swear by **cerave \"in the tub.\"** you may prefer the more-expensive but really wonderful **dr. jart+ ceramidin cream.**\n\nlet me explain: CREAMS ARE A MINEFIELD. a lot of ingredients in moisturizers cause sensitivities for certain people, including:\n\n(i) fatty alcohols (benzyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, etc., etc., etc.) -- if you have a sensitivity to these, you may want to try just a plant oil, since moisturizing creams without them are hard to find. people love **rosehip, argan, and camellia/green tea seed oil**, among many other possible contenders.\n(ii) beeswax (if a cream causes breakouts, this could be a contributing factor)\n(iii) plant oils, e.g., shea butter, coconut oil, sunflower oil, argan oil, rosehip oil, etc. (but a lot of people's skin LOVES one or more plant oils, so don't assume anything about yourself without experience--just be aware that if you're getting bumps, breakouts, or irritation, a plant oil could be the culprit)\n(iv) coconut derivatives like capric/caprylic triglycerides\n\nultimately, you need to obtain small amounts of various creams and oils to test on your skin to see which of these sensitivities you have. start your research on creams with [this awesome list](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4xwoe1/best_products_for_common_skin_concerns_series_dry/) from dry-skinned folks (look under \"gels, emulsions, creams, lotions...\") \n\n(c) if creams are irritating your skin and you need *something* to hold you over until you figure out which ingredients to avoid: straight-up **vaseline** is *the* gold standard for reducing trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL), and you can buy a tiny pot of it without making a big monetary commitment. yes, it is derived from petroleum; no, it is not toxic (purified for cosmetic use) or comedogenic (unlike plant oils, its molecular size is too big for it to clog pores). (only caveat is that it doesn't play well with sunscreen, so you'll need to find something else for daytime before you get to that step.) plain **mineral oil** also works pretty well (and feels less gross than vaseline); if you're in the US, snow river's wood oil is a plain, unscented mineral oil you can get for like, $4.\n\n---------------------\n\n(3) A GENTLE CLEANSER \n\n* what: a low-pH micellar water (check the original first-four post if you want a quick overview of why low pH is important), an oil-based cleanser that emulsifies (washes off) well, (ETA) or a cream or milk cleanser. (ETA:) *not* a foaming cleanser (harsh; you want to be gentle to your skin).\n\n* why? many western cleansers have a pH that is high enough to irritate skin or don't properly remove makeup and sunscreen. that basically means just washing your face stresses your skin. a cleanser that starts you off on a good footing can improve the overall situation.\n\n* how do i decide which ones to buy? if you don't mind scents and oil, i recommend you start with **banila co clean it zero** (in the US, you can buy sample/travel sizes on amazon for something like $2.50, in addition to decants available on /r/asianbeautyexchange). if mineral oil irritates your skin (rare but possible), the \"purity\" version doesn't contain it.\n\nif you want something you can buy in US drugstores, an oil-free option, or something you can swipe on with a cotton pad, **simple's micellar water** is a popular alternative (other micellar waters have high pHes--don't substitute).\n\n(ETA:) if you are ready to do some research to choose your own cleanser (highly recommended!), see the comments below for a long discussion about cream cleansers and milk cleansers (some AB, some not). as you will see, many of the more vocal dry-skinned folk seem to prefer them to oil cleansers.\n\n---------------------\n\n(4) A PROBABLY ALCOHOL-FREE SUNSCREEN \n\n* what: a sunscreen which, to be on the safe side, contains no alcohol. (as mentioned below, not all but many of us dry folks are sensitive to alcohol.) \n\n* why: it's the main way to prevent dark spots, post-blemish scarring (PIH), and signs of aging. \n\n* how do i decide which one to buy? the most oft-recommended alcohol-free one is **canmake mermaid uv gel.** here are [some other suggestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/41y5s9/are_there_sunscreens_without_alcohol/). \n\n---------------------\n\n(5) BONUS ROUND because you can't be a total monk about your first haul: SHEET MASKS, if you want 'em\n\n* what? single-use fabric masks soaked in hydrating \"essence.\" \n\n* why? the fabric sheet acts as a physical occlusive to hold water onto your skin. the single serving means you can try various ingredient combinations without a big commitment. (yes, the packaging is wasteful. yes, a lot of them are expensive. yes, it's ridiculous that they're single-use. if you're not into it, ignore this part and count your saved money!)\n\n* how do i decide which ones to buy? (make sure to isolate introductions of masks as you would other products; don't do two new things at the same time.)\n\n(a) do you mind heavily scented things? that will narrow the field a lot. (searching for unscented sheet masks should get you on the right path quickly.)\n\n(b) next, narrow your search by your other skin concerns, e.g., calming, brightening, anti-acne. or check out the favorites on beloved blogs like fifty shades of snail, vanity rex, and 35th of may, whose proprietors are members of this sub (the last two have dry skin).\n\n(c) check ingredient lists to help you avoid alcohol high in the ingredient list. (for example, innisfree it's real masks are sort of notorious for alcohol content.)\n\n(d) do you want my idiosyncratic and highly personal recommendations? here you go: **illi camellia** (contains camellia/green tea seed oil); **tosowoong dr. troubex** (a nice introduction to fermented ingredients, with lots of calming things like centella and licorice); anything **lululun** (they come in multi-packs and have less essence, which i personally prefer); **elizavecca donkey steam cream masks** (these are one of a kind--coated in thick cream, not \"essence\"). all of these are available by the box in the US on amazon, mostly for $1.50/sheet or less, or you can find some singly at memebox or /r/asianbeautyexchange.\n\n---------------------\n\nPRO TIPS FOR CARING FOR DRY SKIN:\n\n(1) you may not need to actually *wash* your face in the morning. many of us just splash with water. (ETA:) the water where you live may have a too-high pH. you might want to swipe with the micellar water (the pH of which is consistent and low enough, unlike that of tap or bottled water) instead.\n\n(2) spritz your face with a spray bottle of water as the first step in the routine. (it gives humectants something to draw into your skin.)\n\n(3) you may have a sensitivity to ethanol/\"alcohol\"/denatured alcohol/\"alcohol denat\" high on ingredient lists. not all of us do, but a lot of us do. \n\n(4) abandon any preconceptions that heavy night creams will cause breakouts. irritating ingredients will; occlusion on dry skin will not. \n\n(5) a lot of people put toner on their lips and then seal it in with lip balm. this may not be FDA approved, but it can really help with the dryness.\n\nhappy hunting!",

The only thing I would suggest, is to check your water's pH level as well, especially if you are just splashing water for one of your cleansing sessions. It took me a while to figure this out. I think I was reading a review on Fiftyshadesofsnails where she mentioned being surprised how high her water's pH was, and something clicked. When I tested mine, it was in the 8-9ish range! So sometimes even just splashing water can irritate the face just as easily as those high pH cleansers. I switched to a quick swipe of Simple's micellar water in the morning instead, and the difference in my skin was astounding. So yeah, just wanted to put that out there, because your water is usually the last culprit you would expect!",

    "body": "^*(last updated 4.5.14: they changed the trader joe's formula, it's off my list!)*\n\nConditioner only washing: washing your hair with conditioner only and cutting shampoo out of your regular routine. This is, as far as I can tell, the gentlest way to cleanse your hair. People with dry, damaged, or brittle hair may find this particularly beneficial, as well as people with very dry, sensitive or oily scalps (over production of oil can be a result of overdrying or irritation). Seems to be able to be adapted for any hair type. \n\nUPDATE: [A pic of my day 2 hair; about 2 months since my last shampoo](http://i.imgur.com/sSSrdLQ).\n\n[From this article on shampoo:](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3002407/)  “Many persons feel that they do not have good hygiene unless they bathe daily. Technically, it is not necessary to shampoo the hair daily unless sebum production is high. Shampooing is actually more damaging to the hair shaft than beneficial.\" \n\n*****\n##How \n*****\nI CO-wash every 2-3 days, sometimes 4-5 if I'm using dry shampoo, deep condition my ends once every 1-2 weeks and before shampooing, and shampoo around every 4-6 weeks or when I get some kind of serious crud in my hair.  My scalp is also naturally oily, which means I'm always going to have to cleanse more often than people with dry scalps. When I first started doing it I CO-washed every day and shampooed weekly-biweekly, but the longer I do it, the longer I can go in between. A good dry shampoo can do wonders, too.  \n\n**Method**  \n\n 1. Thoroughly wet your hair, which can take a minute if your hair is low porosity or very thick.  \n\n 2. Get yourself a generous handful of conditioner and saturate your roots with it. Use the pads of your fingers (no nails) to massage the conditioner all over your scalp. Make sure you thoroughly massage every inch. This is easier with your head hanging upside down. Get some more conditioner if you need to, there's no such thing as too much.  \n\n 3. Rinsing after this step then working a second round of conditioner all through your hair is sometimes recommend. I've experimented and find it (personally) unnecessary. I just work some more conditioner into the length of my hair and finger comb it through. When I deep condition this is when I use it.  \n\n 4. Let your hair soak for the rest of your shower. I'll often take a bath and read for a while with the conditioner in my hair. Letting it sit for at least 5 minutes is an important part of the cleansing process; your oil needs time to dissolve into the conditioner.  \n\n 5. Thoroughly rinse your hair, massaging the scalp again as you do. Easier with your head upside down, but I'm not coordinated enough to keep the water from going up my nose so I just tilt my head way back and lift it in sections to help work my fingers through.  \n\n**Tips**  \n\n - Before you start this method, it's a good idea to use a clarifying shampoo to remove any build up. There are many ingredients in many haircare products that are difficult to remove and require stronger chemicals.  \n\n - Wash your face or anywhere you're concerned about acne/sensitive skin after you're done rinsing.  \n\n - If you're worried about an adjustment period, start out alternating CO-washing and shampooing with a gentle poo, and slowly increase the proportion of CO-washes.  \n\n - Comb through your hair with a wide toothed comb while the conditioner is in. It's easier to detangle and your hair is more elastic during this phase, which means less breakage, and it'll preserve your natural texture.  \n\n - Scratching/irritating/overheating your scalp causes it to produce more oil.  \n\n - I squeeze out all the excess moisture and let my hair air dry. A lot of others recommend drying with an old tshirt or microfiber towel. Terry cloth tends to rough up your hair and promote frizz and tangling.  \n\n*****\n##Why  \n*****\nThere are multiple ways this method can work to clean your hair. The first is by dissolution, the principle that oil dissolves oil. This is how the oil cleansing method works, which has been very popular in Asia for thousands of years, and historically they've placed a much higher value on hygiene than in the West. This is much gentler than surfactant based cleansing. The oils, humectants, and fatty alcohols in a good CO-wash bond to the oils on your scalp and roots (the soak), distribute them throughout your hair, and rinse away clean with gentle agitation (the scalp massage.)\n\nThe other way CO-washing can cleanse your hair is actually the same as shampoo: many conditioners still contain surfactants. I prefer to go mostly surfactant free, but some of them have certain benefits (just discovered [cetrimonium chloride](http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/curl-products/curlchemist-what-is-cetrimonium-chloride), [it's pretty spiffy](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ls6zx/advice_on_a_heat_protectant_without_silicones_and/cc4h5r0), though I'm being cautious because there are some [allergen concerns](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/701258/CETRIMONIUM_CHLORIDE/)). Some surfactants have conditioning properties, lift the cuticle and allow it to absorb moisture, and some will lightly coat your hair, lending slip and shine.  \n\nWith this method it's VERY IMPORTANT to **avoid anything that builds up on your hair!** This means checking what's in the products you're putting on your hair and doing your research. **UPDATE:** Check out /u/smbtuckma's [guide on silicones](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/) for more info on determining what will and won't work for your totally customizable routine! **Waxes** can build up and make your hair look dirty, particularly if it's fine; they can lend definition to curls though and are not drying. **Fatty alcohols** are emulsifiers (bind oil and water) and help provide slip to a conditioner, something you want, but can cause build up, particularly with waxy sebum, so they shouldn't be too high on the ingredient list; I haven't experienced an issue with them.\n\nQuick list of...\n\nDrying alcohols: Denatured alcohol, SD alcohol 40, Witch hazel, Isopropanol, Ethanol, SD alcohol, Propanol, Propyl alcohol, Isopropyl alcohol  \n\nFatty alcohols: Behenyl alcohol, Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl alcohol, Isocetyl alcohol, Isostearyl alcohol, Lauryl alcohol, Myristyl alcohol, Stearyl alcohol, C30-50 Alcohols, Lanolin alcohol\n\n**Ingredients I look for:**  \n\n - **coconut oil** *(will actually penetrate your hair to moisturize, protects protein bonds, but usually very comedogenic; for more info on all the oils I mention check out [this guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1m014r/info_about_natural_hair_mask_ingredients_pt_1_oils/) )*\n\n - **jojoba oil** \n\n - **sunflower oil** \n\n - **glycerin** (humectant)\n\n - **honey** (humectant, can lighten your hair/enhance highlights, be careful if you're worried about preserving your color; in it's raw form has strong antibacterial properties)\n\n - **aloe** (humectant; acidic, which helps remove mineral build up and seal the cuticle; contains protein(amino acids), if your hair starts to show signs of [protein overload](http://www.curlynikki.com/2012/06/can-i-over-condition.html)(crunchy, brittle, less elastic) cut back; extremely under studied with highly contradictory information out there, so experiment for yourself and draw your own conclusions)\n\n - **cetrimonium chloride** (cationic surfactant, increases tensile strength when combined with heat)\n\n - **panthenol** (significantly improves shine and manageability)\n\n*****\n##Who  \n*****\nAs far as I can tell, this method can work for pretty much anyone as long as you're willing to experiment to find the right conditioner. My scalp is oily, my hair is extremely fine, low porosity, bleached, dyed, henna-ed, dry, and extremely fragile. This method cleanses my scalp and roots thoroughly and nourishes my length, leaving everything soft, shiny, stronger than it ever has been in my life, and really enhances my natural texture. My scalp also seems to be producing a LOT less oil than with any other method I've tried. I've seen glowing write ups on this method with every hair texture, thickness, and density; from what I can tell it started with the curly community.\n\nThe biggest obstacle seems to be **knowing your hair type** and what works for it:  \n\n - Fine or thin hair is going to need a very light product that rinses very clean.  \n\n - Chemically colored hair will eventually be stripped by oils that penetrate your hair (coconut oil, olive oil, sunflower seed oil) so should avoid those in regularly used products\n\n - Low porosity hair doesn't like too much protein (makes it crunchy, brittle, less elastic; this is specifically in reference to hydrolyzed protein, other types won't absorb) and seems to need an extra boost from humectants to absorb moisture, especially since (if you opt for a surfactant free route) you're no longer lifting the cuticle to help it. Still needs some protein/strengthening treatments,  you have to find a balance for your hair [More on this over at Curly Nikki](http://www.curlynikki.com/2012/06/can-i-over-condition.html).  \n\n - High porosity hair typically loves hydrolyzed protein (you need that word to be in front of the protein ingredient for it to be absorbant) and much more readily absorbs, and loses, whatever you put on it. Needs more attention from products that coat/seal in moisture and smooth the cuticle. \n\n - Wetter/oilier sebum is the easiest to remove and really lends itself to this method.  \n\n - Thicker/waxier sebum might do better with a conditioner that contains more emulsifiers, such as surfactants. Jojoba oil is also a good ingredient to look for, because of it's chemical structure it can really effectively penetrate and combine with what's on your scalp. I've read that build up from fatty alcohols is particularly an issue with waxy sebum.  \n\n*I would love to hear some feedback on waxier sebum and high porosity hair!*\n\n**I do NOT recommend this method to anyone experiencing issues with dandruff.** Dandruff is often a fungal infection called melassazia in your scalp's yeasts. I recommend visiting a doctor or certified trichologist to find out your cause; I've read about successfully treating it naturally with raw honey, coconut oil, aloe, hemp oil, and tea tree oil, but this really all depends on what kind of dandruff you're dealing with, and a lot of the evidence is anecdotal or under studied.  \n\n*****\n##What  \n*****\nCO-Washing:  \n\n - **Mane n' Tail Conditioner** *(wow, gotta say, this stuff might be my new favorite! Contains cationic surfactants (good, conditioning ones), coconut oil, glycerin, and hydrolyzed protein. I've been alternating it with the Trader Joe's conditioner lately, and myt hair has been perceptibly healthier. I think I finally found my protein balance!)*\n\n - **Sukin Organics Nourishing Conditioner** *(100% carbon neutral and cruelty free. Contains cetrimonium chloride, aloe, and hydrolyzed protein. Good slip.)*\n\n - **As I Am Coconut CoWash** *(Lightweight, leaves my hair very bouncy and shiny with LOTS of texture. Great slip, very moisturizing, rinses clean.)*\n\n - **Tresemme Naturals** *(haven't used it but often recommended, contains drying alcohols low on the list, NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\n - **Giovanni Brazilian Keratin & Argan Oil Ultra Sleek Conditioner** *(haven't tried, recommended)*\n\n - **Suave Naturals** *(haven't used, often recommended, range of options, some have NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\n - **As I Am Cleansing Pudding** *(haven't tried, made for this, NO PENETRATING OILS)*   \n\n - **Curl Junkie Daily Fix Cleansing Conditioner** *(haven't tried, made for this, contains yucca, NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\n - **Darcy's Botanicals Daily Cleansing Conditioner Cream** *(haven't tried, made for this, contains wax, label says NO SURFACTANTS but it has BTMS, a very mild cationic, NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\n - **Jessicurl Hair Cleansing Cream** *(haven't tried, made for this, NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\n - **Curly Q's Curlie Cutie Cleansing Cream** *(haven't tried, made for this, NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\nDeep Conditioning:  \n**Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner** *(contains shea butter, aloe, panthenol, and coconut oil, some of my favorite ingredients; NO SURFACTANTS, also contains emulsifying wax so should be used sparingly)*, **Cold pressed coconut oil** *(will actually penetrate your hair, protects protein bonds, but a little bit goes a very long way! Also very comedogenic for most people, be careful of it near your face. Excellent as a pre-poo treatment. Not ideal for chemically colored hair, because of it's penetrative abilities it can remove the color molecules.)*  \n\nShampooing:  \n**Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Moisture Retention Shampoo** *(uses the gentlest surfactant on the market, decyl glucoside, NO PENETRATING OILS, [break down here](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1l4sjc/product_recommendation_community_survey_shampoos/cc0o2kz))*  \n\nClarifying Shampoo:  \n**Malibu Swimmers Water Action Shampoo** *(no sulfates but still effective combo of surfactants and ingredients that remove mineral build up, panthenol, smells like orange push pops...)*\n\nDry Shampoo:  \nThe best one I ever tried from the store was **Dove.** I prefer to just make my own with arrowroot powder and cocoa powder. Corn starch is popularly recommended and the ingredient in most of these dry shampoos that soaks up the oil, but I find that the arrowroot is finer and disappears better.",

        "body": "So, /u/SnooSnooCookie asked me about a specific conditioner, [Matrix Total Results Color Care Conditioner](http://www.google.com.au/imgres?um=1&safe=off&client=firefox-a&hs=G7g&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&hl=en&biw=1280&bih=878&tbm=isch&tbnid=1Qc4icCLLeYB4M:&imgrefurl=http://www.beautyofnewyork.com/shopping/DYH0200911KK0158.htm&docid=vQoU3xg8hp02dM&imgurl=http://www.beautyofnewyork.com/upload/2011/matrix-total-results-color-care-soin-couleur-conditioner-10-1.jpg&w=221&h=550&ei=7rktUrOVBIbPkQWjmoCwCA&zoom=1&ved=1t:3588,r:1,s:0,i:80&iact=rc&page=1&tbnh=194&tbnw=80&start=0&ndsp=30&tx=10&ty=102), for COwashing. Here's a break down of it with some helpful resources for you guys.\n\nGenerally, I'll just google the ingredients in a product one by one; eventually you start to remember what's good and what's bad.  I'd say MAYBE it'd be a suitable COwash, but I think you can do a lot better, especially for the price. Here's the ingredients list:\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cetyl Esters, Isopropyl Myristate, Isopropyl Alcohol, Parfum/Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, Lauryl PEG/PPG 18/18 Methicone, Helianthus Annuss Seed Oil / Sunflower Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Linalool, Chlorhexidine Digluconate, Citric Acid, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Dodecene, Poloxamer 407, Hexyl Cinnamal, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Iso-Methyl Ionone \n\n -  Cetearyl Alcohol is a fatty alcohol, meaning it's moisturizing. Fatty alcohols cause build up issues for some people, particularly those with waxy sebum. I prefer to see them farther down the ingredient list, things are listed in the order of largest quantity to smallest, but this isn't a deal breaker; lots of frequently recommended COwash are very heavy on fatty alcohols. \n\n -  Behentrimonium Chloride is an emulsifier (binds oil and water), antistatic agent, and mild cationic surfactant. Basically, this means it will both condition and clean your hair. Popular ingredient in co-wash conditioners (I, personally, am super sensitive to surfactants so avoid them, but most people don't have this issue.)\n\n -  Glycerin is a humectant (attracts water) and one of my favorite hair care ingredients. Be careful of it in leave ins if you're in a low humidity climate, without other products or humidity to provide moisture it'll actually attract water out of the interior of your hair. In a co-wash, this helps both clean and moisturize your hair.\n\n -  Cetyl Esters are a wax used to thicken products, waxes can build up on your hair and make it look dirty after awhile. This may not be an issue if you're hair isn't easily weighed down (mine is) and in combination with the behentrimonium chloride. Only way to know is trial and error.\n\n -  Isopropyl Myristate is used as an emollient and helps make a product slippery (a good thing for COwashing), however I'm finding conflicting information on it and nothing solid about it's application to hair. Generally, it's an accepted moisturizer, however there's solid information on it's potential for irritation and clogging pores. There's also some discussion that it can be drying. I dunno. This is a confusing one. I'd just try to avoid it.\n\n -  Isopropyl Alcohol is a drying alcohol. It's difficult to avoid drying alcohols entirely, but good to do if you can. You definitely don't want it this high in an ingredient list. [This page has a handy list of drying alcohols, fatty alcohols, and silicones](http://www.wikihow.com/Determine-if-a-Hair-Product-is-Curly-Girl-Approved).\n\n -  Parfum/Fragrance is the bane of my existence. I'm usually super sensitive to it. It can mean almost anything, companies aren't required to report their personal fragrance blends, so they're frequently drying/irritating. They're also in freaking everything. Damn near impossible to avoid, so just aim for low on the ingredient list.\n\n -  Phenoxyethanol is a preservative, it keeps your product from getting moldy.\n\n -  Lauryl PEG/PPG 18/18 Methicone is a silicone; generally, silicones are the top thing you want to avoid with COwashing. This one, however, is a [water soluble silicone](http://www.curlynikki.com/2012/08/water-soluble-silicones-101.html), so it MAY be ok to use with this method. There's really conflicting information about the role that cones play in hair care, some studies say they only simulate the appearance of health and block the absorption of moisture, others say they help protect hair from heat damage and can help act as humectants. The only way to know what works for you is trial and error. I would think that, combined with surfactants, water soluble silicones MIGHT be ok for SOME people. I don't mess around with them because my hair is so easily weighed down. Again, [this page has a handy list of which silicones are and aren't water soluble](http://www.wikihow.com/Determine-if-a-Hair-Product-is-Curly-Girl-Approved).\n\n -  Helianthus Annuss Seed Oil / Sunflower Seed Oil is a moderately penetrative oil, which means usually it's a GREAT ingredient for hair care and COwashing. However, penetrative oils can strip hair dye; proceed with caution.\n\n -  Tocopherol is vitamin E, it acts as a moisturizer and preservative.\n\n -  Linalool is a fragrance and byproduct of essential oils and vitamin E, generally not a concern unless you have eczema and it oxidizes.\n\n -  Chlorhexidine Digluconate is probably being used as a preservative here, it has antiseptic/antimicrobial properties. Some moderate risk for irritation.\n\n -  Citric Acid is an acidifier and preservative. Also removes hard water build up. Moderate acidity is great for hair care, it helps close the cuticle = make your hair shinier.\n\n -  Benzyl Salicylate related to salicylic acid, generally used as a fragrance ingredient. Some concerns about potential for irritation/developing a sensitivity to it over time.\n\n -  Limonene is used primarily as a fragrance in toiletry products; used commercially as a solvent, ie it strips oils. Some concerns about irritation and developing sensitivities to it.\n\n -  Butylphenyl Methylpropional is a fragrance with irritation and endocrine disruption concerns. It's use is heavily restricted.\n\n -  Dodecene is a known skin irritant, appears to be used as a thickener. Primarily used in the manufacturing of detergents.\n\n -  Poloxamer 407 is a gentle non-ionic surfactant. It's also hydrophilic, which means it attracts water molecules. Good ingredient for COwashing.\n\n -  Hexyl Cinnamal is a fragrance with some irritation and allergen concerns. Safe in small amounts (this qualifies).\n\n -  Citronellol is a fragrance with sensitizing concerns.\n\n -  Benzyl Alcohol is an aromatic alcohol with solvent properties, used as a preservative. Not a concern in small quantities.\n\n -  Alpha-Iso-Methyl Ionone is a fragrance with some allergen concerns in large quantities.",

It not recommended for normal hair, or protein sensitive hair.\n\nScent: *Sweet like milk and honey*\n\nTexture: *Thick and creamy*\n\nCurly Girl Method Approved?: *No*\n\nSilicone Free?: *Nope, contains* *Dimethicone, Amodimethicone, and Cyclopentasiloxane*\n\nAlcohol Free? : *No, contains Isopropyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, and Stearyl Alcohol*\n\nAfter one use, my hair is softer and feels smoother. After using it, I put my hair in a microfiber hair cap to air dry. My hair dried straight, instead of wavy. My hair looked more shiny and healthier than before. If you are looking to keep your natural hair texture, I don't recommend this product.\n\nSee full Curly Girl Method Ingredient Breakdown [here](https://isitcg.herokuapp.com/Home/Results/9TayIxixVkeoUwqp7FYTgw).\n\n**Shampoo Brush**\n\n[Shampoo Brush](https://preview.redd.it/ny21b01hl7811.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd0af98c4e7cf87aa0286fa46ad5ad045b6c42de)\n\nI bought this, because I do a lot of co-washes. I wanted to still be able to scrub my scalp clean, even though I don't use shampoo daily. I picked it up at Daiso for $1.50.\n\nThe bristles are made out of a rubber. It doesn't snag my hair, and I am able to brush through without issues. The handle is comfortable. It looks questionable, but for brushing your scalp it is perfect.\n\nMy scalp feels great when I use it. Using it feels like a little scalp massage. I have been using it for a few weeks now. I have noticed that my scalp doesn't feel as \"tight\" anymore. I really think it is helping, and I am glad I purchased it. I love using it, and will continue to use it.\n\n**Edit:** I forgot to mention that the shampoo brush is easier on my arthritic hands. It gives my scrubbing a little more power and doesn't hurt so much. \n\n**A'PIEU Healthy Scalp Doctor Tonic**\n\n[Hair Essence](https://preview.redd.it/1553s3nrm7811.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3eef80ce12cd882561d123de6c0b13fdbc61d116)\n\nI bought this for my dry scalp. I got it from Jolse for less than $10.\n\nI have been using it for a few months. It is used to treat over-oiled, itchy, dry scalp, and hair loss prevention. It contains Salicylic Acid, Peppermint, Rosemary, Menthol, and Allantoin. It is meant to be used after drying hair every other day. The bottle has a misting cap on it . You mist it directly to your scalp and massage throughout.\n\nOnce applied, it instantly feels cool, probably from the menthol. It does help keep the build up down, and my scalp doesn't have as much dander fallout.\n\nI think this would be better for oily skin. I won't be repurchasing, because I feel like I can find a better product suited for myself. I will use it up, and then try a mist from Innisfree.\n\nI was not able to find the full list of ingredients in English.\n\n**TONYMOLY Make HD Hair Wax - Super Hard Matte**\n\n[Tonymoly make HD Hair Wax - Super Hard Matte](https://preview.redd.it/n5i87lbxq7811.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1dceca026f002ac0b7f8e0c10a3433cfd1462733)\n\nI bought this for my husband. He has short fine black hair. He has some thinning and grays. His scalp is oily, and he has dandruff. I purchased this from Jolse for less than $5.\n\nHe does not care for it, but he says it isn't so bad that he will throw it away without finishing it. It doesn't hold as long as it suggests. It holds hair for about four hours. It dries matte. It doesn't leave a white cast, or white flakes. The color of the product is slightly gray. It has a strong scent of talcum. I will not be repurchasing this one, because the hold wasn't strong enough.",

Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\n🐳 **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\n🔵 **TONER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **DermaFique All Important Toner** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\n🐳 **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you! Rest your eyes for a bit,it did endure quite a bit of a strain with this one :P",

    "body": "If you like videos, [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rwMIm0VlpA) a youtube rendition of this beginner's guide. \n\n----\n\nThis guide has been written based on results from scientific studies as well as HCS community feedback. It's an introduction to haircare that will help most people, but it may not give you all the results you want or may create atypical effects. If you want a more personalized haircare regimen, check out our guide on [common problem troubleshooting](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1km6ui/troubleshooting_common_problems/), visit our [product recommendations page](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/wiki/product_reviews), or post a question thread.\n\nThe basic process for caring for hair is cleansing, conditioning, drying, and then styling. In other words, it is the process of cleaning the hair, protecting it, drying it, and then getting it into the shape you want. Fulfilling you and your hair's needs in these four areas is the objective of a good haircare procedure.\n\n**Cleansing**\n\nMany commercial shampoos have harsh surfactants that degrade the cuticle through abrasion and excessive oil extraction and can even sever protein bonds in the cortex underneath [1][6][9][10]. They function primarily as foamers, emulsifiers (so oils and water can exist in the same bottle without separating), and oil extractors [11]. However they are often used in excess because many people believe in the myth that shampoos with more foam and that leave the hair squeaky clean are better [1][6]. While these harsh surfactants do clean the hair better, our hair doesn't need to be cleaned that well that often. Because of the significant cuticle damage caused by frequent use of these surfactants over time, here are our alternate recommendations:\n\n- buy a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner duo as a starting point. If you’re used to using harsh shampoos, it may take time to adjust to the gentler formula so be patient. \n\n- Try not to wash your hair every day. This strips the natural oils from your scalp that are produced to lubricate the hair shaft and exposes your hair to more damaging agents [6]. However, it is also possible to [exacerbate any scalp conditions you have](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/668qkd/scalpama_we_are_a_team_of_scientists_working_in/) by not washing *enough*. Wash cycles will be a very personal thing, so experiment with different lengths of time in between washes for a couple weeks to see what works for you. On off days you can keep your hair dry, wet and massage it in the shower, or wash with conditioner.\n\n- If this still feels too harsh for your hair, check out [co-washing](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1m0g7c/conditioner_only_method_cowashing/). This is a method of cleaning and nourishing the hair only with conditioner and is helpful for people with excessively fragile and dry hair and sensitive scalps. \n\n- If you're co-washing or use any styling products, also use a stronger clarifying shampoo every few weeks\n\nFor more details on different kinds of cleansing, check out [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1vw6sz/big_giant_super_basic_eli5_guide_to_cleansing/) post. \n\n**Conditioning**\n\nConditioners protect the hair by smoothing down the cuticle, which reduces the chance for damage and makes the hair shaft softer, more combable, and more manageable [3][4]. It also reduces moisture loss. Conditioners can be applied in the shower, after washing while hair is wet or dry, and in a concentrated amount as a deep conditioner before washing. You may find benefit by using one kind, or all three depending on your hair's susceptibility to damage (e.g. it's thinner, you heat style, you live at higher elevations with more UV exposure, etc.) and porosity. \n\n- In-shower conditioners are the most common and are often formulated as part of a pair with a shampoo. \n\n- Leave-in conditioners, or conditioners you add after washing, are very helpful if you plan on doing any sort of styling. Look for something light if you have thin hair that is weighed down easily, like a thin liquid or a spray that doesn't have heavy silicones or other conditioners. Thicker hair can stand up to and may even require heavier conditioners like cremes or liquids with more viscosity. \n\n- Finally, deep conditioners typically have the strongest effect, hence their name. If your hair still feels dry or rough, try a commercial or natural deep conditioner formula once every one to two weeks. Depending on the amount of conditioning you're looking for and what ingredients you use, you can put it on for a few minutes in the shower, apply it all over your head a couple hours before a wash, or apply it at night, sleep on it using a shower cap or old towel, and wash it out in the morning. Warming the deep conditioner before application increase penetrative abilities for those who have low-porosity hair (cuticle scales lay tight against the shaft). This is also a good chance to take care of the scalp too with antibacterial ingredients. A discussion of natural deep conditioners is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1m014r/info_about_natural_hair_mask_ingredients_pt_1_oils/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1pa93e/info_about_natural_hair_mask_ingredients_pt_2/).\n\n**Drying**\n\nOne of the most common sources of hair damage is heat styling such as hot irons, straighteners, and hot blow dryers [8]. Avoid these as much as possible to avoid the damage they cause (we like natural texture here!). While heat styling may seem like the only way to make your hair look good right now, over time as the condition improves it will most likely look better without the need for heat. *However,* there's some preliminary research that indicates complete air drying also damages the cell membrane complex between cuticle and cortex fibers[5], so here's some drying suggestions to minimize as much damage as possible:\n\n- Towel/shirt drying: Soak up some excess water first by wrapping your hair in a towel for a few minutes, or better yet use a fabric with a finer weave like a cotton t-shirt or satin/silk, as the rough fabric loops on towels can cause friction damage (curlies should visit /r/curlyhair or google \"plopping\" for curl-specific ways to do this).\n\n- air drying: This is best for smoothness and shine, but consider using a protein treatment and/or penetrative deep conditioner from time to time to conserve the integrity of your cell membrane complex and avoid fragility and breakage.\n\n- blow drying: Or, blow dry your hair on a low heat setting after applying a heat protectant with non-volatile silicones, PVP/DMAPA acrylates copolymer, Quaternium 70, and/or hydrolyzed wheat protein as one of the top ingredients [2]\n \n\n**Styling**\n\nStyling regimen is a very personal preference that people tailor to their own unique hair over time, so we won't presume to advise on any specific styling technique here. A few good rules though are:\n\n- avoid products with short-chain alcohols[7]. The short-chain alcohols (SD alcohol, alcohol denat., propanol, propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol) are included in products to decrease drying time and make the product spread more easily, but they also dry out the hair by pulling out moisture. Dry hair is more susceptible to breakage, damage, and frizz. \n\n- \"Good alcohols\" on the other hand include lauryl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, and behenyl alcohol. These are long-chain molecules that act like conditioners by smoothing the hair cuticle. Just be careful not to use too much, as that can make the hair feel weighed down and greasy. \n\n- Silicones have the same conditioning effect, but can be more difficult to wash out and therefor can build up over time with undesirable consequences. Read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/) post for more information about silicones. \n\n\nAgain, these are tips to help you start out and aren't definitive rules. Some people may not see as much change as they'd like, or may even see negative effects from this routine. Just remember that change in hair quality is a slow process, so be patient for a couple of weeks if you don't see immediate improvement. If after a while your hair still hasn't changed or has taken a turn for the worse, look at our [other care guides](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/wiki/beginner_haircare_guides) or post a question on our sub!\n\n------\n\n*cited sources:*\n\n1.

I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm really excited about this section. I'm not happy that Korea is and has been for years, swamped in pollution from the winds carrying it over. There is a lot of microdust and even people with resilient skin reported getting redness & severe irritation from the pollution. Everyone has to wear these giant masks, sometimes special ones, and limit their exposure to the world outside of their homes.*\n\n*So there has been a lot of push for soothing, calming products and \"clean\" ingredients. A lot more focus on repairing the skin barrier. So I'm excited about those, but not the fact that people have to suffer.*\n\n*I'll be bolding some of the soothing, repairing and/or skin-identical ingredients in the ingredient lists. I don't know every good ingredient, but I will bold the ones that I do know of. Some other beneficial ingredients as well.*\n\n*\\*Also got random pictures of the textures of the creams and the users who posted it.*\n\n*If you're interested in barrier repairing/replenishing as I am, here are some good quotes from Susan, from Swift Crafty Monkey blog:*\n\n>**Natural moisturizing factor (NMF)** is found within the corneocytes, and makes up 20% to 30% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum. It **consists of amino acids (40%), sodium PCA (12%), lactate (12%), urea (7%), ions (18.5%), sugars (like glycerol – 8.5%)**, and a few other things. These are water soluble [humectants](https://swiftcraftymonkey.blog/better-crafting-through-chemistry/) (meaning they draw water out of the atmosphere to our skin) that have a huge impact on the biochemical and mechanical properties of our skin. Having an adequate NMF level in our skin can prevent or reduce skin tightness, cracking, scaling, and flaking. It improves our skin’s plasticity (thanks to the interactions of the amino acids with keratin) and helps maintain skin’s barrier properties.  \n>  \n>**Filaggrin** is a really important protein found in our skin! ...When we are in more arid climates, the filaggrin breakdown increases to produce more NMF. More NMF is a good thing!  \n>  \n>The contents of the NMF do more than act as humectants. The lactate and potassium can affect the pH and stiffness of the stratum corneum. The lactic acid stimulates ceramide biosynthesis and improves barrier function. The [hyaluronic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan) (HA – picture to the left) maintains hydration and structural integrity of our skin. It also interacts with intercellular lipids and regulates the mechanical properties of the stratum corneum.  \n>  \n>\\[The strateum corneum lipids\\] make up about 15% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum, and contain about **40% to 50% ceramides, 20% to 25% cholesterol, 15% to 25% fatty acids** (those with C16 to C30 chain lengths, with C24 to C28 being the most common), and **5% to 10% cholesterol sulfate**.  \n>  \n>Oils with **linoleic or gamma-linoleic acid** are always welcomed by our skin (like sunflower, sesame seed, borage, evening primrose, rice bran, and others), especially in the winter.\n\n**Squalane, beeswax, lecithin, lanolin** are also good skin replenishing ingredients. Shea butter is very soothing and moisturizing, as well as having a lot of antioxidants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TOP CREAMS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. \\[Dr. G\\] Red Blemish Clear Soothing Cream - 4.22/5 (9,894 Reviews)**\n\n70ml/36,000 KRW - $31.29\n\nWater (Aqua/Eau), **Glycerin**, Butylene Glycol, C 13-16 Isoparaffin, **Niacinamide**, C 12-14 Isoparaffin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Pentylene Glycol, Vinyl Dimethicone, Caprylyl Methicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Panthenol**, Acrylates/C 10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Tromethamine, **Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate,** Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, **Beta-Glucan, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside,** Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Epigallocatechin Gallate, **Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid.**\n\n*This line from this brand is extremely well-known and popular in Korea.

    "body": "Heavy-duty moisturisers for problem facial skin. No fragrances, alchohol, parfum, or any other sensitising ingredients. These products will help to repair skin damaged by over-exfoliation and over-treatment. Also helpful for de-hydrated and inflamed acne. To get best results, use in a routine that starts with layers of humecants (thin, hydrating layers found in Asian Beauty products), and finishes with oils (rosehip, sea-buckthorn, squalane). Avoid foaming cleansers, and try OCM/gentle cleansers. \n\n\nLA ROCHE-POSAY LIPIKAR BAUME AP+: (HG). Fantastic moisturiser with shea butter and 4% niaciniamide. Hugely moisturising, thick, soothing, cosmetically elegant. Mixes with everything (oil, sillicons, hydrators), never pills. 400ml of product in big pump bottle. Love using this. Re-purchased at least 5 times so far. \n\n\nEUCERIN 5% NIGHT CREAM: Make sure you get the night cream. Much thicker than the day one. Powerful moisturiser, with 5% urea, ceramides and other clinically effective ingredients. Thick and again mixes with everything. If you want to get a urea product into your routine, this is the one. Only 50ml of product so have to be slightly more sparing, but reasonably good value for money. Re-purchased 4 or 5 times.\n\n\nLA ROCHE-POSAY CICAPLAUST BAUME B5: Very different to the previous two products, and should be used as a mixer with them, rather than a stand alone moisturiser. It is incredibly soothing and anti-irritating. With B5 and zinc, it is anti-bacterial, calming, thick. This plays a different role in routine, repairing, reducing redness. Slightly occlusive and leaves a slight whitecast, so for evening use only. Find this product to be quite unique, especially at the price point and a great addition to any routine. Re-purchased 3 times. \n\nBEPANTHENOL: Yep, nappy rash cream. Heavy, thick occlusive. Great consistency, feels very luxorious and mixes nicely with vaseline and aquaphor, making them easility spreadable. Also mixed well with creams, for a sleeping back. Ingredients listend below. None of the 'alcohol' ingredients are sensetizing, they are all fatty alchohols, like those used by cerave, that are moisturising. Ingredients: Aqua, Lanolin, Paraffinium Liquidum, Petrolatum, Panthenol (Dexpanthenol), Prunus Dulcis, Cera Alba, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Ozokerite, Glyceryl Oleate, Lanolin Alcohol. \n\nNotable mentions to Cerave Cream, Aquaphor, Vaseline, pure lanolin. \n\nI'm have lots of experience dealing with very problematic skin and associated skin conditions, so please hit me up with any questions and I hope I can impart with some of my knowledge/suggestions!",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

    "body": "Good Skin Days On The Bright Side Moisturizer\n\nWhat an interesting journey it has been having the Soko Glam Good Skin Days products in my routine.\n\nThings started off great with the C’s The Day Serum, fell apart a bit with the Prime Time Cleansing Toner, and then rebounded with the wonderful A New Leaf Cream Cleanser I’m so happy to have had the chance to try out all of their offerings and end on a really good note with the On The Bright Side Moisturizer.\n\nThis lightweight/creamy gel style moisturizer reminds me a lot of some of the other lotions I have had in my routine over the past few months. Products like the Oat So Simple Water Cream and By Wishtrend VItamin 75 Maximizing Cream have a similar consistency/feel.\n\nThe offering from Good Skin Days focuses on hydration, nourishment, brightening/probiotic power with ingredients like Sake (the first ingredient to be exact), Squalane, Ceramides, and Madecassoside.\n\nThe formulation is pretty simple compared to some other moisturizers I have used and with  the addition of a few other ferments I didn’t mention above...the ingredients list reads more like a first treatment essence than a moisturizer lol.\n\nOne of the main things that stood out to me upon initial application was the super lightweight and cooling application. The On The Bright Side Moisturizer glides onto skin easily and absorbs quickly. On hot summer days/nights...I really appreciated the effect.\n\nI worried that this light/gel-like product wouldn't be enough for me on days where my skin felt dry or hot wind zapped all of my skin’s moisture. But, I found that layering/customizing each application of this moisturizer was sufficient in keeping my skin happy and hydrated throughout the day. A bit more on dry days...a bit less when I was planning on staying in. All without feeling greasy or heavy.\n\nHowever, those that prefer something a bit more “intense” may need to layer another cream or product on top of the On The Bright Side Moisturizer in the PM (I took to adding a few drops of the Sweet Chef Beauty Oil on certain nights).\n\nAs a bonus to the general hydration/nourishment I noticed from this product...the fermented ingredients do come through to offer some brightening benefit. The On The Bright Side Moisturizer really seemed to compliment/boost my first treatment essence (I was using Iope Bio Essence alongside this moisturizer) as I noticed slightly faster results in terms of skin tone balancing and glow.\n\nFor me, the Good Skin Days On The Bright Side Moisturizer was the stand-out of the range and something I would totally come back to. It might not be quite enough during the dry/cold Colorado winters but I could see it being an excellent choice for the rest of the year.\n\nOh, and it smells like root beer gummies...just thought I’d throw that in there.\n\nFull Ingredients List: Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake), Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Squalane, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Lactobacillus Ferment Lysate, Isopentyldiol, Water, Ceramide NP, Propanediol, Glycerin, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Streptococcus Thermophilus Ferment, Madecassoside, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nWhere To Buy (Soko Glam $24.00 USD): [https://sokoglam.com/collections/good-skin-days/products/good-skin-days-on-the-bright-side-moisturizer](https://sokoglam.com/collections/good-skin-days/products/good-skin-days-on-the-bright-side-moisturizer) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4wmbx52pvsj51.jpg?width=5472&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b16f7800b910516d3a0fd898fc91e743bd09169",

SPF 50 PA++++ sunscreen**  \n\n\n**2. 0.025% Tretinoin**   \n\n\n**3. 15-20% L-ascorbic acid vitamin C serum**   \n\n\n**4. Peptides, particularly 8% matrixyl 3000 and 2% matrixyl synthe'6, and glycolic acid.**  \n\n\nWith this said, even if we never, ever saw the light of day our entire lives, we'd still develop the signs of aging over time due. Aging is divided into intrinsic and extrinsic aging. Intrinsic aging is also known as chronological aging and it's our bodies' natural decline as the years go by.   \n\n\nExtrinsic aging is photoaging, which is aging due to sun exposure, but also includes this process called glycation. Eating sugar at least in the form of glucose and fructose causes aging because these compounds bind to collagen and inhibit the repair and replacement of both collagen and elastin. So avoiding high glycemic index foods is a good idea if you really want to avoid aging at all costs, and perhaps even carbohydrates as a whole.  \n\n\n**Sunscreen:**  \n\n\nMaking sure you're using a sunscreen that's rated PA++++ or discloses its PPD rating as 16 or higher is very important. To put it simply, UVA rays cause tanning, then sunspot hyperpigmentation, and then wrinkles. UVB rays cause sunburn. Both can cause skin cancer. The issue with using a sunscreen that is only rated for SPF is that SPF only tells you how much UVB protection the product has. It doesn't mean jack shit for how much UVA protection the product is giving you. So if you see people complaining they tanned or got freckles despite using SPF 100 or some other nice sounding high number, that's why. SPF is for UVB protection, not UVA.   \n\n\nThis is where the PA system comes in. The PA system rates a product's UVA protection, specifically its PPD. So now you're thinking what's PPD??? And we can explain this pretty easily. Let's say your bare skin starts tanning (the first sign of UVA skin damage) in 10 minutes. Now if you applied a sunscreen with a PPD of 16, your skin would then only start tanning in 160 minutes. PPD is a multiplier for your skin's UVA damage resistance. The highest PA rating is PA++++ which means a product has a PPD of 16 or more. There's no real way to tell the exact PPD in a PA++++ sunscreen, but at worst, it's PPD 16. Some sunscreens disclose their actual PPD, usually European sunscreens. But generally, finding a PA++++ sunscreen and committing to it will go a long way.   \n\n\nIf you're overwhelmed, you can consider looking into the sunscreen I personally use: Rohto Skin Aqua Super Moisture Gel Sunscreen SPF 50+ PA++++. It's stupid cheap at $11 USD for a big 140g bottle that lasts at least three months with liberal daily use. It also has an exciting photostable UV filter called tinosorb S, but even though this UV filter doesn't really degrade in UV light, it's not entirely composed of tinosorb, so don't lull yourself into thinking you can slap this on your skin and you're fine and dandy all day long in the sun. For general daily use though, it'll serve you very well. Do be aware it contains alcohol which has been shown to age the skin pretty badly, though, so you might want to take it upon yourself to research a PA++++ sunscreen without alcohol if you find that problematic.  \n\n\n On the topic of UV filters, PPD doesn't well assess the UVA1 protection of a product, as opposed to its reliability for rating UVA2 protection. Our best bet for protecting ourselves against UVA1 is by looking at the filters in sunscreen. Zinc oxide, tinosorb S, tinosorb M, Mexoryl SX, Uvinul A Plus, and avobenzone all help block UVA1 rays.  \n\n\n**Tretinoin (Retin-A):**  \n\n\nNext we have tretinoin. The mother of wrinkle prevention and reversal of present wrinkles. Tretinoin 0.025% has the same anti aging effect as tretinoin 0.1%. So don't jump the gun and assume you need the highest concentration for best results. Tretinoin does a bunch of things like increase collagen production (in fact, the only retinoid proven to do so), increase skin cell turnover from the inside out, and thicken the dermis. Basically, tretinoin cream is generally easier to use than tretinoin gel. The gel has alcohol and a difficult to spread texture. The cream is more emollient and spreads easier. However, the cream often has a fatty alcohol, stearyl alcohol, and isopropyl myristate, a full 5/5 acne trigger.   \n\n\nSo if you are worried about acne consider using tretinoin microsphere, also known as Retin-A Micro or Supatret by brand name. Microsphere is a gel format with no acne triggers and it's said to be gentler to use since it releases tretinoin into the skin over a period of time. I searched high and low for anti aging research on the microsphere version, but I came up with nothing.  Even though it's the same active ingredient, the vehicle, or inactive ingredient combination, that delivers the active ingredient can still affect results. So if you can use tretinoin cream, great, do that! If not, tretinoin microsphere is a solid option. Microsphere comes in 0.04%, 0.08%, and 0.1% formulations.   \n\n\nWhen using tretinoin, expect a three month transition period which is what we call retinization. Dehydration, dryness, flaking, peeling skin, irritation, even burning are common. This side effects tend to be most common in people who make one or more of the following mistakes: not applying tretinoin 20 minutes after applying moisturizer, not applying petrolatum like Vaseline immediately after applying tretinoin, and/or using tretinoin way too frequently too soon. To be super safe, I recommend for people to use tretinoin once a week for two weeks, twice a week for two weeks, three times a week for two weeks, and so on. If you experience intolerable side effects, go down one step and try again.  \n\n\n**Vitamin C:**  \n\n\nVitamin C serums are great for skin brightening, addressing PIH, but also increasing collagen production over a long period of time. I can only confirm that the latter effect occurs with 15-20% L-ascorbic acid vitamin C. And from here on out, when I talk about vitamin C, I'm talking about L-ascorbic acid.   \n\n\nThe problem is that L-ascorbic acid oxidizes and becomes useless with continued exposure to air and light. I keep my own serum in my fridge. Some people decant their vitamin C serums into multiple bottles so portions of the product are sealed off from the air for weeks or months, extending the longevity of the product. If your vitamin C serum is yellow, orange, or brown, it's time to get a new vitamin C serum. The issue is that vitamin C serums need a pH of 3.5 or lower to be effective. Vitamin C is a pH dependent active so it needs a 20 minute wait time after application before applying any other skincare products. Ideally, the vitamin C serum is formulated with vitamin E and ferulic acid. These two additives both help stabilize the vitamin C and even make it more effective.   \n\n\nVitamin C is an antioxidant and it has photoprotective effects. By no means does it replace sunscreen, but it's a sunscreen booster in a sense. That's why it's generally recommended to apply vitamin C during the day. You might not want to apply vitamin C daily though; vitamin C has a half life of roughly four days in the skin, so applying it daily might be overkill. I still apply it daily for peace of mind though. Oh and I use and recommend Timeless 20% Vitamin C + E and Ferulic Acid Serum, the formulation by all accounts is correct. They even have a permanent $5 off coupon (HF5OFF) and free shipping in the US, no minimum order. The great thing is that their vitamin C is made to order, so you get as fresh of a product as possible.   \n\n\nDon't buy vitamin C from third party retailers. The product you receive already has had its timer ticking for who knows how long on a retailer's warehouse shelf. For vitamin C, order from the manufacturer for best product longevity.  \n\n\n**Peptides:**  \n\n\nThere's so many peptides out there. I'm most knowledgeable about the matrixyl family. Matrixyl 3000 is basically matrixyl but with additives to help prevent glycation aging. Matrixyl syntheis a different peptide known more for collagen production. You're not missing out on anything by not having a product with the original matrixyl since it's already in matrixyl 3000. Peptide research isn't that robust, but the matrixyl studies I've gone over are really promising.   \n\n\nFull disclaimer that those studies have been sponsored by parties with a financial stake in matrixyl, but conflict of interest does not necessarily mean bad science. Anyway, 8% matrixyl Peptides only work if they get to living skin cells in the dermis. I'm personally discouraged by the efficacy of incorporating peptide products in a routine. Microneedling creates channels to the dermis, but that sort of needle length is used infrequently, around a monthly basis. Applying peptide products would be effective after microneedling, peptides on their own do not produce actual results if they only interact with the living skin cells on a monthly basis. Regardless, for people who microneedle, applying peptide products afterwards wouldn't hurt. I again recommend Timeless' matrixyl serums, despite their lack of delivery system technology in their formulation.  \n\n\n**Glycolic Acid:**  \n\n\nAnd now we have glycolic acid. 20% has shown itself to increase collagen production, but higher strength peels have been used and can be found on Makeup Artist's Choice's website.  Don't use chemical peels for at least 72 hours since last applying tretinoin and don't apply tretinoin for at least  72 hours after the chemical peel. Waiting longer is never a bad idea. I'm not sure about the anti aging effects for long term lower glycolic acid use, but I don't use this ingredient personally.   \n\n\n**Skincare Surgeries:**  \n\n\nThere's also dermatologist procedures you can consider like using Botox to prevent dynamic wrinkles, such as crow's feet and forehead lines. Microneedling stimulates collagen production and is also known as collagen induction therapy. Injectables like collagen and Sculptra stimulate the body to produce collagen, but I'm not sure how effective those are. Chemical peels treat fine lines and increase collagen production as well, at least glycolic acid in a concentration of or higher than 20%. I generally recommend against spending so much money on professional treatments, as they are mostly temporary but I'm just including these things to be comprehensive.",

I mean, I could google every single ingredient in the list, but they don't separate out which are the active ingredients, and I don't have time to look each one up. Do you happen to know from prior research? Does it contain any of the more troublesome ingredients like oxybenzone or octinoxate? It's definitely chemical-based...I'm not totally opposed to that, but it entirely depends on which chemicals they are. Also, it appears to contain parabens...just FYI. \n\nStill on the hunt for my HG sunscreen...for face OR body...I know that they really have to have zinc to be protective enough, but it's so hard to not look like Casper if it has zinc. :/",

Their other moisturizers are okay but are a bit basic for me and not too elegant for the face. This one has hyaluronic acid and ceramides!!\n\nIngredients (from website): purified water, squalane, glycerin, pentylene glycol, polyglyceryl-2 stearate, glyceryl stearate, stearyl alcohol, hyaluronic acid, ceramide EOP, ceramide NG, ceramide NP, ceramide AS, ceramide AP, carnosine, hydrogenated lecithin, phytosterols, caprylyl glycol, polyacrylate crosspolymer-11, 1,2-hexanediol\n\nThe product dries down to a semi-matte finish, doesn’t irritate my eczema/seb derm prone skin and I wake up with softer, plumper skin. \n\nThe ingredients haven’t irritated my face at all! It’s a much more cosmetically elegant finish than their other products too. Only addition that would have been nice would have been an occlusive in some small percentage (which was surprising since all of their other products are so occlusive heavy)\n\nOf course, your mileage may vary but this may finally be my favorite moisturizer!",

But i went to the dermatologist to get a cream that would give me an extra boost to get rid of the rest of my acne and she gave me tretinoin, to my understanding tretinoin can be very drying and make your skin peel if not enough hydration is applied day and night, and unfortunately the hydroboost is good enough if you just do wash and moisturizer but with my azaelic acid cream as well I needed some more hydration to my skin. So Im gonna use this moisturizer since i use the face wash and that works amazing for me.

(This post might be half cooked, not very organised and all over the place, but it's my first time, so bear with me :P) \n\nSo as I mentioned, this is my first post here (eeep! :D) and initially I thought of sharing my entire shelfie, but I realised that being the junkie/hoarder I am, it'd end up being a terribly long post , hence after much deliberation I decided to post different categories of products separately  (sunscreens, moisturisers, serums etc) and after I'm done with that, I shall be making a post with only the products I use in my  current skincare routine!\n\nWithout further adieu let's get started! Please do like, share,  subscribe and don't forget to hit the bell icon!... lmao jk\n\n**Skin Type** : Oily - Combination, Comedonal Acne Prone, Rosacea Prone,\n\n**Major skin concerns** : Hypersensitivity, Non inflammatory acne, Sebum Production. \n\n**Age** : Early - Mid 20s, F\n\n**Current Climatic Conditions** : Semi- Arid, Dry winter \n\nSpecie : Homo Sapien\n\nHeight : wait.. I'm not supposed to divulge all these details! \n\n**Product reviews** :\n\n*Note* : None of these products have been used by me on a strictly daily basis, except for a week (or two) in a row during vacations, as I rarely step out of the house (lockdown, duh!) and don't apply sunscreen indoors (\\*gaasp\\* 😨)   \n Rest assured, I've reapplied some when out, and have used them on and off in a span of 6 months. \n\nFrom L-R \n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/s2C99g0N/IMG-20211119-184403.jpg\n\n\n**1-  Nivea Sun Protect And Moisture, moisturising sun and collagen protection SPF 50+ PA++++** \n\n**Quantity** **- Price** : 125 ml - ₹495 MRP\n\n(bought on Amazon for ₹396)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, Titanium Dioxide, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Alcohol Denat, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Panthenol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Myristyl Myristate, Silica, Cetyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Stearyl Alcohol, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Methylparaben, Dimethicone, Trisodium EDTA, Ethylparaben, Sodium Citrate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citric Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Linalool, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Eugenol, Coumarin, Methyl Benzoate, Benzoic Acid, BHT, Parfum/Fragrance\n\n**Texture** : White - Chalky Color. Medium - Thick Consistency   \n , you have to rub it in for a while for it to get completely absorbed, medium drying speed. Kinda greasy, semi matte finish. Leaves a moderate white cast, not a ghastly one though. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. Smells mostly of Alcohol! (it's one of the ingredients, so obviously..), fragrance is definitely not unnoticeable, but I don't mind it for my body, lingers around for a while. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : Hell yeah! It won't wear off unless you bathe, it survives water splashes and friction from clothes. Be careful while applying it on your feet though, I slip a lot while walking, esp when there's a rush and I put on sandals right after applying it. Give it ample time to dry before stepping out. \n\n**Reapplication** : Since the lotion sits thick on the skin, reapplication is not a bliss, the white cast becomes more noticeable after reapplication, and if you sweat after, oh god it feels a heavy /sticky mess lol, also tends to attract dust, but it's for the body, so I can compromise. 🤷‍♀️\n\n**Overall experience** : It's the best body sunscreen I've tried so far, with the highest protection and I think the brand can be trusted for its spf claims. \n\nI tried using it on my face once, oh nooo, I will never do that again! it kept moving around and just wouldn't get absorbed, plus it stung like hell because of the alcohol, and I literally felt like I was applying fevicol!   \n For my body, yep a thumbs up! \n\n\\*But\\*, if you get acne on your arms  (my arms have a tendency to break out / get textured if I use the wrong product) it wouldn't be the best choice, it seals and chokes the pores, I'd prefer something lighter. I usually wear tops/suits with long sleeves, so not much of the arm is exposed. below the elbow it feels comfortable enough. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WRP**, Hit! (for the body) \n\n**2- Iba Halal Invisible Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++**   \n **Quantity - Price** : 80 ml - ₹395 MRP\n\n(I bought it on Amazon for ₹ 337)\n\n**Ingredients** : WATER CONTAINING EXTRACTS OF ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) EXTRACT & HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) WATER, WATER & ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE & BENZOPHENONE-3 & BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE & PHOSPHOLIPIDS & 1,3-BUTYLENE GLYCOL & PHENOXYETHANOL, GLYCERINE, AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/BEHENETH-25 METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL AND TRIETHYLENE GLYCOL, ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE, ALUMINIUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE, NIACINAMIDE (VITAMIN B3), TITANIUM DIOXIDE, PERFUME, DISODIUM EDTA, SODIUM HYDROXIDE\n\n**Texture** : White color. Light lotion - cream consistency, very lightweight and water like, kind of runny, it trickles down when you place a dallop on the palm and tilt it.   \n The Best consistency of a sunscreen I've used so far! Not at all heavy, takes some time to dry, esp when using larger amounts (I use 2-3 finger lengths) and still it doesn't feel too much on my face, easy to work with, requires a lot of gentle massaging because it's watery and takes some time to dry and settle in. High dry time.   \n It contains no silicones! My oily skin loves it! Doesn't give a matte finish though, on the glossy (satin?) side, but nothing bothersome.  \n Doesn't leave a white cast! On the Low I'd say, because of the presence of Titanium Dioxide. Absolutely love the texture. Skin feels very hydrated and plump and non greasy. (taaza nikhaar 😆) \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Has a \"fresh\" smell, (bamboo room freshener? idk something like that), moderate level, doesn't linger a lot. I haven't found a \\*good\\* fragrance free budget (\\*my\\* budget) friendly sunscreen yet. So I'm okay with this for now. Sometimes I'm guilty of enjoying the fragrance 😅 because all other products I use are strictly fragrance free. \n\n**Water Resistant?** :  Nope, doesn't survive water splashes or sweat (it won't come off completely in a single splash though, will wash off when sweating profusely) white colored droplets roll down the face if out in the sun for long. (the survival time is slightly more than the La Shield urban protection mineral sunscreen gel though) \n\n**Reapplication** : Breezy! Since it's lightweight, although, you might experience some moving around if there's a \\*lot\\* of product, I'd suggest applying pea by pea instead of taking a finger length at one go, I squeezed out a good amount once while in the car and kept massaging it in for a couple minutes (or more) and felt embarrassed at the weird looks my family and people outside the car gave me.. So yeah.. lol.  It doesn't feel uncomfortable after layers have been built up. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I love it! Although I'm not sure if the sunscreen has undergone the required tests to justify the actual sun protection claims, but that's all I got so far, it fits my requirements of no silicones, negligible white cast, high declared protection, non oily texture, and most importantly budget! \n\nOne important point, it stings when used after physical / chemical exfoliation. So you may want to avoid it after threading / waxing / scrubbing / masking / exfoliating.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Hit! **WRP** (for face) \n\n**3- La Shield Pollution Protect Mineral Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹280 MRP\n\n(bought it on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Purified Water, Octinoxate, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Caprylyl Methicone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Diisopropyl Adipate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetearyl Alcohol, Brassica Campestris/Aleurites Fordi Oil Copolymer, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Phenoxyethanol, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, C20-22 Alcohols, Isohexadecane, Fragrances, Aluminium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 60, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trolamine, Disodium Edetate, Sorbitan Isostearate\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Light - Medium gel - cream consistency. Lightweight. Doesn't require a lot of rubbing in. Doesn't move around a lot. Leaves a Low- Moderate white cast. Not the kind typical to mineral sunscreens, but more than the Iba Halal sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Lingers.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Naah, it melts away almost instantly if you happen to sweat while applying it, just a spray (accidental rain drop for example) on the face and it wears off from that spot, minor sweating and it rolls down the cheeks, doesn't adhere to the skin. \n\n**Reapplication** : Medium ease. Moves around, kind of sticky when built up. Medium White cast (visibly noticeable) after reapplication. \n\n**Overall Experience** : Um, I had expected a better performance from this one, looking at the ingredients and all, but it stings around the eyes, and on the face, makes my face somewhat tacky, my face becomes oily by afternoon (if applied in the morning). Personally I didn't like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Miss. **WNRP**.\n\n**4-  La Shield Fisico Matte Sunscreen Gel SPF 50+ PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹630 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹441)\n\n**Ingredients** : Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate\n\n**Texture** : White color, pasty. Very thick, \\*very\\* silicone-y (it's silicone based.. So), chokes the skin, spreadability is good, doesn't require a lot of massaging in, quick dry time. Moderate - slightly high white cast. Makes my face sweat! \n\n**Fragrance** : No. Silicone like.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Definitely. Strong staying power. Survives sweating and water splashes too well. Requires double cleanse or a heavy duty face wash to remove. \n\n**Reapplication** : Hahaha! Go ahead and try it if you want to look like a freshly frosted cake! Don't even \\*think\\* about it. Unless you plan to scare people with your literal white walker look. Been there, done that. I'm forever terrified, and will \\*never\\* do it again.\n\n**Overall Experience** : It's a thick paste, Stings around the eyes, which was surprising it being a physical sunscreen (probably because the zinc is micronized? idk) Reapplication is painful, can't apply more than 2 pea sized amount in the first application. Attracts dirt, Chokes my pores, I can't afford to apply something so pore clogging and then strip my facial skin away to remove it.   \n For me, it's not worth the price performance wise.   \n I'm finishing it off as a primer for occasions, smoothes out the face surface, my face gleamed during diwali :P\n\n**Repurchase status** : Miss! **WNRP**.\n\n**5- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Mineral Sunscreen, SPF 50+ PA++++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹295 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹236)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Sodium Chloride, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Perfume, Magnesium Sulphate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Thick cream. Low - medium effort required for blending in the skin. Doesn't move around a lot. Medium - High Dry time. Low white cast (for a mineral sunscreen), medium matte finish. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : No, doesn't survive low- medium sweating. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I haven't used this sunscreen much. My mom used it a few times, and the moment I saw it melting down her face I didn't want to use it. Could have been a great affordable mineral sunscreen, but it's not even mildly water resistant, so I instantly passed on it. Might give it a try in the future. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WNRP**. \n\n**6- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Sunblock and Anti Tan Lotion Tinted Sunscreen, SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 60 ml - ₹245 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water,Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Propylene Glycol, Glyceryl Monostearate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Kaolin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Sodium Sulfite, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Extract, Saxifraga Sarmentosa Extract, Acetyl Tyrosine, Arbutin, Glutathione, Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dimethiconol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, Perfume, Disodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ci 77492, Ci 77491, Ci 77499\n\n**Texture** : Orange color (literally). Medium consistency lotion like. Lightweight. Medium matte finish. Easy application. Doesn't require much effort to blend in. But the color is a literal disaster, it's impossible to apply a full finger length of this sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. On the Higher side. \n\n**Water Resistant** : Maybe a bit more than the mineral sunscreen variant? Not sure, rubs off on the mask \\*very\\* readily. Haven't noticed orange sweat yet, maybe because I haven't worn it enough. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. But I'm pretty sure it's not possible provided the intense color. \n\n**Overall Experience** : It could have been a good,  affordable tinted sunscreen, but the tint is just a disaster.. It dulls my face overall, and it doesn't even work as a bb cream (or sorts) although I don't expect to provide any coverage as per se (which it doesn't anyhow), but I can't find a way to finish it off other than applying it on my hands. Maybe color corrector?? Omg what'd I just come up with 😃💡. Let's see lol \n\n**Repurchase status** : Nope. **WNRP**. \n\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/RVccCB01/IMG-20211119-173651.jpg\n\n**7-** **Malibu LipCare Balm, SPF 30, UVA/UVB** (watermelon variant) \n\n**Quantity - Price** : 5 gm - ₹249-₹299\n\n(bought 2 on amazon for ₹199 each )\n\n**Ingredients** (watermelon) : Petrolatum, Paraffinum Liquidum (Mineral Oil), Paraffin Wax, Ozokerite Wax, Homosalate, Octocrylene, Carnauba Wax, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Flavor  \n May Contain: Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Citral, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol\n\n**Texture** : Ultra Rich, stiff stick, application is not smooth and breezy, tugs and pulls on the lips if you rush it, tightly press it against the surface, let the balm melt and glide on slowly. Makes lips very soft though. Staying power is great! \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Watermelon. Strong. \n\n**Taste** : Bitter Af! Avoid applying it on the insides and corners to keep it from seeping in. \n\n**Water resistant?** : Definitely! Survives liquids (tea, water, juice for me) not very heavy meals. Apply a thick layer to fight the mask rubbing off. Stays on for hours, afternoon - evening, for example. Keeps lips very soft and supple, no stinging sensation. \n\n**Overall Experience** : The only lip balm with spf 30 (plus uva/uvb protection) that has all the ingredients disclosed. Can't ask for more.   \n The only issue is, I can't use it with my waterproof /transferproof matte lipsticks. It makes them water loving and easily transferable, need to figure something out for that.. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : Unless I find some other lip balm with spf 30 mentioning all the ingredients, in a more affordable range, with no bitter taste, and better sunscreen filters. I **WRP** this. \n\nThats about it! Congrats for making it this far! Thanks!\n\n*Edited to add links to images, since I couldn't upload them with the post*",

    "body": "First of all, these are a list of products available in Boots that I've found, so they're non-exhaustive. Apart from some Neutrogena products and No7 Beautiful Skin Blemish Defence Serum, they contain \"alcohol denat.\", which is a dealbreaker for me as I try to avoid drying alcohols as much as I can. \n\nBHAs are few and very far in between, in addition to not being labelled as such and most probably without the percentage of salicylic acid contained or whether it's in the right pH to be effective. \n\nI haven't done a price comparison, and since I found them in Boots I've used the online site's price point. Prices are only as a guide, they may be cheaper/more expensive elsewhere. Ingredients are highlighted to point out the position of salicylic acid, as well as presence of drying alcohols and parfum for those irritated by them. \n\nAdditional suggestions, opinions and reviews are very welcome!\n\n* PRODUCT: Boots Skin Clear Deep Blackhead Cleansing Lotion\n\nPRICE: £2.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua (Water), **Alcohol denat.**, **Salicylic acid**, PPG-1-PEG-9 lauryl glycol ether, Butylene glycol, Potassium hydroxide, Ammonium glycyrrhizate, **Parfum (Fragrance)**, Dipropylene glycol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Deep Cleansing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.29 for 65 exfoliating pads\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat., Salicylic Acid,** Isoceteth-20, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Hydroxide, Triethanolamine, Allantoin, **Parfum**, **Menthol**, Benzyl Salicylate, Disodium EDTA, Limonene, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Pads\n\nPRICE: 5.39 for 65 pads\n\nINGREDIENTS:Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, **Salicylic Acid**, Hydrogen Peroxide, **Parfum**, Sodium Hydroxide, Dextrin, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Superfruits Refreshing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.07\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, Glycerin, **Salicylic Acid**, **Parfum**, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Sodium Hydroxide, Propylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Limonene, Citronellol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Hexyl Cinnamal, Rubus Idaeus Juice, Trideceth-9, Vaccinium Macrocarpon Fruit Juice, Geraniol, Bisabolol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Garnier Pure Active line (various)\n\nPRICE: from £4.99 to £7.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: I can't find an ingredients list anywhere, which is frustrating but as a guide, I remember putting all the Garnier products down because they contain \"Alcohol Denat.\" The packaging lists 2% salicylic acid. No info on pH level. \n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: No7 Beautiful Skin Blemish Defence Serum\n\nPRICE: £16.00\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua (Water), Glycerin, **Salix Nigra (Willow) Bark Extract**, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Citric Acid, Butylene Glycol, Propylene Glycol, Methylparaben, Sodium Citrate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Lupinus Albus Seed Extract, Tetrasodium EDTA, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, Butylparaben, Ethylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Propylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7.\n\nNOTE: As far as I know, willowback extract works as a weaker form of salicylic acid, so I really can't comment on whether there's enough of it to be effective (or if it's in the right pH!), but hey, no alcohols as far as I can see! \n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: No7 Beautiful Skin Pore Minimising Serum\n\nPRICE: £16.00\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua(Water), **Alcohol denat.**, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, HDI/trimethylol hexyliactone cross polymer, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, Dimethicone crosspolymer, Octyldodecanol, Acrylamide/ammonium acrylate copolymer, **Alcohol, Salicylic acid**, Butylene glycol, Polyisobutene, Phenoxyethanol, PEG-30 dipolyhydroxtstearate, Octyldodecylxyloside, Hamamelis virginiana (Witch hazel) water, **Parfum (Fragrance)**, Lens esculenta fruit extract, Sodium PCA, Tocopheryl acetate, Retinyl palmitate, Sorbitan isostearate, Polysorbate 20, Ascorbyl glucoside, Silica, Tetrasodium EDTA, Magnesium PCA, Dipropylene glycol, Spiraea ulmaria extract, Zinc PCA, Potassium hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Manganese PCA, Potassium sorbate, Tocopherol.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Neutrogena Visibly Clear Oil-Free Moisturiser\n\nPRICE: £4.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, Propylene Glycol, Clycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, **Salicylic Acid**, AloeBarbadensis, Chamomilla Recutita, Menthyl Lactate, Glyceryl Stearate, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, PEG-100 Stearate, Sodium Isostearoyl Lactylate, Propylene Glycol Isostearate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Carbomer, Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Probylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, **Parfum**.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Neutrogena Visibly Clear Spot Stress Control 3-in-1 Daily Cleansing Lotion\n\nPRICE: £3.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Butylene Glycol, **Salicylic Acid**, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract, Cucumis Sativus Fruit Extract, C12-15 Alkyl Lactate, Cetyl Lactate, Glycerin, Potassium Lactate, **Isopropyl Alcohol**, Sodium Benzotriazolyl Butylphenol Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Sodium Citrate, Lactic Acid, Sodium Chloride, Disodium EDTA, Benzalkonium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, **Parfum**, Cl 17200, Cl 19140, Cl 42090.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Neutrogena VISIBLY CLEAR Blackhead Eliminating Cleansing Lotion\n\nPRICE: £3.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, Glycerin, **Salicylic Acid**, Menthyl Lactate, **Parfum**\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Neutrogena VISIBLY CLEAR Pink Grapefruit Oil-Free Moisturiser\n\nPRICE: £4.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Cetyl Alcohol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Stearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, **Salicylic Acid**, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Cetyl Lactate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, C12-15 Alkyl Lactate, Dimethicone, Sodium Isostearoyl Lactylate, Propylene Glycol Isostearate, **Alcohol Denat.**, **Isopropyl Alcohol**, Myristyl Alcohol, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Chloride, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Lactic Acid, Benzalkonium Chloride, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, **Parfum**.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Neutrogena Visibly Clear Spot Stress Control Hydrating Spot Treatment (note: currently using this as my BHA, tell me if you want a review.

I'm not sure if it's due to the age of the bottle, or just the ingredients, but I discontinued use.\n\nThen I bought *Boots Skin Clear Deep Cleansing Lotion* which is exactly the same as the Blackhead version just with an extra word on the front.

It goes on really light which I like, but after a while my skin either feels dry, or really oily. I felt it was super hit and miss.\n\nWith the Neutrogena Visibly Clear Spot Stress Control Hydrating Spot Treatment, is that just on acne, do you put it on under moisturiser or as a moisturiser?",

    "body": "I've lurked and occasionally posted on this sub for about a year, and I credit my clear and glowing skin today entirely to the AB suggestions I've seen here.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat was my skin like before? I'm 39 and have had tenaciously stubborn acne (cysts, CCs, blackheads, SFs) since my mid-20s, especially around my chin and nose. Nothing would touch it. I've done two rounds of Accutane (cleared it for about a year each time), and used almost every prescription cream (Retin-A, Epiduo, Duac, Tazorac, etc), BP, BHAs and AHAs. I tried several different birth control pills, I drank the spearmint tea, I did everything, and while some things (BHA stopped the cystic acne in particular, but I purged for two months straight) helped a fair bit, nothing really stopped the acne from showing up every single day.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo what worked for me? I saw a post about using spreadsheets to track your inventory and started using [this one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18GtmaRo0ycwecU4uo6ypfripAZwGHHqrIS0JBB006wE/edit#gid=0)\n linked by u/831106. I'm not sure who created it -- THANK YOU u/831106 for posting it!!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnything that touched my face went on the spreadsheet. I brought my routine down to a minimum using products I was reasonably confident didn't make my skin any worse. And then I tracked everything. I watched my skin. I alternated products, testing each one for two weeks, one on each side of my face, and wrote down what happened. In the end, what helped the most was testing two products of the same kind at a time, i.e two toners at a time, one on each side of my face. I had a lot of products available to test because my best friend has a cosmeceutical skin clinic and she gives me tons of gifts! \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSix months after starting the spreadsheet, I finally identified the ingredients that were breaking me out. For me (YMMV), it was fatty alcohols, mostly cetearyl alcohol. It was an epiphany to realise this, and also a bit of luck. Without knowing it, I'd settled on a night cream and a day moisturiser that happened to be fatty alcohol free, and I'd done a month of testing toners, so I hadn't tested any other creams in that time. And my skin was clear. I then started testing the Joseon cream and another moisturiser and suddenly my face was full of acne again. I stopped the creams, and within three days my skin was clear again. I also realised that almost every cream/moisturiser has fatty alcohols in them. Thankfully AB has more fatty alcohol-free options because it emphasises light layers more than creams.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo now I'm almost two months off the fatty alcohols and I haven't had a single cyst, CC, or blackhead since stopping them. I use BHA and AHA every other day, but I plan to start decreasing the frequency BECAUSE I HAVE NO ACNE anymore!! I use Tazorac and Finecea 3x week for anti-aging and to help fade my PIH. My skin is now normal and balanced and so clear and glowy. And it's all because of the information I learned in this sub. Thanks AB! I hope this will give others encouragement to take the time to really drill down into what is causing acne for you.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR** I tracked all ingredients using a spreadsheet and finally figured out my persistent, 15 year acne struggle was entirely because of fatty alcohols (cetyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol). My skin is now completely acne free, totally balanced, smooth and glowy. Thank you AB!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy current routine (a combination of AB and western products; moving more to AB as I use up my stash):\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Morning**    \n- *Cleanse:* Bioderma Micellar water    \n- *Actives:* Timeless Vitamin C +E with Ferulic Acid; Stridex BHA; PC AHA (BHA alternated with AHA every second day)    \n- *First Essence:* Missha First Treatment Essence    \n- *Hydrating Toner:* The Face Shop Rice Ceramide toner    \n- *Serum:* Timeless B5 Hydration Serum    \n- *Moisturizer:* Clinique DDM Gel (fatty alcohol free)    \n- *Sunscreen:* Biore Watery Essence OR Rationale B3-T Superfluid    \n**The Rationale sunscreen is a new type of sunscreen developed by an Australian cosmeceutical company. It is completely different to normal sunscreens (it's an oily serum, not a cream) and is unlike anything I've ever tried. I burn easily, and it has completely protected my face at the height of an Australian summer. I can do a review of it if anyone is interested, even though it's not AB. Best sunscreen I've ever used.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Night**    \n- *First Cleanse:* Clinique TTDO Balm    \n- *Second Cleanse:* CosRx Low pH Cleanser; Sulwhasoo Snowise Cleansing Foam    \n- *Actives:* Tazorac mixed with Finecea (azelaic acid) 3x/week    \n- *First Essence:* Missha First Treatment Essence; currently testing Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum    \n- *Hydrating Toner:* The Face Shop Rice Ceramide Toner    \n- *Essence:* Olay Miracle Boost Pre-Essence (niacinamide)    \n- *Serum:* Elizabeth Arden Superstart (ceramides, probiotics); currently testing Sulwhasoo Capsulized Ginseng Fortifying Serum    \n- *Moisturizer:* Rosette ceramide gel is on its way to me    \n- *Heavier moisturizer:* The Face Shop Rice Ceramide cream (this has cetearyl olivate in it, which I seem to be ok with)    \n- *Sleeping pack:* Laneige Sleeping Mask    \n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow I hope all that formatting works properly!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEdit: This is my first proper post, so I hope it's helpful and relevant to the community. I'm just so grateful for all the information I've learned here.",

Still probably way higher than most other brands).\n\nThough with these products in general, particularly for the ones with “real” (not pseudo/ceramide precursors), honestly I would be shocked if they were present at more than 0.1 %. Even if they come before the preservatives, the preservatives are probably present at like 0.9% so the company can list them after the fancy ingredients even though the expensive ingredients are at minuscule concentrations. Maybe I’m too cynical, but a >1% concentration of any ceramides would be such a HUGE selling point (not to mention very expensive to produce) that I can’t believe they’re not advertising it\n\nLike Regimen is coming out with one and they are trumpeting the HELL out of it (and I mean fair enough)",

    "body": "**EDIT: I am quite angry. I feel like all of my concerns have been ignored. I woke up today to find that the KK Store owner is actively promoting the glitters on her facebook and giving them away for free. She has obviously chosen to ignore legitimate concerns and carry on regardless. I do not find the neons in the store inventory but she is still promoting unsafe and dangerous products. I have reported the store to the Store Envy team and will be making a complaint to the FDA and I ask that you all do the same.**\n\n**EDIT EDIT: I just received a message from her, she said that she was not the one controlling the facebook page so she didn't see that it was still being promoted. She has also now removed all glitters from sale and will be reformulating them. She asked if I would be interested in doing a follow up review once she has fixed everything and I told her that i would. i think that is only fair :)**\n\n\nEarlier today I made a post asking for advice regarding a brand I had gotten involved with. [The post is here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/31akqi/help_needed_re_possibly_unsafe_cosmetics_and_fda/). My reasons for with holding the brand name were innocent and simple. It was not done maliciously or to cause drama. I had been invited by a friend (who I had \"worked\" with on Rockeresque's promo team) to join up with the Korpse Kosmetics Promo team. As it was a friend who was also part of the group, I happily joined them, expecting the same kind of fun we had in Rockeresque, I stupidly did not research the brand first as I trusted my friend. I am not from the USA and needed some help determining if the products reached FDA guidelines as they are different to my own countries and I didn't want to share the name immediately as I felt that I should inform the owner that :\n\n* 1. I was not happy with the products\n* 2. I felt the products were not to FDA guidelines\n* 3. I would not be promoting them\n\nbefore I went ahead and made a bad review. I have had a few PM's from people who guessed the brand, had similar experiences and a few who were annoyed I didn't straight up out the company. If you feel it was unfair of me to check facts and show a little courtesy to the owner I am sorry that you feel that way.\n\nAnyway, aside from being very irritated with myself for not fact checking and blindly trusting a friend, here is the whole saga.\n\n\n[Pictures are here](http://imgur.com/a/XWyGQ)\n\n\nI agreed to join the Korpse Kosmetics (KK) Promo team in January based on my friends recommendation. The owner was pleased to have me on board and welcomed me to the group She is incredibly friendly and helpful and I hope that she doesn't hate me for an honest review. I placed a large-ish order of 6 lip paints and 4 eyeliners, and I was incredibly excited to get them. A few days after the order was placed I was invited to show my work at a convention. I messaged the owner and asked if it was possible to purchase some sample bags or something to give away to customers. She was very helpful and actually offered to send them with my order for free. So far everything was going to plan.\n\nThe convention was in the first week of March and 5 days before I received a message from Store Envy that my order had been shipped. I knew that it would not arrive in time and asked if the owner would like the sample returning. This question was never answered and it did not matter as by mid March the package was still MIA. I contacted the owner a few times, keeping her updated and she did appear to make efforts to track the package. In the end she re-sent the order with \"a few bonus goodies for the trouble\". Again I was very happy with the communication and service I was receiving and believed the international postage was to blame.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, the package arrived as as most of you will probably understand this feeling, I was excited for products! The light was bad so I decided to wait until this morning to open the package and test, photograph and enjoy the products. As a bonus for the wait I received 4 neon glitters which are promoted as cosmetic grade. All the products came in 5gram clear jars with black lids and home made product stickers (which are pretty cute) So far everything seems on a par with other Indie Brands I have tested.\n\nThen I turned the jars over and instead of finding a little label with ingredients and the shade name, I found a small sticker with a handwritten shade name. Now this seemed a little odd and unprofessional but as someone in the other thread pointed out, they might've chosen to save a few bucks on official stickers. \n\nOn the website I did find an ingredient listing but it was a generic, \"our products contain these\" not specific listings for each shade and product. I also noted that there was not weight or product size information for each product.\n\nNow the glitters have a few problems. First off the sparkle is almost non existent. They are plastic like and are very large sand like chunks. Even my husband thought that I had purchased craft sand and was concerned that I would use it on my face, and he knows NOTHING of cosmetics. They are also a little static, so the particles stick together and it is hard to get a smooth layer don't worry I did not put these on my face!) When compared to one of the LIT Cosmetic glitters it was even more painful to see the low quality.\n\nNext the lipsticks or Lip Paints as they are named. They smelled terrible but I am fully aware that scent is a preference. They are semi solid, quite greasy and some of them were not mixed properly with lumps of unblended (is that the right word?) pigment in the mixture. It is also obvious by the vast amount of air pockets in the jars that the mixture is not made liquid and then decanted into the jars. Instead it seems to be smushed in and does not fill the whole space of the jar. The jars were also in my opinion, carelessly filled. Some were over flowing with product in the threads of the jar, some filled the lid and others appeared to contain less product than others.\n\nWhen I opened the eyeliners I was confronted with the same situation and smell. I also noted immediately that one of the eyeliners appeared to be IDENTICAL to one of the lip paints. Which really annoyed me as I don't want or need two pots of the same product. If the lipstick is eye safe or eyeliner lip safe then I am happy. I also failed to find this information on the website. I swatched the two apparently identical products side by side and I really feel that they are the same. Maybe the eyeliner is *slightly* thicker consistency, but it is not enough for it to be a liner in my opinion. The eyeliners also had the same greasy, vaseline like texture as the lip paints. \n\nI also discovered a fingerprint in the lid of one of the lipsticks.\n\nAt this point I can to r/indiemakeupandmore for some advice regarding cosmetic grade glitter, ingredient listings and the sale of products which are apparently identical but labeled differently.\n\nThrough the post I came into contact with a number of people who had had equally dodgy dealings with the brand but  will leave it up to them to tell their stories.\n\nAn hour after swatching the colours on my arm I developed a red blotchy and itchy rash but now 5 hours later it has subsided and all seems well.\n\nAlso contacted the owner with all of my above concerns. She got back to me and addressed each point:\n(I am going to copy paste her answers)\n\n* Handwritten labels: \"yes I usually write the names on the bottom with the stickers. Since I print all the labels myself it saves a lot of ink\"\n\n* The smell: \"really? they didn't have a smell to me,  In the lip paints I used some essential oils to make it have more of a lipstick smell.\" \n\n* The similarities between lip paint and eyeliner: \"The liners and lip paints are really different tho I do understand how they do look a lot alike and have been trying to change that\"\n\n* Ingredients listings: \"Well I have it on my website. But I can change to printing the bottom labels with the ingredients\" (She also provided me with the ingredients listings but again just generic ingredients, not specific to each shade)\n\n\nEyeshadows: \nKosher Rice Powder, Mica, TITANIUM Dioxide, Iron Oxide & May Contain Some Glitters\n\n\nBlushes: \nKosher Rice Powder, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxide\n\n\nSirens Glow: Kosher Rice Powder, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxide\n\n\nMINERAL Veils: Kosher Rice Powder, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxide\n\n\nLip Paints:Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxide, Castor Seed Oil, Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol, Olive Fruit Oil, HYDROGENATED Castor Oil, Glycine Soybean Lipds, Lauryl Laurate, Carnauba Wax, Candillia Wax.\n\n\n* Fingerprint: \"Well I make sure I sanatize my hands before working on each inditvidual shadow or liner or whatever but I shall get some gloves asap\"\n\n* Glitter:  The glitters are cosmetic grade. I purchased them from a well known site. (she provided me with links to the products she purchased and was under the impression she had purchased [Ben Nye Glitters](http://www.starcostumes.com/Sparklers-Glitter-5-oz-p/abld.htm?1=1&CartID=0), this is the link for the [Neons](http://www.dhgate.com/product/1kg-0-3mm-neon-glitter-dust-body-glitter/181828155.html?utm_source=pla&utm_medium=GMC&utm_campaign=della520&utm_term=181828155&f=bm%7c181828155%7c018009-NailArtSalon%7cGMC%7cAdwords%7cpla%7cdella520%7cUS%7c018009006-NailArt%7cc%7c%7c0LRF%7c&gclid=CjwKEAjw9PioBRDdpqy0-ofG3DgSJAACe5NEqioYBdo-w_TTTg8vhRNOKSl2Zqbfa8_wqrZf1KiwbBoC1ALw_wcB)  I also spoke to my lovely friend who works for a cosmetics company and from the pictures it was said that these glitters are not cosmetic grade. \n\n* When I told her that the glitters were most likely NOT cosmetic grade: \"Are you serious?WTF.....I'm going to have to contact them right now and leave them a nasty message, okay now im really upset. Thank you for letting me know. I really do appreciate it and so so sorry.\nI feel terrible\"\n\n\nNow it is up to you, I feel as though although her answers were a bit vague and sketchy, she seemed genuinely upset about the glitters. Personally I don't know how she thought she was getting Ben Nye for that price, or that she couldn't see that the glitter was not of good quality but I would like to give her the benefit of the doubt. She has promised to make changes and I hope that she does. She was upset but happy that I was honest and the conversation was amicable. She also understood why I would not be joining the promo team and asked if it was ok to get advice if needed. \n\nThe album of the cosmetics is here [Pictures are here](http://imgur.com/a/XWyGQ), linked at the top too, with lots of captions. Sorry for the monster wall of text, I hope everyone is satisfied with this review. I wanted the whole story before making a bad review. I love Indie Brands and this has not put me off. I will continue on my indie quest. In 3 years this is the first bad experience I have had and hopefully it will be my last. To all the awesome Indie Brands out there, I love you!\n",

I've heard cocoa butter can be beneficial for smoothing out boxcar scars, and now I see it helps with PIH too. Does it specifically just have to be cocoa butter, or would this help too? Thanks.",

Only experience will tell how it works in your hair\"\n\n\"That particular silicone is designed to attach to damaged areas in your hair - little chipped cuticle edges, broken cuticles. It doesn't prevent moisture from entering the hair strands. It acts like a conditioning ingredient. It will wash out with almost any detergent. The only detergent that does not remove it very well is Decyl glucoside or Lauryl glucoside - and that only applies when one of those is the *only* detergent in a shampoo\"\n\n-Science-y hair blog.\n\nMeaning, in theory you won't be experiencing buildup but also get the silicone effect. This silicone can be washed off with cocoamidopropyl betaine Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Sodium lauroyl glutamate, Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate all of these can wash out the silicone and all of these are cg approved. \n\nSo, in theory and from a logical point of view, this could be a budget friendly conditioner suitable for curly hair! \n\nAlso if you've used this conditioner please share your experience!",

        "body": "So I was waiting to comment here after trying out their conditioner. It's been a month now and OP, I can't thank you enough for your post. \n\nI have 2B curls with fine hair and it was damaged (bleaching, color, heat treatment 😭) before I started CGM. I started experimenting with combination of products over the last year and realised my hair needs medium level of conditioning and protein makes it very dry. So I stick to a normal routine of washing my hair with SebaMed Anti-dry shampoo(prescribed by my derm) and WOW Morrocan Argan Oil Conditioner. I use a few drops of Nature's Tattva Sweet Almond oil as my leave in and WOW aloe vera gel. This seemed to work for my hair but I still wasn't happy with my hair. \n\nSaw your post and thought of giving the pantene conditioner, Silky Smooth variant in Advanced haircare series a try. And OMG, IT IS CGM FRIENDLY. Still waited a month to be able to judge the conditioner and it works wonders without breaking the pocket. It doesn't have as much slip as a heavy condioner would have though, maybe the damage protection variant might, so I don't recommend it for extremely dry hair. I mainly use it to detangle and am planning to dilute it to use as a leave-in as well.",

    "body": "Basically, I've been on the hunt for affordable, daily wear sunscreens. In my dream world these would come in a big bottle, not these ant-sized 40 or 50ml bottles, but we can't have everything :(\n\nControversial I know, but I quite like alcohol in sunscreens for that quick drying effect and easy wear. All of the sunscreens I'm reviewing here are more indoorsy/low-exposure - I wear the Ambre Solaire Super UV Face Fluid for walks and light outdoors seeing as the UV index isn't super high nor is it very sunny at the moment. Neither are waterproof though so not suitable for long outdoors wear.\n\nAlso, because I'm a massive cheapskate I wear an ultra-cheap/failed sunscreen on my neck so these are for face only.\n\n**MY SKIN:** sensitive to fragrance, dry, acne-prone, kinda starting to get a Differin glow after 2 weeks on Differin so idk what's going on there, but it does make the sunscreens look a bit glowier than usual.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**GARNIER AMBRE SOLAIRE SUPER UV FACE FLUID**\n\n**Price + purchasing:** I bought this at Boots (drugstore in the UK) so obviously very convenient. It cost £8 for 40ml or £0.2 per use.\n\n**Packaging:** IMO the texture of this is a bit too fluid for the nozzle tip, so it has a tendency to run out too much if you're not careful. Also, why is this so small???\n\n**Ingredients:**  Aqua / Water, Alcohol Denat. Diisopropyl Sebacate, Silica, Isopropyl Myristate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Glycerin, C12-22 Alkyl Acrylate/Hydroxyethylacrylate Copolymer, Propanediol, Drometrizole Trisiloxane, Perlite, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Tocopherol, Hydroxyacetophenone Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Hyaluronate, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Phenoxyethanol, Triethanolamine, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Caprylyl Glycol, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Potassium Sorbate\n\n6 UV filters - octisalate, uvinul T150, tinosorb S, avobenzone, mexoryl XL, mexoryl SX\n\nSome tocopherol as an antixoxidant as well.\n\nThis is a dupe of the LRP Shaka Fluid/Invisible Fluid, which is waterproof and has a PPD of 46.6. If the filter concentrations are the same here, then we have 5% octinoxate, 4.5% uvinul T150, 4% tinosorb S, 3.5% avobenzone, 2% mexoryl XL, 0.495% mexoryl SX, total filter concentration 19.495%.\n\nThis isn't marketed as waterproof but the LRP version is, so idk? Maybe they just cheaped out and didn't want to do waterproof testing.\n\n**Feel + finish:** as you apply this it feels very liquid. Dries down quickly and easily (no surprise thanks to the alcohol), with no sticky residue on the skin. This is shinier than the Anti-Age but definitely still quite natural on my skin, more of a slightly glowy finish. No pilling, clumping or settling around the nose bridge of my glasses.\n\n**Overall thoughts:** this is pretty good I have to admit. I feel pretty secure in the protection of this when I'm out and about for shorter periods of time, but again I'm not sure I would wear this to the beach/outdoorsy holidays because it's not confirmed as water-resistant. The finish is so much better than I expected, but it isn't as good as the one below. **4.5/5**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**GARNIER AMBRE SOLAIRE SUPER UV ANTI-AGE FACE PROTECTION CREAM**\n\n**Price + purchasing:** I bought this at Boots (drugstore in the UK) so obviously very convenient. It cost £10 for 50ml or £0.2 per use.\n\n**Packaging:** a very sleek and convenient tube. Apparently it uses 49% less plastic than a conventional Garnier tube and it's got a very slim cap which is space-saving. Only 50ml though :(\n\n**Ingredients:**  Aqua / Water, C12-15alkyl Benzoate, Glycerin, Octocrylene, Niacinamide, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Dimethicone, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Silica, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Vinyldimethicone / Methicone Silsesquioxanecrosspolymer, Terephthalate Tricolicilicolylene Triphetylsilicolylene Stearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Tocopherol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Phenylethylresorcinol, Triethanolamine, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Poloxamer 338, Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, 2 Caprylic Acid\n\n3 UV filters - octocrylene, avobenzone, uvinul T150. This is a fragrance-free dupe of LRP Age-Correct SPF50, which has a PPD of 20. IMO this is plenty for indoorsy, everyday wear so I'm pretty happy with that.\n\nThis also has niacinamide and tocopherol + phenylethyl resorcinol as antioxidants.\n\n**Feel + finish:** this is a medium-weight cream which is definitely moisturising enough to wear without a moisturiser for me in summer, probably perfect for combo-oily skin all year round as well. No white cast and it absorbs very quickly and easily. It leaves a non-sticky, satin finish on my skin, which is very elegant and reminiscent of Purito (which I hated because that didn't absorb well at all, but even more elegant in terms of appearance - this is less glowy for me). No pilling or clumping around the nose bridge. Honestly such a pleasant experience from a fragrance and alcohol free Euro sunscreen - I was shocked.\n\n**Overall thoughts:** ok I'm in love with this as a daily sunscreen. So easy to wear, so pretty on the skin and non-drying! The only con is the small bottle, although it's accessible and I don't have to spend money on shipping which is a major plus. **4.9/5 (every-day HG)**\n\nIf you got to the end of this thanks for reading - please correct me on anything if I'm wrong!",

Sometimes actives are not what your skin is looking for and a good moisturiser can be the game-changer.*\n\n[Just a pic](https://preview.redd.it/p39fzjc4kx661.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=027cc219d95e8947525507a3beec33a9d459f961)\n\nBefore I review the products, these are my expectations from my moisturiser.\n\n1. ***Hydrate:*** Bring water/moisture to my skin\n2. ***Emolliate:*** Thanks to kindofstephen (google his blog or insta if you haven't) for providing a term to my feelings. Make my skin soft and supple by nourishing my stratum corneum with nourishing lipids without clogging my pores.\n3. ***Strengthen my barrier:*** To reduce TEWL by strengthening my barrier so that my skin stays hydrated and supple for longer. This also means I want the moisturiser to have slight occlusive properties.\n4. ***Repair:*** To help my damaged/sensitised skin by repairing my skin barrier.\n5. ***Extras/added benefits:*** Would like if the moisturiser additionally helps to deliver certain ingredients that help with targetted issues like ageing, hyperpigmentation etc. This is not a must though.\n\n\\---\n\n***1. Avene Skin Recover Cream -*** ₹*1500 (depends on discounts); Cost Per gm: ₹30/gm*\n\nThis is my go-to skin-emergency product. I do not use it on daily basis. The texture is cloudlike but not mousse-y. It is a lightweight cream. Nevertheless, it packs a punch. I have gone through 8+ tubes of this stuff. It is the only cream that does not aggravate any sensitised areas (burning/redness/dry patches/peeling patches) and absolutely calms my skin. This cream is true to its name. Repairs compromised flaking, sensitised skin in two days with twice/thrice a day usage. The ingredient list is very minimalistic. It is expensive and the sterile patented packaging kind of sucks because you will most definitely have face squirts if you are not careful. However, I can rely on this cream to fix my skin mistakes.\n\n* Hydrate: 4/5\n* Emmoliate: 4/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 4.5/5\n* Extras: 0/5\n* Status: HG, It is easily available in India but shit is expensive.\n\n***Perfect for: All skin types, Sensitive skin***\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene Aqua), Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Squalane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Serine, Carbomer, Tetrasodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, Water (Aqua)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***2. Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream -*** *$10/* ₹*1300 (with shipping/customs); Cost per gm* ₹6.5/gm\n\nI tried this product a month back and I am in love. This cream is perfectly balanced. It adequately hydrates and emolliates my skin. My skin feels supple and bouncy without being too greasy and the moisture lasts. I did not see noticeable calming benefits but as a moisturiser it is lovely. The tube is huge and a little goes a long way. This has a slight cooling effect when applied to the skin. Also uses a patented encapsulation delivery mechanism to delivery pseudo-ceramides (lab-made) which help to strengthen your skin barrier. In short, it is a simple no frill moisturiser that is easy to use - not too thick, not too thin, not too heavy, not too light, doesn't sensitize, not too silicone-y, doesn't pill, value for money.\n\n* Hydrate: 4/5\n* Emmoliate: 4/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 3.5/5\n* Extras: 0/5\n* Status: will repurchase.\n\n***Perfect for: All skin types***\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Stearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Palmitic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide Mea, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Magnolia Biondii Flower Extract, Cholesterol, Perilla Ocymoides Seed Extract, Lactobacillus/​Soybean Ferment Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohols, Glyceryl Caprylate, Dimethiconol, Mannitol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Alcohol, Acrylates/​Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polysorbate 20, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Propanediol*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***3. Eucerin Q10 Anti Wrinkle Face Cream -*** *$9*\n\nThis is my third tub of this cream. This cream is richer than any cream in the lot. It has a thick emollient texture without being too greasy. It absorbs easily in the skin. It also contains shea butter, SAP and Ubiquinone (Q10). This cream has helped me transition into tretinoin. Do not recommend it for day time use (especially in summers) but for night time/winters it is perfect. It keeps my face moisturised through the night and it has a soft blurring effect on fine lines/skin texture. It did not sensitize peeling skin but helped repair my barrier. I use this regularly at night and it helped to fix the acute dryness that comes with tretinoin. I use it around my eyes and it hasn't given me milia/ clogged my pores. My mom loves and swears by it. She finds it makes her wrinkles look softer.\n\n* Hydrate: 3.5/5\n* Emmoliate: 4.5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 4/5\n* Extras: 3/5\n* Status: HG but not readily available in India. Will stock up when relatives come post covid.\n\n***Perfect for:*** *Combo-dehydrated/Dry/ Mature skin*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Cocoate, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Stearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Octyldodecanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ubiquinone, Biotin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Zea Mays (Corn) Oil, Beta-Carotene, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Phenoxyethanol*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***4. Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume -*** ₹*1300 (with shipping/customs); Cost per gm* ₹6.5/gm\n\nThis cream is unique. As the name suggests it is a cream-balm hybrid but the texture is surprisingly lightweight. Highly emollient with occlusive properties. It absorbs quickly into the skin as the texture is not too heavy. Sadly, it leaves a greasy feeling/film on my skin. I can not use it the day time and worry that it will clog my pores if I use it on my face. I love it for the body especially my Sahara hands. It seriously brings life to my hands and I do not need to reapply often. I did notice a calming effect. Many of my friends from the community love to use it on their face. It is a little too heavy for my face. If your face is very dry, I think you may like this.\n\n* Hydrate: 3/5\n* Emmoliate: 5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 3.5/5\n* Extras: 0\n* Status: WNRP at least for my face.\n\n***Perfect for:***  *Extremely Dry Skin*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Aqua/​Water/​Eau, Glycerin, Paraffinum Liquidum /​ Mineral Oil /​ Huile Minerale, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Behenyl Alcohol, Sucrose Stearate, Canola /​ Canola Oil /​ Huile De Colza, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Pentylene Glycol, Beta-Sitosterol, Xylitol, Zinc Gluconate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Palmitamide Mea, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Rhamnose, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Phytosphingosine, Ceramide Np, Mannitol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide Ap, Cholesterol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Ceramide EOP*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***5. Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream -*** ₹2700 *(estimated); Cost per gm* ₹45/gm\n\nI was sort of disappointed with this product. It is not a bad product but it is not necessarily better. The soft blue colour deceives your mind to think the cream texture may be light. It is actually slightly thick with a silicone-y feel. It has a cooling effect on the skin when you first apply it which tricks the calming feeling. While it is hydrating when you first apply it but compared to others I feel the moisture does not last as long. Also, it makes the sensitised area skin sort of burn. The feeling is not intense but very much against claims. I did not notice any calming/repairing benefits. It may also not be enough moisturisation for the winters. The colour is aesthetically pleasing and silicone-y texture + cooling feel can outwit you into enjoying application but I do not see many real benefits.\n\n* Hydrate: 3/5\n* Emmoliate: 2.5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 3/5\n* Repair: 3/5\n* Extras: 1?\n* Status: WNRP, Expensive.\n\n***Perfect for:***  *Oily/ Combo Dehydrated Skin?*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Centella Asiatica Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Glyceryl Stearate, Stearic Acid, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Polysorbate 60, Bees Wax, Chlorphenesin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Morus Alba Root Extract, Tromethamine, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Guaiazulene, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Lecithin, Acetyl Glutamine, SH-Oligopeptide-1, SH-Oligopeptide-2, SH-Polypeptide-1, SH-Polypeptide-9, SH-Polypeptide-11, Bacillus/​Soybean/​Folic Acid Ferment Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol*\n\n&#x200B;",

    "body": "Dupe of Beauty of Joseon?\nHi, I have recently tried a few products from Korea. While they are not the exact products of Beauty of Joseon, some of the ingredients are similar but of course not exactly the same.  Some of the products are particularly popular in Korea at the moment because Hanbang and plant based?\n\n[KIcho Sheep Oil](http://beautyfaceskin123.blogspot.com/2016/07/review-on-kicho-sheep-oil-cream.html)\n-this product is free from T.E.A, artificial scents, mineral oil, isopropyl alcohol, paraben, urea, heavy metals and formaldehyde.   Since it is anti aging product and is for dry skin, it contains a lot of plants extract(8 types of berries), essential oil, beeswax, silicone, shea butter hyaluronic acid and oils(grapefruit,lemon, orange) Dimethicone is the second ingredients after water.   So, it can be clogging if you do not like those ingredients.  The moisture lasted whole day.  There are ceramide, lanolin, collagen and sea water. No butylene glycol. (press sample, no affiliate link)\n \n[Hansaeng Cosmetics RIN Bi-gyeol Soo Essence](http://beautyfaceskin123.blogspot.com/2016/07/review-on-hansaeng-cosmetics-rin-bi.html)\nThis is a hanbang skincare from Korea. Niacinamide is high on the list along with a lot of hanbang which include the famous ginseng ingredients(6 fermented years). It has floral scent to it. Texture is light and absorb well.  It has Triethanol amine  which some said it is dangerous but it is not a problem for me.  No paraben.( press sample ,no affiliate link)\n\n[Hansaeng Cosmetics RIN Bi-gyeol Soo Cream](http://beautyfaceskin123.blogspot.com/2016/07/review-on-hansaeng-cosmetics-rin-bi_28.html)\nIt has the same hanbang ingredients(fermented 6 years ginseng) in the cream with the same smell but with different kind of texture. It is pretty light and calming. The jar is of course luxurious and looks like a blue pearl. Niacinamide is lower than the essence but it is still high. No paraben but contains Triethanol amine  to adjust the ph.

    "body": "Hi all!  \n\n\nI am back with another skin conditions post. This one is on perioral dermatitis.   \n\n\nAdmittedly, when I began researching this, I knew zilch about PD except that it was acne-like breakouts around the mouth,  and as I began to research it, it seems that there isn't a whole lot that is known about it. Fortunately, it is a highly treatable condition that seems to overlap to a degree with rosacea (earning it the earlier name  of \"steroid rosacea\") and even seborrheic dermatitis.  \n\n\n**As always, please feel free to correct or inform me of anything wrong, and also feel free to post/discuss what helps your PD.**\n\n# What is Perioral Dermatitis\n\nPerioral dermatitis (PD) is a chronic, recurrant inflammatory disease that most commonly occurs in the perioral region of the face (the area around the mouth). It can also affect the area around the nose, and in roughly 20&#37; of cases, it can manifest around the eyes (though it goes by another name if around the eyes: peri-orificial dermatitis).   \n\n\nIt afflicts around 1&#37; of the population of the United States, particularly those with fair skin, and predominately occurs in women between 18-45, with 20s and 30s having peak incidence.   \n\n\nIt presents as small, red, tender, sometimes itchy bumps that can flake and burn. While commonly mistaken for acne, it is distinct from acne in that it only presents in specific locations, spares the small area around the lips, and lacks pustules (whiteheads).\n\n# Causes of Perioral Dermatitis\n\nThe causes of perioral dermatitis are unclear. It is a relatively \"young\" disease that was only first described as a distinct condition in 1964. It is first and foremost an inflammatory condition, and is aggravated by ingredients and habits that can create inflammation either in the skin or in the body. \n\nWhile I was researching PD, the one constant that showed up again and again is that it is aggravated by corticosteroid use -- both topical and inhaled. To specify, that means not just creams like kenalog, triamcinolone, and over-the-counter hydrocortisone, but also asthma inhalers (including Advair, Flovent, and ProAir aka Albuterol) and nasal allergy mists like Beconase, Flonase, Nasonex, Omnaris, and Veramyst. \n\nLess commonly, but still a factor to consider are hormones, where monthly shifts can put the condition into overdrive. More frustrating is that oral contraceptives can worsen PD in some. \n\nOther causes can be fluoridated toothpaste, high SPF value sunscreens¹, sunscreens with the filters zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, the ingredient \"isopropyl myristate,\" improperly removing makeup or sleeping in makeup, occlusive ointments (Vaseline, Aquaphor, and oils, for example), heavy creams with occlusive ingredients, and cold creams (wipe-off cleansing creams that leave a residue, like Pond's). In one case, a woman's favorite lip balm (containing the ingredient propyl gallate) caused her PD.⁶\n\n# Treatment\n\nPD can look like many other conditions, such as acne, angular cheilitis, rosacea, or seborrheic dermatitis, and requires treatment of a professional due to the inflammatory nature of the condition. \n\nThe most important thing for anyone suffering from PD is to discontinue steroid use - whether cold-turkey or weened off with the management of a healthcare professional. While topical steroids can seem to improve the condition, they frequently create a rebound effect, which can make the condition worse. \n\nOnce steroids are removed, the skin will get worse before getting better. This is the toughest part of PD for most people. Topical antibiotics or topical immunosuppresants (such as Pimecrolimus or Elidel) are frequently prescribed due to their tremendously  helpful anti-inflammatory effects on PD, and azelaic acid can prove useful in some cases. In very severe cases, oral antibiotics can be prescribed in addition to topicals. \n\nWhile healing from PD, the skin should not be cleansed with any cleanser, and makeup and skincare products should be avoided completely until the condition resolves. And no matter how tempting, PD should never be scrubbed, as this worsens the inflammation. \n\nOnce treated, it is encouraged to use liquid or gel sunscreens as well as soap-free cleansers that do not dry out the skin, as TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) is significant in people who suffer from PD.\n\n# Long-Term Care\n\nSome people have PD once in their lives, while others may combat it on and off for several years. If you fall into the latter, it is important to try to avoid triggers that can cause the condition to reoccur (particularly steroid use). That means cleansing your skin each day with gentle cleansers, always removing makeup (removing it with a wipe does *NOT* count - you need to cleanse it away thoroughly with an oil cleanser that rinses cleanly), and using light products, particularly around the areas typically affected. \n\nPrescriptions like azelaic acid and over-the-counter .1&#37; adapalene (Differin)² may  also help to manage the condition in the long-term. \n\nI've put together a list below of some cleansers and moisturizers that are recommended for people suffering from PD. Again, like with my rosacea list, this is not a be-all-end-all list. None of the products listed contain isopropyl myristate or heavy occlusive ingredients.\n\n## Recommended Products\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser** \n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Stearyl Alcohol and Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate​,​ Polysorbate 60​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Panthenol​,​ T-Butyl Alcohol,​ Tocopherol​.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Wate/Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryl Glycol/Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**Avene Extremely Gentle Cleanser Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (avene Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Serine, Cetrimonium Bromide, Coco-Glucoside, Dipotassium Phosphate, Disodium Edta, Disodium Phosphate, O-Phenylphenol, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Water (Aqua).*\n\n**Spectro Jel Cleanser for Blemish-Prone Skin - Fragrance Free**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Hydroxypropyl Methocellulose, Polysorbate 20, Cetyl Alcohol (moisturizer), Hydrated Silica, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Diazolidinyl Urea, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Sorbitan Oleate.*\n\n## Foaming Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Terastearate, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric, Glycerides, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Sodium Chloride, Phytosphingosine, Citric Acid, Edetate Disodium, Dihydrate, Sodium, Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Olay Foaming Face Wash Sensitive**\n\n>*Ingredients: Water/Eau, Glycerin, Sodium Myristoyl Sarcosinate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Polyquaternium-10, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Laureth-10, Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, DMDM Hydantoin.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate​,​ PEG-120 Methyl Glucoside Dioleate,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Hydroxide​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Capryloyl Glycine​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Citric Acid​,​ Acrylates Copolymer​.*\n\n## Makeup Removers\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm**\n\n>*Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Polyethylene, PEG-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Water / Aqua / Eau, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol.*\n\n**Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Mineral Oil, PEG-8 Glyceryl Isostearate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclomethicone, Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Isostearic Acid, Glycerin, Phenoexyethanol.*\n\n## Moisturizers\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Ceteareth-20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Phosphate, Potassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben.*\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3-Diisosterate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide 1, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium phosphate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 20, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Active - Dimethicone, 1\\%.

        "body": "I’ve been diagnosed with Peri-orbital Dermatitis by my dermatologist. I’ve had it for at least 10 years. Peri-orbital means it presents around my eyes, nose and mouth. My worst flare ups cover all three areas, my most frequent flare ups present just around my nostrils. \n\nYes, you’re correct that causes are basically unknown. Successful treatments can vary wildly. \n\n(personally, I’m convinced it has a fungal element, specially related to candida imbalance. That’s just my opinion. I have used OTC topicalS and been prescribed anti-fungal topicals and pills, none of that worked. I believe it is related to gut microbiome health. Our skin is a direct reflection of what’s going on intrinsically in our bodies) \n\nI want chime in here about Zinc Oxide. You mention it as a possible cause. I want others out here to know that high concentration Zinc Oxide Cream is the ONLY thing that stops my flare ups. So if you have PD, I recommend patch testing a high ZO cream on one or two of the papules and see if it helps you. Incidentally, I’ve found recently that micronized ZO particles actually work faster for my than larger particles. So I stopped using Desitin Max strength and started using Neutrogena Sheer Zinc for face with 22% ZO. It stops my flare ups completely in a matter of a day or so, versus 4+ days with the Desitin. \n\nI’ll list below everything I’ve tried in case it’s helpful. The other product I find helpful is daily probiotic pills containing Lactobacillus Acidophilus. I get less flare ups when I take daily probiotics. \n\nDIDN’T WORK: \nAntibacterial Rx creams, I believe I had both Erythromycin and Dapsone. OTC antifungal creams, clotrimazole, miconazole and terbinafine. I also had an oral Rx for Lamisil, it was generic and I can’t recall the generic name. OTC topical steroids, hydrocortisone. Violet extract. Cutting out SLS from from my toothpaste and hair products. (I never cleansed with SLS, always either soap or oil) Changing my diet to an acne safe diet. Getting sun. Staying out of sun. Sulphur washes. Leaving it alone.",

I had no idea what perioral dermatitis was and assumed all this redness was broken capillaries from a Clarisonic. \n\nIt wasn’t until I went to a dermatologist and asked her about it that she said it looked like perioral dermatitis. I was prescribed Finacea and in one month the results have been astounding. Redness has significantly reduced and no closed comedones or inflamed pimples anywhere. Again mine wasn’t severe but for anyone who has it I think azelaic acid is a great choice. \n\nI should point out I never use steroids, I’m 30F and I think this was due to over moisturizing after over exfoliating. I also think the occlusive nature of aquaphor made it much worse. My routine now consists of nothing but cleanser, moisturizer and Finacea. Drastic change from what I was doing before. \n\nThank you for taking the time to post this very informative breakdown of perioral dermatitis.",

It smells plasticky to me.\n\n-1 point for the weird waxy feeling of this crea on my skin. \n\nBesides for that, this cream is absolutely perfect. Its moisturizing, its thick, and its occlusive. It took me 2 years to finish this because I really disliked the waxy feeling when I first started using it so I stopped for about 6 months. Then I came back to it and have been using it consistently once a day before sleeping. \n\nBesides for the discontinued Laneige Timefreeze sleeping mask, this is a good moisturizer for my very dry skin; skin so dry that it would flakes off in small pieces during the winter months if I dont apply moisturizer. \n\nWorks great under makeup for me, but it may be because I have dry skin so it gets absorbed in quickly. However I could imagine that makeup would be slippy on top on a layer of cream if your skin is less dry than mine. \n\nRight now Im exploring other creams to find my holy grail but if I cant find anything, I would fall back on this one. \n\nMy ranking of best moisturizer for my dry skin: \n\n1. Laneige Timefreeze sleeping mask. (Discontinued)\n\n2. Etude Soon Jung 2x Barrier Cream (od version-discontinued). This one was slightly less moisturizing, but it beats the Kikumasamune one for being scentless and came in an easy squeeze tube. \n\n3. Kikumasamune Sake Cream\n\n4. Illyoon Ceramide Ato Cream. Nice squeeze tube. Tube is really wide though. No scent. Non-fussy. \n\n5. Laneige Cica sleeping mask. Pleasant scent. Jar. Less moisturizing than the above 3 but has a nice calming effect thats helpful in the summertime. \n\n6. Hanyul Rice cream. Perfumed rice scent. Great moisturizer. Bouncy cream texture. More expensive than most of the other ones on this list. \n\n7. Hanyul Pure Artemisia cream. Lovely calming cream. Really similar to the Laneige cica cream. Pricier than the other products on this list. \n\n8. Sulwhasoo Overnight Vitalizing Sleeping mask. Great daytime moisturizer. Too much ginseng breaks me out though.  ",

Since then I’ve found some products that work really well for me and which haven’t been mentioned on this sub before, so I decided to share my shelfie and write some reviews.\n\nI'm happy to hear your opinion about the products or my routine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Skin type**\n\nDry and sensitive, some general redness, not acne-prone.\n\nMy skin reacts to most artificial fragrances and some essential oils. \n\nI also prefer to use products with “natural” ingredients and try to avoid parabens, PEGs, micro plastic and mineral oil as much as possible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Products (from left to right):**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch** \n\nINCI: AQUA, CENTAUREA CYANUS FLOWER WATER, DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS HYBRID OIL, CETEARYL WHEAT STRAW GLYCOSIDES, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM BENZOATE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, STEARIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, TOCOPHEROL, LACTIC ACID\n\nPrice 11 € for 200ml, available at Müller drugstore in Germany\n\nThis gentle cleansing milk is one of my holy grail products. All other cleansers that I’ve tried before where either super drying and/or made me break out. This one isn’t drying at all and yet leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. Only on days when I wear a lot of makeup I need to do an additional oil cleanse. I like that the formulation is not too watery, so it’s easy to spread on my face. It doesn’t have a noticeable smell. The bottle lasts a long time for me, usually over 6 months even with daily use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme**\n\nINCI: HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, ETHYLHEXYL STEARATE, CERA ALBA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, KAOLIN, ZINC OXIDE, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND) OIL, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice 2 € for 50ml, available at Rossmann drugstore \n\nThis water free balm with oils and beeswax is a thick and oily formulation, similar to a cold cream. I sometimes use it on cold and dry winter days as a thin layer between my daytime moisturizer and sunscreen. I’m not sure if it truly qualifies as an occlusive cream, but in my experience it does help with preventing moisture loss in dry weather. It takes a while to get absorbed into the skin. A little goes a long way and when you apply too much your face is going to shine like crazy. I noticed that when I use this cream several days in a row my skin texture starts to feel a bit smoother than usual. The beeswax smell is nice too. It works well under makeup as long as you give it enough time to dry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dermaveel  (OTC pharmacy cream, made by HEEL)**\n\nINCI: ECTOIN\\*, AQUA, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PANTHENOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, SQUALANE, TOCOPHEROL, OLEA EUROPAEA FRUIT OIL, HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, VANILLA PLANIFOLIA FRUIT EXTRACT, ALCOHOL DENAT., CARBOMER, SODIUM CARBOMER, RHIZOBIAN GUM, CORYLUS AVELLANA BARK EXTRACT, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, C12-16 ALCOHOLS, PALMITIC ACID, CERAMIDE 3\n\n\\*Since this cream is a medical product, its active ingredient (Ectoin) is listed first, even though it’s not the main ingredient.\n\nPrice about 10 € for 30ml in online pharmacies \n\nSo this is a medical product for people with neurodermatitis that was recommended to me by my dermatologist. It has a thick, slightly oily consistency but doesn’t take too long to get absorbed into skin. The smell is slightly chemical. Its active ingredient, Ectoin, is supposed to protect skin cells from environmental stress factors and help with skin barrier restoration. It is also used in other products such as eye drops and nasal sprays.\n\nNow I don’t know enough about skincare to judge how solid the research behind this patented molecule is. When my skin was a bit over exfoliated a few months ago, my experience was that Dermaveel was in fact better at repairing my damaged skin barrier than other moisturizers that I tried.\n\nI only use this cream during the winter months; it’s too heavy for warm summer days, even for my dry skin. I use it as a daytime moisturizer a few times per week; I find it a bit too pricey for everyday use. Unfortunately it does sometimes pill up under my makeup foundation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Manuka Repair Creme/Miel de Manuka Crème Réparatrice (OTC pharmacy cream, made by French brand Comptoirs & Compagnies)**\n\nINCI: MEL, AQUA, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, MACADAMIA TERNIFOLIA SEED OIL, GLYCERYL STEARATE, SQUALANE,SODIUM STEAROYL GLUTAMATE, LEVULINIC ACID, PHENETHYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, BISABOLOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM LEVULINATE, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice about 10 € for 40ml in online pharmacies\n\nThe reason why I bought this was simply that I really wanted to try a Manuka product. It contains 40% GMO 300 Manuka Honey. This isn’t exactly the highest GMO rating, but it’s the best price-performance ratio I could find. Despite its 40% honey content it has an average moisturizer consistency, not sticky, dries fast. The smell is amazing! Very sweet, smells of honey and beeswax.\n\nWith my dry skin I found it not hydrating enough as standalone moisturizer, though it might work for normal to oily skin. I apply this in the evening (few times a week) in combination with my usual moisturizer (TO NMF). On the next morning my skin is smooth and soft; feels slightly exfoliated and overall texture seems to be improved. Manuka honey, or honey in general, is said to have exfoliating properties. Manuka also has anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial effects though I can’t really comment on that since I luckily don’t have any breakouts at the moment.\n\nOnce or twice I made the mistake to use the Manuka repair cream on the same evening as my AHA exfoliator- which resulted in slightly flakey skin on the next morning. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dado Sens Sun - Sonnencreme SPF 30**\n\nINCI: AQUA \\[WATER\\], DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE (UVINUL A PLUS) , ALCOHOL, ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE (UVINUL T 150), BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE (TINOSORB S), GLYCERIN, ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE (OCTISALATE), SUCROSE PALMITATE, DISTARCH PHOSPHATE, PANTHENOL, TITANIUM DIOXIDE (NON-NANO), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CANDELILLA/JOJOBA/RICE BRAN POLYGLYCERYL-3 ESTERS, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM STEAROYL LACTYLATE, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, BENZYLIDENE DIMETHOXYDIMETHYLINDANONE, ALLANTOIN, POLYHYDROXYSTEARIC ACID, SODIUM ALGINATE, CALCIUM ALGINATE, GLYCINE SOJA OIL \\[SOYBEAN\\], ALUMINA, STEARIC ACID, ECTOIN, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, LECITHIN, TOCOPHEROL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE\n\nPrice 20 € for 125ml, available at Müller, Douglas\n\nThis is my favourite sunscreen ever! Definitely a holy grail candidate. Sunscreens have always been a bit problematic for me, for two reasons: 1: I need to use a product without acrylates, which unfortunately are an ingredient in nearly every sunscreen formulation ever.  2: I’m a bit picky about sunscreen filters; I’d rather not use problematic filters like Octocrylene, Octinoxate, Oxybenzone and Homosalate. And now I finally found something that works for me!\n\nDado Sens Sonnencreme SPF 30 has a thick, creamy consistency, perfect for my dry skin but it is probably too much for oily skin. There is no noticeable white cast, however I’m pale as ghost anyway, so results might be different for darker skin tones. It leaves a small amount of shine but I’m not too bothered by this. Smell is slightly chemical (different from usual sunscreen smell) but not very strong.\n\nThe downsides are that it has only SPF 30 and contains alcohol. I don’t find it drying though. What I like best about it is that it has great filters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, PROPANEDIOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ARGININE, ASPARTIC ACID, GLYCINE, ALANINE, SERINE, VALINE, ISOLEUCINE, PROLINE, THREONINE, HISTIDINE, PHENYLALANINE, GLUCOSE, MALTOSE, FRUCTOSE, TREHALOSE, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SODIUM LACTATE, UREA, ALLANTOIN, LINOLEIC ACID, OLEIC ACID, PHYTOSTERYL CANOLA GLYCERIDES, PALMITIC ACID, STEARIC ACID, LECITHIN, TRIOLEIN, TOCOPHEROL, CARBOMER, ISOCETETH-20, POLYSORBATE 60, SODIUM CHLORIDE, CITRIC ACID, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, TRIETHANOLAMINE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, PHENOXYETHANOL, CHLORPHENESIN\n\nPrice 10 € for 100ml, available at Douglas\n\nI actually don’t want to write too much about this one, there are already tons of reviews on this sub. It has fairly good INCIs, doesn’t dry or break me out and is cheap – that’s all that I want in a moisturizer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), LACTIC ACID, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PROPANEDIOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE CROSSPOLYMER, TASMANNIA LANCEOLATA FRUIT/LEAF EXTRACT, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM, XANTHAN GUM, ISOCETETH-20, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL\n\nPrice 7 € for 30ml, available at Douglas\n\nThis is the first acid exfoliator I ever bought, so I can’t really compare it to other products. After a short purging period it got rid of the tiny closed comedones I had all over my face within about 6 weeks.  I like it a lot and use it about twice per week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Timeless Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin C Serum**\n\nINCI: WATER, MAGNESIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE, ALOE BARBADENSIS, GLYCERIN, HYALURONIC ACID, MATRIXYL 3000™, BENZYLALCOHOL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID\n\nThis is usually not available in Europe. I found it at my local TK Maxx store for 10 €. Bought it because I wanted to try Vitamin C. The lightweight, watery formulation is nice. It doesn’t have any noticeable smell.\n\nI’ve been using this for 8 weeks now and don’t really see any difference. When it’s empty I’m probably going to replace it with a more potent Vitamin C product from The Ordinary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Salthouse Totes Meer Therapie - Beruhigende Maske Akut** (Picture only shows lower half of sachet)\n\nINCI: AQUA, CELLULOSE GUM, GLYCERIN, PANTHENOL, PROPANEDIOL, MARIS SAL (DEAD SEA SALT), PROPYLENE GLYCOL, MAYTENUS MACROCARPA (CHUCHUHUASI) BARK EXTRACT, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE POWDER, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) LEAF EXTRACT, CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA FLOWER EXTRACT, PHENOXYETHANOL, CITRIC ACID, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL ALCOHOL\n\nPrice 1.25€ for 2x7ml, available at DM drugstore\n\nThis is a gel mask with Dead Sea salt and other calming ingredients. It calms down irritated skin and reduces redness. Most of the time it doesn’t completely get rid of the redness, but there is a visible difference. A hydrating, oil free formulation which I think is suitable for all skin types. The smell is slightly sweet but otherwise neutral. As usual, one of those “single-use” sachets is enough for at least three applications. It’s currently not a permanent part of my routine, but I use it whenever my skin gets irritated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Schaebens Augen & Lippen Maske**\n\nINCI: AQUA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, DIISOSTEAROYL POLYGLYCERYL-3 DIMER DILINOLEATE, GLYCERIN, CERA ALBA, ZINC STEARATE, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, CITRUS LIMON PEEL OIL, GLYCINE SOJA OIL, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA WATER, PANTHENOL, RETINYL PALMITATE, TOCOPHEROL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, UBIQUINONE, ALCOHOL, BENZOIC ACID, CITRAL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE, LACTIC ACID, LIMONENE, MAGNESIUM SULFATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBIC ACID\n\nPrice 0.60€ for 4x1.5ml, available at DM, Rossmann\n\nThis is the only product with essential oils that I put on my face. It works surprisingly well for my sensitive skin. Even though it is advertised as an eye-and–lip mask and the instructions say to take it off after 10 mins., I use it as an overnight leave on mask for my whole face.\n\nIn the morning my skin feels plump and well hydrated. The mask reduces very fine lines overnight. Not permanently of course, but the effect does last at least a day for me.\n\nWhen I use this mask everyday my pores start to clog up after a while, so I make sure to not use it too frequently. 2 or 3 times a week is completely fine though. It’s also super cheap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Current Routine**\n\n**AM**\n\n\\-wash face with water\n\n\\- moisturizer: either TO NMF or Dermaveel\n\n\\- on cold days:  Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme\n\n\\- sunscreen: Dado Sens  Sun Sonnencreme SPF 30\n\n**PM**\n\n\\- Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch\n\n\\- one of the following:\n\n* TO NMF\n* TO LA 5% + TO NMF\n* Timeless HAC Serum + TO NMF\n* Manuka Repair Creme + TO NMF\n* Schaebens Augen und Lippen Maske as leave on overnight mask on whole face",

    "body": "Disclaimer: I'm Randy and I am related to the businesses - Besfren Beauty and Masksheets.com. The contents below does not contain any product information and it does not include any information that can be used in favor of my affiliated business. \n\nTHIS IS MOD APPROVED ARTICLE: so I submitted this posting for proof-read before I post this.  \n\nAlcohol for your skin\n\nSo, let’s talk about something uncomfortable here, both for cosmetic curator like me and k-beauty fan like you. So do we really have to avoid them like we do for parabens? Or we can just chill out and say “Come on, it’s gonna be fine.” So, this time I want to talk about alcohols and cosmetics.  \n\nSo, what is alcohol? In organic chemistry, alcohol is defined as any molecule with –OH (hydroxyl) group on their structure. Generally these guys have name –ol as a suffix, so we can easily recognize alcohols in many cosmetic ingredients. So by this definition, plenty of known moisturizers contains full of alcohol? So butylene glycol, butylenes glycol, panthenol are all alcohol family, so do we have to avoid them for moisturized skin? \n\nThe answer is ABSOLUTLEY NO. The character of alcohol is heavily influenced by their main body. So, one or two –OH on long carbon chain (a.k.a fat) won’t dry up your skin. Then, why so many people talk about the alcohol-free toners and moisturizer? Because when we say “alcohol”, it generally refers to the ethanol or Alcohol Denatured (sometimes it is written as Alcohol Denat. Or SD alcohol.)\n\n In mid 20th, the cream-type cleanser and alcohol based toner became popular in Europe (especially in Paris.) At that time, the make-up products contained quite thick, paint like pigments so people needed oil based creams to clean them up. Also, in Paris’ tap water, the lime concentration was really high this cream-alcohol toner routine was widely accepted. In other words, the purpose of first toner was to get rid of oily residue of those cream-type cleansers. Back in the days, manufacturers just added alcohol denatured into the toner, simply because their model products from European contained it, without much rational thinking. But, cosmetic companies in 80’s actually realized people sort of like it. Because evaporating of alcohol is endothermic process (meaning, it absorbs heat from skin,) so it gives “coolness” or “refreshes” feeling to skin and cosmetic brands keep them in their ingredient list, and cosmetic producers began to use alcohol denatured in non-toner products for this “refreshing” texture such as serum, emulsion and gel-type creams. \n\nOf course, denatured alcohol has various functions other than this “refreshing” texture, a.k.a “penetration enhancer.” It is known anti-septic, and as they used for alcohol in mid 20th, it may be used as a lipid solvent (dissolving oil contents with mixture) as well. However, science – more specifically so-called “organic” boom didn’t allow ethanol’s glory for long. Several researches suggested some concerns over alcohol denatured, and people began to hate this. \n\nI have mixed feeling about alcohol denatured. Yes, it dries up your skin very quick and it is a quite strong skin irritant for someone. But, generally most of the researches were done in relatively high concentration of ethanol so we don’t really have to be concerned about alcohol denatured in the ingredients list as long as you don’t have irritation. I mean, it certainly gives quick-absorbing, refreshing finish on your skin. This applies to isopropyl alcohol as well that has very similar molecular structure to ethanol (one more carbon branch though.) \n\nActually, we have more alcohols other than those fast drying alcohols. Actually it is quite opposite. Long carbon chain alcohols such as stearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, and caprylic alcohol are used to thicken the texture and to emulsify the mixture. So, those alcohols contains long carbon (fat chain), so it makes texture heavier and prevent dehydration of your skin. Recently, 1-2 hexanediol is often used in sheet masks and other products because it does not affect the texture of the solution so nicely stabilizes cosmetics while providing hydration to skin.\n\nSo my point is, we always have to know what we are paying for. If you are sensitive to alcohol denatured, we definitely should avoid products that contain it, but we do not really have to be overly concerned when we see other fatty alcohols. They are not same alcohols. Do not get obsessed with refreshing, fast-absorbing texture if you have dry skin. Some stickiness or some greasy feeling sometimes does great things on your skin.   \n",

        "body": "Thanks for the informative read!\n\nI have sensitivity to alcohol (typical for someone with sensitive skin, I guess), but I use a lot of products with alcohol, because it depends on **both** the combination and concentration (and type) of alcohol **with** the **other** ingredients.\n\nSometimes, combinations that cause me problems can be avoided if I only use the product for a short time, such as rinsing off after masking (those masks that come in tubes, not sheet masks).\n\n> So do we really have to avoid them like we do for parabens?\n\nI've never avoided parabens and never will. Not all parabens are equal, either. Products with methylparaben actually help my skin tolerate certain trigger-ish ingredients much better (I'm not sure why, I'm just going on my personal experience, and this only applies to me).\n\nMany of my previously-favorite products (using methylparabens) changed their preservatives to be \"paraben free\" during the big paraben scare a few years ago, and I couldn't use them any more :(\n\nI'm actually very suspicious of \"paraben free\" products, because there's a lot less information about the ingredients used to replace the parabens. There's plenty of information and research done on methylparaben.",

Re'equil one is available in only one size, 100gm for Rs 350.\n* *Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:* DAM- HG/WRP, RE'EQUIL: WNRP.\n\n**Experience:** \n\nHello all\n\nUsually I use lighter moisturiser but winters had me looking for an apt moituriser for my skin, since it gets dry and skin tends to become flaky. I was earlier using Simple Light moisturiser and Disguise Cosmetic's Sorbet, but both of these were proving insufficient for winters, hence decided to try DAM and Re'equil.\n\nAs you can see both of them have beautiful ingredients, though Re'equil one has fragrance (it is the last ingredient, the smell is mild and nice) while DAM is fragrance free.\n\nFor my skin type, I require a small amount of both of these  moisturisers. Though Re'equil is heavier- it is a cream albeit not a thick one, while DAM is lighter comparatively and has lotion like consistency.\n\nI started with using DAM during the morning routine. Needless to say, my skin did not feel dry at all. There was no need for reapplication either. It also did not react with my skin. So overall, I am very satisfied with this. Might this be love? Probably.\n\nRe'equil one I used in my PM routine. Now this moisturiser and I go long back because back in June, I got this for my younger sibling, who has a dry-dehydrated skin which is also prone to blackheads, whiteheads and acne. I wanted her to start looking after her skin a bit so I got her a bunch of products, one of which was this. It suited her nicely, though it is another matter altogether that she was never consistent with her routine. I guess skincare enlightenment has to occur on its own to a person for one to really get invested in it. Sigh. \n\nI also would use it occasionally then, and it did feel a little heavy on my combination skin so I decided to use it during winters. Cut to November, I started applying it in my nighttime routine. However after a couple of days, I could see some acne on my forehead. It probably clogged my pores. I stopped using it for some time, and the acne receded (my skin is not acne prone). I thought I should give it a try again, and once more I could see tiny acne on my forehead. I have since then decided to cut it off my routine. It is a great moisturiser, very nourishing. As mentioned, it works for my sister, but unfortunately it is not for me. \n\nRe'equil's finish is more matte, and it can be seen and felt immediately while DAM can feel slightly greasy on immediate application but sinks in fast and also provides a nice, smooth finish.\n\n**Conclusion**: So for the past one week, I have been using DAM in my AM as well as PM routine and I am more than satisfied. I think DAM is going to be my HG for winters atleast. Not sure how it is going to fare in summers, that remains to be seen. Hope this is helpful for folks looking for winter moisturisers. :)",

Re'equil on my skin felt stickier on my skin and didn't sit comfortably the couple times i used it. DAM feels light and absorbs well. Another odd thing I felt with the Re'equil moisturizer was that it left a slight white cast which I didnt appreciate at all, especially in the AM when I'm expecting a white cast from my sunscreen as well. \nMy vote goes for Cetaphil in the two.",

In the BoxyCharm Premium box the high price item ****possible spoiler if you haven’t gotten your December box but it’s crap anyway***** is the Avant Supreme Hyaluronic Acid Antioxidising DUO moisturizer. They claim this item is worth $134 and it would be if it had the actual ingredients in it that the true product does. From the Avant website (where it is on sale for $87) these are the true ingredients:\n\nAllantoin, aqua (water), ascorbyl palmitate, caprylic/capric, triglyceride, cetearyl alcohol, cetearyl, glucoside, cetyl alcohol, chlorphenesin, CI 17200 (D&C Red No. 33), CI 42090 (FD&C Blu No. 1), citric acid, dimethicone, dimethicone crosspolymer, ethylhexyl, palmitate, ethylhexylglycerin, lecithin, maris aqua (sea water), ozokerite, parfum (fragrance), Persea gratissima (avocado) oil, phenoxyethanol, potassium cetyl phosphate, propylene glycol, Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, sodium hyaluronate sodium polyacrylate, sorbitol stearyl alcohol, tocopherol, xanthan gum.\n\nThe first few on the BoxyCharm version in order are: Aqua (water), caprylic/capric triglyceride,ethylhexyl palmitate,cetyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, dimethicone, sorbitol.......you get the picture\n\nSo from now on if you are a BoxyCharm customer I’d encourage you to check your ingredients against the manufacturers website to see if they are just giving you garbage to try to make it sound like you are getting an amazing deal.",

    "body": "Hey everyone! Before I got super busy with my new job, I used to regularly post reviews over on r/AsianBeauty. I really enjoyed that process, and now that things have mellowed out a bit for me, I wanted to start doing the same here. \n\nI generally try to review products that I don't see too often on skincare subs. Past reviews have included [Missha Near Skin Madecanol Cream] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/87r241/review_missha_near_skin_madecanol_cream/), [Missha Near Skin Total Ceramide Cream] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/82f8h9/review_missha_near_skin_total_ceramide_cream/), [Missha Near Skin Phyto Azulen Cream] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8cejd0/review_missha_near_skin_phyto_azulen_cream/), [Tosowoong Apricot Seed Cleansing Oil] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/7u2j65/review_tosowoong_apricot_seed_cleansing_oil/), and [Benton Honest TT Mist] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/7trt3u/review_benton_honest_tt_mist/). Today I wanted to review one of my favorite masks: The Body Shop Ginseng and Rice Polishing and Clarifying Mask. \n\nI hope you enjoy the review, and as always, please feel free to leave questions and feedback!\n\n**The Body Shop Chinese Ginseng and Rice Clarifying and Polishing Mask**\n\nI *love* masks. Like seriously **love** them. And as much as I enjoy a good sheet mask, there's still something about a nice wash-off mask that feels like you're really pampering yourself. I still have very high expectations for my wash-off masks though...they can't just feel nice. I also expect them to address my skin concerns, which are mainly acne, PIE, and dryness/dehydration. \n\nI spotted this particular mask in someone's shelfie over on ScA, and hadn't heard of it before, so I popped into the Body Shop one day to have a look. I was a bit hesitant to try it, as I was worried it might be too drying. It's ended up being one of my favorite products, and I'm so glad I took the risk. \n\n**Packaging:** This product comes in a 3oz/75ml dark brown glass jar with a black plastic lid. It's surprisingly heavy for its size, but has proven fairly durable...the lid has stayed intact for as long as I've had it, and while I haven't dropped it, the jar did survive an international move with no problems. Aesthetically, it's apothecary/minimal, so if you're into Aesop's vibe, you'll probably like this too. I know not everyone is keen on jar packaging, but I personally don't mind it. \n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nThe star ingredients in this mask are kaolin, salicylic acid, ginseng, and rice extract. The first two are acne-fighters; kaolin is a type of clay that's known for being less drying than other types of clay while still providing similar acne-fighting, pore-reducing benefits. And we all know salicylic acid as everyone's favorite BHA. While the percentage isn't listed, it's high enough on the ingredients list that I'd estimate (very unscientifically) it's somewhere in the 1% range, and expect to see an impact. Rice bran extract is an emollient ingredient ([source] (https://cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/oryza-sativa-rice-extract)) but in its powdered form, can be a mild exfoliant. I'm not sure which form it's used in here, but given the slightly grainy texture of the mask, I'd expect it's powdered, and is acting as an exfoliant rather than an emollient. Ginseng is touted for its anti-aging benefits, and has been shown to act as an antioxidant, have an anti-inflammatory effect, and stimulate blood flow to give you a bit of a glow ([source] (https://www.refinery29.com/42123). Beeswax and shea butter in the ingredients list also made me a bit more optimistic when considering the product--it seems like there was definitely some thought that went into making this a clarifying product that still wouldn't strip dry skin too much. \n\nThat's the good stuff. However, there are a lot of potentially sensitizing ingredients in there. Denatured alcohol features pretty high on the ingredients list. I personally don't have issues with alcohol in skincare, but it's something to watch for those who do. Fragrance is also higher on the list than I'd generally like, so those who are sensitive to fragrance, beware. There are also some fatty alcohols, as well as limonene, and linalool. If you have especially sensitive skin, this product is probably not for you.\n\nThe full ingredients list is:\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Glycerin, Luffa Cylindrica Fruit, Kaolin, Sesamum Indicum Seed Oil/Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, PEG-100 Stearate, Alcohol Denat., Decyl Glucoside, Cera Alba/Beeswax/Cire d’abeille, Perlite, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter/Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter,Parfum/Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Limonene, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Myristyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Menthol, Panax Ginseng Root Extract/Panax Ginseng (Ginseng) Root Extract, Disodium EDTA, Citral, Citronellol, Linalool, Menthoxypropanediol, Tetrasodium Pyrophosphate, Eugenol, Dextrin, Oryza Sativa Extract/Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, CI 77891/Titanium Dioxide.\n\n**Price:** I bought mine in the UK for £17; it retails for $28 in the US, but The Body Shop often runs sales and 3 for 2 deals. \n\n**Use and Performance:**\n\nLike I mentioned when talking about the ingredients, this is a clarifying mask that seems to have been formulated with dry skin in mind. This is very clearly reflected in the texture of the mask. It's far creamier than your typical clay mask, and doesn't dry down as completely. The mask itself is an off-white colour, and the creamy clay consistency also includes a grainy element (most likely from the rice). It smells very strongly of ginseng, which I love. You apply this like you would any other clay mask--spread a thin layer over your face using your fingers or a brush, then wait 15-20 minutes for the mask to dry down, and then rinse it off. \n\nI don't find that this mask dries down as aggressively as other clay masks I've tried, and I don't feel like my face is about to crack at the end of 20 minutes. I usually prefer to wash this mask off in the shower, because it can be a bit difficult to wash it off cleanly without making a total mess--consider yourself warned! My face does feel a bit tight afterwards, but it's nothing that a few layers of Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion and Scinic Honey AIO can't fix. \n\nI see instant results from this mask. My pores immediately look smaller, and my skin has much more of a glow. If I use it at night, I wake up the next morning with a significant reduction in my acne. I also find it reduces my PIE, which was something I wasn't expecting! I use this mask once a week, or twice a week if my skin is especially congested, and I find that it clears up any random acne or texture issues that I'm dealing with. \n\n**Final Thoughts:** This is a really great mask option for someone who needs an occasional serious acne-fighter, but is also worried about dryness. Oilier skin types may be able to use the mask more often than dryer skin types. It's definitely not a one-stop miracle acne product...I rely on Differin (currently, previously Skinoren) to keep my acne under control in the long-term, and use this mask to address random breakouts and congestion. It's also probably not great for more sensitive skin types, I'm sorry to say. And if you're dehydrated, you'll probably want to steer clear as well--clay and salicylic acid won't do your moisture barrier any good!\n\nOverall, it's a very effective, pleasant to use mask that I consider a holy grail, and will continue to repurchase for as long as I can. \n\n**My Rating: 5/5**\n\n",

    "body": "I see a lot of comments in skincare communities where people are trying to guess product qualities, analyze the functions and compare different products based on the INCI list. Although INCI list states all the ingredients of the formula, people often misunderstand what it actually tells us and make far-fetched conclusions.\n\nAnother problem is duping. The product is out of stock? The product is great, but the fragrance kills it? Or you don't like the texture? One particular advantage of being a DIYer is a possibility to dupe and tweak the products you like. And what we do first? Exactly, we analyze the INCI list.\n\nIn this post I want to show why INCI list tells us very little about the product itself.\n\n# What is INCI?\n\n[INCI](https://www.personalcarecouncil.org/resources/inci/) - is an international standard system to label cosmetic products with list of ingredients. The system consists of:\n\n1. [INCI dictionary](https://incibeauty.com/en/ingredients) - lists standard names for each ingredient that should be used on the label. If a new skincare ingredient is developed by some company - the company should register it in INCI dictionary;\n2. [INCI rules](https://news.ceway.eu/how-to-write-the-ingredient-list-on-the-cosmetic-product-label-in-the-eu/) - set of rules which describes how to order the ingredients, what additional information can be listed etc.\n\nMany people already know the golden rule: each ingredient should be listed in descending order by mass content. And here are the problems with this.\n\n# Problem 0: Not every listing is in INCI format\n\nThis problem has nothing to do with INCI ruleset, but mostly with manufacturing practices. That's why it is named as zero.\n\nNot every product is compliant with INCI dictionary and rules. It's not an issue if you are analyzing a product from some big brand, but small DIY shop on Etsy has high chances stating INCI wrong.\n\nTypical mistakes:\n\n* List trade mark of the ingredient instead of name from INCI dictionary. Example: *Green tea extract*. Actual INCI is *Camellia Sinensis Leaf Water*;\n* List trade mark of the mix of ingredients instead of listing each ingredient of the mix. Usually happens with preservatives. Example: *Euxyl PE9010* instead of *Phenoxyethanol*, *Ethylhexylglycerin*.\n\nAlso, not every country forces local manufacturers to follow INCI rules. If you don't see exactly \"INCI:\" before the list of ingredients there is a chance that they are randomly named and ordered.\n\nBut next problems apply even if the INCI list is written correctly.\n\n# Problem 1: INCI shows the relation, not the content.\n\nAgain, the golden rule: each ingredient should be listed in descending order by mass content.\n\nMany people think this rule allows to estimate the actual content of each ingredient in the formula. Well, they are wrong.\n\nTake a look at next two products and their INCI lists:\n\n|Toner|Content|-|Serum|Content|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Water|up to 100%||Water|up to 100%||\n|Niacinamide|2%||Niacinamide|5%||\n|Glycerin|2%||Glycerin|3%||\n|Phenoxyethanol|1%||Phenoxyethanol|1%||\n|Xanthan Gum|0.2%||Xanthan Gum|0.7%||\n\nI intentionally oversimplified the formulas, but these 2 products have the same INCI, while the texture, function and active ingredient content is different,\n\nINCI list shows only **relation** between the ingredients. One relation can fit many different formulas. Especially with the next rule.\n\n# Problem 2: Ingredients below 1% can be listed in any order\n\nYou might say \"WHAAAAAT?\". Yes, I know. This rule might be a revelation, because it is not very cited (and hence not well-known) as the golden one. Basically, this rule allows cheating. A lot of cheating.\n\nWhat manufacturers do:\n\n* Add many claim or sexy ingredients with 0.01% content\n* Move them closer to ingredients >1% in the list\n* Move \"nasty\" non-sexy ingredients (like preservatives) to the end of the list\n\nNext two INCI lists correspond to the same product and are totally valid:\n\n>**INCI 1:** Water, Glycerin (5%), Propylene Glycol (3%), Phenoxyethanol (0.9%), Xanthan Gum (0.7%), Allantoin (0.5%), Retinol (0.1%).\n\n>**INCI2:** Water, Glycerin (5%), Propylene Glycol (3%), Retinol (0.1%), Allantoin (0.5%), Xanthan Gum (0.7%), Phenoxyethanol (0.9%).\n\nDid you spot how I moved the preservative to the end of the list and Retinol closer to the start? Now if you don't know the percentages you gonna assume that if Retinol is closer to the beginning of the list then there is more of it than Allantoin.\n\nThat's why the only way to know active ingredient content is product labeling. Manufacturer should literally say \"Retinol 0.1% serum\".\n\nI see this technique is abused a lot by Korean products. They add many extracts in 0.01% content and move them closer to 1% line. This makes the whole list longer and makes you think that first few ingredients are in very high content.\n\nBut even if you know the exact formula in percentages you still can't bypass the next problem.\n\n# Problem 3: One INCI name can correspond to different ingredients\n\nOkay, this statement is insane, right? Isn't the whole idea of INCI to list standard names to distinguish the ingredients? Well, it kinda is. But one ingredient can mean different substances, have different properties and at the same time have the same name:\n\n1. **Grades**. One ingredient can have different grades (food, skincare, nano, micro etc) that dramatically affect its function. Have you ever wondered why your serum gelled with Xanthan Gum has slurry opaque texture, while the product you dupe has transparent texture that feels almost like Hyaluronic Acid? Most likely you use food grade Xanthan Gum for sauces, while the manufacturer used Xanthan Gum Soft.\n2. **Mixtures**. There are ingredients like Cetearyl Alcohol, that are basically allowed to be named as one INCI ingredient. The problem is the ratio between Cetyl and Stearyl Alcohol in it. My supplier has 3 different Cetearyl Alcohols being sold, because they are 30:70, 50:50 and 70:30 ratios. This affects the final texture - from creamy to soapy.\n3. **Groups**. One INCI name can mean different molecules from a groups of substances. Good example is silicones. Dimethicone can be very thick as a good lube or very light as a good occlusive for face cream. This happens because Dimethicone molecule has a repeating part. And based on how many repeats it has the substance changes properties. But in INCI it's the same name.\n\nSo the only way to get identical result is to buy the same trade mark ingredients from the same supplier.\n\nWhat is you do? What if you have exact formula with exact ingredients. Well...\n\n# Problem 4: Hidden ingredients\n\nManufacturers are tricky. They want to make the product as appealing as possible by abusing the rules. Everyone would agree that \"no preservative\" or \"100% natural\" claim would be very appealing to a regular buyer. Especially when fear mongering of preservatives, silicones, SLS etc is being spread around.\n\nOne nasty trick is to hide some non-sexy ingredient behind the blend. For example preservative can be a part of some natural extract. Manufacturer lists only the extract as one ingredient to hide the preservative. Or any other ingredients to make you think that the product is as natural as possible.\n\nHere is one product to show this: [Skin1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoule](https://youtu.be/N47y6pkMbdo?t=250). Many youtubers were puzzled about the INCI list and why it is different.\n\n>**INCI in Korea:** Centella Asiatica Extract\n\n>**INCI in USA:** Centella Asiatica Extract, Water, Glycerin, Cellulose, 1,2-Hexanediol, Gum, Butylene Glycol, and Ethylhexylglycerin)\n\nUSA enforces manufacturers to list all the added ingredients even if they are in the extract or some blend. While in Korea the rule is looser.\n\nOther way is to hide a preservative behind Perfume blend. INCI rules allow to not disclose the content of fragrances because each perfume is a commercial secret. This trick is not used much because it would force to move perfume above 1% line and nowadays consumers tend to avoid such products.\n\nOf course there are exceptions, like Avene emulsion for sensitive skin that is not using any preservatives because of unique manufacturing process and packaging.\n\n# Problem 5: Manufacturing process, packaging and delivery systems\n\nSkincare product is a system. It is not only about each separate ingredient or the formula in general, but also about manufacturing process and equipment.\n\nTwo different manufacturers could make the same formula and get different results. One can successfully thicken the product with a polymer, while the other doesn't have proper equipment to swell it.\n\nOne can distribute nano-particles in a medium evenly with the right costly equipment while the other just get lumps (that's why we don't DIY sunscreens).\n\nOne can create a great delivery system (like liposomes) while the other get the same mix of ingredients, but without proper structure.\n\nOne can maintain the proper pH during manufacturing, while the other can ruin some ingredient because of wrong additional order or pH measure.\n\nThere is no way to now this from the INCI list, which makes impossible to judge the product and makes it hard to replicate.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nSo what should we do? Is it really impossible to analyze or dupe skincare now? Yes and no.\n\n* Most of manufacturers still list all the ingredients in descending order with no tricks because it is much easier;\n* The more you experiment with ingredients the more you understand which trade mark is used and in what proportion;\n* With experience you can spot BS claims and INCI tricks in the formula (like if there are a lot of extracts, but the gel is clear and has no color...).\n\nAfter all most of the formulas on the market are not a rocket science.\n\n*P.S.: I am not chemist and if you have spotted factual mistakes or want to add more on the topic - I will gladly add it to the post.*\n\nGood video on the topic that came after my article from LabMuffin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTs7DR5tTmQ",

Foundation-friendly and can replace primer.\n\nRemoval:\n\n* All three sunscreens can be removed by Cetaphil cleanser, but CeraVe requires more rubbing than the other two sunscreens. You should be able to wash off all three with a regular body wash.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\n* I don't know why I still haven't thrown away the CeraVe AM. I should have done so earlier.\n\n* Both LRP and Biore are nice sunscreens. Although there are many Japanese sunscreens that have comparable or better performance, Biore should be one of the best choice within this price range.\n\n* LRP is known to have a wide range of sunscreens with different consistencies and added functions. They are also well known for making high PPD sunscreens (good UVA protection). Uvidea Aqua Fresh Gel is indeed a very good sunscreen. Being a Japanese-based line under La Roche Posay, it is very well balanced between good UVA protection typical of an European sunscreen and user-friendly consistency of a Japanese sunscreen, but I am expecting more from it with its high price.",

I'm a male and I accidentally bought the tinted one which felt weird because it looked like makeup, but tried it anyway and it was excellent. I bought the non-tinted one and it was ok, but left me looking a bit chalky and seemed to be heavier than the tinted.

    "body": "I’m From Mugwort Cream\n\nThe mugwort line from I’m From features some of my favorite soothing/calming products. Artemisia/mugwort is known for its ability to bring down redness and inflammation...and I’m From’s offerings contain some of the higher percentages of the ingredient that I have seen.\n\nTheir Mugwort Cream contains 73.55% mugwort extract alongside shea butter, father david elm extract, and fermented soybean/cogon grass extracts. The entire formulation reads like an herbal remedy that I imagine being concocted at an apothecary.\n\nAs for the consistency/texture...I was quite surprised. The cream has a lightweight look and nearly gel-like feel when first applied. But, once it’s gotten a chance to absorb there is a bit more of an occlusive feel and even slight residue left behind (which might not be ideal for those with oily skin that prefer really watery hydrators).\n\nHowever, it ended up being the lack of immediate calming/soothing that made this product a bit less impressive than the rest of the I’m From Mugwort products.\n\nWhile I did see an improvement to redness and irritation over the course of the past month...there wasn’t that immediate hit of redness reduction that I appreciated in the other products. I could always turn to the I’m From Mugwort Essence to bring my skin back from the brink when adjusting to Tretinoin or after being in the sun too long. \n\nThe I’m From Mugwort Cream just doesn’t seem to have that “triage” ability that I was hoping to see. The amount of hydration and moisture-locking ability is really nice though. Dry/normal skin that experiences redness or sensitivity might get along well with this product...but there might be a slower build to visible calming results. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Artemisia Princeps Extract, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Stearic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Arachidyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Flower Extract, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, C14-28 Alkyl Acid, Stearyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-2 Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Allatoin, Boswellia Serrata Resin Extract, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/ VP Copolymer, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/ Sodium Acryloydimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Dimethiconol, Saccharamyces/ Viscum Album (Misletoe) Ferment Extract, Lactobacillus/ Soybean Ferment Extract, Saccharomyces/ Viscum Album (Misletoe) Ferment Extract, Lactobacillus/ Soybean Ferment Extract, Saccharomyces/ Imperata Cylindrica Root Ferment Extract, Disodium EDTA, Polyglutamic Acid, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Artemisia Vulgaris Oil\n\nWhere To Buy ($32.00 USD - Wishtrend - 50ml): [https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/mugwort-cream/](https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/mugwort-cream/) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/660kxqxxhrq51.jpg?width=4707&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f44858c40b452cc060e2e1922a84175baf307379",

There are only some other big brands that do repetitive months long studies on their sunscreens too but yeah this is the heart of it here. This type of thing is very expensive and high risk for companies to be honest.\n\nI do wonder though, how different would it be from the other sunscreens so far with Triasorb. The startches and the Triasorb and such always with a white cast for me and I look like I have facial and hair dandruff.\n\nAnyway, I love the sunscreens haha\n\nAlso this is in a pump and it is cool because all the medical device sunscreen they always give instruction how much to use exactly and a lot come in pump bottle\n\nI know some people like pump bottle\n\nBut the thing is in my experience pump bottle, there is always a lot left at the bottom and around the neck of the top near the end. So have to be careful and cut i open and such and then use it all.\n\nDo you know if the Pigment medical device one will have a tinted version too or is this just the only one?\n\nThe Avene tint I tried in previous months was the Ultra Fluid Ultra Mat SPF 50+ con color and it was very smooth but very shiny too but unfortunately too dark for me to realistically wear it. I actually posted new picture showing it next to the Dr. Ph Sunset AR SPF 50+ PPD 27 which is what I am using now. The different in color is like pretty big actually and I think the Dr. Ph Sunset AR color is better for light and pale skin.",

This also might apply to other online sellers who might import theirs from the US e.g. some Amazon sellers. ",

    "body": "Skin type:\n\nCombination skin leaning towards oily. Acne, clog prone and milia prone skin. I also have a bit of sensitive skin. I also have KP at my jaw/lower cheeks.\n\nRoutine: \n\nAM: Wash with water -> vanicream daily facial moisturiser -> random sunscreen sample (no solid sunscreen yet plz recommend haha)\nPM: Roundlab Dokdo cleanser -> daily facial moisturiser \nOccasional: kiehl’s spot treatment (PM), kiehl’s clearly corrective serum (AM/PM/when I feel like it lol) \n\nProduct: \n\npurified water, squalane, glycerin, pentylene glycol, polyglyceryl-2 stearate, glyceryl stearate, stearyl alcohol, hyaluronic acid, ceramide EOP, ceramide NG, ceramide NP, ceramide AS, ceramide AP, carnosine, hydrogenated lecithin, phytosterols, caprylyl glycol, polyacrylate crosspolymer-11, 1,2-hexanediol\n\n\nThe texture of this moisturiser is light and almost watery, like an emulsion. It’s not heavy at all and spreads rather easily. As it contains squalane, it makes your hands oily after application. It doesn’t have any added fragrance, but it does give off a very creamy and a wee bit of a nutty smell(?). The smell is quite distinct so I’m not so sure how to describe it. \n\n\nThoughts:\n\nI’ve been using this moisturiser for a month now, so I feel like i can finally review and give my thoughts about it. This specific moisturiser was only released recently so i know there’s not a lot of reviews on it. \n\nI started using this moisturiser when my skin barrier was damaged. My skin literally felt like rough, grainy paper with NO OIL at all. Some parts of my face were also super dry and painful to touch. Thankfully my face wasn’t super red, but I guess because the KP on my face already makes part of my face red by default lol. \n\nThis moisturiser saved.my.barrier. FULL STOP. I stopped using any skincare products for a while and this was the first thing I incorporated. Within a few days it turned my paper, grainy ass skin back to its combination mess. I love love how this moisturiser makes my cheeks feel so soft and smooth whenever I apply it. I know it’s bad but, I keep finding myself touching my cheeks because of it. With KP, my lower cheeks tend to feel rough, but this moisturiser makes it a tad bit smoother to touch. I forgot what’s it like to have a completely smooth cheek, so that’s a pleasant thing to experience.\n\nI love the short ingredient list. It’s straight to the point with no filler ingredients and what not. Using this made me want to look for products with equally short ingredient list. \n\nI still experience some CCs here and there while using it BUT it’s not that obvious + it’s not a lot. Most of it go down after using my spot treatment, and I’m now trying to incorporate an exfoliant to try and yeet them out. My forehead is the most clog prone and I barely have any CCs there. Which means that it’s still super safe for my skin!\n\nAs stated, your hands and face might feel a tad bit oily after application due to the squalane oil. Personally I’m not bothered by this, I can just wash my hands and call it a day. BUT if you don’t like that then I might not recommend this moisturiser to you. Also note, always wait for the moisturiser to dry and sink into your skin before applying anything else. I made a mistake of not doing that and it made my sunscreen ball up and pill. I wouldn’t recommend this moisturiser if you’re also in a rush. \n\nNow is this a HG for me? It’s close to one. The only downside is that it’s SUPER hard for me to get my hands on. Vanicream does not ship to where I live (Singapore) so I have to buy from resellers. There’s not a lot of resellers selling it and there’s also an issue with authenticity. Also it’s usually quite pricey (>=SGD$30). This is the only thing holding it back from being a HG. I am planning on trying out other moisturisers to see if I can find one that gives similar results and one that’s more accessible for me. Will I repurchase if I ever find it? Definitely 100%. \n\nAn 8.5/10 for me.",

And i do think that i damaged my skin barrier too bc i got too excited w tret. I’m currently not using anything but a cleanser and a sunscreen bc sadly abt 2 weeks ago, my face suddenly developed rashes in patches when i applied the moisturizer that i’ve been using for >1 yr now (i think my damaged barrier’s to blame here tho). So yea, i’ve been on the hunt for a good basic moisturizer for a while now. I react quite easily to products and have active acne rn so your review is definitely encouraging. Gonna add it to my cart now! Hope it would work for me as well. 🤞🏼🤞🏼Thanks for your insight!! \nI have a few questions for u tho. Given that it’s oily on the hands after having applied it on the face, i suppose that it’s oily too on the face. Does it stay like that even after it has dried down or does the oiliness diminish? Also, do u think that if u used it in the AM, it would leave u an oil slick at the end of the day or no? Thanks a lot!",

    "body": "About my hair- 2a/2b dry coarse low porosity hair which is a little longer than my waist.\nI have always had a tough time finding a conditioner / mask , any mask loaded with silicones make my hair not clump to form waves and puff out. Matrix hydrasource mask was the only thing that has even come close to my hg but unfortunately they stopped selling the mask on retail basis and it is intended only for saloon purpose and with the pandemic I don't think I will be stepping into a salon anytime soon. So I was looking for an affordable alternative and someone in this sub mentioned this one. Now the coming to ingredients \n\nMatrix biolage hydrasource mask- \nAqua , Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, stearyl alcohol,Cetyl Esters, fragrance,  Phenoxyethanol, Isopropyl Alcohol, Aloe Barbadensis / Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Limonene, chlorhexidine dihydrochloride , sodium citrate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Coumarin, Linalool, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Alcohol, Hydroxycitronellal, Amyl Cinnamal. \n\n Loreal total repair 5 masque - \nWater, cetearyl alcohol, mineral oil, dipalmitoylethyl hydroxyethylmonium methosulphate, cetyl esters, lactic acid, phenoxyethanol , trideceth-6 , chlorhexidine digluconate, limonene, benzyl salicylate, amodimethacone, 2-oleamido-1,3-octadecanediol, fragrance,cetrimonium chloride, butylphenyl methylpropional , Hexyl cinnamal.(they have reformulated since the last time I used it about 2 years ago)\n\nMY EXPERIENCE:\n     Now coming to texture , the loreal one is tad bit thicker than the matrix mask and the slip provided is also lesser than the matrix mask. So I needed about 1.5 times  the amount as matrix one . The shine provided by both are same .They both act similarly when it come to making my waves form and hold. The loreal one is not as moisturising as the Matrix mask , and the frizz is also a little more than matrix mask.  So overall I would say  loreal total repair mask comes close to matrix by about 85%  . And it is costlier than the matrix biolage hydrasource mask, so I will again start my search once this one gets over.",

According to their description it's silicone free. So I called to inquire as they confirmed this. I went to the store, purchased this item and had been using it for about 3 weeks. \n\nIn that time I had developed this aweful residue spot on the back if my head and couldnt figure it out. Finally I looked at the ingredient list and clear as day it lists Dimethicone. Now this caused me a little frustration but I thought I would call and complain.\n\nhere is the list of ingredients : Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Fragrance, Benzyl Alcohol, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Glutamic Acid, Bis Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Disodium EDTA, Panthenol, Panthenyl Ethyl Ether, Citric Acid, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone\n\nThen started the most ridiculous conversation with the Pantene product support people I have ever had.\n\nIn a nut shell, They insisted I use a shampoo, wanted to send me a pamphlet on how to properly use their product and when I was willing to overlook the fact that I'm not an idiot and was explaining that the issue was now how I was using it but that they mis-advertized their products, and said it was silicone free. The stupid lady tried telling me that DIMETHICONE is NOT silicone. \n\nSo that's when I realized that my perceptions of Pantene as a brand where not what I thought and they in fact don't know what they are talking about and as a result I will no longer trust them with being a quality product if they don't understand their own ingredients.\n\nBreath....end vent..\n\nwas I wrong? Because I was 95% sure Dimethicone is a silicone based polymer. Its in fact one of the most obvious silicone products.\n\nI might call back when i have calmed down and approach it as an allergy issue because they clearly are misrepresenting the product as far as I can tell and as soon as they find I don't use shampoo they don't seem to care.",

    "body": "Hi guys! Long-time lurker, first-time poster here! I'm an avid reader of /r/skincareaddiction, /r/asianbeauty, /r/beautytalkph. \n\nLooking through previous posts here, there's not much discussion about\ndeodorants, so I thought I'd share my [review of Human Nature's roll-on deodorant](https://www.urbanfilipino.com/personal-care/human-nature-roll-on-deodorant-2020-review/)!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Why Did I Buy This Deodorant?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor a long time, I've had trouble with stains on my shirts because I sweat profusely. The problem was using **antiperspirants, most of which contain aluminum, which reacts with salt (sweat), resulting in yellowing stains found in clothing**.\n\nI've desperately scoured grocery aisles and Watsons for an antiperspirant that didn't have aluminum to no avail. Funny story, I bought this deodorant when I visited ATC, coming all the way from Makati.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Price**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou can get it in a 50ml bottle for ₱119.75 (₱2.40/ml), available in two scents: Powder Fresh and Petal Scent.\n\nI don't know how much you pay for deodorant, but as a guy, I've previously stuck with Nivea, Milcu, and Dove, all of which contained aluminum and cost around ₱60 - ₱80.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Aqua (water)\n* Glycerin (vegetable-derived)\n* Triethyl citrate (plant-derived)\n* Zea mays (corn) starch\n* Sodium caproyl/lauroyl lactylate (vegetable-derived)\n* Stearyl alcohol (vegetable-derived)\n* Helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil\n* Fragrance (all-natural)\n* Glyceryl stearate (vegetable-derived)\n* Glyceryl caprylate (coconut, palm and glycerin-derived)\n* Xanthan gum (plant-derived)\n* P-anisic acid (anise seed-derived)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Application**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDirections said to swipe at least 8 times, \"the wetter, the better!\" the website stated. Personally, I dialed it down to 3 times, which gets me through the day. It should be noted that one bottle lasted me for a year.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Result**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor the whole year I've used it, I carefully observed any signs of staining on my shirts. Thankfully, the deodorant really worked and left no stains at all.\n\nIf you're a sweaty person with stain issues, I recommend trying this deodorant. \n\nBe warned though that **deodorant is different from antiperspirant, which blocks sweat. Deodorant only neutralizes the smell, so you might find yourself perspiring more.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**__________________________________________________________________________________**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI've also covered reviews on HN's [mosturizing conditioner](https://www.urbanfilipino.com/personal-care/hair-care/human-nature-moisturizing-conditioner-review/), [moisturizing shampoo](https://www.urbanfilipino.com/personal-care/hair-care/human-nature-moisturizing-shampoo-review/), and [day moisturizer](https://www.urbanfilipino.com/personal-care/skin-care/human-nature-day-moisturizer-review/) on my blog, if you guys are interested to read them.",

I was having bad B.O all throughout the day. I apply 2-3 times a day but no luck with B.O. I've read that it's your pits purging out the chemicals from deos that caused the smell. I was still working that time and can't afford being smelly around my coworkers so I switched back to Dove. Maybe I'll try it again this quarantine. Nice review btw!",

Please also let me know if it's good for dry or oily skin (I have oily skin). \n\nLa Roche Posay Anthelios SPF 50+ Dry Touch Gel Cream (sale price £12.37 for 50ml)\n\nSoap & Glory Make Yourself Youthful Sunshield Superfluid SPF50 (£15.00 for 30ml)\n\nEucerin Sun Face Fluid SPF 50 (£16.00 for 50ml)\n\nI picked up a bottle of Garnier Ambre Solaire Sensitive Advanced SPF50 (200ml bottle) for £6.99, apparently they retail at around £14.

Although, i'm not sure I'll be using it all the time because of the price :/\nSo it's is super thick and you have to take care and rub in fully when applying to avoid white cast (which has happened to me a few times when i've been in a rush). The matte look is lovely- genuinely matte! & it leaves a nice base for make up application (really smooth, kind of feels like benefit's Porefessional primer if you've used it haha).

At first, its was wonderful, felt super nice in my hair and for the first time in my life, my frizziness was gone just after using the shampoo and conditioner.\n\nI thought I'd found a shampoo that was perfect for my hair finally, but just recently, it hasn't been so great. For the first 2 weeks, all my frizziness was completely gone, but it seems it comes back more and more with each wash, and I've been getting little tiny flakes of either dandruff or product buildup. I always make sure to scrub my scalp with the pads of my fingers and work the lather down, and the conditioner absorbs so well  into my strands that there's barely anything to wash out after waiting a couple minutes. On top of that, my hair has been getting greasy on my second day, which never happened on any shampoo I've ever used (Suave, Tresseme, RegisDesignline, Big & Sexy, Paul Mitchell). I don't use any heat products or any other kinds of products to set my hair, so I don't think that it's because of damage or product buildup, unless it's somehow the shampoo itself. \n\nI'm really at a loss at this point and not sure if I should try a different line within Shea moisture, to give this one a bit more time, or to try a different brand.\n\n\n**Shea Moisture Mafuka Honey Shampoo**\n\nWater (Aqua), Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Glycol Stearate, Glycerin (Vegetable), Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Panthenol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter*, Fragrance (Essential Oil Blend), Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Trichilia Emetica Seed Butter, Ficus Carica (Fig) Extract, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Stearamide AMP, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Tocopherol, Honey\n\n\n**Shea Moisture Mafuka Honey Conditioner**\n\nWater (Aqua), Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyropermum Parkii (Shea) Butter *, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Trichliav Emetica Seed Butter, Behentrimonium Chloride, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Cellulose, Glycerin (Vegetable), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Ether, Honey, Fragrance (Essential Oil Blend) Tocopherol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG Propyl Silanrtriol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ficus (Fig) Extract",

It smelled SO lovely and it had been recommended to me by my sister who has defined ringlets so I thought I'd give it a go. I have 2c hair and oh man this stuff was a disaster for me. The top of my scalp was always so so waxy. Yes, I do mean waxy, not greasy. It had turned the hair on the top of my scalp into a straight (no longer wavy) waxy mess. I was full of dandruff, my head was also itchy (which made the dandruff even worse, and god I mean it was *insane* how itchy I was!!!) so I figured I should use more shampoo and really get it sudsing to wash it out. It made my situation worse. I was not using any product in my hair and going to work on the daily so it was always in a bun and I let it air dry almost every night, I was treating it right so I couldn't understand wtf was happening. \nAbout that time I decided I needed a hair cut and apologized in advance to the hair stylist and told her my woes (I'd never seen her before) and once I told her I was using this line of shampoo and conditioner she told me immediately to stop using it. The shampoo I had been using was full of too many oils and I wasn't clarifying my hair in any way. I was kinda drowning my hair in oil. The conditioner didn't really help much either. \nI haven't used their products since cause I was so upset from what it did to me. I know I used a different shampoo but there's something about this line that could never groove with my hair. I stole a pump from my sister's styling cream and it gave me a headache all day from the scent and my hair didn't take to it, either. \nI tossed my bottles in the end.

Artemisia/mugwort is known for its ability to bring down redness and inflammation...and I’m From’s offerings contain some of the higher percentages of the ingredient that I have seen.\n\nTheir Mugwort Cream contains 73.55% mugwort extract alongside shea butter, father david elm extract, and fermented soybean/cogon grass extracts. The entire formulation reads like an herbal remedy that I imagine being concocted at an apothecary.\n\nAs for the consistency/texture...I was quite surprised. The cream has a lightweight look and nearly gel-like feel when first applied. But, once it’s gotten a chance to absorb there is a bit more of an occlusive feel and even slight residue left behind (which might not be ideal for those with oily skin that prefer really watery hydrators).\n\nHowever, it ended up being the lack of immediate calming/soothing that made this product a bit less impressive than the rest of the I’m From Mugwort products.\n\nWhile I did see an improvement to redness and irritation over the course of the past month...there wasn’t that immediate hit of redness reduction that I appreciated in the other products. I could always turn to the I’m From Mugwort Essence to bring my skin back from the brink when adjusting to Tretinoin or after being in the sun too long. \n\nThe I’m From Mugwort Cream just doesn’t seem to have that “triage” ability that I was hoping to see. The amount of hydration and moisture-locking ability is really nice though. Dry/normal skin that experiences redness or sensitivity might get along well with this product...but there might be a slower build to visible calming results. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Artemisia Princeps Extract, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Stearic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Arachidyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Flower Extract, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, C14-28 Alkyl Acid, Stearyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-2 Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Allatoin, Boswellia Serrata Resin Extract, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/ VP Copolymer, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/ Sodium Acryloydimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Dimethiconol, Saccharamyces/ Viscum Album (Misletoe) Ferment Extract, Lactobacillus/ Soybean Ferment Extract, Saccharomyces/ Viscum Album (Misletoe) Ferment Extract, Lactobacillus/ Soybean Ferment Extract, Saccharomyces/ Imperata Cylindrica Root Ferment Extract, Disodium EDTA, Polyglutamic Acid, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Artemisia Vulgaris Oil\n\nWhere To Buy ($32.00 USD - Wishtrend - 50ml): [https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/mugwort-cream/](https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/mugwort-cream/) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gej52o8uhrq51.jpg?width=4707&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69c33d2c3502651329ebd0b47e18a465bf9de2d1",

I bought this in the hopes of soothing my skin, improving overall redness, and reducing the chances of acne appearing.  I LOVE a good hydrating toner, so away we go.\n\nIngredients: \nCamellia Sinensis Leaf Water (50%), Aqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Root Extract, Punica Granatum Fruit Extract, Tocopherol, Betaine, Arginine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\nTexture:  Very watery.  This is probably very similar to what it would be like to put cold green tea on the skin.  It sinks it very quickly, especially if your skin is thirsty like mine. \n\nThe first two weeks I was having a great time!  I slotting in this product before my standard hydrating toner (Klairs Unscented), so it was acting like an FTE going directly onto clean skin, morning and evening.  It sank in immediately and everything going well.\n\nThen, around week 3 my face started getting dry and no biggie, just some weather changes.  Let's pile on the hydrating layers!  So I upped things to 2 or 3 of the Benton and 2 or 3 of the Klairs.  However while it seems like dehydration was taken care of, my face *craved* oil.  My rosehip seed oil started getting sucked in right quick.  Small bits of acne started to appear as is normal for me when my skin gets dry.\n\nYou see, **I had completely forgotten green tea regulates sebum production**.  And sebum regulation is exactly what I DO NOT need.\n\nSo!  Once I realize my error (2 weeks later), I dropped out the Benton and my face went back to normal.\n\nRecommendation:  This has been one of the few times where I have seen such noticeable impact of a product on the daily functioning of my skin.  While not for me, if you are looking to reduce sebum production I would recommend the Benton Deep Green Tea Toner without hesitation.  It is cosmetically elegant, minimal potential irritants, a straight-forward addition to a routine, and affordable.\n\nApologies for the clickbait title.  It was an interesting product to try and interesting skin adventure!  Cheers!",

I knew I was allergic to gel based deodorants but anti-perspirants had never bothered me.\n\nI tried switching deodorants to a natural type with no stearyl alcohol, aluminum, etc.  I changed my soap to a bland Neutrogena.\nI went without deodorant.  I tried only using talc.  I stayed out of the sun.  I tried treating it with hydrocortisone.  I tried using clotramidizole. \n\nNothing was helping.\n\nAbout 3 weeks ago my grocery store had a giant sale on Lily's chocolate bars. \n Probably getting rid of the slow moving stock.

I've probably been averaging about one bar a day since.\n\nAs I reviewed any lifestyle changes during that time frame this jumped out to me as my only significant diet change.\n\nI cut out the chocolate 3 days ago and the rash has finally started to diminish and fade.  My sanity has been restored. \n\nAnyway, still the best tasting chocolate substitute but be wary of side-effects.",

    "body": "Skin type: dehydrated, eczema-prone, acne-prone\n\nLocation: Toronto, Canada (i.e. I can't access some USA-only type moisturizers)\n\nHi everyone!\n\nSo I've started my journey in Jan 2019 attempting to find the best moisturizer w/ HA (along with a HG sunscreen), and have used the following products:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*NOTE: YMMV - this obviously details my own personal experiences w/ the products below :)*\n\n**1) Cetaphil - Daily Hydrating Lotion w/ Hyaluronic Acid**\n\nIngredients: Water, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Homarine HCI, Sodium PCA, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Erythritol\n\nThis is the best moisturizer I've used; the -1 in the rating is that I use it up too fast! I use three pumps (2 on the face, 1 on the neck) AM and PM. As its consistency is more lotion and watery-like than that of a heavy cream, the bottle is tiny at 88 mL and runs out quickly. I've used up 2 bottles of this in 4-5 months or so (so a bottle per 2 months, and its pricey at that too!). It doesn't break me out, applies like silk and actually gives me lasting moisture. I think it's more because of its hydroxy urea moreso than the HA, tbh, because my Hada Labo premium outperforms TO's HA serum also; and it contains the same urea ingredient. BUT due to the price, I'm not sure if I will buy again... in the event no other moisturizers in the future work as well though then I will resort to this lol\n\nRating: 9/10 (-1 Price)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2) The Ordinary - Natural Moisturizing Factors w/ Hyaluronic Acid**\n\nIngredients: Aqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Stearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Arginine, Aspartic Acid, Glycine, Alanine, Serine, Valine, Isoleucine, Proline, Threonine, Histidine, Phenylalanine, Glucose, Maltose, Fructose, Trehalose, Sodium PCA, PCA, Sodium Lactate, Urea, Allantoin, Linoleic Acid, Oleic Acid, Phytosteryl Canola Glycerides, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Lecithin, Triolein, Tocopherol, Carbomer, Isoceteth-20, Polysorbate 60, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Pentylene Glycol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.\n\nI really wanted to love this, I really do, because I've been attempting to put out an all-DECIEM based routine to save up on my budget and support a Canadian company at the same time. But this moisturizer, given its universal praise isn't cutting it! Lack of silicones in it usually end up with me contracting eczema at the end of the day. Also, heads up - I can't tolerate oils at all because I'm prone to sebborhea, eczema AND acne (I can only use jojoba oil and squalane) - so I really feel the oiliness of this product, despite being oil-free. I think it's because of the oleic and linoleic acids in the product which is basically what oils are comprised of.  To add, it feels tacky on my skin, and the packaging format isn't too nice as i have to squeeze hard for the product to come out. The price is great though, so I didn't waste my money on it. I don't think it breaks me out particularly so I'll still try to use up the entire 100mL of it :p\n\nRating: 7/10 (-1 tacky feeling, -1 oily feeling, -1 no silicones)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3) CeraVe AM Lotion w/ SPF30**\n\nMed. Ingredients: Homosalate 10.00%, Menthyl Anthranilate (Meradimate) 5.00%, Octinoxate (Ethylhexyl, Methoxycinnamate) 5.00%, Octocrylene 2.00%, Zinc Oxide 6.3%.Other Ingredients: Water, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Ceramide AP , Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Disodium EDTA, Glycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Methylparaben, Niacinamide, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Xanthan Gum\n\nOkay this sucks big time. It clogged ALL my pores, literally and I had to take a week course doxycycline to clear it up a bit. It also left my face a greasy mess. But it does moisturize well so I'm planning on using it up on my neck and hands, lol 😂 Also, there was a very informed post of ceramides in CeraVe not really doing anything so there's that too. Will definitely NOT be buying again.\n\nRating: 4/10 (-5 100% pore-clogging, -1 greasy face)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4) CeraVe PM Lotion**\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Disodium EDTA, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n\nThis one sucks too, but it doesn't clog my pores as much as the AM variant. I've been using this on and off because I just hate the greasy feeling it leaves my skin, and I'm not really sure if its the main culprit clogging my pores yet (I just started using it last month on and off). I also kind of itch a bit after using it. It's definitely not a silky smooth application feeling as I had when I used the Cetaphil moisturizer. Will not be buying again.\n\nRating: 6/10 (-3 may be pore clogging , -1 greasy face)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in short, I still did not find my HG Moisturizer, unfortunately. I'll be looking into the following products now:\n\n**5) Eucerin Replenishing Face Cream w/ 5% Urea** \\- Due to my success with products containing the hydroxy derivative, and its wonderful reviews I'm dying to try this. I just ordered a tube off of [well.ca](https://well.ca), and hope it works out. I'll be using this after I use up the CeraVe PM or discontinue it lol. I have very high expectations of this, and hope this will end my quest to find my perfect moisturizer  😭\n\n**6) CeraVe SPF 30 Ultra Light Moisturizer** \\- Despite my bad track record with CeraVe, I've heard great things about this version of their sunscreen+moisturizer hybrid, and I still am looking for my HG sunscreen.\n\n**7) Hada Labo Perfect Gel** \\- This thing has squalane, hydroxy urea AND HA. Seems too good to be true, but the Premium Lotion already is a HG for my skin. The problem is, it's an Asian product so I need to buy in bulk online for that free shipping or risk getting a counterfeit product off of Amazon (and I don't like buying off of Amazon due to its treatment of its workers anyways).\n\n**8) Neutrogena Extra Dry Hydro Boost Moisturizer** \\- I'm not sure about this one because HA is the 4th last ingredient, and is listed well after the phenoxyethanol (which is 1% I believe) meaning that the HA % of this is less than 1%. Butttt enough ppl are raving about it for me to notice it  😅 so I'll give this a shot if the other ones don't end up being my HG.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd that's that! If anyone has any experiences regarding the products above (especially the ones I want to try in the future) please let me know :)!",

    "body": "Looks like we are receiving more scalp-targeted skin care products which is very exciting! There are little scalp focused products (although there are more lately in the form of scalp acids).\n\nThis line also has a shampoo but the treatment/conditioner is what I would really like to discuss. What's different, from just a glance, is that it's more \"dermatologically\" proven. It claims that the ingredients used are \"certified by Korean ministry of food and drug safety\" and it is also \"certified as low irritation through a rigorous skin patch test by Korean dermatology research institute.\"\n\nThis product REALLY caught my eye because I am constantly looking for more scalp-care products. It is my understanding that conditioner shouldn't touch the scalp, (especially if you are acne prone). I have a sensitive scalp prone to inflammation which is why I am very interested in scalp care. If this product is everything the marketing for it claims then this might just be a holy grail for scalp-focused skin-carers.\n\nPY's approach is interesting because most conditioner seem to be formulated as a hair conditioner first and skin conditioner second. In my experience, products formulated like this tends to leave an irritating residue as the consideration for the scalp is secondary. Their testing seems to be addressing this.\n\nI don't pay much attention to the hair loss claim in itself (only in terms of how much it improves scalp health which obviously affects hair health in the long term).\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR:This hair conditioner is designed with scalp-contact in mind making this product stand out from most other I've seen on the market (something like a wash off scalp mask + hair conditioner)\\*\\*\n\nIt seems like a pretty new product (so long shot asking if anyone has used it) but this is product really caught my eye so I will try it out and report back.\n\nif this seems like an ad for this brand, it's not. I'm just really passionate about scalp health lmfao (check my posting history and rifle through the housewives and university posts)\n\nany thoughts on this product's formulation or comments on scalp-care asian products in general?

    "body": "Here’s a couple empties, but before a bit of info about my skin and environment\n\n[Link to pictures of empties](https://imgur.com/a/62si7mM)\n\nSkin type: combination (oily T zone)\n\nSkin tone: medium tan\n\nClimate: dry dessert, tested the products during winter season\n\n\n\n———\n\nBioré - UV Aqua Rich Watery Gel SPF 50+ PA+++\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, ethanol, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, (lauryl methacrylate/sodium methacrylate) crosspolymer, ethylhexyl triazone, dimethicone, alkyl benzoate (C12-15), titanium oxide, hexyl diethylaminohydroxybenzoylbenzoate, bisethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyltriazine, (dimethicone/vinyl dimethicone) crosspolymer, BG, xylitol, dextrin palmitate, DPG, hydrous silica, hydroxyethyl cellulose, glycerin, glyceryl stearate, cetanol, polymethylsilsesquioxane, (vinyl dimethicone/methicone) Sesquioxane) crosspolymer, triethoxycaprylylsilane, propanediol, (acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate) crosspolymer, glyceryl behenate, polysorbate 60, aluminum hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, stearic acid, stearyl Alcohol, sorbitan distearate, agar, polyvinyl alcohol, isoceteth-20, stearoyl methyl taurine Na, stearoyl glutamic acid, AMP, stearoxy PG sodium hydroxyethyl cellulose sulfonate, arginine, glutamic acid, locust bean gum, maltose, sodium hyaluronate, royal jelly extract, Phenoxyethanol, EDTA-2Na, BHT, fragrance\n\nTexture: As you would expect it’s very watery, slips down your fingers. The applicator is big so you get a good chunk. After drying it gives a silky veil finish. Color is white like milk.\n\nApplication: Please please mix the bottle before application, otherwise it will be alcohol impregnated, causing a heavy smell (that vaporizes quickly) and might sting if you have scratches or sensitive eyes. I used the two fingers rule, but it always felt like I was applying too much, which then tended to cause pilling even if I used silicone based makeup or no makeup at all. I had to leave it dry and it had a white cast, but it faded after drying.\n\nWould Recommend: nah, I guess it’s a good alternative for no makeup days, as the silk finish is quite nice by itself, but the alcohol smell was awful. To be honest, if you mix the bottle well the product won’t smell of anything noticeable, but I found that when the bottle was near the end, all applications smelled like alcohol, even after mixing the bottle well. I had heard good things about this product, but I think Bioré can and has done better (like with their Aqua Rich Essence line).\n\nOverall: 6.5/10\n\n———\n\nHOLIKA HOLIKA - Aloe Waterproof Sun Cream SPF 50+ PA++++\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Niacinamide, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Caprylyl Methicone, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Behenyl Alcohol, Poly C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Decyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Fragrance, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, t-Butyl Alcohol, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Hippophae Rhamnoides Fruit Extract, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Juice, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Ceramide, Phytosphingosine, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Artemisia Capillaris Extract\n\nTexture: think Lubriderm, feels like lubriderm, same texture and absorbs just as quickly. Only difference is that this one does not smell and doesn’t sting the eyes or irritated skin (maybe thanks to the aloe vera?)\n\nApplication: again, same as lubriderm. Leaves skin feel light but moisturized. You can apply primer or any makeup after it dries and it will feel like you didn’t put sunscreen on.\n\nWould Recommend: yes! It has everything I was looking for, it’s lightweight, non-oily, absorbs quickly, it was cheap and leaves no white cast. It’s even waterproof, and I went to some trips where I sweat or went to the beach and didn’t get burnt, so it was effective. I love that this sunscreen is basically a moisturizer that leaves your face a white canvas for any makeup you want to use that day. Holika Holika has never disappointed me when I have tried their products, but this one is by far the best (and that’s saying a lot considering their protein hair mask is the best I’ve tried).\n\nOverall: holy grail / 10 (but as anything else that’s good, it’s discontinued, so my search for a holy grail sunscreen will continue 🫠)",

I had been using this for the past two months. It gently cleanses my skin without leaving it dry and no irritation whatsoever. It feels like applying a cream on face with very minimal lather. Haven't faced any purging or breakouts with it. A con though is that it contains SLS. \n\nIngredients: Aqua, Propylene Glycol, Cetyl Alcohol, Saccharide Isomerate (Pentavitin), Stearyl Alcohol, SLS, Polysorbate-20, D-Panthenol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone & Methylisothiazolinone.\n\nThings to consider: Non-Comedogenic, Fragrance Free, Paraben free, Pentavitin for locking in the moisture and it also claims to build skin barrier. \n\nWho can consider: People with dry and sensitive skin. People with oily skin can also consider it in the winters. \n\nMy Current Routine: AM- Cleanse (Nosoap Cleanser), Treat (Azelaic Acid 20%), Moisturize (Ponds Super Light Gel) and SPF (Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch SPF50). \n\nPM- Cleanse (Nosoap Cleanser), Treat (Biluma Cream). I follow a very minimal routine! \n\nHoly Grail for Winters. However, would avoid in summers. :) x",

The sunscreen smell is very present (which I've always disliked) but goes away after a few minutes. \n\nIt does not leave your face as dewy as other sunscreens, it is not drying, a bit moisturizing, and does not pill. Really, I can't say anything against this sunscreen other than high price. Other than that, you can quite feel it on your face, which is to be expected from most sunscreens. It's a tube with a weird applicator, but it's not a deal-breaker. As opposed to the Cicadiane, the UVAPF is not disclosed, but since the INCI are so similar, it should be around 38.\n\n[Yves rocher Soin Anti-Âge SPF 50+:](https://www.yves-rocher.fr/corps-et-douche/soin-solaire/protection-solaire/soin-anti-age-protection-fps-50-/p/yr.R57438) AQUA (Eau) DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE, PHENOXYETHYL CAPRYLATE, C12-15 ALKYL BENZOATE, DIBUTYL ADIPATE, DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, METHYLPROPANEDIOL, BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE, PHENYLBENZIMIDAZOLE SULFONIC ACID, DIMETHICONE, ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE, TROMETHAMINE VP/EICOSENE COPOLYMER, PEG-100 STEARATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, SODIUM STEAROYL GLUTAMATE, STEARYL ALCOHOL, ERYNGIUM MARITIMUM EXTRACT (Extrait D'Etoile Des Dunes), ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, GLYCERIN, XANTHAN GUM (Gomme De Xanthane), PARFUM, BENZYL ALCOHOL, ISOEUGENOL, TOCOPHEROL\n\n**-> Uvinul A plus, Tinosorb S, Ensulizole, Uvinul T 150**\n\nThe Trio White would have been my HG (I'm tired of looking for a sunscreen), had I not decided to buy Yves Rocher's one to try since it's -45% on their website. I'm not against fragrance (especially if it's masking sunscreen smell), and the fragrance is very much pleasant and faint; not overbearing at all.\n\nApplication is great, it's an airless pump which are vastly superior to tubes, and greatest of all... it gives my skin a very healthy look in a way. Most sunscreens give me a greasy-ish look. As opposed to the Trio White, I don't feel it at all on my skin. Despite the fragrance, the formulation is top notch. I know fragrance + UV exposure = bad, but I'm kinda willing to take the risk, and will stop if my skin ever comes to react badly.\n\nAnyway, thanks to this, my search for a face sunscreen has ended. \nIf this sunscreen is not in sales, it's around 21€, which depending on where you buy the Trio White, can be more expensive than the Trio White (which I bought for 17€).\n\nFinally, I'm pretty sure than Yves Rocher is more accessible than Noreva around Europe.\n\nThe marketing is funny though: \"made to meet women's highest standards\". I'm a man, please.",

I started avoiding sun, and wearing the spf lip balm whenever exposed to sun and for the night I’d put on the vit A ointment which would first help a bit, but not much anymore. I stopped using the lip peeling as it was only making things worse. i drink a lot of water, have a balanced diet, take vit D daily.

    "body": "Hey y'all. New guy here. A couple of days ago I read the intro to CG and went straight ahead to a store to find the right products to start using the CG method. Turns out, I had no clear idea of what to go for, since many ingredient's names had no sense for me. Were they alchohol? Silicones? Maybe both of them? Since there's no signal inside the stores, I couldn't even use the ingredients bot.\n\nI got out and checked reddit back and found the holy list of products... except there's an extreme lack of content in the italian list. Having no idea about what to buy, I went back home and started reading more on the wiki. After reading a good amount of articles, I wrote a guide for myself, so I can understand if a product should be the one I need or not. Might as well share it here.\n\nBeing the guide to myself, it's made in my native language (italian). I could make a translation, but you'd notice that it's no more than the content of a couple of wiki pages summarized, so I think it would still be a good idea to go read those, since they're surely better written than mine. Aside from that, in this guide there's the full content of the intro, with all the explanations of all the techinques added (SOTC, Plopping etc.), a list of all the main ingredients you should find on a product, understanding what is nice to have and what should be avoided (among alchohols, silicones and humettants), some dedication about porosity and how to care for your curles during sleep and when you don't wash them. This should hopefully help any italian who gets here to fill the holy list of italian products easily. There you go:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrima di cominciare, leggerai diverse volte il termine \"sgranocchiare\". Si intende tamponare gentilmente i capelli partendo dalle punte, alzando le ciocche fino alla cute, quindi strizzare.\n\nRoutine per lavare i capelli \\[le tecniche in parentesi quadra sono opzionali\\]:\n\n\\- **Reset shampoo** (solo una volta. Solfati, no siliconi) \\[se possibile V05 clarifying, ma va' bene  anche uno della linea Ultra dolce (es. quello alle 5 erbe) o Fructis (es. il Cucumber Fresh) della Garnier. (da riusare non più di una volta al mese)\n\n\\- **Balsamo** (no solfati, no siliconi). Non aver paura di abbondare. Pettina i capelli con il balsamo ancora in testa.\n\n\\- **Sciacqua** via il balsamo, continuando a massaggiare. Puoi valutare di lasciare un po' di balsamo in testa\n\n\\[S2C\\]: dopo il balsamo, aggiungi porzioni d'acqua come se fossero un prodotto. Strizza l'acqua nei capelli per sciacquare poi via il balsamo.\n\n\\- Prendi molto **gel** (no solfati, no siliconi, no alcol) e usalo sui capelli ancora bagnati\n\n\\- **Asciuga** \"sgranocchiando\" con una maglietta in cotone o asciugamano in microfibra. Asciuga col diffusore da lontano, temperatura media.\n\nPer aumentare il volume, puoi mettere dei fermagli sulle radici dei capelli.\n\n\\[Plopping\\]: appoggia una maglietta in cotone su un mobile. Appoggia la fronte sulla maglietta. Lega la maglietta attorno alla testa e solleva nuovamente la testa.\n\nDopo 10 minuti, leva la maglietta e usala per asciugare \"sgranocchiando\" i capelli.\n\n\\- **A capelli asciutti**. \"sgranocchia via\" la \"croccantezza\" causata dal gel, con le mani\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[SOTC\\]: se i capelli risultano crespi, puoi aggiungere un olio, massaggiando dalla punta verso la radice, quando i capelli sono perfettamente asciutti.\n\n\\[Super Soaker\\]: usa tutti i prodotti insieme. Sciacqua usando poca acqua alla volta.\n\n\\[Finger coiling\\]: definisci i ricci applicando il prodotto riccio per riccio. Avvolgilo intorno alle dita e ripeti con il riccio successivo.\n\n\\[LOC\\]: utile sui ricci annodati. Prevede l'utilizzo di balsamo, olio e crema, nell'ordine che ho scritto\n\n\\[Rake & Shake\\]:  dividi i capelli in ciocche e applica i prodotti sulle lunghezze pettinando i capelli con le dita. Una volta alle punte, afferra la  ciocca e agitala per \"riattivare\" i ricci.\n\n\\[Shingling\\]: dividi la testa in 5-6 sezioni e focalizzati su una alla volta, applicando il prodotto aiutandoti col pettine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Alcol:**\n\nAlcuni alcol sono totalmente da evitare (Ethanol alcohol, Ethyl alcohol, Propanol alcohol, Alcohol denat., Isopropyl alcohol, Isopropanol alcohol, Benzyl alcohol)\n\nAltri sono permessi, in quanto non causano danni. Anzi, possono addirittura portare benefici (Cetyl alcohol, Cetearyl alcohol, Stearyl alcohol, Lauryl alcohol)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Siliconi:**\n\nSon divisi in categorie. Alcuni di questi possono essere presenti senza problemi, altri meno perchè possono accumularsi. Oltre ad accumularsi, comunque, portano benefici vari.\n\n1. Evaporativi. Evaporano nel giro di due ore al massimo, quindi non si accumulano.\n\n\\- Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane, Hexamethyldisiloxane, Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, cyclomethicone (quest’ultimo e altri ciclo-XXX-silosani non sono solubili in acqua, ma evaporano comunque rapidamente, quindi non sono un problema)\n\n2) Facili da lavare. Non evaporano e possono essere presenti nel balsamo. Alcuni di questi, però, possono essere resistenti all'acqua (specie se calda) e potrebbero richiedere uno shampoo coi solfati perchè vengano rimossi.\n\n\\- Methicone e Dimethicone e Dimethicone copolyol (buoni se non hanno ingredienti cationici),silica, silequioxanes, siloxysilicates (es. diisostearoyl trimethylolpropane siloxysilicate) (questi sono pesanti),diphenyl dimethicone, dimethiconol, disiloxane, Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane, Lauryl methicone copolyol, Phenyltrimethicone, Trisiloxane\n\n3) Difficili da lavare, ma non si accumulano. Si accumula solo in un primo strato. Gli strati successivi eliminano i precedenti, quindi l’accumulo non è troppo. È comunque meglio evitarli, se possibile.\n\nDimethicone crosspolymer, Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer, Aminopropyltriethoxysilane, Aminopropyl Dimethicone (senza surfatante cationico), Amodimethicone (senza surfatante cationico), Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone, Dimethicone, Dimethicone PEG/PPG, o -dimethylsiloxane, in presenza di un altro catione polimerico come bromuri, cloruri o polyquaterni.\n\n4) Difficili da lavare, si accumulano. Da evitare totalmente. Per essere rimossi si richiede l’uso ripetuto di shampoo con solfati.\n\nBehenoxy dimethicone, Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone, Cetyl dimethicone, Cetearyl methicone, Dimethiconol hydroxystearate, Polysilicone-18 Cetyl Phosphate, Propyl Dimethicone, Stearoxy dimethicone, Stearyl dimethicone, Stearyl methicone Trimethylsiylamodimethicone\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Umettanti:**\n\nDa evitare in zone calde e umide, in quanto tendono ad assorbire troppo e rendere i capelli troppo secchi.\n\nGlycerin, Propylene Glycol, Honey, Agave nectar, Sorbitol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed silk protein, Fructose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Come trattare i ricci nei giorni in cui non li lavi:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dormi con i capelli avvolti** in una sciarpa in seta, oppure legali in modo da formare una coda partendo dalla cima della testa (metodo ananas)\n\nSe hai i capelli molto lunghi, puoi fare trecce.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ogni giorno** puoi trattare i tuoi capelli in più possibili modi, a seconda dell'umidità dell'ambiente in cui vivi e la porosità dei ricci:\n\n0) Bagna completamente i capelli, aggiungi un po' di balsamo (eventualmente S2C) e gel. Praticamente lavali di nuovo.\n\n1. Usa uno spray per spruzzare il balsamo (o anche solo acqua) per inumidire, poi \"sgranocchia\" un po' i ricci.\n2. Bagnati le mani con gel diluito, oppure balsamo diluito, oppure anche solo acqua, e \"sgranocchia\"\n3. Valido se hai tempo per asciugarti bene e se hai capelli corti; prendi l'acqua con le mani e \"sgranocchia\" le punte, eventualmente aggiungendo un po' di gel, poi asciuga (eventualmente plopping)\n4. Cerca una sezione particolarmente crespa, bagna le mani, aggiungi una goccia di gel e applicalo sulla sezione (eventualmente finger coiling). \"Sgranocchia\" tutti i ricci un po' in generale.\n5. Agita i ricci e \"sgranocchia\" mentre sei a testa in giù. Puoi anche incasinare i capelli un po' ma evita di far passare le dita lungo i ricci o rischi di fare un disastro.\n\nIn particolare, quando fai attività sportiva, è una buona idea usare un po' di balsamo, ed eventualmente sostituire il gel con creme per ricci.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Porosità:**\n\nI capelli possono in genere avere bassa, media o alta porosità.\n\nQuesti due link sono i modi migliori per identificare la porosità dei capelli: [https://www.curlsbot.com/porosity/](https://www.curlsbot.com/porosity/)\n\nOppure  [http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/hair-porosity-how-to-measure-sort-of.html](http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/hair-porosity-how-to-measure-sort-of.html)\n\nBassa porosità:\n\nI capelli impiegano più di 2 secondi a bagnarsi, anche sotto il getto diretto dell'acqua\n\nL'acqua rimane sopra i capelli invece che bagnarli\n\nI prodotti non vengono ben assorbiti, perciò si accumulano di più in mezzo ai capelli\n\nI capelli impiegano molto a seccarsi\n\nI capelli sono più resistenti a trattamenti chimici (come il colore)\n\n\\- Lavali sempre con acqua calda\n\n\\- Usa gli heating cap\n\n\\- Metti i capelli in una cuffietta per la doccia in plastica e usa un asciugamano riscaldato\n\n\\- Usa prodotti più leggeri, specialmente se usi gli oli, in quanto tenderanno ad appesantire molto i capelli. (Oli leggeri: jojoba, argan/argania, grapeseed/semi d'uva, sunflower/girasole, sweet almond/mandorle dolci). Eventualmente non usare affatto gli oli.\n\n\\- Usa con una certa regolarità un prodotto che elimini gli accumuli sui capelli. Il prodotto dev'essere un po' aggressivo ma non quanto un comunque shampoo.\n\nAlta porosità:\n\nSi bagnano immediatamente anche con poca acqua\n\nI capelli assorbono rapidamente qualunque cosa\n\nI capelli si asciugano velocemente dopo essere stati lavati\n\nAccettano facilmente prodotti chimici (come il colore), ma possono espellerlo altrettanto facilmente.\n\nPossono sembrare pesanti e secchi\n\nSi annodano facilmente\n\nTendono a essere crespi\n\n\\- Usa oli pesanti (castor/ricino, olive, coconut/cocco, flax/lino, hemp/canapa, jamaican black castor/ricino nero giamaicano) e oli che chiudono le cuticole.\n\n\\- Usa settimanalmente una maschera per capelli\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Altre generalità:**\n\nGli ingredienti principali di cui tenere conto sono: solfati, siliconi, polyquats, umettanti cocco. proteine, (in genere i capelli tendono ad accettare o rifiutare gli ultimi due tipi di ingredienti). Evita il calore diretto e i prodotti Pantene.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsigli da u/GIUlianab\n\nSe vuoi provare a seguire il CG per adesso prova a guardare tra i prodotti Omia e de I Provenzali, dovrebbero avere almeno balsami e maschere senza  siliconi (le maschere della Omia sono buone) e shampoo senza solfati e siliconi. Io personalmente sconsiglio il co-washing, specialmente se  vivi in un luogo con acqua molto dura. Usare uno shampoo delicato (senza solfati o con questi in basso nella lista degli ingredienti, in quanto dovrebbe indicarne una bassa quantità) è sempre meglio secondo me.\n\nLa Biopoint di recente ha lanciato una linea senza siliconi, solfati e  parabeni, se la trovi ed è nel tuo budget puoi provarla, la Garnier ha lanciato le maschere hair food (solo non lasciarle agire per un minuto, non fanno una cippa in un minuto) e se non sbaglio il balsamo Splend'Or è  CG. \n\nQuello che per me ha funzionato davvero è stato usare una vecchia  magliette di cotone per asciugare e plopping, mettere una stoffa di raso sopra il mio cuscino quando dormo, dormire con \"l'ananas\", lo S2C, lo  scrunching e applicare tutti i prodotti sui capelli gocciolanti.",

I only used it this morning but I liked it a lot. It's not quite as thick as CeraVe in the tub, and it is slightly more shiny since it has grapeseed oil. To me this is a plus because CeraVe dries down too matte to feel moisturizing to me. It's also super cheap! $4.99 for 5.5oz and $9.99 for the full size. So if you're looking around for a new moisturizer, I would definitely give it a try. If you don't like it for your face, you can use it on your body. \n\nIngredients: Water, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide Np.

    "body": "Hello there! I was fortunate enough to receive the newly reformulated All-Day Airy Sunscreen by Klairs. I've been using it for just over a week now. Here's what I think:\n\n**Texture:** Super light and \"airy\" for sure. It's not greasy or watery. It feels like a moisturizer, so it's probably best for those with normal or dry skin. I have dry skin and can skip my (light) morning moisturizer when I use this. \n\n**Finish:** This product didn't leave any whitecast on me. It dried down to a slightly dewy, radiant finish. Somehow I look glowy without looking greasy, which doesn't usually happen for me with sunscreens! It soaked in really quickly and applied easily.\n\n**Wear:** While this goes on great, I've noticed that it starts to pill if you're a frequent face-toucher or by the end of the day. For this reason I haven't tried to put makeup over it yet. I also don't think it's the best for reapplication, though I haven't tried (I've been sick and haven't been out much haha). It just starts to pill if you handle it too much.\n\n**Sun protection:** The UV protection was rated by three different clinical trial institutions to confirm the SPF and PA ratings. The sunscreen is rated as SPF50+ and PA++++. After the debacle with their last formulation, Klairs seems to have stepped their game up (thankfully).\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! This would probably be my favorite sunscreen if it weren't for the pilling. It's great for short-term wear, but unfortunately breaks down as the day goes on.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Vegan and cruelty free\n* Free of bad alcohols (contains two moisturizing, beneficial alcohols)\n* Free of essential oils and fragrance\n* Contains niacinamide, glycerin, and aloe, among other beneficial ingredients\n* Utilizes 4 different chemical and broad spectrum UV blockers\n\nAqua (Water), Dibutyl Adipate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Polysilicone-15, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Polyglyceryl-6 Stearate, Cetearyl Olivate, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Panthenol, Silica, Sorbitan Olivate, Dipropylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Poly C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate, Polyglyceryl-6 Behenate, Allantoin, Caprylyl Glycol, Stearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Adenosine, Cetearyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Butylene Glycol, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Lepidium Meyenii Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Berberis Vulgaris Root Extract, Morus Nigra Fruit Extract",

After I used the treatment in my hair, my hair feels the BEST it has felt in months. It's so soft and I want to keep touching my hair, so I looked at the ingredients for the treatment.\n\nThe ingredients in the treatment: Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Stearoxypropyldimethlamine, etc...\n\nI have spent months avoiding dimethicone (especially if it is listed in the first 5 or so ingredients) because I heard that it coats hair and it only makes it appear nice, but it is not really good for your hair's health. Now, I'm reconsidering it. I debating if I should go to Target and grab some new conditioner...\n\nI have bounced around from different shampoos and conditioners for a bit still searching for my holy grail items. I currently use this shampoo: [https://www.costco.com/Kirkland-Signature-Moisture-Shampoo-33.8-fl-oz-.product.100375353.html](https://www.costco.com/Kirkland-Signature-Moisture-Shampoo-33.8-fl-oz-.product.100375353.html)\n\nand impulsively bought this conditioner (which I now see has amodimethicone further down in the ingredients list): [https://www.albabotanica.com/en/products/hawaiian-conditioner-drink-it-up-coconut-milk-12oz/](https://www.albabotanica.com/en/products/hawaiian-conditioner-drink-it-up-coconut-milk-12oz/)\n\nThey are both okay for me, but they aren't amazing. I'm mostly disappointed more by the conditioner.\n\n...\n\nWith that all said... Here are some questions I have!\n\n1. What are your thoughts on dimethicones?\n2. Do you completely avoid them?\n3. Do you love them?\n4. Do you avoid some, but like others?\n5. Are you indifferent about them?\n6. What kind of hair do you have and what conditioner do you use or love?\n7. I think it's time for me to get a new conditioner! Any help is appreciated!\n\n...\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your responses! :)\n\nFor now, I bought a shampoo with sulfate to clarify my hair. I'm going to order a conditioner online most likely by Shea Moisture or Nature's Gate.",

However, if I straighten my hair I do use products with silicones to help smooth it out and it’s just cheaper for me to use what I have already lol. I just clarify with a sulfate containing shampoo that I only use specifically for this purpose and then I go back to only using conditioner. If you are going to use silicones make sure you use a shampoo with sulfates to remove it or you will get build up!! I have curly 3c hair that is very dry so I avoid sulfates. I find I don’t really need silicones to have my hair look good so I avoid them. Different strokes for different folks. \n\nEdit: I use the no lather conditioner by ouidad. I get the 1 Liter bottle and it lasts me for 6 months. It’s very moisturizing but a bit pricey. I’ve also enjoyed Camille rose they make the best conditioning products that make my hair soft, I use the deep conditioner. I’ve also used TGIN brand that I’ve enjoyed. My sister swears by Deva curl but I wasn’t a huge fan. Also Trader Joe’s have some great hair products that are dupes of salon products. And I’m pretty sure are silicone free and not too pricy. I’ve tried a lot of products lol!!\n\nEdit 2: one of the Trader Joe’s shampoo and conditioner had tea tree oil in it and it was super refreshing on the scalp, very cleansing. That might be helpful for dealing with oil!",

I have been avoiding silicones for over a year now, and I found it to be difficult at first while I struggled to find products and routines that work for me. \n\nRight now, I am using the SheaMoisture moisture retention shampoo and restorative conditioner. I absolutely love these, because they don’t have silicones or protein in them (my hair is protein sensitive and gets brittle when I use products with protein). About every 4 weeks I will use a Neutrogena clarifying shampoo, or really whenever I feel like I need it. I also use the Living Proof leave-in conditioner and de-tangler. Lately, I am considering bringing silicones back in to my routine, but I want to be careful not to use too much because I found it weighed down my hair so much in the past. I have replaced my Living Proof detangling spray with a Bumble&Bumble one that has dimethicone, and it has been going pretty well so far.\n\nWhile these products have been working well to keep my hair hydrated and feeling soft without silicones, something I suggest to anyone with thin hair would be either a silk pillow-case or silk night-cap. I use a silk night-cap that has helped me tremendously with breakage and flyaways, and I always wake up with smooth hair ready for the day. However, I did get a few weird looks from my fiancé at first at bedtime! But even he has noticed improvement with my hair and now accepts it 😁",

    "body": "Does anyone know of a good conditioner with water-soluble silicones? For the past month or so I've tried cutting down on my use of silicones and sulfates (only use a sulfate shampoo once a week or so because my hair feels too gross without it), but overall my hair feels worse than before. About a month ago I bought some natures gate products, because I really like how they're relatively inexpensive and also vegan/cruelty free. \n\nFor anyone who's curious: \n\nThis is the ingredients list for the shampoo I've been using: Water, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, sodium cocoyl isethionate, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, lauryl glucoside, glycerin, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract, panthenol, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, borago officinalis (borage) seed oil, tocopherol, ascorbic acid, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, equisetum arvense (horsetail) leaf extract, geranium maculatum (geranium) extract, salvia officinalis (sage) leaf extract, mimosa tenuiflora (mimosa) bark extract, ascorbyl palmitate, polysorbate 20, leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, glyceryl undecylenate, citric acid, fragrance (parfum)*\nMade in the USA from globally sourced materials.\n* Phthalate free\nNo - sodium lauryl/laureth/coco sulfates, phthalates, butylene glycol, artificial colors.\n\nAnd this is the ingredients list for the conditioner - Water, Glycerin (Vegetable Derived), Stearyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Cetyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Vegetable Derived), Benzyl Alcohol, Stearalkonium Chloride (Vegetable Derived), Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Hordeum Vulgare (Barley) Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Fruit Extract, Viola Tricolor (Pansy) Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hydroxyethylcellulose (Plant Derived), Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Fragrance*.\n*Phthalate free.\n\nMy hair feels straw-like even in the shower, there's no slip unless it's absolutely coated in conditioner and then as soon as it rinses out it feels gross again. I also feel like my hair is falling out more often (if I pull at the tips, long strands will start coming out in the shower). I don't really know what to do. I feel like my hair gets buildup pretty easily because when I've tried cowashing with thick shampoos or have put oil in my hair it always feels really weighed down and greasy the next day. I also have a lot of problems with an itchy, flaky scalp. \n\nI was thinking that using a conditioner with water soluble silicones would be the best compromise - all the benefits of silicones but without the buildup. \n\nDoes anyone have any product recommendations? *I've also been looking for a heat protectant spray* that contains water soluble silicones, since I usually straighten my hair a bit to get rid of the really weirdly shaped waves. I've started using a bit of salt spray in my hair as well (not that often), but I feel like it's been drying out my ends. I considered mixing a bit of conditioner or oil (I've heard jojoba is closest to the scalp sebum) into the mix to make it less damaging, but I have no idea what the salt is doing to my hair with or without silicones. On one hand, it seems like silicones would protect my hair from the salt penetrating it too much. But on the other, it would also prevent the moisturizing ingredients from penetrating my hair, so it seems like a catch-22. I do think I need silicones though, because my hair just doesn't seem to be doing too great without them.   \n\nI'm sorry for such a long post! But if anyone could help me, that would be wonderful.

You might want to find a protein free conditioner to use and only use the protein one once every couple of weeks.\n\nAlso salt spray will just dry out your strands and make your hair feel coarse. I'm not sure why you are using salt spray if your straighten your hair. It's more likely to make it wavy and crazy.\n\nIf you use heat I'd maybe get a silicone heat spray/serum and just use it on the parts you straighten. Silicone WILL wash out if you don't use it in every single product and it will help to protect your hair from heat.\n\nWhen not using heat. Use an oil on your ends to keep them soft.\n\nHope that helps :)",

I tried going silicone and sulfate free as well, but it just resulted in tangles and increased hair loss after a couple of months. I've since gone back to using silicones for daily conditioning. I normally use a sulfate free-shampoo, and when I notice build-up weighing my hair down, I'll use a sulfate shampoo to remove the residue (usually 1-2x per week). I try to keep the silicones off my scalp and only on the shafts and ends of my hair. This combination has resulted in far more manageable and healthier looking hair for me.\n\nMy preferred shampoo and conditioner combo is Loreal Everstrong: http://a.co/8UHjdLn",

    "body": "So I just discovered that Nivea did the unforgivable crime of reformulating their classic bestseller - their body milk in light blue bottle with Shea butter and almond-y scent. It’s called the Nivea Pampering Soft Milk (VERWÖHNENDE SOFT MILK) in the light blue bottle. it’s also called:\nNivea Smooth Sensation Body Soft Milk or Nivea Smooth Sensation Body Lotion, depending on the country. The formula for all those three names is the same, I’ve checked (after going down this rabbit hole), and the colour of the bottle is the same. \n\nAnd if you are in the US, then the formula for a similarly-looking Nivea body lotion in the light blue bottle (which in the US is called Nivea Shea Nourish Body Lotion) is different from both old and new European formulas for the same product 😩 the old European formula is better, the US formula is much simpler (but should work in a humid climate where people don’t need as much moisture). \n\nback to European formulas:\n\nApparently, they’ve also reformulated their other body milks/body lotions, both in deep blue colour bottle and in the white bottle (which is why those products no longer work for my skin 😩). \n\nThe new formula isn’t as hydrating and occlusive as the old one (even though the new formula claims to give hydration for 72 hours, the old one was better). Basically, the old formula has a richer feel, stays longer on the skin and locks-in moisture better, for longer period of time bc it had stronger occlusives and emollients. But as the result, it was a bit tugging on the skin and took a few minutes to absorb. The new formula absorbs immediately,  is easier to apply but is less hydrating. And it now contains denatured alcohol (at least in the light blue and white bottles). So, if you live high humidity and have normal, combo or slightly dry skin, you probably will be okay with the new formula. But if you live in dry air or have extremely dry skin, then you probably would prefer the old formula. \n\nfor years the old Nivea Body Milk in light blue was my holy grail. Nothing could beat it. Even Lipikar or Vaseline Body Lotion weren’t strong enough for my skin. Nivea was the only lotion that would actually keep my skin moisturised for an entire day, without being too thick, too greasy, too difficult to apply or too slow absorbing. And now it’s gone 😢 \n\nFortunately, you can still find the old formula on Amazon and in some online stores who are still selling the leftover stock. The new formula has words 72 h  on the packaging. The old formula would say 5 in 1, 48 h. The old formula is still officially available in Ghana and some other markets around the world but in EU, UK, Ukraine it seems to be officially discontinued (so only can be found in old stock). \n\nIf you are curious about the formulas, here are all of the them: \n\nThe old European formula for Nivea light blue body milk/lotion: \n\nAqua, Glycerin, C15-19 Alkane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Palmitate, Paraffinum Liquidum, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Glucoside, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Sodium Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Linalool, Limonene, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citral, Geraniol, Parfum (this formula should be saved in some museum of skincare and studied by chemists bc it’s so good).\n\nThe new European formula for the same product: \n\nAqua,Glycerin,Alcohol Denat.,Cetearyl Alcohol,Ethylhexyl Cocoate,Glyceryl Stearate SE,Butyrospermum Parkii Butter,Isopropyl Palmitate,Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil,Sodium Hyaluronate,Tocopherol,Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil,Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate,Glyceryl Stearate hydroxypropyl starch phosphate, xanthan gum, ethylhexylglycerine, phenoxyethanol, linalool, limonene, benzyl alcohol, perfume.\n\nThe US version of the product: \n\nWater, Mineral Oil, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, C15-19 Alkane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Dimethicone, Fragrance, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nI’ve also found this version in the Polish market (but they have both the new and the old European formulas, too) - this is one is quite close to the OG formula in terms of the level of hydration and occlusion but less cosmetically-elegant, heavier, waxier, a bit slower to absorb and a bit more difficult to spread: \n\nAqua, Glycerin, C1316 Isoparaffin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Palmitate, Paraffinum Liquidum, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Glucoside, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Sodium Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Linalool, Limonene, Hydroxyisohexyl 3Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol, AlphaIsomethyl Ionone, Citral, Geraniol, Parfum.\n\nThe closest thing to the old formula that I’ve found so far is their new Nivea Irresistibly Smooth Body Cream in the light blue jar. The formula is different, slightly less hydrating but close enough. It should be more fast absorbing and easier to apply: \n\nGlycerin, Mineral Oil, Alcohol Denat., Stearyl Alcohol, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Cetyl Alcohol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Microcrystalline Wax, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, Myristic Acid, Arachidic Acid, Oleic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Linalool, Limonene, Benzyl Alcohol, Citronellol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, BHT, Fragrance. - \n\nit’s not available in all countries, only in some. \nThe Polish regional variant is also close to the OG body milk formula but is less cosmetically elegant. \n\nSo since I now know these things, I had to share it with you 😂\n\n",

I think the version with glycerine+vit E is supposed to be the heaviest of the bunch, maybe it's worth checking out.  \nAs a more expensive option, you could try the Bioderma Atoderm cream or balm. I had the cream a few years ago and found it more occlusive than Lipikar, so the balm should work even better.",

    "body": "So last year when I visited Japan, my sister asked me to buy her a Japanese hair treatment product that doesn't have any obvious English writing to suggest it's a hair product because it's written in Japanese.\n\nFast forward to a few weeks ago - my sister starts accusing me of using her hair treatment as each time she would take a shower, the bottle would mysteriously end up next to the bathroom sink. I explained to her that I had never used it before and that it was not me.\n\nNow today, as I prepared to leave for a holiday in South Korea this morning - my mother asked me to buy another bottle of the hair treatment (without realising it was hair treatment). My sister saw and exclaimed \"so it was you using it!\". My mother explained that she had been using it for some time on her face and that it made it really nice - both me and my sister screamed internally and we had to explain to her that it was hair treatment.\n\nSo what I'm wondering at this point is - would be there be any harms in her using the hair treatment as a face wash? The ingredients are written in Japanese but I pulled the listing from Amazon Japan and have transcribed/translated them below:\n\n> water, isopentyl diol, behentrimonium chloride, glycerin, stearyl alcohol, dimethicone, behenyl alcohol, cetanol, DPG, maltitol, aminopropyl dimethicone, steartrimonium chloride, camellia seed oil, lactic acid, lemon extract, rose water , Royal jelly extract, soybean seed extract, isopropanol, isopropyl myristate, PEG-2 laurate, amodimethicone, SODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE , salicylic acid, PPG-2-deces-12, EDTA-2Na, cetrimonium chloride, BG, tocopherol, Sodium benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Flavor, Red 227, Yellow 4    \n\nI punched them into CosDNA and can't see anything particularly of concern but I'm not an expert by any means but I was hoping to get input from people with more knowledge.",

    "body": "Just to put into perspective, I'm 32F and started tretinoin a few months ago, which has caused my skin needs to change. My skin is combo/leaning towards dry (used to be combo/oily) and more sensitive (I can NOT tolerate niacinamide). \n\nLike many others, my skin did *not* like the new Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser formula and I've been struggling to find something ever since. The Differin Gentle Cleanser is listed a lot, but it appears that this facial cleanser has also been discontinued.\n\nThe ingredients aren't completely the same, however on my quest to find a cleanser that is both gentle, doesn't sting, doesn't cause redness, and doesn't dry out my skin, I came across the [Japanese Curel Foaming Face Wash](https://kao-h.assetsadobe3.com/is/image/content/dam/sites/kaousa/www-curel-com/curel-japan/master/global/curel-foaming-facial-wash-front.jpg?fmt=jpeg&qlt=85&wid=588). For those that double cleanse, they make a Make-Up Cleansing Gel as well (I can't vouch for it, but I did see that it exists).\n\n\n#**INGREDIENTS**\n**Japanese Curel:** Water/Aqua, Glycerin, Maltitol, Propylene Glycol, PEG-150, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Lauroyl Aspartate, Lauryl Hydroxysultaine, Polysorbate 60, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Potassium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben.\n\n**Old Cetaphil Formula:** Water, Cetyl Alcohol, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Stearyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben\n\n\n\n\n**Since I've become aware of the formula change, here are other face cleansers that I've tried and my skin did not like:**\n\n* **Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser** -  not gentle enough/stripped my skin. Did NOT cause redness.\n* **Aveeno Calm+ Restore Cleanser Gentle Nourishing Oat Face Cleanser** - First night was fine, after that my face got itchy, tight, and red.\n* **Belif Aqua Bomb Jelly Cleanser** - I had this lying around from a sample pack I had. It was fine to bridge me between cleansers for a day or two, but would not work as an every day cleanser.\n* **Olay Regenerist Collagen Peptide 24 Cream Cleanser** - I had this one lying around in my graveyard of face washes. It didn't dry out my skin, but my face was super red (niacinamide). \n* **The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser** - I genuinely don't know if you can use this as just a one-step cleanser. I don't really wear heavy make-up, so I don't need to double cleanse. Either way, sometimes my skin liked this, sometimes my skin ended up drier. Caused redness.\n* **ETUDE SoonJung pH 6.5 Whip Facial Cleanser** - Gentle, but my skin still felt dry after. I think this would work better for combo/leaning towards oily skin. \n* BONUS: Garnier Micellar Water Rose Water/Vitamin C - Both feel the same to my face and I'll admit I have no idea what I'm doing with micellar water. I started using this to take off sunscreen/eye make-up before cleansing my skin or to clean the shell of my ears on a non hair-wash day. \n\n\n*Side note, I'm in the market for a chemical sunscreen without niacinamide. Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun : Rice + Probiotics feels amazing but causes redness like no other. I currently use Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch, which is fine.* \n\nApologies if the formatting is atrocious.",

I read every how-to guide, tried a ton of different conditioners, and just eventually decided maybe it wasn't for me.\n\nFast forward to last weekend- I went out of town and just threw a couple of random shampoo and conditioner samples I had on hand into my bag. One of them was a [Sachajuan Hair Cleansing Cream](https://shop.sachajuan.com/products/hair-cleansing-cream)\n\nI got to the hotel, realized it wasn't a shampoo and decided to give it a shot according to the package directions. I had low expectations, but it was AMAZING. My hair looked great air dried with no product, and the wash lasted with just a little dry shampoo for a solid week.\n\nI looked into buying a bottle and it is really outside my budget. I am willing to pay for good quality hair products, and I can technically afford it, but we're trying to save up right now, so I'm hoping there is something close, even if not an exact dupe, available for less $$.\n\nThe ingredients are: AQUA (WATER),GLYCERIN, ISOPROPYL PALMITATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, STEARAMIDOPROPYL DIMETHYLAMINE,GLYCERYL STEARATE, PARFUM (FRAGRANCE), HYDROLYZED RHODOPHYCEA (RED ALGAE) EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, DICAPRYLYL ETHER, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, LINALOOL, LIMONENE.\n\nI've searched the sub and read a lot about what different ingredients do, but I'm not sure what's most important here?\n\nSo my question: am I just looking for something with glycerin high up on the ingredients list? Is there some combination of these ingredients that's most important? Or should I just suck it up and buy the real thing?\n\nIf it matters, I have thick, wavy hair that tends to be oily. Any advice or recommendations would be appreciated!",

    "body": "I started my tret journey back in March, on 0.025% Obagi cream. I managed to go up to nightly use in two months and had absolutely zero peeling or purging – just the usual, occasional hormonal spot here and there. My derm then suggested we move up to 0.05%, but the price tag made my eyes water (around ~£120). I then found Menarini online for ~£13; I'd read good things about gel vs cream, and I didn't need a prescription to order it. So, I took the plunge. \n\nI think it's the worst thing I've ever done for my skin. I went in carefully, sandwiching once every three days. Suddenly, I broke out all over my chin, around my mouth and along my jawline. Super painful cystic acne, with spots coming up in clusters of two or three - never just one. My skin didn't *feel* irritated but it clearly was, so I simplified my routine even further and completely stopped using my SA cleanser. \n\nI thought I was just mid purge, so I tried to persevere, but after 3 weeks I just felt constantly sore and depressed so I got back in touch with the derm and explained. He said he's not familiar with Menarini but that there might be something in the formulation that my skin doesn't agree with - but he didn't say what. He advised I take a break completely and contact him again once my skin has calmed down/cleared. I'm now on day 5 with no tret. I haven't had any new acne, and my existing breakouts are calming super quickly. \n\nI'm going to follow his advice and get back in touch when my skin feels ready, but I want to do some homework before I take the hit on paying so much for Obagi. So I'm curious - what could my skin be reacting poorly to in the Menarini? I'm not clued-up on ingredients at all but so many people in this sub are incredibly knowledgeable, so I thought it was worth a shot. I found the ingredients lists for both, and have copied and pasted them below:\n\nMenarini 0.05% gel\n\nActive Ingredients tretinoin gel USP – 0.05% Excipients: PEG-4 olivat, PEG-7 olive oil ethers, methyl hydroxybenzoate, propyl hydroxybenzoate, propylene glycol, silicone oil, caprylic / capric triglyceride, carbomer, triethanolamine, purified water.\n\n---\n\nObagi 0.025%\n\nEach gram contains: Tretinoin 0.025%, stearic acid, isopropyl myristate, polyoxyl 40 stearate, stearyl alcohol, xanthan gum, sorbic acid, butylated hydroxytoluene, and purified water.",

    "body": "**Tl;dr**: more propylene glycol and/or higher PH = better results, but itchy and inflamed scalp. Propylene glycol varies greatly among brands, and some products also have citric acid to lower the PH to the neutral. You can find the ingredients and their exact percentage in official drug registries of some countries.\n\n# Introduction\n\nI've seen claims all over Tressless, that minoxidil brand doesn't matter, foam has the same efficacy as liquid, and that if it didn't work, it was fake minoxidil. It didn't turn out to be true in my case. I didn't mean to test anything. I was just having too much skin irritation with the first (very effective) product I used, switched to another one, and side effects disappeared along with my gains. So I switched to yet another product and had some little improvement, with slightly more side effects. All products were legally registered 5% minoxidil foam/liquids, bought at authorized pharmacies, so I started digging information on differences between specific products. I figured out a theory and tested it, so you don't have to.\n\n# Theory\n\nPH is a measurement of acidity/basicity of a substance. Neutral PH is 7, water has such a PH. PH lower than 7 means the substance is acidic. Higher PH means the substance is basic (alkaline). Human scalp PH is about 5.4-5.6, to make life harder for germs.\n\nI learned on my own skin (and hair), how PH of minoxidil formulation and/or propylene glycol content shape the effectiveness and side effects of topical minoxidil. Minoxidil liquids consist mostly of minoxidil (of course!), propylene glycol (PH 9.3-10.5), ethanol (PH 7.3), water (PH 7.0) and sometimes citric acid (PH 3.0-6.0, hard to say, because pure citric acid is solid). I guess the role of propylene glycol increasing absorption, effectiveness and causing skin irritation, is based on its high PH. Here's one source claiming alkaline (high PH) environment boosts minoxidil results: [https://rest.neptune-prod.its.unimelb.edu.au/server/api/core/bitstreams/818e43e5-d66d-58be-b067-064ccd15095a/content](https://rest.neptune-prod.its.unimelb.edu.au/server/api/core/bitstreams/818e43e5-d66d-58be-b067-064ccd15095a/content)\n\n# Tested products and results\n\nFor the record, I live in Poland and buy minoxidil only in physical pharmacies. That limits my choices to brands and formulations officially registered in Poland, but it guarantees minoxidil isn't fake, and gives me the ability to check the full list of the ingredients, including their amount, on government website. This information is not present in the leaflet. **We don't have Rogaine or Kirkland in official distribution, so I didn't test them.** I mention it, because these are the most common names I've seen here (I guess most of you live in the USA). The full list of ingredients is presented in so called \"product characteristics\", available on the public registry of drugs. Maybe there is a similar website in the USA, where you can check it? I don't know.\n\nProducts I've tested were given nicknames Formulation A-D, so I don't promote any brand. I've ordered them chronologically. Their characteristics and my experiences:\n\n# Formulation A\n\nLiquid. 1g of the product consists of:\n\n* **50mg minoxidil**\n* 509mg propylene glycol\n* 248mg ethanol 96%\n* purified water (undisclosed amount, but you can deduce)\n\nTested for 2 months. 10/10 effectiveness. Gave me hypertrichosis, over 10mm long peach fuzz on my entire forehead, but also headaches, dizzines and gradually worsening contact dermatitis.\n\n# Formulation B\n\nFoam. 1g of the product consists of:\n\n* **50mg minoxidil**\n* 560mg waterless ethanol (>99.8% purity)\n* 11.6mg cetyl alcohol\n* 5.3mg stearyl alcohol\n* 1mg butylated hydroxytoluene\n\nTested for 1 month. 1/10 effectiveness. Lost 80% of gains on it, completely reversed hypertrichosis, works only locally and maintained only small amount of my gains in the middle of my hairline.\n\n# Formulation C\n\nLiquid. 1g of the product consists of:\n\n* **50mg minoxidil**\n* 500mg ethanol 96%\n* 300mg propylene glycol\n* purified water (undisclosed amount)\n* citric acid (undisclosed amount)\n\nTested for 1 month. 3/10 effectiveness. Maintains 3mm long peach fuzz on my entire forehead (I use it as an absorption and effectiveness metric), slightly harsher than the Formulation B, very slow gains started to appear.\n\n# Formulation D\n\nLiquid. 1g of the product consists of:\n\n* **50mg minoxidil**\n* 520mg ethanol 96%\n* 240mg propylene glycol\n* purified water (undisclosed amount, but you can deduce)\n\nTesting so far for 2 weeks. Based on side effects, I guess it will be 5-6/10 in terms of effectiveness. I need to give it slightly more time to make it comparable to others. Nonetheless, it's one of 2 products (besides Formulation A), that make some serious peach fuzz form in my temples. It's harsher than formulation C, even though it has less propylene glycol, but it almost surely has higher PH.",

I use a version of [Crunchy Betty's face oil recipe](http://www.crunchybetty.com/simple-homemade-3-ingredient-facial-oil-moisturizer-customize-it-for-your-own-gorgeous-skin) in the morning and evening.  I put it on right after I wash my face/shower while my skin is still damp so it seals in moisture.  \n\nWhen my skin gets really dry, I use a shea butter recipe.  Despite the fact that it can feel pretty greasy, shea butter is actually non-comedogenic, so it doesn't give most people acne.  This does take some time to soak it, so I treat it as more of a night cream then a day cream.  This is my approximate recipe:\n\n~2/3 shea butter \n\n~1/3 oil (almond, jojoba, and/or grape seed are the ones I usually use)\n\ndash vitamin E oil (good for skin and also acts as a preservative)\n\ndash rose hip oil (I find this oil really nourishing- it's often used in anti-aging products)\n\ndash glycerin (helps draw water into your skin cells)\n\na few drops of lavender EO\n\nIf you're *really* dried out, you can also add some beeswax, but this makes the lotion take even longer to soak in, and I'm not convinced that it's ok for acne-prone skin.\n\nAdditionally, you can add some corn starch or arrow-root powder to your lotion to soak up some of the oil, giving you a softer, less-greasy finish that may be easier to apply makeup over.\n\nI also like to add just a few drops of honey to my lotion sometimes.  Unfortunately, this does make your lotion stickier, but it is incredibly good at healing blemishes and brightening your complexion.  Make sure to use raw honey, and don't add it to the lotion until you're about to mix it with the beaters so that you don't denature all the good proteins.\n\n*Instructions:*\n\nCombine all ingredients in a double boiler and allow the shea butter to melt.  Stir.  Pour into a mixing bowl and put directly into the fridge.  (The faster the mixture solidifies, the smoother it will be.)  After a few hours when the mixture has hardened, put it on the counter and allow it to warm to room temperature.  Mix with electric beaters and put it in a jar.",

Also if something works for you, then it works for you, ingredients list shouldn't be what makes or breaks it for you because cosmetic formulators are not idiots)\n\nThese are supposed to be moisturising hair masks... But here's the thing... there's no humectant... Not even one.\n\nBoth of these have fatty alcohol which provide that soft feel you'll be getting after using them and the cationic surfactant behentrimonium chloride will provide the slip for detangling but there's no humectant which imo feels like an essential ingredient in a hair mask, not even the humble glycerine... (Granted there is straight up water for hydration but really... Buying moisturising hair mask that depends on water for hydration?)\n\nI've seen curly hair influencers reviewing them saying though they provide slip they don't moisture their hair which kinda makes sense. These feel like detangling conditioners rather than moisturising hair masks. (again this is an opinion formed solely by looking at the ingredients list which isn't the be all end all)",

I found it a year or so ago while looking for a lotion to help with occasional razor burn bumps after shaving my legs and overall dry skin. I've been using it on my whole body after showers since then and I'm currently on my second bottle. Razor burn on my legs has completely cleared up, and near-daily use has dramatically reduced bumpy skin on my upper arms. My skin is hydrated and smoother all over. It's helped fade some surgery scars on my stomach. I used to suffer from mild eczema under my knees, in my elbows, and around my underwear lines in the summer and I haven't developed a single spot since I started using this lotion. The scent is light and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin or asthma. It is a thick lotion, and if the last bit at the bottom of the bottle was easier to get out (pump bottle has trouble pumping the last half-inch or so of lotion) it would be perfect IMO. One bottle lasts me about six months of frequent use (probably 4-6 times a week). As a bonus, the company is ethically run, with no animal testing and fair-trade ingredients, and is completely cruelty-free.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Where to Buy**: Easily available for a reasonable price and large bottle. Mine is 16 oz and cost me $13 at the store near my house. I've seen this lotion at CVS, Walgreens, and occasionally a Wal-Mart or Target. It's available on the Shea Moisture website for $11.99, and on Amazon through third-party sellers for \\~$19. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR- This lotion has changed my relationship with my bumpy, sensitive skin on my arms and legs. It's cheap, easy to get, and the company is cruelty free. A quality AHA body lotion.**",

    "body": "**Introduction**\n\nToday's cleanser products come in the form of a solid (bar), liquid (delivered as a pourable or pumped liquid), gel, or wipe cloth. Cleansers are based on surfactant chemistry and their structural properties; surfactants playing a role in removal of soil from a substrate and structural properties shaping the delivery and use experience of the product. Surfactant systems are typically based on alkaline salts, synthetic surfactants, and natural surfactants.\n\n**Top Fundamentals**\n\nA key to utilizing surfactant's unique properties lies in understanding how and when to use them. Surfactants can be easily incorporated into cosmetic personal care formulas, but this requires skillful execution of surfactant-related processes:\n\nSurfactant molecules rest at a water interface, forming a thermodynamically stable system that prevents polar and non-polar solvents from contacting each other;\n\n* thermodynamically stable systems primarily include: micelles, lamellae, micro-emulsions, emulsions, and liquid crystals\n\n---\n\nPolar and non-polar components of a surfactant provide varying affinity that allows a surfactants to attract to specific solvents;\n\n* non-polar components are hydrophobic and typically insoluble in water - can be linear or branched alkyl or alkyl and aromatic, sulfuric, nitrogenic, phosphoric, alkoxylate groups combined\n\n* polar components are hydrophilic; this region determines a surfactant's classification: nonionic (polyalkoxylate, glucose, sucrose, amine oxide), anionic (sulfate, sulfonate, carboxylate, phosphate), cationic (alkylammonium salts), or zwiterionic (which contains both anionic and cationic groups)\n\n**Anionic surfactants** are incorporated for their surface activity (negative charge polar head groups like carboxylic acid, sulfates, sulfonic acids, and phosphoric acid derivatives),\n\n**Cationic surfactants** are incorporated for their electrostatic attractive properties to skin and hair, and substantivity [positive charge polar head groups like amines, alkylimidazolines, alkoxylated amines, quaternary ammonium),\n\n**Non-ionic surfactants** are incorporated as emulsifiers, conditioning agents, and solubiliziers/coupling agent (no charge and represented by alkylene oxides, polyglucosides, fatty alcohols, ethanolamines, dimethylamine oxides),\n\n**Amphoteric surfactants** are incorporated as secondary surfactants to help boost foam, improve conditioning, and reduce irritation (zwitterionic with positive and negative depending on pH of environment).\n\n---\n\nThe selection of right surfactant system is difficult because of the diversity of options. -- When deciding upon a system:\n\nconsider the interaction of ingredients and how a surfactant-based cleansing system will be positioned in the marketplace\nchose the raw material manufacturers because they might employ different processes:\n\n   (a)\tthere is always concern - as relates to manufacturer variations - regarding quality and performance of ingredients\n\n   (b)\tthere can be variances in the consistency of ingredients from batch to batch and lot-to-lot\n\n   (c)\tsurfactant specifications are critical to ensure viscosity control, color, odor, pH, salt content, and foaming/cleansing characteristics\n\n---\n\nThe general mechanism of surfactancy is similar, care should be taken, understanding why a surfactant is used and how to determines selection of the right combination of surfactants. Everyday functional uses of surfactants include:\n\n* **Detergency** to remove soil - e.g., in shampoos and soap\n* **Wetting** to improve the contact angle between a solution and a substrate - e.g., in coloring of hair and applications of permanent wave lotions\n* **Foaming** for appearance - e.g., in shampoos, bubble bath, and laundry detergents\n* **Emulsification** to form a stable mixture of two incompatible phases to include oil-in-water, water-in-oil, multiple phase, clear micro, alcoholic, nano-, and refractive index matching -- e.g., in skin and hair creams and lotions\n* **Solubilization** of insoluble components such that they are compatible in an incompatible system - e.g., in perfumes and flavors\n\n\nSurfactant Class | Ingredients | Benefits\n---------|----------|----------\n**Sulfates (anionic)** | Alkyl sulfates, alkyl ether sulfates | Can irritate the skin if left on too long, Solubility reduces as alkyl molecular weight increases - have better solubility than the un-ethoxylated version and start to lose their foaming characteristics and surfactancy as the degree of ethoxylation increases above 4, Considered milder than the un-ethoxylated version, ethoxylate bridge balances the optimal foaming and mildness - usually around 2 or 3 moles of EO\n**Sulfonates (anionic)** | Taurates, isethionates, alkyl/aryl sulfonates, olefin sulfonates, sulfosuccinates, sarcosinates | Stable in aqueous systems, but susceptible to hydrolysis; could cause minimal irritation and minimal damage to cuticle, Poor solubility and foaming in hard water hinders use in personal care products, Susceptible to hydrolysis, but relatively mild, Used in syndet bars and facial cleansers - produces a creamy feel when lathered; limited solubility barrier in clear systems, Leave a somewhat dry feel to skin; can be utilized as a hydrotrope to increase water solubility of other surfactants, especially in the presence of salt, Good foamers, especially in acid pH, used for mildness; have the potential to reduce irritation values of a surfactant system; poor foamer, but good synergistic lathering with other surfactants, Less irritating than sulfates; works well in soft and hard water (decrease in hard water at low pH's); compatible with cationics\nPhosphates (aphiphilic) | - | Based on mono- or di-esters and an ethoxylated alcohol; milder than sulfates but higher cost, Within this grouping are phospholipids, which can be used for their physiological role and formation of liposomal structures to enhance delivery of actives\n**Amines (cationic)** | Alkylamines, alkoxylated amines, amine oxides, alkanolamides, amphoterics (e.g., alkylamido alkylamines) | Not used much in cleansers because they can contribute an amine odor to a formula and potential irritants; salts (e.g., alkylamidopropyl amines) are milder and contribute to conditioning properties of a treated surface, Good for acidic systems, where they provide good conditioning properties, Nonionic; have been under-utilized because of poor purity in the past (as processes have improved, use of them is showing a resurgence); good foam boosters; stable in amphiphilics; reduce irritation of sulfate systems; long-chain alkyl amine oxides require a higher-than-normal salt concentration to form worm-like micelles, Historically used for their foam boosting properties and ability to increase viscosity; can be used in low pH systems, Used to reduce the irritation value of anionics; act as a foam booster with improved substantive conditioning\n**Esters & Glucosides** | Glycerides, sorbitan esters, ethoxylated, alkyl glucoside | Limited surfactancy but good conditioning properties (especially the ethoxylated types), Good hydrophobe, particularly the acylated types; when ethoxylated, yield very good coupling agents and mild conditioning agents, Enhances solubilization of incompatible ingredients, mild conditioning, co-emulsification, and thickening, Good foamers; good detergency; diverse compatibility; poor stability in highly acidic mediums; ethoxylated version improves creamy feel in cleansers\n**Alkoxylated alcohol (Ethers)** | Blocked copolymers, alkyl glucosides | Going from ethoxylated (PEG) to propoxylated (PPG), reduces aqueous solubility; block polymers of the PEG and PPG create hydrophobic or hydrophilic ingredients, Produce extensive foam; are mild; and leave a substrate soft and smooth to the touch\n\n**Practical Aspect**\n\nAn important step in developing a cleansing-type product is to consider how surfactants will be incorporated into them to optimize performance and processing. The main performance properties of cleansers are creation of some type of foam and cleansing action; but level of foam and the structure of the foam bubble (e.g., creamy, loose, tight, quick breaking, etc.) are equally important.\n\nFundamentals to successful cleanser construction are:\n\n* determination of which part of the body is to be cleaned\n* foam size and structure\n* ease of building foam\n* feel during application and after rinse off\n* viscosity during dispensing and use\n* deposition of active ingredients.\n \nIt does not stop there. Also necessary is development of an aesthetically pleasing product that consumers will continue to use. Additionally, as in-process foaming is a concern, consideration of equipment used during formulation is of importance; and, as surfactants need to dissolve quickly and fully, equipment, order of addition of ingredients (to include surfactants), mixing rate, and temperature need to be considered.\n\nWhen constructing a cleansing formula one needs to divide the formula into functional buckets:\n\n**Water**\n\n**Primary Surfactant(s)** - the workhorse ingredient(s) required to remove soil from a substrate\n\n**Co-Surfactant(s)** - used to add structure to a formula (and could add foam density); conducive to forming a micelle structure that confers higher viscosity (Alkanolamide MEA and Betaines being the more common options)\n\n**Rheology Modifier(s)** - There are two types of rheology modifiers: polymeric and high melting point wax. Polymeric thickeners include Acrylate-chemistry, cellulosic, and gums (guar, xanthan and locust). High molecular weight/melting point waxes (e.g., Stearyl Alcohol and PEG esters) produce crystalline structures that provide suspension of insoluble components. Their performance properties include:\n\n* Controlling rheology and yield stress—modifying appearance, flow, and texture to alter pour and at-rest characteristics\n* Stabilizing oils and suspended particles\n* Thickening of surfactants - i.e., those that do not thicken with the addition of salt\n* Aesthetic modification - e.g., to impart a modified feel during application\n* Viscosity stabilization - i.e., preventing viscosity drift during long-term high-temperature stability testing\n\n**Preservative(s)** - since cleansing product tend to be based on aqueous systems at relatively neutral pH, preservatives are critical to maintaining a micro-organism-free system\n\n**pH Adjuster(s)** - alkaline and/or acidic (e.g., sodium hydroxide and citric acid)\n\n**Miscellaneous Functional Ingredients** -\n\n* Emolliency & Moisturization (e.g., glycerin, fatty acid esters, polymers)\n\n* Rinse-off aids\n\n* UV Stabilizers for colorants\n\n* Pearlizing agents\n\n* Antioxidants\n\n* Color\n\n* Fragrance\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIt is important to first think about the specific cleansing action required and both the visual and experiential objectives. Once you have these down, then look for the right combination of surfactant actives, type of preservative system necessary to protect the formulation, and ingredient build around other non-cleansing claims.\n\nSOURCE: [Special Chem 4 Cosmetics](http://www.specialchem4cosmetics.com/markets/skin-care/articles.aspx?id=9801) (registration required to view the article)",

        "body": "OP, Over a quarter century ago, I was diagnosed with ED and nothing me or my wife could do would get it hard.  I could easily feel pain, but absolutely zero pleasurable sensations, no matter what. I was unaware of anyone ‘restoring’ and everyone I tried to talk to about it were emphatic naysayers.  That included friends, family and members of the medical profession that included my wife. \n\nDekeratinization is important, but growing back nerves and nerve ends in the prepuce are where most of one’s true sexuality comes from.  Find a way to comfortably retain when not actively tensioning your remaining shaft tissue.  That has a number of benefits and none of the dangers of applying chemicals to what little mucosal tissue that you now may have.  I did use a lot of Vitamin E oil and some coconut oil. I don’t know if either were of any help. \n\nMy favorite retainer was 1/2” wide and 1” in diameter rubber bands, aka Lobster Claw Bands.  It kept my glans covered 24/7 after I learned how easily they were to put on and take off.  And there was a period of letting my penis get used to it.  It eventually allowed me to develop adult onset phimosis which I have learned to love, after having reversed it several times, just to prove that it could be done.",

        "body": "Amlactin, that's a new one on me. I asked Google's new AI bot about lactic acid, and here's what it replied:\n\n>Lactic acid is a chemical exfoliant that can improve skin appearance, increase cell turnover, and treat moderate skin conditions like acne, eczema, and psoriasis. It's derived from lactose, a carbohydrate found in milk, and is a popular ingredient in many skin care products. When applied to the skin, concentrations of 10% or less are generally safe for the face, while concentrations of up to 15% are usually safe for other parts of the body.\n\nOK, let's break this down:\n\n* Chemical exfoliants break down dead skin cells through chemical reactions. That sounds good on the surface (no pun intended) but where are you putting this chemical? On your glans and inner foreskin. But...\n* The glans and inner foreskin aren't skin - they're mucosa, like the inside of the mouth and nostrils, and other mainly internal tissues like the vagina, etc.\n* The skin on the face is more delicate than that on other parts of the body - and I guarantee that 'other parts of the body doesn't include the groin - so it says not to use 15% lactic acid on your face.\n* The mucosa of the glans and inner foreskin is far more delicate and less protective than the skin on the face, yet  you are considering using the 15% concentration lactic acid which is regarded as too potent to use on the face... on the mucosa of your dick.\n\nI strongly suggest you reconsider this idea. Chemicals 'burn', and what you're proposing is to effectively 'burn' the keratin off the head of your dick. \n\nOK, if I haven't talked you out of this idea - or if you don't believe me because I'm just a retired software engineer - please go ask a doctor if this is a wise course of action. I suspect it won't be a a long discussion.... \n\n'Doc, I'm thinking of smearing 15% lactic acid on the head of my dick to help it regain sensitivity. What do your think?'\n\nTop 3 expected answers in no particular order:\n\n'Don't do that.'\n\n'If you do, don't complain to me.'\n\n'Take pictures, so I can add them to my Facebook page titled 'You won't believe the stupid things people do.'\n\nSo why not try coconut oil, or Man1 Oil, or something similar - gentle stuff, not a chemical exfoliant.\n\nNow, on the subject of penile sensitivity, just about everyone focuses on the effect of 'keratinization' - which is a big factor - but they aren't even aware that there is another part of this: habituation.\n\nHabituation is the brain's defense against annoying and/or painful stimulus. It's pretty complex, but the tldr is that the brain is pretty good at filtering out unwanted stuff. \n\nI have tinnitus, but sometimes I don't even pay any attention to it... another example is living next to a freeway - I did that - or train tracks. After a while you don't notice the repetitive noises a lot of the time.\n\nThe brain can do the same thing to the annoying sensations coming from a circumcised dick. So it's not all about the keratin, there's a mental aspect to it as well.\n\nAnd that can be fixed, but not with chemicals. It takes time, and a transition from constant irritating stimulus to the peace of a glans covered 24/7 by what mother nature - or god, if you prefer - designed for it.\n\nBottom line: be nice to your dick - it's the only one you'll ever be issued. Don't try to artificially rush the process.....\n\nAnd lay off the harsh chemicals.\n\nCheers.",

I don't have rosacea, but if it makes your skin more sensitive I wouldn't recommend it. The clear cleanser also contains [triclosan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triclosan), which is an anti-bacterial agent. I think it's suppose to help with the acne, but it didn't make a particularly big difference for me. Far more important was the BHA and the BP. There's lots of options for cleansers though, honestly I think PC cleansers are on the expensive side and you could do without. But their BHA are to die for and the 2.5% BP is excellent. \n\nAs for the regular strength clear toner, I love that stuff! It's like the BHA 2% liquid (the extra strength is exactly the same as the BHA 2% liquid fyi) except it doesn't leave a residue on the skin and is more gentle. I'd start with that if you're new to BHA.\n\nIf you're concerned about the prices and not too much about potential irritation from the cleanser, I'd just buy the regular clear kit (or the trial size). If you're not, I'd suggest buying the hydralight cleanser (it comes in 16oz, cheaper by the oz and lasts FOREVER), the regular clear toner and the 2.5% BP.\n\nGood luck! :) PC also has a really good return policy and excellent customer service in my experience.",

Like the Ultra Sheer body lotion it has a sticker over the back and front, I assume because they're currently just imports and the package info needs to adhere to our guidelines. For some absolutely asinine reason, no sunscreen sold here actually has a full ingredients list (both active and inactive ingredients) yet the majority of sunscreens in the US do.

    "body": "Hi,   I've been lurking for a while, but now I need to ask for your help/advice.\n \nI have very fine, low-porosity, dyed 2C/3A hair in a jaw length inverse bob. I lucked in to some very awesome products when I started doing CG, and for the first time in my life I fell in love with my hair. However, finding my \"holy grail\" so early meant I never really experimented or tried things.  Now my products have been discontinued one by one, leaving me scrambling for similar replacements, and it's just not working. On paper, It looks like I pick the right things, but my hair is so sad now. It's just lackluster. Limp, kind of flat, feels dry no matter what I've tried. My curls are just wavy now. Nothing else has changed  as far as the style, dye, or routine.\n \nI don't mind paying  for pricey products that work, but I don't even know where to start at this point and I don't want to keep paying tons of money for more products that aren't doing anything for me. Any recs, products or otherwise, are much appreciated.\n\n\nEdit: My HG products were Spiral Solutions Caitlyn's conditioner mixed with a tiny bit of Spiral Solutions Repairing Protein Treatment, then Redken Soft Spin 05 gel, diffused with low heat and/or air dried.

It was on sale when I bought it, so I wanted to take a chance. It’s not worth it. It’s too difficult to spread on the skin, requires a lot of pulling and if you warm it up in your hands, it doesn’t transfer well, but just kinds of clings to your hands. It does NOT absorb. Like at all. It is so incredibly sticky and greasy, and I have dry skin. That is why I could not use it in the AM, and I even ruined a couple of pillowcases because of it. Of note, it did absolutely nothing for dehydration. The only one small redeeming point is that when using it immediately after an AHA exfoliator, it does help to soften the skin and restore nutrition. I do not recommend for any skin type.\n\nRepurchase: No\n\nOverall Score (1 lowest, 5 highest): 1/5\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vikhq4avrrkc1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4b480c7eceadbe0c6529027deb6ff27d9bd4f58\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Saturday Skin Yuzu Vitamin C Sleep Mask (50 ml)**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWATER/AQUA/EAU, GLYCERIN, NIACINAMIDE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, GLYCERETH-26, PHENYL TRIMETHICONE, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, BEHENYL ALCOHOL, POLYMETHYLSILSESQUIOXANE, CHLORELLA VULGARIS EXTRACT, GLUCOSE, CARBOMER, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, FRUCTOOLIGOSACCHARIDES, FRUCTOSE, HIPPOPHAE RHAMNOIDES OIL, TROMETHAMINE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, CITRUS JUNOS PEEL OIL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, DISODIUM EDTA, ECLIPTA PROSTRATA EXTRACT, ECLIPTA PROSTRATA LEAF EXTRACT, CITRUS JUNOS SEED OIL, MORINGA OLEIFERA SEED OIL, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, CHOLESTEROL, PEG-800, ASCORBIC ACID, TOCOPHEROL, POLYSORBATE 20, CERAMIDE NP, LINOLEIC ACID, RETINOL, CITRUS JUNOS FRUIT OIL, BIOFLAVONOIDS, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-1, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-1, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-2, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-22, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-45, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-8, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-9.\n\nPlace of purchase: SokoGlam\n\nPrice of purchase: $20.3 USD\n\nPackaging: Cute yuzu-inspired jar that comes with a spatula and inner lid. It’s a bit too much packaging for a small amount of product, though. \n\nScent: Yuzu scent (surprise!)\n\nTexture: Complex, lol! It has this nice gel-like texture that actually looks like yuzu jello, with PULP inside it. It has these little particles that are reminiscent of Yuzu peel. They disappear upon application.\n\nReason for purchase: I wanted to try a sleeping mask and really liked that this one had Vitamin C, retinol and ceramides. Seemed like it would help with both dehydration and hyperpigmentation.\n\nSeason for use: Year-round\n\nFrequency & place in routine: Sleep mask to replace PM moisturizer, once or twice a week.\n\nLength of use: several months\n\nExperience: The scent, packaging and texture of this product make it a very pleasurable experience to use! It’s so refreshing and I enjoyed using it. However, it was not hydrating enough, despite the gel-like texture – it does not protect from dehydration overnight unfortunately. Although it does make my skin a bit more supple the day after. Perhaps I needed to use it daily to see effects? One thing I did not like was that it does leave a sticky and tacky feeling after application. I’m giving 3/5 because I think it might be very good for oily, combination and normal skin types.\n\nRepurchase: No\n\nOverall Score (1 lowest, 5 highest): 3/5",

That might be why you didn't find it hydrating, but also of course, it might just not work for you! I use it over the dynasty cream 1-3 times a week and I can always notice a difference when I wake up, but it is one of my favourite products so again, everyone's different!",

    "body": "Good Skin Days On The Bright Side Moisturizer\n\nWhat an interesting journey it has been having the Soko Glam Good Skin Days products in my routine.\n\nThings started off great with the C’s The Day Serum, fell apart a bit with the Prime Time Cleansing Toner, and then rebounded with the wonderful A New Leaf Cream Cleanser I’m so happy to have had the chance to try out all of their offerings and end on a really good note with the On The Bright Side Moisturizer.\n\nThis lightweight/creamy gel style moisturizer reminds me a lot of some of the other lotions I have had in my routine over the past few months. Products like the Oat So Simple Water Cream and By Wishtrend VItamin 75 Maximizing Cream have a similar consistency/feel.\n\nThe offering from Good Skin Days focuses on hydration, nourishment, brightening/probiotic power with ingredients like Sake (the first ingredient to be exact), Squalane, Ceramides, and Madecassoside.\n\nThe formulation is pretty simple compared to some other moisturizers I have used and with  the addition of a few other ferments I didn’t mention above...the ingredients list reads more like a first treatment essence than a moisturizer lol.\n\nOne of the main things that stood out to me upon initial application was the super lightweight and cooling application. The On The Bright Side Moisturizer glides onto skin easily and absorbs quickly. On hot summer days/nights...I really appreciated the effect.\n\nI worried that this light/gel-like product wouldn't be enough for me on days where my skin felt dry or hot wind zapped all of my skin’s moisture. But, I found that layering/customizing each application of this moisturizer was sufficient in keeping my skin happy and hydrated throughout the day. A bit more on dry days...a bit less when I was planning on staying in. All without feeling greasy or heavy.\n\nHowever, those that prefer something a bit more “intense” may need to layer another cream or product on top of the On The Bright Side Moisturizer in the PM (I took to adding a few drops of the Sweet Chef Beauty Oil on certain nights).\n\nAs a bonus to the general hydration/nourishment I noticed from this product...the fermented ingredients do come through to offer some brightening benefit. The On The Bright Side Moisturizer really seemed to compliment/boost my first treatment essence (I was using Iope Bio Essence alongside this moisturizer) as I noticed slightly faster results in terms of skin tone balancing and glow.\n\nFor me, the Good Skin Days On The Bright Side Moisturizer was the stand-out of the range and something I would totally come back to. It might not be quite enough during the dry/cold Colorado winters but I could see it being an excellent choice for the rest of the year.\n\nOh, and it smells like root beer gummies...just thought I’d throw that in there.\n\nFull Ingredients List: Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake), Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Squalane, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Lactobacillus Ferment Lysate, Isopentyldiol, Water, Ceramide NP, Propanediol, Glycerin, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Streptococcus Thermophilus Ferment, Madecassoside, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nWhere To Buy (Soko Glam $24.00 USD): [https://sokoglam.com/collections/good-skin-days/products/good-skin-days-on-the-bright-side-moisturizer](https://sokoglam.com/collections/good-skin-days/products/good-skin-days-on-the-bright-side-moisturizer) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5749shqjvsj51.jpg?width=5472&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dfcd1ea3bdcb2b0dd04fe2986b47d0aed37c6d49",

    "body": " \n\nName: **Ethique Bliss Bar (Cleanser)** \\- a “solid face cleanser for balanced to dry skin”  \n \n\n**Background:**  \nMaybe 6 or so years ago I was having a hard time with acne and became an avid reader of ScA, and one of the main tips I got from this sub was to try a low-ph cleanser. While I know this isn’t important for everyone, this + an adequate moisturizer DRASTICALLY improved my skin’s baseline and ability to heal, and I was an early customer of Stratia and loyalist to my HG Velvet Cleanser by them for years. Stratia has obviously blown up and the prices and shipping have shot up a lot - they also shipped me not one but two cleansers with preservative issues that started rotting on my counter immediately (yuck).\n\nAdditionally, I realized that the bulk of the heavyweight, non-food related waste plastic I consume is for cosmetics and skincare. Ecological crisis anxiety lead me to trying to minimize my packaged products and find bar or zero plastic alternatives that still fit my (slightly snobby) skincare requirements.   \n \n\n**Ingredients:** Creamed Cocos nucifera (coconut) · sodium cocoyl isethionate · cocoyl methyl glucamide · stearic acid · cetyl alcohol · stearyl alcohol · maltodextrin  \n \n\n**PH**: Listed at 5-5.5 (dug in questions on website for this)  \n \n\n**Price**: $17 for full size. Can also purchase $5 mini to try.  \n \n\n**Time in use:** 2-3 months - and my bar is still very substantial! The price is steep for me for one product (I’m frugal) but it’s lasting forever as long as I don’t leave it in the shower.  \n \n\n**Packaging:** Ethique makes plastic-free skincare products so this bar comes in a sort of thick cube wrapped in compostable paper. I was able to acquire it from a local health food store so didn’t have to pay for additional individual shipping (bonus to me on the carbon footprint).  \n \n\n**Experience:** This bar is creamy with a very mild texture to it (NOT a physical exfoliant, just a little more textured than a gel cleanser). It has almost no scent - with no added fragrances, there is a mild nuttiness from the coconut solids. I wet my face and one side of the bar and then rub it directly on my face, though you can also lather it in your hands first. It creates a mild lather and then is easy to rinse off. I find the experience VERY similar to using my old Stratia cleanser - it cleans my skin, but does not create any additional tightness, dryness or itchiness after. I think it’s a medium-light cleanser - I don’t wear foundation or concealer routinely, just fun eye makeup, so it’s enough to take off my SPF and the day’s grime, but I would probably use a wipe or oil to remove heavy makeup first. It takes very little of the product to get a nice cleanse (I always felt like one pump was too much product of gel cleansers!). Ethique makes a little bar holder that you can purchase, but I sewed a little mesh bag that I keep mine in and hang up to dry when not using. I’ve been using it for a few months now and the size of the bar is still significant.  \n \n\n**Overall Opinion:** I love this product - new favorite, would absolutely keep using and re-purchase. It works like my favorite cleansers, is a fun user-experience (I love using the bar instead of a pump of goo!), and doesn’t hurt my skin or break me out. I have found it easy to travel with as well - a lil bar doesn’t take up much room.  \n \n\nMajor **pros**: It’s not fragranced, low ph, feels mild and creamy, lasts forever, is **plastic-free** and “carbon neutral” by the company, is sold in local ‘natural food’ stores so no shipping (for me in the USA), simple + short ingredient list. Possible **cons:** coconut based (though not straight up coconut oil - which I DO have acne sensitivity to. This product does not break me out.), not a heavy-duty cleanser especially for makeup, is a bar - so needs to dry out in between use to not make a mess.   \n \n\n\\~\\*\\~\\* Thanks for reading! I did search this sub before buying for reviews, but found them unsatisfactory! Hope this helps. Also, if anyone knows of an actually usable low-plastic SPF, plz suggest lol! \\*\\~\\*\\~",

Artemisia/mugwort is known for its ability to bring down redness and inflammation...and I’m From’s offerings contain some of the higher percentages of the ingredient that I have seen.\n\nTheir Mugwort Cream contains 73.55% mugwort extract alongside shea butter, father david elm extract, and fermented soybean/cogon grass extracts. The entire formulation reads like an herbal remedy that I imagine being concocted at an apothecary.\n\nAs for the consistency/texture...I was quite surprised.

But, once it’s gotten a chance to absorb there is a bit more of an occlusive feel and even slight residue left behind (which might not be ideal for those with oily skin that prefer really watery hydrators).\n\nHowever, it ended up being the lack of immediate calming/soothing that made this product a bit less impressive than the rest of the I’m From Mugwort products.\n\nWhile I did see an improvement to redness and irritation over the course of the past month...there wasn’t that immediate hit of redness reduction that I appreciated in the other products. I could always turn to the I’m From Mugwort Essence to bring my skin back from the brink when adjusting to Tretinoin or after being in the sun too long. \n\nThe I’m From Mugwort Cream just doesn’t seem to have that “triage” ability that I was hoping to see. The amount of hydration and moisture-locking ability is really nice though. Dry/normal skin that experiences redness or sensitivity might get along well with this product...but there might be a slower build to visible calming results. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Artemisia Princeps Extract, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Stearic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Arachidyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Flower Extract, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, C14-28 Alkyl Acid, Stearyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-2 Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Allatoin, Boswellia Serrata Resin Extract, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/ VP Copolymer, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/ Sodium Acryloydimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Dimethiconol, Saccharamyces/ Viscum Album (Misletoe) Ferment Extract, Lactobacillus/ Soybean Ferment Extract, Saccharomyces/ Viscum Album (Misletoe) Ferment Extract, Lactobacillus/ Soybean Ferment Extract, Saccharomyces/ Imperata Cylindrica Root Ferment Extract, Disodium EDTA, Polyglutamic Acid, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Artemisia Vulgaris Oil\n\nWhere To Buy ($32.00 USD - Wishtrend - 50ml): [https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/mugwort-cream/](https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/mugwort-cream/) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1v2hb1nphrq51.jpg?width=4707&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c1d9c6fc79b1872a8b62a5f86e994978fc3754f",

    "body": "So I know Dr. Vanita Rattan has got bad rep here in the sub and the Derma co is more or less the same but I really want to discuss their new range as the percentages seemed appealing to me initially.\n\nThe new range is live now so I have some doubts. They have come out with 5 products which include their \n\n1. Skin renew peptide anti pollution facewash\n2. Skin renew peptide hydrating toner with peptides and hyaluronic acid\n3. Skin renew ABC peptide exfoliator serum\n4. Skin renew peptide retinol serum-cream\n5. Skin renew barrier repair peptide moisturiser\n\nOut of these what fascinates me is their peptide retinol serum and moisturiser.\nThe serum claims 3% peptides, 0.2% encapsulated and 1% alpha arbutin, similarly, moisturiser has 1% ceramides, 0.5% peptides as star ingredients. The reason this intrigues me is this is something new in the Indian market I mean I don’t think we have 1% ceramides in an affordable range and 3% peptides that too with encapsulated retinol. Despite the fact that Dr Vanita is shady af these ingredients are attractive enough to ignore that.\n\nRetinol-peptide serum Ingredients :\nAqua, C13-15 Alkane, Diethylhexyl Carbonate, Behenyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Alpha-Arbutin, Retinol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Retinaldehyde, Pentaerythrityl Distearate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate,\nPentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, 4-t-Butylcyclohexanol, Xanthan\nGum, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Ethylhexylglycerin,\nTrisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Metabisulfite, Sodium\nLactate, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nMoisturiser ingredients :\nAqua, Propanediol, Coco Caprylate/Caprate, Ceto Stearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, Betaine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate,\nIsododecane, Squalane, 3-0-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Ceramide NP, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylgylcerin, Glycerl Mono\nStearate, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Glyceryl Sterate Citrate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantion, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, Sodium Gluconate\n\nHere comes my doubts\nI thought dr Vanita will formulate these products according to US guidelines by which first 10 ingredients should be above 1% and in descending order after which they can have any order. So the serum really confuse me. Retinol is above peptides which are 0.2 and 3 percents respectively and retinol is at number 7\nThere are two peptides which claimed to be higher are at number 12 and 13\n\nSimilarly star ingredient of the moisturiser, ceramides (1%) are at number 12 that too only one ceramide (ceramide NP)\n\nWhat you guys think? Will these productsbe effective? \n\n",

I do however find that in the summer months, even with regular applications of my SPF (and avoiding the sun like the plague), my melasma does get much worse, so I thought I'd see what else was out there.\n\nI came across Eucerin's SPF 100 recently and thought I'd give it a go (will leave info about it below). It pilled horribly the first time I used it, but I think I've got the knack of it now (basically layer light and wait a while after skincare to apply the SPF). It is not tinted though, and obviously still has to be reapplied throughout the day. It has a few other negatives such as leaving a bit of a white cast and makes me look quite shiny, but I will take that over my melasma worsening. I'm also a fan of other Eucerin products, hence why I was so intrigued to try it.\n\nIt's expensive stuff, but obviously factor 100 sounds perfect melasma-wise...\n\nHave any of you had experience with this sunscreen?

Honestly, I'd stick to the LRP UVmune that you already know and love and try cooling off options like a thermal water spray or carrying a hand fan for when you are feeling too hot. Maybe that could help.",
