    "body": "UPDATE: Did you know citrus zest isn't acidic? I've been updating [this blog post](https://www.culinarycrush.biz/all/the-types-of-acidity) with details I've learned since I posted this to reddit.\n\nChances are, you are already incorporating acidity into your cooking. But are you thoughtful about ***which*** ***type*** of acidity to use for a given dish? Because lemon doesn't work with everything.\n\nIn this post, I describe the different types of acidity and how you can incorporate each into your cooking.\n\n# What's acidity?\n\nTo chefs, acidity is control. When used judiciously, acidity can brighten a heavy or fatty dish, bring attention to subtler flavors in a dish, or add complexity. Acidity can also diminish the perception of sweetness and bitterness or decrease the salt required to balance your dish.\n\nWhen adding acids to a recipe, it’s helpful to think of acidity as not a flavor but a *category* of flavors. There are different *types* of acidity, and each type has its pros and cons. Knowing which type of acidity to reach for (or knowing when to combine types of acidity to make a dish more interesting) will make your dishes more cohesive and thoughtful.\n\nSo let’s walk through the types of acidity — what they are, what they’re good for, and where to find them.\n\n# Citric acid\n\nWhen most people think of acidity, they think of citric acid. That’s because citric acid is the primary acid in citrus fruits such as lemon, lime, grapefruit, orange, and yuzu.\n\nTo me, citric acid tastes like early morning sunshine. It’s bright, it’s assertive, and it can stand on its own. It is the most acidic (i.e. it is lowest on the pH scale) of the popular acids.\n\n***When to use citric acid***\n\nI prefer to use citric acid in dishes that I want to taste *fresh*. Think salads or white fish preparations. When sautéing vegetables, for example, you might find that your vegetables taste less vibrant after you’ve cooked them; a squeeze of lemon can revive those cooked vegetables — bringing out flavors that are more reminiscent of the vegetable in its raw form.\n\nCitric acid loses much of its characteristic tang with heat. You can use this to your advantage if hoping to subdue citric acid (e.g. cooking oranges with braised duck), or you can choose to add your citrus towards the end of the cooking process. The rinds of citrus tend to contain more citric acid, so don’t be afraid to zest.\n\n***Where to find citric acid***\n\nIn addition to buying citrus, you can also buy pure citric acid. This can be useful when you want to incorporate the effects of citric acid without the flavors (particularly the sweetness) that come along with citrus. I often use the powder in the *leche de tigre* for my ceviche when I want more control of the acid levels. This method enables me to marinate my raw seafood in a liquid like shrimp broth instead of using just citrus juice.\n\n# Lactic acid\n\nLactic acid is the primary flavor associated with lacto-fermentation. If you’ve tasted pickles, sauerkraut, kimchi, miso, or yoghurt, you’ve tasted lactic acid. Even sourdough bread’s acidity is due in part to lactic acid.\n\nI think of lactic acid like turning up the dimmer in your living room. It’s a softer, rounder glow than citric acid — almost milky. I typically associate lactic acid with a bit of funkiness too, partially because it is usually derived from the fermentation of some other ingredient.\n\n***When to use lactic acid***\n\nI use lactic acid in dishes that need an uplifting note that is not distracting. Earthy broths or sauces seasoned with lactic acid still feel earthy but nonetheless sip lighter.\n\nI often add brightness to vegetable dishes by seasoning the vegetable with its lacto-fermented self. For example, when making celery root puree, I find that adding lemon (i.e. citric acid) is too noticeable — it doesn’t belong! So I season my celery root puree with fermented celery root instead.\n\n***Where to find lactic acid***\n\nThe best way to find lactic acid is to ferment something! Lacto-fermentation is easy, and it enables you to add subtle funk to your dishes. I also like to preserve lemons in order to mellow out the citrus’s citric acid with some lactic acid.\n\nBut you don’t have to rely on fermentation to add lactic acid to your dishes. You can also buy powdered lactic acid and incorporate it as needed. For example, I have a stash of lactic acid powder that I add to my yeasted pizza dough recipe to simulate a bit of the sourness of sourdough bread.\n\n# Acetic acid\n\nAcetic acid is the acidity you associate with vinegar or kombucha. It’s also found in trace amounts in sourdough bread (alongside lactic acid) and wines (especially natty wine or those described as having “volatile acidity”). Acetic acid is usually produced when alcohol is fermented in the presence of oxygen.\n\nI think of acetic acid like shining a flashlight on the heavier elements of your dish. Thanks in part to its pungent smell, it sticks out a bit, never quite mingling with the other ingredients.\n\n***When to use acetic acid***\n\nThe beauty of acetic acid is the accessibility of vinegar varieties. From rice wine vinegar to balsamic and everything in between, it’s easy to find a vinegar that complements your salad or main course.\n\nMore so than other types of acidity, vinegar begs for fats to complement its sourness and tame its smell. Emulsions of vinegar and butter or olive oil serve this purpose well.\n\n***Where to find acetic acid***\n\nI don’t just buy vinegars. I make them, too. Homemade vinegars (especially those made from fruits and vegetables) can have a thicker mouthfeel and sweeter taste, making them more balanced and almost a sauce on their own. The Noma Guide to Fermentation is an incredible resource for making your own vinegar.\n\nWhen I’m not planning months ahead with a custom vinegar, I also like to flavor otherwise neutral vinegars (like white wine vinegar). For example, before making mushrooms, I might throw mushroom scraps in with the vinegar I plan to use the next day.\n\nMost often, I opt for an extremely strong vinegar called ättika. From Sweden, ättika vinegar is four times as strong as regular vinegar, so it works well when you want to adjust acidity without imparting other flavors. I have a little spray bottle with ättika vinegar that I use to spritz a dish when I realize that it wasn’t as acidic as I was hoping.\n\n# Malic acid\n\nMalic acid is the acidity in a green apple. It’s also the principle acid found in apricots, blackberries, blueberries, cherries, mirabelle plums, peaches, pears, and quince. A cheap cooking wine tastes like malic acid to me.\n\nI think of malic acid like sunshine through a stained-glass window. It’s subtler than citric acid in a way that I can only describe as warm.\n\n***When to use malic acid***\n\nI find that malic acid works well to bring life to meat-centric dishes — particularly pork. It mingles well with sweetness, too, making it great for desserts.\n\nI don’t use malic acid much on its own, but I do try to incorporate it into dishes that are already acidic to add more complexity. A sauce with multiple types of acidity can taste like a whole fruit basket! For example, I often add both white wine and vinegar to butter sauces (i.e. I mix malic acid with acetic acid). Fermenting blackberries, similarly, is a means to add lactic acid to malic-rich berries.\n\n***Where to find malic acid***\n\nI keep some reduced white wine handy to adjust the malic acidity in dishes. Otherwise, I keep powdered malic acid on hand to adjust the liquids I use in my ceviche.\n\n# Other acids\n\nThe four acids I’ve described only scratch the surface. But the other acids don’t have as many culinary uses.\n\nOxalic acid (found in wood sorrel, chives, and purslane) certainly comes in handy (and is reminiscent of acetic acid), but excessive consumption of oxalic acid can be toxic. Tartaric acid plays an important role in lowering the pH in wine production, and it’s mixed with baking soda to become baking powder. Meanwhile, ascorbic acid is common too — because it's vitamin C!\n\n# Conclusion\n\nHope this was helpful. And when life gives you lemons, be sure to think twice about whether that’s the acidity life really needs right now.\n\nEdit: A couple folks asked about the blog where I post similar thoughts on food.

    "body": "What's up everyone. This has been a great subreddit to follow for fashion advice so I thought I'd contribute what I could as a dermatologist since I know that many of my friends view skincare as too complicated or cumbersome to worry about so they do nothing. There was a guide about 10 years ago that talked about [some of these things](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/t0yzd/a_guide_to_taking_care_of_your_face/) but I think that this is a bit more comprehensive and aligned with the research and what I discuss with patients daily. I am a practicing dermatologist but I have to make it clear that this post is **strictly for educational purposes** and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. It's also not intended to be a comprehensive review of the topic but I'm going to try to cover the big points. If you have any concerns or questions about your skin health, it's definitely best to see a dermatologist in person.\n\nThese are going to be listed in descending order of importance. You can stop at any stage here and still see tangible benefits for your skin in my opinion. I'm also going to avoid listing specific products to avoid any appearance of conflicts. Make sure that you follow the instructions on the packaging of anything you start.\n\n# 1. SUNSCREEN, SUNSCREEN, SUNSCREEN\n\nI know you've heard this a million times but sunscreen is absolutely THE MOST important thing you can do for your skin. Even if you don't apply to your whole body, using an SPF 30+ sunscreen (for some people with pigmentary disorders like melasma, we will recommend 50+) on your face should be a minimum. Besides causing skin cancers, sunlight is the **#1 factor** causing aging of the skin (wrinkling, pigmentary changes, \"sun spots\"). For a really clear example of this, here is a photo of one-sided photoaging published in the [New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm1104059) in a truck driver (who gets sun on the left side of his face while working). Ideally, you would use a \"physical\" sunscreen that has zinc oxide or titanium dioxide but these can leave white streaks on the skin, especially for darker skin types. If you have this problem you can get \"chemical\" sunscreens that have compounds like avobenzone, octinoxate and oxybenzone. There are also a number of products that are 1/2 and 1/2 which leverage the advantages of both. Physical sunscreens work immediately while you want to apply chemical sunscreens \\~30 minutes before you go out into the sun.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qzji12hcmhra1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=fae4500f6f6ff33b2a72aaf4c06f4eb27fb58654\n\n# 2. Nighttime retinoid\n\nAmong all actives in skincare products, retinoids have by far the most demonstrated efficacy. These products are all derivatives of vitamin A. In addition to improving acne by shrinking sebaceous glands and reducing comedones (blackheads/whiteheads), retinoids [significantly improve the appearance of the skin](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2147/ciia.2006.1.4.327). They do this by increasing cell turnover and stimulating production of collagen/elastin (which increase firmness and general \"youthfulness\"). Almost all retinoids are inactivated by sunlight so the advice is to apply nightly to dry skin then moisturize. They can also be drying and make you more sun sensitive so using sunscreen and a facial moisturizer is important if you're using a retinoid. There are prescription retinoids such as tretinoin which you can get from your PCP or dermatologist as well as OTC products which use retinol (not as potent).\n\n# 3. Moisturizer\n\nA lightweight non-comedogenic (look for that term on the bottle/box) moisturizer in the evening and morning is an important part of taking care of your skin. They help to lock in moisture and restore your skin's barrier, which can also decrease rashes if you're breaking out because of scratching dry skin causing a cycle of inflammation.\n\n# 4. Topical vitamin C\n\nThe last topical product I'll talk about with patients interested in a cosmetic skincare regimen is vitamin C. It has been shown to brighten skin and even skin tone as well as stimulate collagen synthesis but its number one effect is as an antioxidant. As an antioxidant it can help to neutralize free radicals generated by environmental exposures. It does break down when exposed to UV so you need to layer a sunscreen on top to make sure it has an effect.\n\n# 5. Everything else\n\nAs I alluded to earlier, the skincare market is vast and filled with different compounds and actives. Some have proven efficacy, many more do not. In the interest of keeping things simple, I'm sticking to the above for now since they have the most demonstrated efficacy, but if there's interest, I can do a follow-up post in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# A simple regimen incorporating the above would be:\n\n**Morning:** gentle cleanser, vitamin C, moisturizer, sunscreen\n\n**Night:** gentle cleanser, retinoid, moisturizer\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Update\n\nFirst, thank you gentlemen for a Sunday reminder about the power of community. It's been beautiful to see the engagement and advice in the comments. I want to do an update for some of the common questions that came up:\n\n**OK what do I absolutely have to do?**\n\n* If you're going to pick just one thing to use, put on a moisturizer with SPF 30+ before you go out in the morning. Trust me, I get it. In my younger years, I wasn't always consistent with this but it doesn't take much. Make it a part of your morning routine. It adds an extra few seconds but it's like brushing your teeth, and your younger, less wrinkled, and less prone to skin cancer future face will thank you. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n\n**Sunscreen? Do I have to? It's cloudy out.**\n\n* I recommend that everyone incorporate sunscreen to their morning routine. Like I wrote above. just like you brush your teeth, look at it as a thing you do every day and it becomes much less of a hassle. Yes its ideal to reapply every two hours and that is the American Academy of Dermatology's [recommendation](https://www.aad.org/media/stats-sunscreen) but don't make the perfect the enemy of the good. Use it every morning and if you can find a way to do it more frequently that's even better. Don't use the fact that you don't want to reapply as a reason to not do it at all.\n* I'll avoid getting too far into the weeds of the science but sunlight has UVA AND UVB. UVB does peak at mid-day but UVA is constant ALL day. UV also penetrates clouds. So cloudy days aren't a free pass to skip your sunscreen. UVB is more responsible for sunburns and DNA damage leading to cancer while UVA is more responsible for photoaging and tanning but there is overlap there and UVA can cause skin cancer as well. SPF is actually just a measure of how protective sunscreen is against UVB but look for a BROAD-SPECTRUM sunscreen which means that it will protect against both. To protect against visible light which can worsen hyperpigmentation and some conditions like melasma, use a tinted sunscreen. **The TLDR here is just use sunscreen every day before you go out.**\n\n**What order should I use the products?**\n\n* I'm not aware of any studies that look into this but what I generally advise patients is to apply any prescription medications to clean, dried skin first, then layer other products and finish with moisturizer and sunscreen.\n\n**What specific products do you recommend?**\n\nI wanted to not list specific products because I'm personally a bit suspect of posts that push brands or products but since it's been requested, I'll list as many as I can think of that I've used myself, my patients have reported good results from, or other dermatologists I know use. I'll focus on more affordable brands available in most stores that sell skincare products. A few that are pricier I'm mentioning mainly because of how many dermatologists I know use or recommend them. This is by no means an exhaustive list and I'm sure I will be leaving out some great products.\n\n* Moisturizer\n   * [La Roche-Posay face moisturizer](https://www.laroche-posay.us/our-products/face/face-moisturizer/toleriane-double-repair-face-moisturizer-tolerianedoublerepair.html) \\- I personally like this one because it is hydrating but not too thick\n   * [CeraVe PM facial moisturizing lotion](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/moisturizers/pm-facial-moisturizing-lotion)\n   * [Vanicream daily facial moisturizer](https://www.vanicream.com/product/vanicream-daily-facial-moisturizer)\n   * [Cetaphil daily oil-free moisturizing lotion](https://www.cetaphil.com/us/moisturizers/daily-oil-free-hydrating-lotion/302993889038.html)\n   * [Neutrogena Hydro Boost](https://www.neutrogena.com/products/neutrogena-hydro-boost-water-gel-with-hyaluronic-acid-for-dry-skin/6811047XX.html?) \\- This one's a love it or hate it. It has HA and is a gel rather than a lotion or cream so the texture is off-putting for some people while others love it.\n* Sunscreen\n   * [EltaMD Daily Tinted Broad-Spectrum SPF 40](https://eltamd.com/collections/best-sellers/products/eltamd-uv-daily-tinted-broad-spectrum-spf-40) \\- EltaMD is one of those brands that most dermatologist are familiar with for sunscreen and makes good products. They have a few different lines but this is a best seller. This one has physical and chemical sunscreen compounds. They also make a non-tinted version and other lines if it isn't for you.\n   * [La Roche Posay Anthelios UV Correct](https://www.laroche-posay.us/our-products/sun/face-sunscreen/anthelios-uv-correct-face-sunscreen-spf-70-with-niacinamide-3606000591035.html) \\- Friends of mine use this and they swear by it. It is a chemical sunscreen.\n   * [La Roche-Posay Anthelios Mineral Tinted Sunscreen](https://www.laroche-posay.us/our-products/sun/tinted-sunscreen/anthelios-mineral-tinted-sunscreen-for-face-spf-50-883140020899.html) \\- Also a bit of a love it or hate it quality but for me rubs in very nicely and I like that it is a purely mineral sunscreen.\n   * [Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen](https://supergoop.com/products/unseen-sunscreen) \\- Some of my patients absolutely love this. It is a chemical sunscreen but they love the finish and feel of it.\n   * Others to look into: Cetaphil, CeraVe, TiZO (Titanium dioxide and zinc oxide sunscreens), Neutrogena\n* Vitamin C Serums\n   * [SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic](https://www.skinceuticals.com/skincare/vitamin-c-serums/c-e-ferulic-with-15-l-ascorbic-acid/S17.html) \\- This is very expensive for a daily skincare product and I don't know how necessary it is to go to a product that is this pricy but it is a favorite among dermatologists for themselves and their patients so I felt that I had to include it in the list. Has vitamin E and ferulic acid which are antioxidants too. Be warned that it has an iron-like smell to it.\n   * [Paula's Choice C15 Super Booster](https://www.paulaschoice.com/c15-super-booster/777.html) \\- Same ingredients as SkinCeuticals at a cheaper price. Haven't used it personally but have heard good experiences from others.\n   * [Vichy LiftActiv Vitamin C serum](https://www.vichyusa.com/skin-care/skin-care-product-type/face-serum/liftactiv-vitamin-c-serum-vitamincserum.html) \\- You'll see a trend here. This also has vitamin E and ferulic acid like the Paula's Choice and SkinCeuticals serums. Also more affordable than both of the above.\n   * [La Roche-Posay Vitamin C Serum](https://www.laroche-posay.us/vitamin-c-10-25-pure-vitamin-c-serum-3337875660570.html) \\- Has a more gel-like quality than others but it is more affordable and still has 10% vitamin C.\n   * [The Ordinary Ethylated Ascorbic Acid](https://theordinary.com/en-us/ethylated-ascorbic-acid-15-solution-vitamin-c-100416.html) \\- I recommend this brand for many patients for a variety of OTC agents like azelaic acid too. In my experience, their products are effective and very cost-effective.\n   * A note about vitamin C products: minimize how long you leave the cap open and how much light exposure it gets because the ingredient is prone to oxidation and breakdown when exposed to air and light. They come in oilier serums instead of water-based vehicles because it also breaks down when mixed with water.\n* Gentle Cleansers\n   * [Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser](https://www.cetaphil.com/us/cleansers/gentle-skin-cleanser/302990110227.html) \\- Great and affordable cleanser.\n   * [CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/cleansers/hydrating-facial-cleanser) \\- Another affordable and effective cleanser.\n   * [Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser](https://www.vanicream.com/product/vanicream-facial-cleanser) \\- Also a great cleanser, good for those with sensitive skin.",

Or somehow try to massage the retinoid into the beard? The guides on /r/tretinoin are mostly directed at women/beardless folks, and when the question HAS been asked there, the answer is usually to shave the beard. I'm not willing to do that. Any insight and experience for us bearded dudes who are starting to feel our age would be appreciated. \n\nThe guide above is probably good, and seems in line with the info available in the skincare subreddits, but otherwise isn't specific to men and still doesn't address facial hair.

I don’t think tret is formulated for under eye or eyelid use but there are OTC retinols that are, so to be on the safe side i would use those within the orbital bone area and use tret more on the forehead, cheek, jaw etc right up to the border where your eye socket starts.

Instead, splash some water on your face in the morning, making sure to follow up with moisturiser,  which will have an effect but be less irritating. Cleansing your face is obviously important but it's also inherently damaging to the moisture on your face. Even as someone with acne I saw benefit to washing just once a day. \n\nFor sunscreen: \nCheck what the uv index is where you live. The epa actually has an app that you can quickly check what it is (EPA UV index). For me, I'm ok wearing no sunscreen if it's under 4. You could make an argument for under 3 but that was my judgement call. The majority of the year I don't need sunscreen, which is great as I really don't enjoy wearing it. This will vary a lot depending on where you live though.\nI personally wouldn't mess around with physical sunscreens unless you know chemical sunscreens bother your skin or something, the white cast is really annoying.

    "body": "Hey-Oh! So, I see some form of this question multiple times per day in various skin and personal care subs: How do I deal with my hyperpigmentation? I also asked myself this question a few years ago. See, I'm prone to freckles and a little melasma and I set out to figure out a way to solve it with years of research, trial and error, testing, talking to dermatologists and professionals, and scouring every medical article I could get my hands on. I wanted to share my findings and research since this is a common concern, especially among people in their 30s. This started as a small post about my routine and ballooned into a massive book about hyperpigmentation. I hope it's helpful!\n\n**DISCLAIMERS:**\n\n* I use the term \"brightening\" instead of \"lightening\" which is a subtle distinction. None of the ingredients or methods I recommend bleach your skin as \"lightening\" would suggest, but they can reduce the appearance of hyperpigmentation. \"Brightening\" tends to be a confusing term in skincare, but for the purposes of this post, I use it as a descriptor for anything that helps prevent or reduce melanin in hyperpigmented skin.\n* I will use the term \"hyperpigmentation\" ad nauseam as a catch-all term for excess pigmentation in the skin including freckles, melasma, PIH and dark spots. This does not encompass moles which are different. This is also different from redness, which is a whole other post.\n* Speaking about hyperpigmentation requires some sensitivity to very real issues around it including cultural implications. This post is not intended to moralize hyperpigmentation nor is it intended to alienate the normal melaninization of skin across various tones. Hyperpigmentation refers to excess melanin production on the skin in the form of spots that are darker than the surrounding skin. It's not bad or wrong, nor does it speak to anyone not \"doing a good enough job\" of taking care of themselves.\n* I do repeat myself a few times in here but that is for people who are skipping around the article. I want to be as thorough as possible even if you're jumping to the parts of the post you need.\n* I do run an online dermatology practice and skin care consultancy, but in order to protect the integrity of my advice, I do not promote my business, I don't give direct medical advice, I don't link to any products/websites, and I don't have any products I've formulated myself to promote. \n\nThis is going to get long because I wanted to cover everything re:hyperpigmentation. But for your reading pleasure and ease, I have divided this post up so you can get whatever information you need:\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n1. Types of Hyperpigmentation\n2. What Causes Hyperpigmentation?\n3. How To Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 1: The Ingredients\n4. How to Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 2: The Routine and Recommendations\n5. Body Hyperpigmentation\n6. Nuclear Options\n\nLet's get to it!\n\n# Types of Hyperpigmentation\n\nHyperpigmentation refers to excess melanin production in the skin, but it can actually take a couple different forms. Knowing the type of hyperpigmentation you're experiencing is key to understanding if and how it can be treated.\n\n**Freckles:** Freckles are incredibly common, especially for people with lighter skin tones. They are small, brown or reddish-brown dots often clustered on the skin. They develop on the surface and are not raised bumps. Freckles can appear anywhere on the body but are common on the face. Freckles are permanent, but the color, contrast and severity can vary and be tempered.\n\n**Melasma:** Melasma appears as dark patches or splotches around the face, though usually found on the forehead, upper lip, and high on the cheeks. Melasma forms deeper in the skin and appears more amorphous than freckles, moles, or age spots. It can create a “muddy” appearance and is very common among pregnant and postpartum women due to hormonal factors. But it can literally happen to anyone and anywhere on the body.\n\n**Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation (PIH):** Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) occurs when damaged skin forms melanin during the healing process leaving dark spots. This is common after acne, injuries, eczema, burns, and other trauma to the skin. Exposure to UV rays during healing can make PIH worse. Post-inflammatory erythema (PIE) is similar, but leaves pink or red marks on the skin as a result of damage to the capillaries from injury or inflammation. Basically, when skin is compromised by injury, as part of the immune response cells will begin to generate melanin in an attempt to prevent further damage from UV exposure, so what will happen is the wound/legion/blemish will heal but the pigmented skin remains.\n\n**Age Spots:** This is kind of a forgotten form of hyperpigmentation. Sun spots, also referred to as liver spots, and solar lentigines are large spots/patches of dark skin with distinct borders. They vary in color from light brown to almost black. They develop on the surface of the skin usually later in life, but reflect damage that often occurred from improper sun protection at a younger age. They can appear on the face, neck, chest, hands, and arms, usually on areas that had UV exposure. For many people, they can begin to appear in your 30s or 40s.\n\n# What Causes Hyperpigmentation?\n\nThere are a number of factors that can contribute to the formation of hyperpigmentation. Generally, it forms as the result of a combination of genetic and environmental influences. Everyone is unique, but these are some of the most common causes of hyperpigmentation and dark spots:\n\n**Genetics** can play a role in the development of hyperpigmentation and dark spots in several ways:\n\n* **Melanin production:** Melanin is the pigment that provides color to our skin, hair, and eyes. The amount of melanin produced and distributed in the skin is largely determined by genetics. People with a greater genetic predisposition to melanin production in their skin are more likely to experience hyperpigmentation and dark spots as a result of sun exposure, hormonal changes, and other factors. People with darker skin are also more prone to melanin production in the form of hyperpigmentation.\n* **Genetic anomalies:** Certain genetic anomalies, such as oculocutaneous albinism, can affect melanin production and distribution in the skin, leading to an increased risk of hyperpigmentation and dark spots.\n* **Family history:** If you have a family history of hyperpigmentation or dark spots, you may be more likely to develop these conditions yourself.\n* **Enzymes and genes:** The enzymes that control melanin production and distribution are regulated by specific genes. Variations in these genes can impact melanin production, leading to an increased risk of hyperpigmentation and dark spots.\n\n**Sun (UV) Exposure.** In addition to genetic determination of melanin production, UV exposure is the leading environmental cause of hyperpigmentation and the formation of dark spots. Melanin is the pigment that provides color to our skin, hair, and eyes. It acts as a natural sunscreen (but don't treat it like natural sunscreen!!! This isn't the point of the exercise), absorbing UV radiation to protect the skin from damage.\n\nWhen the skin is exposed to UV radiation, the melanocytes (cells that produce melanin) in the skin go into overdrive, producing more melanin to protect the skin from further damage. This increased melanin production can result in dark spots or areas of hyperpigmentation on the skin.\n\n**Hormones.** In addition to genetic determination of melanin production, hormones and hormonal sensitivity is a leading internal cause of hyperpigmentation and the formation of dark spots.\n\nOne of the most well-known examples of hormonal hyperpigmentation is melasma, a condition characterized by dark, amorphous patches on the face, particularly on the cheeks, forehead, nose, and upper lip. Melasma is often associated with hormonal changes, such as those that occur during pregnancy, hormonal therapy, or birth control pill use. The hormonal changes can stimulate an increase in melanin production, resulting in dark spots or areas of hyperpigmentation. This can happen irrespective of UV exposure, though the sun does exacerbate it.\n\nHormones can also affect melanin production by altering the skin's metabolism and pigmentation pathways. For example, high levels of cortisol, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands during stress, can trigger an increase in melanin production, resulting in hyperpigmentation.\n\n**Inflammation, Injury & Trauma** to the skin can result in hyperpigmentation by triggering an increase in melanin production. When the skin is inflamed or injured, it triggers a response from the body's immune system, which can stimulate an increase in melanin production as a protective measure.\n\nFor example, acne breakouts or other skin injuries can result in post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), which is characterized by dark spots or areas of discoloration on the skin. The dark spots are a result of an increase in melanin production in the affected area, which occurs in response to the inflammation or injury. In addition to acne and other skin injuries, other conditions that can result in PIH include eczema, psoriasis, and insect bites.\n\n**Medication Side Effects.** Certain medications can cause hyperpigmentation on the skin. Medications that can cause hyperpigmentation include:\n\n* **Tetracycline antibiotics:** Tetracycline antibiotics, such as doxycycline and minocycline, can cause discoloration of the skin and teeth when taken in high doses or for an extended period of time.\n* **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs):** NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, can cause hyperpigmentation in some individuals, especially if taken in high doses or for an extended period of time.\n* **Chemotherapy drugs:** Certain chemotherapy drugs, such as doxorubicin and daunorubicin, can cause hyperpigmentation, especially in areas of the skin that have been exposed to the sun.\n* **Hormonal medications:** Hormonal medications, such as birth control pills and estrogen replacements, can cause hyperpigmentation in some individuals, especially if they are taken for an extended period of time.\n* **Antimalarial drugs:** Antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, can cause hyperpigmentation in some individuals, especially if taken in high doses or for an extended period of time.\n* **Isotretinoin** aka accutane when taken for acne can cause hyperpigmentation due to the increase of cell turnover and exposing delicate new skin cells to UV rays before they have shored up.\n\nIf using these medications is necessary for your livelihood, it is not recommended to stop their use without the recommendation of your doctor.\n\n# How To Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 1: The Ingredients\n\nWhen looking for skin care products to treat and prevent hyperpigmentation and dark spots, it's important to look for ingredients that can help encourage cell turnover, curb melanin production, and block harmful UV rays. A lot of these things overlap with treatments for other conditions like acne and general anti-aging, but I've noted ones that specifically work on the mechanisms controlling melanin production. Now, this is an extensive list, but I know it doesn't have everything. I've included the ingredients that had the most compelling evidence and/or worked the best for me or people at my practice. But it's also not necessarily a shopping list. You don't have to have all of these things to treat hyperpigmentation, but I'll get to that in the routine portion. This is more to be used as a tool that can help you diversify your routine if you find one ingredient or another doesn't work for you. And it can help you determine if a product targets hyperpigmentation based on its ingredients. There's lot's of options. Some of the key ingredients to look for include:\n\n**Retinoids** that increases cell turnover. Retinoids like tretinoin, adapalene, retinol et al, can help treat hyperpigmentation by promoting the turnover of skin cells and increasing cell growth, which can help fade dark spots and improve overall skin tone by replacing pigmented skin cells at the surface. While retinoids are extremely effective, they do have some caveats. First, they can be sensitizing to a lot of users, but this can be tempered by using different form functions, different application methods, or different concentrations. Second, because it's constantly turning over skin exposing delicate new skin cells to the elements, it can actually worsen hyperpigmentation if you're not vigilant about sun protection and avoidance. Tretinoin and other retinoids are firewalled behind a prescription in some countries and may be more difficult to obtain. But retinol/al is available in OTC forms.\n\n**SPF** represents a class of many ingredients designed to protect the skin from UV rays and the damage that occurs from exposure. UV exposure is one of the biggest causes of fine hyperpigmentation and wrinkles so adequate protection is essential. I know I'm not winning any science awards for this declaration, but a lot of people who struggle with hyperpigmentation aren't adequately protecting themselves from the sun. But you also have to be kind of realistic. Even with perfect protection and avoidance, sometimes your hyperpigmentation will still flare. This happens during the summer for a lot of people and something even I grapple with. The key is to do your best and SPF actually works well with numerous other ingredients (like the ones listed below) to help solve that problem.\n\n**Arbutin** is a Tyrosinase Inhibitor that blocks melanin production. Arbutin, or the synthesized version called alpha arbutin, is a favorite brightening ingredient because it's a slow-release derivative of hydroquinone that inhibits melanin production. This results in both healing and prevention of dark spots, especially when paired with topical acids. It metabolizes on the skin into hydroquinone which is super effective for hyperpigmentation while being a less controversial and hard-to-come-by ingredient than pure hydroquinone. More on hydroquinone in part 6.\n\n**Tranexamic acid** is another Tyrosinase Inhibitor. This was first used in wound care and it was found to have profound effects on hyperpigmentation. Although it's an acid, it's not a chemical exfoliant, kinda like how hyaluronic acid is not a chemical exfoliant. The exact mechanism by which tranexamic acid works to reduce hyperpigmentation is not fully understood, but it is believed to work by reducing inflammation by blocking plasmin which contributes to melanin production when unchecked. It is particularly effective in treating melasma and one of my personal favorite ingredients.\n\n**Kojic Acid** is *another* Tyrosinase Inhibitor. Kojic acid is a natural skin brightener that is derived from various fungi. Kojic acid can also help to exfoliate because it's a slight chemical exfoliant, which can remove dead skin cells that contribute to hyperpigmentation and improve overall appearance. But it does both things: block melanin production and turn skin cells over.\n\n**Azelaic Acid** has a lot of things going for it that can help with hyperpigmentation. It's an anti-inflammatory and antiseptic that disrupts melanin production. Azelaic acid works by inhibiting the production of melanin in the skin like those other tyrosinase inhibitors. In addition, azelaic acid also has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, which help to improve the overall health and appearance of the skin by reducing melanin production as a result of injury or inflammation. It's also an anti-acne ingredient that can address the root cause of PIH by reducing acne on the skin. It's pretty awesome and available in OTC and prescription strengths.\n\n**Niacinamide** is another one that directly and indirectly addresses hyperpigmentation. It's a skin soother that decreases inflammation and it naturally reduces sebum production which can curb acne which can curb PIH. It actually took me a little while to figure out that this was another solid hyperpigmentation treatment for these reasons because I used to look at it as being more of an acne treatment. Niacinamide is a form of vitamin B3 that works by inhibiting the transfer of pigment within the skin, which can help to reduce the appearance of dark spots and uneven skin tone. So while it doesn't block tyrosinase, it prevents transfer of pigmented skin cells to the surface.\n\n**Vitamin C aka L-ascorbic acid** is an antioxidant that fights free radical damage. It treats and prevents hyperpigmentation in three ways. First, it reduces free radical damage from UV exposure which helps increase the effectiveness of SPF when worn together. Second, it is also a tyrosinase inhibitor that blocks melanin production. And finally, vitamin C encourages skin cell turnover. The key is finding a nice stable version of it.\n\n**Glycolic and Lactic Acid.** Since this list is getting long I am going to group these together. Glycolic Acid is a water-soluble alpha hydroxy acid that penetrates into the pores to treat pigmentation by providing general exfoliation and resurfacing of the skin. The result is improvements in dark spots, texture and other signs of aging. Lactic Acid is also an AHA but with a slightly larger molecular size than glycolic acid so it doesn't penetrate as deep and acts more as a surface exfoliant. As a result it provides more gentle exfoliation to buff away surface pigmentation with an added benefit of acting as a humectant to seal moisture into the skin.\n\n**Licorice Extract** is a plant extract that inhibits melanin production. Licorice root extract contains a compound called glabridin, which has been shown to have skin brightening effects as, you guessed it, a tyrosinase inhibitor. In addition, licorice root extract also has anti-inflammatory properties, which can help to reduce redness and inflammation associated with hyperpigmentation. I'm seeing more and more of this pop up in skin care.\n\n**Soy Proteins** are another plant extract that inhibits melanin production. They contain compounds known as isoflavones, which have been shown to help reduce the amount of melanin produced by melanocytes in the skin. Additionally, soy proteins have antioxidant properties that can help to protect the skin from damage caused by free radicals, which can contribute to hyperpigmentation.\n\n# How To Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 2: The Routine and Recommendations\n\nThis is adapted from numerous comments, posts and DMs I've written on the topic and also comprises a large portion of my own personal routine and routines we recommend to patients. This is a generalist routine meaning it targets all the forms of hyperpigmentation I've mentioned; freckles, melasma, PIH, and age spots though it can be tweaked to address these individually more specifically. This is really my jumping off point for people to get a good idea of what they can achieve as a baseline with OTC ingredients before fine tuning or enlisting the help of a dermatologist. For a lot of people, this is enough to fully resolve, but even if it gets you part of the way there, this should give you a good idea of reactivity.\n\nA few caveats:\n\n* Freckles cannot ever be 100% eradicated. You can however reduce their appearance and prevent them from getting darker. It's important to have realistic goals and understand that sometimes our genetics will overrule any routine we have.\n* This routine and any hyperpigmentation routine will not address moles. Moles are a totally different thing that can only be eradicated through removal by a medical practitioner. Moles can be raised or not, but no amount of topicals will get rid of them.\n* Melasma is a beast. Sometimes it can be treated with OTC topicals, sometimes it requires prescription strength topicals like hydroquinone, sometimes you need in-office procedures like fractal lasers or IPL. Again, this routine is a jumping off point to see what you can accomplish at home before going down that road (and more on that at the bottom in part 6).\n* You'll notice I don't mention products with all the ingredients I listed above. This is because the more you put on your face, the greater your risk of causing irritation. Again, you can adjust and tweak by switching out products with these ingredients or add/subtract as it suits your personal needs.\n* If you're struggling with hyperpigmentation while pregnant or breastfeeding, these recommendations may need to be paused.\n\nAlright, let's get to it!\n\n**AM routine -- The Goal: Heal, Protect, and Prevent. In order of application following a lukewarm water rinse:**\n\n* Azelaic acid\n* Alpha Arbutin\n* Vitamin C serum\n* Moisturizer\n* SPF\n\nThe combo of C+AZ+AA+SPF is an absolute powerhouse for healing existing hyperpigmentation and preventing new hyperpigmentation from forming. It makes your SPF more effective, it inhibits the production of melanin from UV exposure (not your natural melanin production though), and it speeds cell turnover with dual antioxidant action and gentle chemical exfoliation. The result is brighter skin in a few months of consistent use.\n\n**For Azelaic Acid**, this is the ingredient for serious treatment. It's considered one of the most effective ways to reverse melasma aka serious hyperpigmentation short of hydroquinone -- which is both controversial and hard to get. It brings a little bit of exfoliation to the table in addition to inhibiting UV melanin production, but it also has a slight antiseptic property which can help with acne. Paula's choice Azelaic Acid Booster is the only one I've really tried after sampling the Ordinary's in-store and not liking the texture. I get about 6 months out of a tube and a little bit goes a long way.\n\n**For Alpha Arbutin**, the Ordinary's formulation is pretty solid. I prefer the Ordinary's AA 2% + HA as opposed to their AA 2% + Ascorbic Acid 8% as I don't believe the quality and stability of their Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) is great. That's why I opt for a separate Vitamin C serum step. But the AA + HA also has a little bit of lactic acid in it which provides some gentle exfoliation and encourages AA deeper into the skin where it's more effective. Lactic acid is mild enough that it's safe for use in a morning routine, but you still want to protect with SPF. There are a couple AA products floating around but I think TO's product is probably the best, most straightforward one. Alpha Arbutin metabolizes into hydroquinone on the skin so is basically one of the best OTC pigment correctors you can get.\n\n**For Vitamin C,** the gold standard really is Skinceuticals CE Ferulic. This is stupid expensive though so I’m going to suggest Timeless Vitamin C. I like that it comes in an airless pump that prevents oxidation over time. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that increases the rate of skin cell turnover bringing forward new, skin cells while simultaneously improving the effects of SPF. It's a great foundation for a fix.\n\nThese ingredients can be layered on one right after the other then topped with your **moisturizer** (I like a basic one like cetaphil daily lotion), then topped with your **SPF**. The SPF I would recommend is Canmake UV mermaid gel in clear as this will not leave a white cast on your skin and it’s generally a very elegant SPF. It's SPF 50 which means it gives really good protection, but there are numerous SPFs you can try. I personally like anything from La Roche Posay, any Neutrogena SPF that's not formulated with ethylhexylglycerin, Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen, Biore Aqua Rich (another Japanese brand), Trader Joe's SPF if you can get your hands on it, and EltaMD.\n\nOf all the products I’ve tried that could act as a stand-in for vitamin c, azelaic acid, and alpha arbutin, there’s one Japanese serum from Hada Labo called “whitening lotion” which has had the biggest impact on my hyperpigmentation in a single product of anything I’ve tried. This might be a little too effective though, I actually find that it washed me out within the first 2 weeks of twice daily use, so now I only use it in the morning. And I’m not a fan of the translation… which is a direct but mistranslation. It’s not a bleaching lotion, it also relies on a form of vitamin C and tranexamic acid to brighten skin. But it's a really interesting to try if you wanted a simplified morning routine in which case I would apply this, then your moisturizer, then your SPF.\n\n**PM routine -- The Goal: Renew and Reveal. In order of application:**\n\n* Cleanse\n* Buffer\n* Tranexamic acid and exfoliant OR retinoid\\*\\*\n* Moisturize\n\n**To cleanse**, I have a really basic recommendation that will remove your SPF, makeup, and any grime/sebum from your day. Start with Cetaphil gentle cleanser. This is a gentle, hydrating cleanser that will break up your SPF really effectively. Massage in and rinse. Then apply a foaming cleanser, I recommend Cetaphil daily cleanser which foams. This will sweep away anything that’s left and give you a good foundation for the rest of your routine. While this doesn't directly help hyperpigmentation specifically, it's a critical step especially for people who are acne>PIH prone. It also gives you a nice clean slate to apply the rest of your skincare. I've tried dozens of cleansers but always come back to these two as good basic options.\n\n**For your Buffer** this is an important step that can be done prior to using a chemical exfoliant or retinoid: applying an occlusive that will block the active from more sensitive skin. I recommend buffering around your eyes and nostrils with La Roche Posay Cicaplast balm because it kind of doubles as a nice eye cream, but this can also be done with basic vaseline or aquaphor for a more budget-friendly option.\n\n**For Tranexamic Acid**, my holy grail TXA product, La Roche Posay Glycolic B5 is actually a multipurpose serum that combines ingredients to treat hyperpigmentation with chemical exfoliants. It contains two hyperpigmentation heavy hitters -- Tranexamic acid and Kojic Acid which are great for melasma -- and two exfoliants -- Glycolic Acid and Lipo-Hydroxy Acid (LHA) which is like fancy salicylic acid -- so it both reveals new skin cells that are less prone to pigmenting from UV exposure while sloughing away your old skin cells. You can use this 2 or 3 nights per week. On off nights, just cleanse and moisturize.\n\n**For a Retinoid** if you can get prescription tretinoin, this is going to be the best bet. Your doctor will advise you on the concentration. More on that in part 6. It will help speed up the rate of cell turnover bringing new, unpigmented skin cells to the surface faster. Some other OTC options include differin (which is rated more for acne but uses the same mechanism for cell turnover so it's also effective in this use case) and retinols. Now, I haven't tried every retinol on the market but I have two that I stand by: SkinCeuticals retinol and L'Oreal retinol serum. The SkinCeuticals is, in my opinion, the closest to RX tretinoin in terms of efficacy, but it's a little pricey. The L'Oreal also does a really good job and is a little more affordable. It's currently my go-to OTC on the days I'm not using my RX retinoid tazarotene. You can use this 2 or 3 nights per week. On off nights, just cleanse and moisturize.\n\n**\\*\\* My recommendations for tranexamic acid and retinoids CANNOT be used in the same night.** You'll nuke your skin. And for most people, both aren't necessary, you can get away with using one or the other. If I had a preference, I would say use the TXA serum instead of a retinoid, but if you can build up a tolerance to using them both without damaging your barrier, they work really well together. So, proceed with caution. If you want to use both, use them on alternate nights and give yourself a night or two without either to let your skin recover. For me personally, I do retinoids on Sundays, and Wednesdays, chemical exfoliants on Mondays and Thursdays, and I let my skin rest (cleanse, moisturize, squalene oil) on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.\n\nOn top of whichever active you choose, apply your moisturizer. You can use the same one you use in your morning routine, the Cetaphil daily lotion as it’s nice and light. I also like La Roche Posay Toleraine double repair for a ceramide-based cream alternative if you want something richer. You do not want to \"slug\" over actives. This advice gets mixed in a lot. Slugging refers to applying an occlusive layer over your skincare such as vaseline, aquaphor, oils like squalene oil, or healing balms like La Roche Posay Cicaplast balm. While this can be done on hydration nights, it should not be done on nights when you're using chemical exfoliants or retinoids as this may make them too effective causing irritation and breakouts.\n\n# Body Hyperpigmentation\n\nOk, I need everyone to be a grownup for two seconds. These products and methods (both from the prior section and this section) should NOT be used on your genitals. First, you can cause serious irritation or infection by applying active skincare to your genitals. Second, it's really not going to do anything to change the pigmentation of the skin there. The skin on your genitals is different than your body and facial skin and it pigments in different ways for different reasons so it's not going to respond to topicals the same way the rest of your body does. Don't even try it.\n\n**To be perfectly clear, these are the areas you should not be applying skincare:** labia majora, labia minora, vaginal entrance or vagina, clitoral hood, perineum, anus, intergluteal cleft aka inside your butt crack, penis, or scrotum. And I say this as someone who chaffed the precipice of her \"intergluteal cleft\" in an unfortunate crunches-in-the-wrong-gym-shorts accident leaving me with some deeply incriminating hyperpigmentation and earning me the nickname \"skid mark\" from my ever loving boyfriend. It faded after a year but you can still send prayers.\n\n**These are areas you can apply skincare but do so with absolute caution and at your own risk:** bikini line, mons pubis, inner thigh up to the groin fold, butt cheeks.\n\nOk, now that we've got the disclaimers out of the way, let's move forward. Hyperpigmentation can also occur on body skin for the same reason it appears on the face, but it can also be triggered by friction. And because body skin is different from facial skin, it requires a slightly different approach. This is my recommendation for both hyperpigmentation and KP (Keratosis pilaris) because they rely on the same mechanism for treatment: chemical exfoliation.\n\nIn the case of body hyperpigmentation, I recommend a two prong approach: a body wash in the shower and a topical treatment to be used after. Oh, and SPF again if there are areas that are exposed to the sun, and I have a holy grail SPF recommendation for this.\n\nNow you may have noticed in my facial skin recommendation that I did not mention CeraVe as a treatment brand. I have posted numerous takedowns of CeraVe on other threads so I won't rehash them here suffice it to say that it's no longer a brand I can in good faith recommend since it's acquisition by L'Oreal. This is often the brand that's considered when treating KP on the body, but I don't believe their formulations and ingredient quality works for everyone.\n\n**For the body wash**, I recommend Neutrogena body clear with Salicylic acid. This is an exfoliating body wash that will help clear away dead skin cells on the surface allowing new ones to come through. To be effective, you want it to sit on your skin for a little while. I recommend lathering it up and applying it after turning off your shower faucet and letting it sit for 2 or 3 minutes. This is when I like to knock out shower emails. Then rinse away.\n\n**On towel dried skin after your shower**, apply AmLactin Bumps Be Gone. Again, this is formulated for KP but the reason I like it is because it contains lactic acid which will also give the assist on brightening hyperpigmented body skin. The wash and this should be effective, but you might also want to mix in a few drops of the alpha arbutin serum I recommended for your facial routine, maybe three drops per application area (each leg, each arm, chest, etc). I generally don't encourage facial products on the body because it's not an economical use for them, and also because body skin is a little more resilient and doesn't need skincare that's formulated for more sensitive facial skin. The AA serum from the Ordinary is very affordable however and is a good hyperpigmentation generalist.\n\nAnother one that I mentioned in the facial hyperpigmentation portion that can work well on the body is the Hada Labo whitening lotion. Again, this is formulated around tranexamic acid which is very effective for hyperpigmentation and a little bit if this stuff goes a long way. I buy it in bulk from Japanese Importers though it's also available on Amazon for a slightly higher price. If you find yourself in Asia, stock up on it. I use this specifically for fading tan lines that happen (even with diligent/neurotic SPF use) around my fitness watch and the straps of my workout tops that I run in.\n\n**You also want to wear SPF on areas that are exposed to the sun** to prevent pigmentation from occurring. The one I absolutely love that’s not your 90’s banana boat is Aveeno Protect + Hydrate lotion with SPF 60. This is a great SPF for a lot of reasons: it finishes like a lotion instead of a sunscreen, it dries down totally clear, and it has a pleasant, slight sweet scent. On a scale of 1-10 with 1 being bare skin, 10 being banana boat slathered on by your mom in 1997, and regular body lotion being a 2, I give Aveeno Protect + Hydrate a 2.5 in terms of texture and feel-finish. I use it as my daily lotion on my neck, arms, shoulders, and chest. If you're more active you might need a heavier hitter here like a sport sunscreen.\n\n# Nuclear Options\n\nIn general, I recommend trying OTC topical solutions for any skin concern before heading down the in-office procedure route. Part of this is because you can usually put a good dent in what you're struggling with by using OTC topicals, making in-office procedures and RX treatments easier and more effective. Part of it is so you have a good maintenance routine in place to use after the fact to preserve the results of your in-office procedure which can sometimes be costly. Lastly, while some procedures can solve the immediate problem completely, topical skincare can be really effective at treating other adjacent conditions like redness, acne, and fine lines.\n\nSide note: I haven't listed every possible compounded medication because there are a lot, and many compounded meds are formulated to tackle multiple issues like acne and hyperpigmentation. I also tend to favor single note skin care (aka, products with very few ingredients) as this allows you to combine or remove certain actives and gives you a better sense of reactivity. \n\nFor tougher-to-treat hyperpigmentation such as melasma, if your topical routine doesn't totally clear the problem in 6 to 8 months, a visit to the dermatologist might be helpful. Here are the heavier-hitting procedures and topicals that can go the extra mile after you've exhausted other options.\n\n**Medical Grade Peels:** Medical grade chemical peels can be done by dermatologists. Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or phenol peels may be done for cases of severe hyperpigmentation, but high concentration BHA or AHA peels are also commonly used. I do these twice a year. Because of the strength of the acids used, these must be done by a medical professional with careful followup.\n\n\\*\\*\\*IPL Therapy and Laser Therapy may not work for everyone and in some cases may exacerbate hyperpigmentation so you really want to work with dermatologists with a lot of experience in treating cases similar to yours to determine if these interventions are appropriate for you.\n\n**IPL Treatment:** Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) therapy can treat hyperpigmentation by targeting the melanin in the skin with a broad spectrum of light wavelengths, heating and breaking the melanin down. IPL is particularly effective for treating sun damage and age spots, as well as other forms of hyperpigmentation. The treatment is relatively non-invasive, with minimal downtime, making it a popular option. This is also a great treatment for the redness associated with enlarged blood vessels (often confused for broken capillaries) on the surface of the skin which can also appear alongside hyperpigmentation. There isn't any clinical evidence to support at-home IPL devices being effective in the same way. That doesn't mean it's not possible, it's just not studied enough to be certain. Most at-home IPL devices do not operate in effective wavelengths the way professional grade ones do.\n\n**Laser Therapy:** Fractional and CO2 lasers can be used to treat a range of hyperpigmentation issues, including sun damage, age spots, and melasma. The treatment works by removing the top layers of skin, which contain the excess pigmentation, revealing fresh, healthy skin cells underneath. The lasers also stimulate the production of collagen, which helps to improve skin texture and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.\n\n**Hydroquinone:** This isn't an in-office procedure like the aforementioned treatments, but it is firewalled behind a prescription meaning you can only access hydroquinone in effective concentrations by working with a doctor. This is a somewhat new development at least in the US following some covid-era rejiggering of prescription clearances. HDQ is controversial because it's a skin bleaching agent which has some cultural implications in places where light skin is favored over natural pigmentation. HDQ technically works the same way other OTC tyrosinase inhibitors do (in fact arbutin actually metabolizes into HDQ when applied to the skin), pure HDQ happens to be the most powerful version of them. It lightens any skin it touches, not just hyperpigmented skin in higher concentrations which can make it tough to use. This effect isn't as profound in the other tyrosinase inhibitors I mentioned making them much easier to use over HDQ which, in high concentrations, must be dotted on the skin in only hyperpigmented areas. So HDQ is really reserved for intervention in extreme or OTC treatment-resistance cases.\n\n**Tretinoin and Prescription Retinoids:** This is going to be dependent on what part of the world you're in, but in a lot of countries, tretinoin and its counterparts like tazarotene are only available through prescription. I mentioned retinoids in the routine so if you're able to get your hands on a prescription from a doctor, it may be more effective than OTC retinols. Most doctors will prescribe a retinoid over hydroquinone, so this is usually easier to procure and can be quite effective on its own as a hyperpigmentation treatment. OTC differin is the only retinoid available over-the-counter (in the US) which can also be used for hyperpigmentation.\n\n**Prescription Azelaic Acid:** This is another one that's available in lower concentrations over-the-counter (which can still be quite effective) but there are prescription strength grades of azelaic acid. This is usually reserved for rosacea treatment as it tends to target redness and flushing, or as an acne treatment because of its antiseptic properties, but it can also be an effective hyperpigmentation treatment for its tyrosinase-inhibiting ability.\n\n**If you made it this far, congratulations! I hope this information is helpful. While it is extensive and based on massive amount of research, experience, experimentation and work with professionals, it may not be perfect and it may not be suitable for everyone. Feel free to offer any constructive criticism or ask any questions in comments. I am always open to expanding my understanding.**",

I'm definitely going to try to (gradually) work some of the things I'm not using into my skincare routine.\n\nI actually just got some azelaic acid and just used it for the first time a couple of nights ago. It sounds like it would be better to use it in the AM.

    "body": "Hey-Oh! So, I see some form of this question multiple times per day in various skin and personal care subs: How do I deal with my hyperpigmentation? I also asked myself this question a few years ago. See, I'm prone to freckles and a little melasma and I set out to figure out a way to solve it with years of research, trial and error, testing, talking to dermatologists and professionals, and scouring every medical article I could get my hands on. I wanted to share my findings and research since this is a common concern, especially among people in their 30s. This started as a small post about my routine and ballooned into a massive book about hyperpigmentation. I hope it's helpful! \n\n**DISCLAIMERS:**\n\n* I use the term \"brightening\" instead of \"lightening\" which is a subtle distinction. None of the ingredients or methods I recommend bleach your skin as \"lightening\" would suggest, but they can reduce the appearance of hyperpigmentation. \"Brightening\" tends to be a confusing term in skincare, but for the purposes of this post, I use it as a descriptor for anything that helps prevent or reduce melanin in hyperpigmented skin.\n* I will use the term \"hyperpigmentation\" ad nauseam as a catch-all term for excess pigmentation in the skin including freckles, melasma, PIH and dark spots. This does not encompass moles which are different. This is also different from redness, which is a whole other post.\n* Speaking about hyperpigmentation requires some sensitivity to very real issues around it including cultural implications. This post is not intended to moralize hyperpigmentation nor is it intended to alienate the normal melaninization of skin across various tones. Hyperpigmentation refers to excess melanin production on the skin in the form of spots that are darker than the surrounding skin. It's not bad or wrong, nor does it speak to anyone not \"doing a good enough job\" of taking care of themselves.\n* I do repeat myself a few times in here but that is for people who are skipping around the article. I want to be as thorough as possible even if you're jumping to the parts of the post you need.\n* I do run an online dermatology practice and skin care consultancy, but in order to protect the integrity of my advice, I do not promote my business, I don't give direct medical advice, I don't link to any products/websites, and I don't have any products I've formulated myself to promote. This is going to get long because I wanted to cover everything re:hyperpigmentation. But for your reading pleasure and ease, I have divided this post up so you can get whatever information you need: \n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n1. Types of Hyperpigmentation\n2. What Causes Hyperpigmentation?\n3. How To Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 1: The Ingredients\n4. How to Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 2: The Routine and Recommendations\n5. Body Hyperpigmentation\n6. Nuclear Options \n\nLet's get to it! \n\n**Types of Hyperpigmentation** \n\nHyperpigmentation refers to excess melanin production in the skin, but it can actually take a couple different forms. Knowing the type of hyperpigmentation you're experiencing is key to understanding if and how it can be treated. \n\n**Freckles**: Freckles are incredibly common, especially for people with lighter skin tones. They are small, brown or reddish-brown dots often clustered on the skin. They develop on the surface and are not raised bumps. Freckles can appear anywhere on the body but are common on the face. Freckles are permanent, but the color, contrast and severity can vary and be tempered. \n\n**Melasma**: Melasma appears as dark patches or splotches around the face, though usually found on the forehead, upper lip, and high on the cheeks. Melasma forms deeper in the skin and appears more amorphous than freckles, moles, or age spots. It can create a “muddy” appearance and is very common among pregnant and postpartum women due to hormonal factors. But it can literally happen to anyone and anywhere on the body. \n\n**Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation (PIH)**: Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) occurs when damaged skin forms melanin during the healing process leaving dark spots. This is common after acne, injuries, eczema, burns, and other trauma to the skin. Exposure to UV rays during healing can make PIH worse. Post-inflammatory erythema (PIE) is similar, but leaves pink or red marks on the skin as a result of damage to the capillaries from injury or inflammation. Basically, when skin is compromised by injury, as part of the immune response cells will begin to generate melanin in an attempt to prevent further damage from UV exposure, so what will happen is the wound/legion/blemish will heal but the pigmented skin remains. \n\n**Age Spots**: This is kind of a forgotten form of hyperpigmentation. Sun spots, also referred to as liver spots, and solar lentigines are large spots/patches of dark skin with distinct borders. They vary in color from light brown to almost black. They develop on the surface of the skin usually later in life, but reflect damage that often occurred from improper sun protection at a younger age. They can appear on the face, neck, chest, hands, and arms, usually on areas that had UV exposure. For many people, they can begin to appear in your 30s or 40s. \n\n# What Causes Hyperpigmentation? \n\nThere are a number of factors that can contribute to the formation of hyperpigmentation. Generally, it forms as the result of a combination of genetic and environmental influences. Everyone is unique, but these are some of the most common causes of hyperpigmentation and dark spots: \n\n**Genetics** can play a role in the development of hyperpigmentation and dark spots in several ways:\n\n* **Melanin production:** Melanin is the pigment that provides color to our skin, hair, and eyes. The amount of melanin produced and distributed in the skin is largely determined by genetics. People with a greater genetic predisposition to melanin production in their skin are more likely to experience hyperpigmentation and dark spots as a result of sun exposure, hormonal changes, and other factors. People with darker skin are also more prone to melanin production in the form of hyperpigmentation.\n* **Genetic anomalies**: Certain genetic anomalies, such as oculocutaneous albinism, can affect melanin production and distribution in the skin, leading to an increased risk of hyperpigmentation and dark spots.\n* **Family history:** If you have a family history of hyperpigmentation or dark spots, you may be more likely to develop these conditions yourself.\n* **Enzymes and genes**: The enzymes that control melanin production and distribution are regulated by specific genes. Variations in these genes can impact melanin production, leading to an increased risk of hyperpigmentation and dark spots. \n\n**Sun (UV) Exposure.** In addition to genetic determination of melanin production, UV exposure is the leading environmental cause of hyperpigmentation and the formation of dark spots. Melanin is the pigment that provides color to our skin, hair, and eyes. It acts as a natural sunscreen (but don't treat it like natural sunscreen!!! This isn't the point of the exercise), absorbing UV radiation to protect the skin from damage. \n\nWhen the skin is exposed to UV radiation, the melanocytes (cells that produce melanin) in the skin go into overdrive, producing more melanin to protect the skin from further damage. This increased melanin production can result in dark spots or areas of hyperpigmentation on the skin. \n\n**Hormones**. In addition to genetic determination of melanin production, hormones and hormonal sensitivity is a leading internal cause of hyperpigmentation and the formation of dark spots. One of the most well-known examples of hormonal hyperpigmentation is melasma, a condition characterized by dark, amorphous patches on the face, particularly on the cheeks, forehead, nose, and upper lip. Melasma is often associated with hormonal changes, such as those that occur during pregnancy, hormonal therapy, or birth control pill use. The hormonal changes can stimulate an increase in melanin production, resulting in dark spots or areas of hyperpigmentation. This can happen irrespective of UV exposure, though the sun does exacerbate it. \n\nHormones can also affect melanin production by altering the skin's metabolism and pigmentation pathways. For example, high levels of cortisol, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands during stress, can trigger an increase in melanin production, resulting in hyperpigmentation. \n\n**Inflammation, Injury & Trauma** to the skin can result in hyperpigmentation by triggering an increase in melanin production. When the skin is inflamed or injured, it triggers a response from the body's immune system, which can stimulate an increase in melanin production as a protective measure. For example, acne breakouts or other skin injuries can result in post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), which is characterized by dark spots or areas of discoloration on the skin. The dark spots are a result of an increase in melanin production in the affected area, which occurs in response to the inflammation or injury. In addition to acne and other skin injuries, other conditions that can result in PIH include eczema, psoriasis, and insect bites. \n\n**Medication Side Effects.** Certain medications can cause hyperpigmentation on the skin. Medications that can cause hyperpigmentation include:\n\n* **Tetracycline antibiotics:** Tetracycline antibiotics, such as doxycycline and minocycline, can cause discoloration of the skin and teeth when taken in high doses or for an extended period of time.\n* **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs):** NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, can cause hyperpigmentation in some individuals, especially if taken in high doses or for an extended period of time.\n* **Chemotherapy drugs:** Certain chemotherapy drugs, such as doxorubicin and daunorubicin, can cause hyperpigmentation, especially in areas of the skin that have been exposed to the sun.\n* **Hormonal medications:** Hormonal medications, such as birth control pills and estrogen replacements, can cause hyperpigmentation in some individuals, especially if they are taken for an extended period of time.\n* **Antimalarial drugs:** Antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, can cause hyperpigmentation in some individuals, especially if taken in high doses or for an extended period of time.\n* **Isotretinoin** aka accutane when taken for acne can cause hyperpigmentation due to the increase of cell turnover and exposing delicate new skin cells to UV rays before they have shored up. \n\nIf using these medications is necessary for your livelihood, it is not recommended to stop their use without the recommendation of your doctor. \n\n# How To Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 1: The Ingredients \n\nWhen looking for skin care products to treat and prevent hyperpigmentation and dark spots, it's important to look for ingredients that can help encourage cell turnover, curb melanin production, and block harmful UV rays. A lot of these things overlap with treatments for other conditions like acne and general anti-aging, but I've noted ones that specifically work on the mechanisms controlling melanin production. Now, this is an extensive list, but I know it doesn't have everything. I've included the ingredients that had the most compelling evidence and/or worked the best for me or people at my practice. But it's also not necessarily a shopping list. You don't have to have all of these things to treat hyperpigmentation, but I'll get to that in the routine portion. This is more to be used as a tool that can help you diversify your routine if you find one ingredient or another doesn't work for you. And it can help you determine if a product targets hyperpigmentation based on its ingredients. There's lot's of options. Some of the key ingredients to look for include: \n\n**Retinoids** that increases cell turnover. Retinoids like tretinoin, adapalene, retinol et al, can help treat hyperpigmentation by promoting the turnover of skin cells and increasing cell growth, which can help fade dark spots and improve overall skin tone by replacing pigmented skin cells at the surface. While retinoids are extremely effective, they do have some caveats. First, they can be sensitizing to a lot of users, but this can be tempered by using different form functions, different application methods, or different concentrations. Second, because it's constantly turning over skin exposing delicate new skin cells to the elements, it can actually worsen hyperpigmentation if you're not vigilant about sun protection and avoidance. Tretinoin and other retinoids are firewalled behind a prescription in some countries and may be more difficult to obtain. But retinol/al is available in OTC forms. \n\n**SPF** represents a class of many ingredients designed to protect the skin from UV rays and the damage that occurs from exposure. UV exposure is one of the biggest causes of fine hyperpigmentation and wrinkles so adequate protection is essential. I know I'm not winning any science awards for this declaration, but a lot of people who struggle with hyperpigmentation aren't adequately protecting themselves from the sun. But you also have to be kind of realistic. Even with perfect protection and avoidance, sometimes your hyperpigmentation will still flare. This happens during the summer for a lot of people and something even I grapple with. The key is to do your best and SPF actually works well with numerous other ingredients (like the ones listed below) to help solve that problem. Arbutin is a Tyrosinase Inhibitor that blocks melanin production. \n\n**Arbutin**, or the synthesized version called alpha arbutin, is a favorite brightening ingredient because it's a slow-release derivative of hydroquinone that inhibits melanin production. This results in both healing and prevention of dark spots, especially when paired with topical acids. It metabolizes on the skin into hydroquinone which is super effective for hyperpigmentation while being a less controversial and hard-to-come-by ingredient than pure hydroquinone. More on hydroquinone in part 6. \n\n**Tranexamic acid** is another Tyrosinase Inhibitor. This was first used in wound care and it was found to have profound effects on hyperpigmentation. Although it's an acid, it's not a chemical exfoliant, kinda like how hyaluronic acid is not a chemical exfoliant. The exact mechanism by which tranexamic acid works to reduce hyperpigmentation is not fully understood, but it is believed to work by reducing inflammation by blocking plasmin which contributes to melanin production when unchecked. It is particularly effective in treating melasma and one of my personal favorite ingredients. \n\n**Kojic Acid** is another Tyrosinase Inhibitor. Kojic acid is a natural skin brightener that is derived from various fungi. Kojic acid can also help to exfoliate because it's a slight chemical exfoliant, which can remove dead skin cells that contribute to hyperpigmentation and improve overall appearance. But it does both things: block melanin production and turn skin cells over. Azelaic Acid has a lot of things going for it that can help with hyperpigmentation. It's an anti-inflammatory and antiseptic that disrupts melanin production. \n\n**Azelaic acid** works by inhibiting the production of melanin in the skin like those other tyrosinase inhibitors. In addition, azelaic acid also has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, which help to improve the overall health and appearance of the skin by reducing melanin production as a result of injury or inflammation. It's also an anti-acne ingredient that can address the root cause of PIH by reducing acne on the skin. It's pretty awesome and available in OTC and prescription strengths. \n\n**Niacinamide** is another one that directly and indirectly addresses hyperpigmentation. It's a skin soother that decreases inflammation and it naturally reduces sebum production which can curb acne which can curb PIH. It actually took me a little while to figure out that this was another solid hyperpigmentation treatment for these reasons because I used to look at it as being more of an acne treatment. Niacinamide is a form of vitamin B3 that works by inhibiting the transfer of pigment within the skin, which can help to reduce the appearance of dark spots and uneven skin tone. So while it doesn't block tyrosinase, it prevents transfer of pigmented skin cells to the surface. \n\n**Vitamin C aka L-ascorbic acid** is an antioxidant that fights free radical damage. It treats and prevents hyperpigmentation in three ways. First, it reduces free radical damage from UV exposure which helps increase the effectiveness of SPF when worn together. Second, it is also a tyrosinase inhibitor that blocks melanin production. And finally, vitamin C encourages skin cell turnover. The key is finding a nice stable version of it. \n\n**Glycolic and Lactic Acid.** Since this list is getting long I am going to group these together. Glycolic Acid is a water-soluble alpha hydroxy acid that penetrates into the pores to treat pigmentation by providing general exfoliation and resurfacing of the skin. The result is improvements in dark spots, texture and other signs of aging. Lactic Acid is also an AHA but with a slightly larger molecular size than glycolic acid so it doesn't penetrate as deep and acts more as a surface exfoliant. As a result it provides more gentle exfoliation to buff away surface pigmentation with an added benefit of acting as a humectant to seal moisture into the skin. Licorice Extract is a plant extract that inhibits melanin production. \n\n**Licorice root extract** contains a compound called glabridin, which has been shown to have skin brightening effects as, you guessed it, a tyrosinase inhibitor. In addition, licorice root extract also has anti-inflammatory properties, which can help to reduce redness and inflammation associated with hyperpigmentation. I'm seeing more and more of this pop up in skin care. \n\n**Soy Proteins** are another plant extract that inhibits melanin production. They contain compounds known as isoflavones, which have been shown to help reduce the amount of melanin produced by melanocytes in the skin. Additionally, soy proteins have antioxidant properties that can help to protect the skin from damage caused by free radicals, which can contribute to hyperpigmentation. \n\n# How To Treat Hyperpigmentation Part 2: The Routine and Recommendations \n\nThis is adapted from numerous comments, posts and DMs I've written on the topic and also comprises a large portion of my own personal routine and routines we recommend to patients. This is a generalist routine meaning it targets all the forms of hyperpigmentation I've mentioned; freckles, melasma, PIH, and age spots though it can be tweaked to address these individually more specifically. This is really my jumping off point for people to get a good idea of what they can achieve as a baseline with OTC ingredients before fine tuning or enlisting the help of a dermatologist. For a lot of people, this is enough to fully resolve, but even if it gets you part of the way there, this should give you a good idea of reactivity. A few caveats:\n\n* Freckles cannot ever be 100% eradicated. You can however reduce their appearance and prevent them from getting darker. It's important to have realistic goals and understand that sometimes our genetics will overrule any routine we have.\n* This routine and any hyperpigmentation routine will not address moles. Moles are a totally different thing that can only be eradicated through removal by a medical practitioner. Moles can be raised or not, but no amount of topicals will get rid of them.\n* Melasma is a beast. Sometimes it can be treated with OTC topicals, sometimes it requires prescription strength topicals like hydroquinone, sometimes you need in-office procedures like fractal lasers or IPL. Again, this routine is a jumping off point to see what you can accomplish at home before going down that road.\n* You'll notice I don't mention products with all the ingredients I listed above. This is because the more you put on your face, the greater your risk of causing irritation. Again, you can adjust and tweak by switching out products with these ingredients or add/subtract as it suits your personal needs.\n* If you're struggling with hyperpigmentation while pregnant or breastfeeding, these recommendations may need to be paused. \n\nAlright, let's get to it! \n\n**AM routine -- The Goal: Heal, Protect, and Prevent. In order of application following a lukewarm water rinse:**\n\n* Azelaic acid\n* Alpha Arbutin\n* Vitamin C serum\n* Moisturizer\n* SPF \n\nThe combo of C+AZ+AA+SPF is an absolute powerhouse for healing existing hyperpigmentation and preventing new hyperpigmentation from forming. It makes your SPF more effective, it inhibits the production of melanin from UV exposure (not your natural melanin production though), and it speeds cell turnover with dual antioxidant action and gentle chemical exfoliation. The result is brighter skin in a few months of consistent use. \n\n**For Azelaic Acid**, this is the ingredient for serious treatment. It's considered one of the most effective ways to reverse melasma aka serious hyperpigmentation short of hydroquinone -- which is both controversial and hard to get. It brings a little bit of exfoliation to the table in addition to inhibiting UV melanin production, but it also has a slight antiseptic property which can help with acne. Paula's choice Azelaic Acid Booster is the only one I've really tried after sampling the Ordinary's in-store and not liking the texture. I get about 6 months out of a tube and a little bit goes a long way. \n\n**For Alpha Arbutin**, the Ordinary's formulation is pretty solid. I prefer the Ordinary's AA 2% + HA as opposed to their AA 2% + Ascorbic Acid 8% as I don't believe the quality and stability of their Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) is great. That's why I opt for a separate Vitamin C serum step. But the AA + HA also has a little bit of lactic acid in it which provides some gentle exfoliation and encourages AA deeper into the skin where it's more effective. Lactic acid is mild enough that it's safe for use in a morning routine, but you still want to protect with SPF. There are a couple AA products floating around but I think TO's product is probably the best, most straightforward one. Alpha Arbutin metabolizes into hydroquinone on the skin so is basically one of the best OTC pigment correctors you can get. \n\n**For Vitamin C**, the gold standard really is Skinceuticals CE Ferulic. This is stupid expensive though so I’m going to suggest Timeless Vitamin C. I like that it comes in an airless pump that prevents oxidation over time. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that increases the rate of skin cell turnover bringing forward new, skin cells while simultaneously improving the effects of SPF. It's a great foundation for a fix. \n\nThese ingredients can be layered on one right after the other then topped with your **moisturizer** (I like a basic one like cetaphil daily lotion), then topped with your **SPF**. The SPF I would recommend is Canmake UV mermaid gel in clear as this will not leave a white cast on your skin and it’s generally a very elegant SPF. It's SPF 50 which means it gives really good protection, but there are numerous SPFs you can try. I personally like anything from La Roche Posay, any Neutrogena SPF that's not formulated with ethylhexylglycerin, Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen, Biore Aqua Rich (another Japanese brand), Trader Joe's SPF if you can get your hands on it, and EltaMD. \n\nOf all the products I’ve tried that could act as a stand-in for vitamin c, azelaic acid, and alpha arbutin, there’s one Japanese serum from **Hada Labo called “whitening lotion”** which has had the biggest impact on my hyperpigmentation in a single product of anything I’ve tried. This might be a little too effective though, I actually find that it washed me out within the first 2 weeks of twice daily use, so now I only use it in the morning. And I’m not a fan of the translation… which is a direct but mistranslation. It’s not a bleaching lotion, it also relies on a form of vitamin C and tranexamic acid to brighten skin. But it's a really interesting to try if you wanted a simplified morning routine in which case I would apply this, then your moisturizer, then your SPF. \n\n**PM routine -- The Goal: Renew and Reveal. In order of application:**\n\n* Cleanse\n* Buffer\n* Tranexamic acid and exfoliant OR retinoid\\*\\*\n* Moisturize \n\n**To cleanse**, I have a really basic recommendation that will remove your SPF, makeup, and any grime/sebum from your day. Start with Cetaphil gentle cleanser. This is a gentle, hydrating cleanser that will break up your SPF really effectively. Massage in and rinse. Then apply a foaming cleanser, I recommend Cetaphil daily cleanser which foams. This will sweep away anything that’s left and give you a good foundation for the rest of your routine. While this doesn't directly help hyperpigmentation specifically, it's a critical step especially for people who are acne>PIH prone. It also gives you a nice clean slate to apply the rest of your skincare. I've tried dozens of cleansers but always come back to these two as good basic options. \n\n**For your Buffer** this is an important step that can be done prior to using a chemical exfoliant or retinoid: applying an occlusive that will block the active from more sensitive skin. I recommend buffering around your eyes and nostrils with La Roche Posay Cicaplast balm because it kind of doubles as a nice eye cream, but this can also be done with basic vaseline or aquaphor for a more budget-friendly option. \n\n**For Tranexamic Acid**, my holy grail TXA product, La Roche Posay Glycolic B5 is actually a multipurpose serum that combines ingredients to treat hyperpigmentation with chemical exfoliants. It contains two hyperpigmentation heavy hitters -- Tranexamic acid and Kojic Acid which are great for melasma -- and two exfoliants -- Glycolic Acid and Lipo-Hydroxy Acid (LHA) which is like fancy salicylic acid -- so it both reveals new skin cells that are less prone to pigmenting from UV exposure while sloughing away your old skin cells. You can use this 2 or 3 nights per week. On off nights, just cleanse and moisturize. \n\n**For a Retinoid** if you can get prescription tretinoin, this is going to be the best bet. Your doctor will advise you on the concentration. More on that in part 6. It will help speed up the rate of cell turnover bringing new, unpigmented skin cells to the surface faster. Some other OTC options include differin (which is rated more for acne but uses the same mechanism for cell turnover so it's also effective in this use case) and retinols. Now, I haven't tried every retinol on the market but I have two that I stand by: SkinCeuticals retinol and L'Oreal retinol serum. The SkinCeuticals is, in my opinion, the closest to RX tretinoin in terms of efficacy, but it's a little pricey. The L'Oreal also does a really good job and is a little more affordable. It's currently my go-to OTC on the days I'm not using my RX retinoid tazarotene. You can use this 2 or 3 nights per week. On off nights, just cleanse and moisturize. \n\n**\\*\\* My recommendations for tranexamic acid and retinoids CANNOT be used in the same night.** You'll nuke your skin. And for most people, both aren't necessary, you can get away with using one or the other. If I had a preference, I would say use the TXA serum instead of a retinoid, but if you can build up a tolerance to using them both without damaging your barrier, they work really well together. So, proceed with caution. If you want to use both, use them on alternate nights and give yourself a night or two without either to let your skin recover. For me personally, I do retinoids on Sundays, and Wednesdays, chemical exfoliants on Mondays and Thursdays, and I let my skin rest (cleanse, moisturize, squalene oil) on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. \n\nOn top of whichever active you choose, apply your **moisturizer**. You can use the same one you use in your morning routine, the Cetaphil daily lotion as it’s nice and light. I also like La Roche Posay Toleraine double repair for a ceramide-based cream alternative if you want something richer. \n\nYou do not want to \"slug\" over actives. This advice gets mixed in a lot. Slugging refers to applying an occlusive layer over your skincare such as vaseline, aquaphor, oils like squalene oil, or healing balms like La Roche Posay Cicaplast balm. While this can be done on hydration nights, it should not be done on nights when you're using chemical exfoliants or retinoids as this may make them too effective causing irritation and breakouts. \n\n# Body Hyperpigmentation \n\nOk, I need everyone to be a grownup for two seconds. These products and methods (both from the prior section and this section) should NOT be used on your genitals. First, you can cause serious irritation or infection by applying active skincare to your genitals. Second, it's really not going to do anything to change the pigmentation of the skin there. The skin on your genitals is different than your body and facial skin and it pigments in different ways for different reasons so it's not going to respond to topicals the same way the rest of your body does. Don't even try it. \n\n**To be perfectly clear, these are the areas you should not be applying skincare:** labia majora, labia minora, vaginal entrance or vagina, clitoral hood, perineum, anus, intergluteal cleft aka inside your butt crack, penis, or scrotum. And I say this as someone who chaffed the precipice of her \"intergluteal cleft\" in an unfortunate crunches-in-the-wrong-gym-shorts accident leaving me with some deeply incriminating hyperpigmentation and earning me the nickname \"skid mark\" from my ever loving boyfriend. It faded after a year but you can still send prayers. \n\n**These are areas you can apply skincare but do so with absolute caution and at your own risk**: bikini line, mons pubis, inner thigh up to the groin fold, butt cheeks. Ok, now that we've got the disclaimers out of the way, let's move forward. \n\nHyperpigmentation can also occur on body skin for the same reason it appears on the face, but it can also be triggered by friction. And because body skin is different from facial skin, it requires a slightly different approach. This is my recommendation for both hyperpigmentation and KP (Keratosis pilaris) because they rely on the same mechanism for treatment: chemical exfoliation. \n\nIn the case of body hyperpigmentation, I recommend a two prong approach: a body wash in the shower and a topical treatment to be used after. Oh, and SPF again if there are areas that are exposed to the sun, and I have a holy grail SPF recommendation for this. \n\nNow you may have noticed in my facial skin recommendation that I did not mention CeraVe as a treatment brand. I have posted numerous takedowns of CeraVe on other threads so I won't rehash them here suffice it to say that it's no longer a brand I can in good faith recommend since it's acquisition by L'Oreal. This is often the brand that's considered when treating KP on the body, but I don't believe their formulations and ingredient quality works for everyone. \n\n**For the body wash**, I recommend Neutrogena body clear with Salicylic acid. This is an exfoliating body wash that will help clear away dead skin cells on the surface allowing new ones to come through. To be effective, you want it to sit on your skin for a little while. I recommend lathering it up and applying it after turning off your shower faucet and letting it sit for 2 or 3 minutes. This is when I like to knock out shower emails. Then rinse away. \n\n**On towel dried skin** after your shower, apply AmLactin Bumps Be Gone. Again, this is formulated for KP but the reason I like it is because it contains lactic acid which will also give the assist on brightening hyperpigmented body skin. The wash and this should be effective, but you might also want to mix in a few drops of the alpha arbutin serum I recommended for your facial routine, maybe three drops per application area (each leg, each arm, chest, etc). I generally don't encourage facial products on the body because it's not an economical use for them, and also because body skin is a little more resilient and doesn't need skincare that's formulated for more sensitive facial skin. The AA serum from the Ordinary is very affordable however and is a good hyperpigmentation generalist. \n\nAnother one that I mentioned in the facial hyperpigmentation portion that can work well on the body is the Hada Labo whitening lotion. Again, this is formulated around tranexamic acid which is very effective for hyperpigmentation and a little bit if this stuff goes a long way. I buy it in bulk from Japanese Importers though it's also available on Amazon for a slightly higher price. If you find yourself in Asia, stock up on it. I use this specifically for fading tan lines that happen (even with diligent/neurotic SPF use) around my fitness watch and the straps of my workout tops that I run in. \n\n**You also want to wear SPF on areas that are exposed to the sun** to prevent pigmentation from occurring. The one I absolutely love that’s not your 90’s banana boat is Aveeno Protect + Hydrate lotion with SPF 60. This is a great SPF for a lot of reasons: it finishes like a lotion instead of a sunscreen, it dries down totally clear, and it has a pleasant, slight sweet scent. On a scale of 1-10 with 1 being bare skin, 10 being banana boat slathered on by your mom in 1997, and regular body lotion being a 2, I give Aveeno Protect + Hydrate a 2.5 in terms of texture and feel-finish. I use it as my daily lotion on my neck, arms, shoulders, and chest. If you're more active you might need a heavier hitter here like a sport sunscreen. \n\n# Nuclear Options \n\nIn general, I recommend trying OTC topical solutions for any skin concern before heading down the in-office procedure route. Part of this is because you can usually put a good dent in what you're struggling with by using OTC topicals, making in-office procedures and RX treatments easier and more effective. Part of it is so you have a good maintenance routine in place to use after the fact to preserve the results of your in-office procedure which can sometimes be costly. Lastly, while some procedures can solve the immediate problem completely, topical skincare can be really effective at treating other adjacent conditions like redness, acne, and fine lines. \n\nSide note: I haven't listed every possible compounded medication because there are a lot, and many compounded meds are formulated to tackle multiple issues like acne and hyperpigmentation. I also tend to favor single note skin care (aka, products with very few ingredients) as this allows you to combine or remove certain actives and gives you a better sense of reactivity. \n\nFor tougher-to-treat hyperpigmentation such as melasma, if your topical routine doesn't totally clear the problem in 6 to 8 months, a visit to the dermatologist might be helpful. Here are the heavier-hitting procedures and topicals that can go the extra mile after you've exhausted other options. \n\n**Medical Grade Peels:** Medical grade chemical peels can be done by dermatologists. Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or phenol peels may be done for cases of severe hyperpigmentation, but high concentration BHA or AHA peels are also commonly used. I do these twice a year. Because of the strength of the acids used, these must be done by a medical professional with careful followup. \n\n\\*\\*\\*IPL Therapy and Laser Therapy may not work for everyone and in some cases may exacerbate hyperpigmentation so you really want to work with dermatologists with a lot of experience in treating cases similar to yours to determine if these interventions are appropriate for you. \n\n**IPL Treatment:** Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) therapy can treat hyperpigmentation by targeting the melanin in the skin with a broad spectrum of light wavelengths, heating and breaking the melanin down. IPL is particularly effective for treating sun damage and age spots, as well as other forms of hyperpigmentation. The treatment is relatively non-invasive, with minimal downtime, making it a popular option. This is also a great treatment for the redness associated with enlarged blood vessels (often confused for broken capillaries) on the surface of the skin which can also appear alongside hyperpigmentation. There isn't any clinical evidence to support at-home IPL devices being effective in the same way. That doesn't mean it's not possible, it's just not studied enough to be certain. Most at-home IPL devices do not operate in effective wavelengths the way professional grade ones do. \n\n**Laser Therapy:** Fractional and CO2 lasers can be used to treat a range of hyperpigmentation issues, including sun damage, age spots, and melasma. The treatment works by removing the top layers of skin, which contain the excess pigmentation, revealing fresh, healthy skin cells underneath. The lasers also stimulate the production of collagen, which helps to improve skin texture and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. \n\n**Hydroquinone**: This isn't an in-office procedure like the aforementioned treatments, but it is firewalled behind a prescription meaning you can only access hydroquinone in effective concentrations by working with a doctor. This is a somewhat new development at least in the US following some covid-era rejiggering of prescription clearances. HDQ is controversial because it's a skin bleaching agent which has some cultural implications in places where light skin is favored over natural pigmentation. HDQ technically works the same way other OTC tyrosinase inhibitors do (in fact arbutin actually metabolizes into HDQ when applied to the skin), pure HDQ happens to be the most powerful version of them. It lightens any skin it touches, not just hyperpigmented skin in higher concentrations which can make it tough to use. This effect isn't as profound in the other tyrosinase inhibitors I mentioned making them much easier to use over HDQ which, in high concentrations, must be dotted on the skin in only hyperpigmented areas. So HDQ is really reserved for intervention in extreme or OTC treatment-resistance cases. \n\n**Tretinoin and Prescription Retinoids:** This is going to be dependent on what part of the world you're in, but in a lot of countries, tretinoin and its counterparts like tazarotene are only available through prescription. I mentioned retinoids in the routine so if you're able to get your hands on a prescription from a doctor, it may be more effective than OTC retinols. Most doctors will prescribe a retinoid over hydroquinone, so this is usually easier to procure and can be quite effective on its own as a hyperpigmentation treatment. OTC differin is the only retinoid available over-the-counter (in the US) which can also be used for hyperpigmentation. \n\n**Prescription Azelaic Acid:** This is another one that's available in lower concentrations over-the-counter (which can still be quite effective) but there are prescription strength grades of azelaic acid. This is usually reserved for rosacea treatment as it tends to target redness and flushing, or as an acne treatment because of its antiseptic properties, but it can also be an effective hyperpigmentation treatment for its tyrosinase-inhibiting ability. \n\n**If you made it this far, congratulations! I hope this information is helpful. While it is extensive and based on massive amount of research, experience, experimentation and work with professionals, it may not be perfect and it may not be suitable for everyone. Feel free to offer any constructive criticism or ask any questions in comments. I am always open to expanding my understanding.**",

        "body": "Wowwowow insanely comprehensive and great info. Also beautifully presented and well formatted! So glad to see so many great suggestions and some of my favorite combinations too.\n\n  \n\n\nOne thing I wanted to comment on was the part about using tranexamic OR retinoids and how you suggested using them and just further clarify that that's, as you pointed out, something specific to the products you were suggesting in this example because the LRP glycolic b5 obviously has glycolic. So it is very much appreciated that you were attentive enough to point out that using retinoids and glycolic on the same night is a big risk for most people 😇\n\n  \n\n\nSince tranexamic itself isn't going to lead to any additional irritation risk, by itself it's safe to use with whatever else you'd like if the formualtion doesn't contain other actives that would add irritation risk. Cos de Baha Tranexamic Acid serum (tranexamic + niacinamide) is one of the generic options I would suggest that won't be adding additional irritation risk, and can certainly be used with retinoids comfortably. Cos de Baha Tranexamic Acid serum (tranexamic + niacinamide). Some other options with just slight exfoliation power but can be comfortably layered with retinoids without significant tolerance risk is Be Minimalist Tranexamic acid serum has no niacinamide, but has 3% mandelic and 0.3% salicylic, and HPA. Those are my 2 primary reccs. There's also Naturium Tranexamic Acid serum (tranexamic acid, niacinamide, licorice, kojic acid) which is more impressive on paper but all of them are excellent.\n\n  \n\n\nThe second is the retinoid application method. I always advise using moisturizer BEFORE your retinoid rather than after. Since there's no reduction in efficacy, theres only upside of decelerated absorbtion leading to less oversaturation of the retinoic acid receptors which is what leads to those side effects. (Using moisturizer before retinoids is also referred to as buffering but I don't want to confuse anyone with using the word buffering in 2 different ways here). Ideally in the simplest routine example, you would cleanse, apply the cos de baha tranexamic serum, moisturize on damp skin. then wait for it to dry down and then apply your retinoid.\n\n  \n\n\nI have a whole guide on how to use retinoids optimally and a list of reccs which I think would be great here for some affordable options in varying potency ranges. I particularly suggest one of the RetinAL products for anyone seeking the most potent OTC options aside from Adapelene depending on your country and very affordable!\n\n  \n\n\n> Retinoid reccs and guidance [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/qtodqu/routine_help_how_to_cleanse_once_a_day_when_you/hkp4w8t/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/qtodqu/routine_help_how_to_cleanse_once_a_day_when_you/hkp4w8t/)\n\n  \n\n\nAnd if it interests you, I believe I have a whole different post linked within that specifically dedicated to discussing the cost:benefit analysis of using moisturizer before retinoids or applying it to clean skin instead. (spoiler: there is no benefit to not using moisturizer before, only risk.)\n\n  \n\n\nFor vitamin C, a fav is the Minimalist 10% or 16% vitamin C which uses centella water as a base so you also get some great additional anti-inflammatory benefit to further reduce any potential irritation. I'm not a huge vitamin C fan, it's great if you can tolerate the extra irritation potential and already have many of those other ingredients you mentioned incorporated since azelaic and retinoids and tyrosinase inhibitors are going to be much more hard hitting for hyperpigmentation :) and having anti-inflammatory ingredients included in your routine can make a huge difference for PIE and consequently PIH to prevent the melanocytes from being irritated.\n\n  \n\n\nI also definitely agree with the TO azelaic being very sensorially and cosmetically unpleasant 🤣. It has a hard time not just pulling with ITSELF which is an impressive feat that they managed to botch the formulation so badly.\n\nWhat I normally suggest is one of:\n\n *  Q +A 8%Azelaic Acid serum\n *  Cosde Baha azelaic acid 10% serum (has Niacinamide)\n *  Peach Slices azelaic acid 10% serum\n *  Finacea 15% azelaic acid prescription (preferably the foam if accessible as it's much more comfortable and elegant, but insurance can make that prohibitive for some).\n\nThsts all I have to comment on for now. Your post was excellent and I hope people get to see it!",

    "body": "Ya'll, I’ve been on a long long journey to find the perfect Vitamin C serum for my skin, and after testing/experimenting multiple brands over the past 2 years, I thought I’d share my thoughts. Hopefully, this helps someone else navigating the overwhelming world of Vitamin C serums!\n\nFor context: I have combination skin (oily T-zone, dry cheeks) and my main concerns are brightening, fading dark spots, and preventing premature aging. I’ve used each serum for at least 3 months to give it a fair shot. Here’s my 2 pennies on the matter: \n\n1. Skinceuticals C E Ferulic \n\nPrice: $$$ (Yeah, it’s expensive)\n\nLink: [https://www.skinceuticals.com](https://www.skinceuticals.com) \n\nReview: This is the holy grail of Vitamin C serums, and I totally get why. It’s packed with 15% L-ascorbic acid, Vitamin E, and ferulic acid. I noticed a visible difference in my skin tone within 2 weeks. My dark spots faded, and my complexion looked amaze! \n\nPros: Clinically proven formula, works FAST, perfect for sensitive skin (no irritation). \n\nCons: The price is *ouch* ($182 for 1 oz), the smell is… weird (like hot dog water, but you get used to it). \n\nVerdict: Worth it if you can afford it. I repurchased twice but had to take breaks because of the cost.\n\n2. Drunk Elephant C-Firma Day Serum Price: $$; Link: [https://www.drunkelephant.com](https://www.drunkelephant.com) \n\nReview: This one has a cult following, and I was excited to try it. It contains 15% L-ascorbic acid, ferulic acid, and fruit enzymes. The texture is lightweight and absorbs quickly. \n\nPros: Brightens skin effectively, comes in nice airless packaging to prevent oxidation, smells nice (like a light citrus). \n\nCons: Oxidizes faster than I’d like (turns yellow after a few months), didn’t fade my dark spots as well as Skinceuticals. \n\nVerdict: A good mid-range option, but I wouldn’t repurchase because of the oxidation issue.\n\n3. Paula’s Choice C15 Super Booster Price: $$ Link: [https://www.paulaschoice.com](https://www.paulaschoice.com) Review: This serum has 15% Vitamin C along with hyaluronic acid and peptides. I loved how hydrating it felt perfect for my dry patches. \n\nPros: Lightweight and layers well under makeup, great for hydration and brightening, doesn’t oxidize quickly. \n\nCons: Took longer to see results (about 4-6 weeks), the dropper isn’t the best (hard to control the amount). \n\nVerdict: A solid choice for dry or sensitive skin, but not the most potent for dark spots.\n\n4. The Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2% \n\nPrice: $ \n\nLink: [https://www.theordinary.com](https://www.theordinary.com) \n\nReview: This is the most affordable option I tried, and it packs a punch with 23% L-ascorbic acid. However, the texture is gritty and can feel a bit harsh on the skin. \n\nPros: Super affordable ($6.80!), high concentration of Vitamin C, works well for brightening. \n\nCons: The gritty texture is annoying, can cause tingling or irritation (not for sensitive skin). \n\nVerdict: Great for beginners or those on a budget, but not my favorite due to the texture.\n\n5. Maelove The Glow Maker \n\nPrice: $$ \n\nLink: [https://www.maelove.com](https://www.maelove.com) \n\nReview: This serum is often called the “dupe” for Skinceuticals, and I see why. It has 15% L-ascorbic acid, Vitamin E, and ferulic acid at a fraction of the price. \n\nPros: Affordable ($29.95), brightens and evens skin tone effectively, lightweight and absorbs quickly. Cons: Slight tingling sensation (not irritating, but noticeable), doesn’t last as long as Skinceuticals. \n\nVerdict: The best budget-friendly alternative to Skinceuticals. I’ve repurchased this multiple times!\n\n6. Numbuzin No.5 Vitamin Concentrated Serum (Not REALLY Vit C, but has some % in it)\n\nPrice: $$ \n\nLink: [https://www.numbuzin.com](https://www.numbuzin.com) \n\nReview: This is a K-beauty gem that I recently discovered. It has 5% Vitamin C derivatives (gentler than L-ascorbic acid) and is formulated to brighten and improve skin texture. Pros: Gentle on sensitive skin, lightweight and hydrating, gives a natural glow over time. \n\nCons: Lower concentration of Vitamin C means slower results, not as effective for deep dark spots. \n\nVerdict: A great option for sensitive skin or those new to Vitamin C. I’d recommend it for daily use!\n\nTldr:   \nIf money isn’t an issue, Skinceuticals is the clear winner. But if you’re looking for something more affordable, Maelove is an excellent alternative. For hydration, Paula’s Choice is great, and if you’re on a tight budget, The Ordinary gets the job done (just be prepared for the texture). Numbuzin is a fantastic gentle option for sensitive skin or beginners.\n\nLet me know if you’ve tried any of these or have other recommendations! I’m always on the hunt for new serums to try.",

    "body": "Most people aren't educated enough to make decisions on what they want to put in their body based solely on the ingredient list.  I once witnessed a woman rant about the \"ascorbic acid\" that was in pre-sliced apples that were being sold.  (Ascorbic acid is literally vitamin C and used as an anti-browning agent).  She went on and on how she couldn't believe that someone was trying to sell her food with acid in it.  (Nearly everything we eat has acidic components, natural or not).  There was a survey conducted that showed that people were against the inclusion of \"Dihydrogen Monoxide\" in foods.  Dihydrogen monoxide is simply a over-complicated way to say \"water.\"  But since it was an unfamiliar term, it sounded dangerous.  There are even ingredients that if you look up on the internet you will find are poisonous, however the missing information is the dosage.  For many of these \"poisonous\" ingredients, you would have to eat ONE MILLION times the amount that is in one portion to see any adverse affects, let alone death.  Too much of practically anything could be poisonous.  You can die from drinking too much water (and it's not as uncommon as you would think).\n\nEDIT:  Seems like the consensus is that while these rules aren't perfect, people who are not exactly educated in nutrition need some sort of rule to follow.  It would be helpful if there were a better rule that encouraged doing research on unknown ingredients. \n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Further, everyone is ignorant about most subjects -- though we all like to pretend otherwise. But just because I took an honors organic chem class in college in 1985 doesn't mean I have any idea what some particular chemical ingredient does to the nutritional value of food, to the digestive process, to various disease processes, and so forth. So even having a better education about chemistry than the average person I'm highly ignorant about chemicals in food. \n\nThe rule as expressed is a way to give guidance to people who don't happen to have the time to go become an expert in the various fields related to chemistry and nutrition. Sure, they can \"google\" everything, but honestly, it's easier to come up with a functional decision heuristic that gets the job done well enough to achieve one's dietary goals and then just get on with life. \n\nAnd this rule is precisely that. \n\nSure, it will exclude some foods that are healthy. And it might include some foods that are not. But as rough cut guideline it will serve the purpose of allowing people to make timely  decisions about what to eat and not eat. \n\nSo, my point, is that for the average person heuristics are precisely about recognizing that they are ignorant and that is precisely why good heuristics should not be ignored -- because we don't have the time or energy to become expert in every field. What is dangerous and should be ignored is not having a good heuristic, nor a catchy way of stating the heuristic. What is dangerous and should be ignored are folks who pretend to be expert and offer heuristics as \"scientific\" claims and then start making up interpretations of reality to adhere to some made-up implications of the heuristic being accepted as some sort of universal law.

And they generally aren't. The ascorbic acid in an orange doesn't have to be listed as \"ascorbic acid\". \n\nIn fact, many labeling laws prohibit individually labeling the chemical components of a food item if the intent is to hide the more commonly known name of the ingredient. You actually have to say \"salt\" and not \"sodium chloride\", if and only if you actually added salt to what was there, in most cases.\n\nOnly things that are added separately are listed. If your food is labeled as having \"ascorbic acid\", then processed pure ascorbic acid, either chemically produced or extracted from other foods using chemical processes, was added.\n\nYou don't find \"caffeine\" in the ingredients of coffee unless extracted/processed caffeine was actually added separately.\n\nSo... this advice essentially comes down to \"don't eat overly processed food\". It's advice that people can actually follow, if they are concerned about overly processed food.\n\nI'm not trying to imply (nor do I believe) that processing always is bad for food... but the people making this kind of statement are basically asserting that it is, at least much of the time.\n\nMy assessment is that processed foods aren't always bad, but sometimes are. If you avoid all processed foods, you might miss out on some perfectly safe (perhaps even *more* safe) foods... but it's not a totally crazy strategy if you're trying to avoid the ones that are without having to do a huge amount of research on every thing you eat.",

        "body": "This rule might have its origins in chemophobia, but really it is not a bad rule to follow because it lead one to choose minimally processed, whole foods over the highly processed foods that make up the bulk of the standard American diet.  Consider the various reasons we process our foods:\n\n1. Make them cheaper to produce.\n2. Make them more marketable to consumers.\n3. Make them easier to eat. \n4. Shelf stability.\n5. Restore nutrients that previous processing has taken out, or add extra nutrients that are otherwise missing from our modern diet. \n\nNone of these things offer any health benefit to us over a diet of whole foods.  A diet comprised of minimally processed foods is nutrient dense, while a diet of highly processed foods is calorie dense in comparison.  It is difficult to overeat whole foods, it is very easy to overeat highly processed foods.  How many apples and bananas would you have to eat to equal the caloric load of the last bag of chips you binged on?  \n\nNow, the woman in your example shunned some perfectly good apple slices because of her ignorance of chemical names, but if she replaces them with a whole apple, what exactly has she lost?  Nothing at all, and she probably saved a little bit of money.  If she eschews granola bars for some raisins and a handful of nuts, is she somehow harmed by this?  Definitely not.  \n\nHumans have the wonderful ability to eat just about anything.  It doesn't mean that everything is equally healthy and it certainly doesn't mean that our highly processed modern diet should be considered optimal for health.  Growing up we learn that food should come in cans and wrappers.  It should have a big list of ingredients that turns bland starches into highly palatable food.  Our snacks should be so good, \"you can't just have one.\" It's all horseshit.  Our food should be picked and washed.  It should be butchered and roasted.  A diet of simple foods with simple ingredients will, in general, be healthier than a highly process diet.  \n\nThe rule of \"if you can't pronounce it, don't eat it\" will lead you to a healthier diet, even if it causes some false positives every now and then.

    "body": "These are about 3 years apart. I took the auto smooth filter off and last pic is no makeup just after washing my face.\n\nMy melasma started suddenly in late 2019/early 2020 for no apparent reason. Started in between my eyebrows then migrated up my forehead until it hit a peak in 2021/2022 where my dad actually thought I had dirt on my face one time. \n\nThe only consistent thing I've done since 2021 was to add daily SPF. I use La Roche Posay cream and liquid (I use either one or the other depending on my mood) tinted SPF 50 and this has replaced my use of foundation. I keep it handy and reapply. I also try to use hats when I can. And I'm not perfect about it, I just am consisten mostof the time.\n\nI live in Canada, but sailed my boat down to Mexico last year, and lived on the boat in Mexico for half a year. So I was definitely outdoors in hot/sunny weather which I was super apprehensive about but I seem to have kept it under some kind of control. \n\nI have used a varying combination of the following, but I've been on and off off these over the time. I'm very un-perfect, but I do what I can when I can.\n\n- retinol 0.025% prescription. I use for a month-ish then a couple months off.\n- L. Ascorbic acid (the ordinary) powder mixed into a few drops of water and rubbed in in the morning. I love this.\n- hyaularonic acid (the ordinary) when I'm extra dry. I won't wear this in the morning if I'm going out in the sun. Not really sure why, I just  have a 'gut feeling' about this with nothing to back it up. But there you go. \n- alpha arbutin (the ordinary) I used for a while, not sure if it helped? \n- ZO skin hydroquinone 2%. I had 2 bottles: one I used in 2022 and then I was off of it for 2023 then 2024 I started again. I think this helped but man it's really hard to tell.\n- cleanser, I use whatever. Dove bar soap sometimes. I try to use pure witch hazel as a toner but havent always had it.\n- salicylic acid and lactic acid i like in the evenings once in a while\n- Skin ceuticals face scrub. I LOVE this and won't use it every day, but when I do it always just resets/refreshes like no other product I've found\n\nHonestly nothing sticks out as a holy grail except maybe the SPF. This is entirely anecdotal, but I think changing up my skincare and taking breaks from things has worked in a way because it prevents my skin from getting used to any one product. So being imperfect, but attentive, and following a gut feeling about products, maybe has helped. It's a lot of work, reading about everything, and finding a way to use them that feels right for my skin, but I'm SO happy that its paying off. I don't even see it much in the mirror anymore and I'm so happy.",

    "body": "With Japan's re-opening and the upcoming winter, I'm going to go over some common cold and cough medicines found in Japan's drug stores. These are all over-the-counter medications that you can pick up a most drug stores throughout the country.  Matsumoto Kiyoshi (MatsuKi, マツモトキヨシ) is possibly the most noticeable drug store, with its big yellow and blue signage, but there are many others, too. More generally, drug stores will have this kanji often listed outside: 薬 (medicine). Note that you cannot buy medicine at convenience stores. At best, they might have throat lozenges or non-medical powders for stomach aches, but they don't sell anything with medical ingredients.\n\n# General Notes\n\n* This guide is meant to help travelers who are experiencing mild symptoms or who are perhaps in a drug store and don't know what to do (the pictures and translations below should help — you can also show them to the staff!). **If you are very sick or feel that you need medical attention, the Japanese government has [a guide that can help](https://www.jnto.go.jp/emergency/eng/mi_guide.html).**\n* The guide below details a few prominent medications. It does not cover all medications available. Some of these medications also have different versions with slightly different ingredients meant to target different symptoms. I picked the most \"general\" of the options when I could.\n* I did not translate the entire box for these medications. Below, I've listed ingredients, usage, dosage, and any important notes. If you need more specifics for info like allergies or aversions, this is not a guide that can help you.\n* Given the ingredients of these medications, almost all recommend that you take them with food.\n* Almost all of these medicines contains forms of codeine and/or ephedrine, ingredients which are often **not considered OTC medications in other countries**. Be careful when taking leftover pills out of the country, and **make sure to adhere to your next/home country's medication laws**.\n* **This guide is not medical advice!** It is simply meant to help you read and understand the packaging of Japanese OTC medications if you are looking for cold symptom management. If you have a complex medical history, or you take medications that interfere with these ingredients or others, always be careful when selecting OTC meds.\n* Translations of Japanese were made with assistance from /u/SofaAssassin.

It is very strong, and contains more dihydryocodeine than other things on this list, which means it has quite a bit of a drowsy effect. I wouldn't recommend SS Bron unless you are suffering a serious cough, and you should be careful when combining it with other medications (especially ones that also contain dihydryocodeine). In most drug stores, this product will be on the shelves, but you will likely need to speak with a pharmacist at checkout and answer a series of questions before they will let you buy it, as it is often abused and more strictly controlled because of that.\n\nFor an adult, you take 4 pills 3 times per day. The dosages on the ingredients listed below are for 12 pills (a full day's worth), so divide by three to get the per-dose amount. **Note: SS Bron also comes in a liquid form.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Ingredient - EN|Ingredient - JP|Dosage|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Dihydryocodeine|ジヒドロコディンリン酸塩|30mg|\n|dl-methylephedrine|dl-メチルエフェドリン塩酸塩|50mg|\n|Chlor-Trimeton|クロルフェニラミンマレイン酸塩|8mg|\n|Caffeine|無水カフェイン|90mg|",

    "body": "Hello, here's a complete guide on how to prevent wrinkles as much as possible.\n\nBefore going into cosmetic procedures, it is important to know that wrinkles are HEAVILY influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Twin studies estimate that genetics account for up to 60 % of the variation in wrinkle development, but lifestyle choices such as sun exposure, smoking, and stress markedly accelerate aging ([article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/712313?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).\n\n* **Eat, sleep and drink well**\n\nBefore anything, you need to focus on what you're giving your body to work with. *Whole foods* rich in antioxidants support collagen integrity and combat oxidative stress. Drinking water (MORE than 2 L/day and please water with electrolytes) helps maintain both superficial and deep skin hydration which improves elasticity and reduces fine lines. \n*Sleep* is crucial for skin regeneration. Aim for 7-10 hours per night to allow your body to repair and regenerate collagen, as most of this process happens during deep sleep.\n\n* **Stress-free life**\n\nChronic stress elevates cortisol, which inhibits collagen synthesis, increases collagen-degrading enzyme activity, and delays barrier recovery—changes that accelerate wrinkle formation ([article 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4082169/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [article 2](https://columbiaskinclinic.com/skin-care/how-stress-affects-your-skin/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). Techniques such as meditation, yoga, and journaling can meaningfully lower cortisol levels and help with wrinkle prevention ([article](https://www.byrdie.com/does-stress-cause-wrinkles-8703479?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).\n\n* **Skincare** \n\n*Prescription tretinoin* improves fine lines, mottled pigmentation, and skin texture within one month, with benefits lasting up to 24 months.\n\nDaily application of a *sunscreen* (SPF 30 or higher) completely prevented detectable skin aging over 4.5 years in a randomized trial ([article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23732711/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [article](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/0003-4819-158-11-201306040-00001?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). \n\nSerums containing 15 % L-ascorbic acid (*Vitamin C*), 1 % α-tocopherol, and 0.5 % ferulic acid reduced wrinkle depth by up to 36 % and improved firmness in 12 weeks ([article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16185284/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). \n\n*Niacinamide* at 5 % reduces fine lines, hyperpigmentation, and sallowness and enhances elasticity over 12 weeks ([article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16029679/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).\n\n*Red light therapy* boosts collagen and smooth fine lines. Studies report up to a 30 % reduction in wrinkle volume after just eight twice-weekly sessions of 633 nm light ([article](https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/red-light-therapy-for-wrinkles/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)), and home-use devices (633 nm + 830 nm) used three times per week for 12 weeks improve skin texture, elasticity, and collagen density.\n\n* **Cosmetic procedures** \n\n*Microneedling* delivers controlled micro-injuries that stimulate dermal collagen types I, III, and VII, resulting in noticeable reductions in fine lines and wrinkles within weeks ([article](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11499218/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). \n\n*Botox* injections can relax facial muscles and inhibit the formation of deep dynamic lines before they set in.\n\n* **Supplements** \n\n*Oral collagen peptides* (10 g/day) significantly improved skin hydration and elasticity over eight weeks ([article](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8125628/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). \n\n*Hyaluronic acid* supplementation (120+ mg/day) reduced wrinkle volume and increased skin luster and suppleness in a 12-week, placebo-controlled trial ([article](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5522662/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). \n\n*MSM* at 1–3 g/day significantly reduced wrinkles and improved firmness, elasticity, and hydration in a randomized study ([article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32083522/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). \n\n*Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA)* attenuate collagen degradation by inhibiting MMP induction and support skin barrier function and anti-inflammatory processes; cell and small human studies show protection from photoaging ([article](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6117694/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).\n\n*Astaxanthin* (8 mg/day) improved skin elasticity, hydration, and reduced fine lines and age spots in 6- to 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled studies ([article](https://abp.ptbioch.edu.pl/index.php/abp/article/view/2168)).\n\n* **Misc:**\n\n\\-> layer antioxidants in the morning and retinoids at night  \n\\-> NEVER skip daily sunscreen  \n\\-> if possible, consult a board-certified dermatologist before starting prescription actives or procedures. \n\nEDIT: added astaxanthin and sleep",

That’s a shit ton of sunscreen. With a spray or a stick you aren’t likely to get a heavy enough application. That’s why lotion is best.\n\nHigher SPF has a better chance of protecting since most people when using sunscreens do not get fully efficacy of whatever SPF they’re using due to application being tricky.\n\nFor daily use with an indoor job, 30 is probably fine as long as you reapply like once. Sunscreen loses efficacy after 2 hours in the sun, or if it’s physically sweated/rubbed off of your face.\n\nOn mobile but I can provide sources if anyone specifically wants some.",

British sailors, like all other sailors, routinely came down with scurvy, because sailors would be at sea for months, and shipboard diets of the time provided no vitamin C at all.\n\nThere were lots of theories, but nobody really understood **why** so many sailors seemed to come down with scurvy. What the British Navy did discover was that ships that went to the Caribbean, whether Navy or civilian, had far less scurvy than ships that sailed elsewhere.\n\nWhat was the difference? Rum!\n\nAnd so sailors got a rum ration. And low and behold, scurvy pretty much disappeared!\n\nNow, rum was made in other locations than the Caribbean, but those other rums didn't prevent scurvy. This was because the Caribbeans put lemon or limes in their rums, which provided the vitamin C that prevented scurvy.\n\nEventually, someone figured out that it was not the rum itself that was keeping away the scurvy, but the lime juice in it. And so the British started putting limes on their ships for those who wouldn't, couldn't, or shouldn't have alcohol. And people were far less likely to steal the limes and go on a bender with them, too. And that is how the British earned the nickname \"limey\".\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk.",

I personally would go for the Be Plain when it's available because it has a simplified formula without the unnecessary plant extracts and flower oils. I think the Be Plain one would be better for oily skin than the Round Lab one. Both of the Hyggee sunscreens look promising, but I'm gravitating towards the Vegan Sun Cream because it is a chemical sunscreen and I have a tan complexion, I don't want to risk a white cast. However, the Real Sun Cream does have an interesting ingredient list and whipped texture (as I can see on Yesstyle)  and I will be looking out for reviews to see whether it leaves a white cast or not and make my decision accordingly. What I love about the Hyggee sunscreens is that they are fragrance/essential oil free, but they still contain alcohol. I prefer alcohol because it allows the sunscreen to set better and be less tacky. If you have oily skin, I would think that one of the Hyggee sunscreens would work better for you because I have a Kolmar sunscreen (Isntree Watery Sun Gel) that is similar to the new Round Lab and Be Plain sunscreens and I definitely wouldn't recommend it for oily skin as it is way too shiny.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream has beet root extract, which made me think of the Krave Beet Shield. Get this, the Beet Shield was also made in Cosmax, same as this new Hyggee one. So I did some digging and found out that the Beet Shield has the SAME exact 5 filters as this new Hyggee sunscreens in the same order. The rest of ingredients are not too similar though, so I do not think they are the same exact sunscreen, as opposed to how I feel about the Be Plain and Round Lab sunscreens, which I do think are almost identical. I do think this Vegan Sun Cream is inspired by the Beet Shield, with maybe an improved formula, since the Beet Shield did not pass SPF tests. So if you are looking for a replacement of the Krave Beauty Beet Shield but with verified SPF protection, get the new Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream!",

I'll be keeping my review of each item fairly short. I also want to mention that some of these products are either discontinued or have been reformulated, which I will note. If I can find the ingredient list for these products I will also be linking them as well.\n\nTo give some context about me and my skin type, I'm mid to late 20 year old male, my skin type is combination (oily T-Zone, dry to normal U-Zone) and I suffer from cystic acne ever since I was a teenager. I live in a climate where it's fairly dry all year round with harsh winters; gets down to around -20C which is -4F, and in the summer it sometimes can get fairly hot around 30C which is 86F.\n\nMy main concerns for my skin is acne and the hyperpigmentation it leaves behind.\n\n**Cleansers:**\n\n* [*Pyunkang Yul ACNE Facial Cleanser*](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-yul-pyunkang-yul-acne-facial-cleanser) \\- this was just an ok cleanser, nothing to rave about but nothing to boo at. I don't think it'll necessary clear much acne, even if you have common acne. It does create a slight lather. Alcohol, essential oil, and fragrance free. \n* [*Etude House Real Art Moisture Cleansing Oil*](https://incidecoder.com/products/etude-house-real-art-cleansing-oil) \\- was not really a fan of this cleansing oil, I don't really wear makeup so I can't really say how well it cleansed, but the fact that it has fragrance kinda peeves me off. Alcohol free, has been renewed once. \n* [*Papa Recipe Eggplant Clearing 5.5 Cleansing Foam*](https://incidecoder.com/products/papa-recipe-eggplant-clearing-5-5-cleansing-foam) \\- this is a basic foam cleanser, I don't really think it really helps with acne. Lathers pretty well, and with these foam cleansers, you only need a small amount to cleanse your face so it lasts a long time. Alcohol and fragrance free. \n* [*2ndesign First Cleansing Oil Pure & Fresh*](https://incidecoder.com/products/2ndesign-first-cleansing-oil-pure-fresh) \\- didn't mind this oil cleanser, minimal ingredients, has a tolerable scent for a wash off product and it's quite affordable. Emulsifies well, and doesn't leave a weird film on the skin. Alcohol and fragrance free. \n* [*Cosrx Low pH good Morning Gel Cleanser*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-low-ph-good-morning-gel-cleanser) \\- i probably have emptied more than one tube of this, but obviously, who can say they've delved into AB without trying a Cosrx product before. I think this is fine because I have somewhat oily skin, but from what I've read general consensus is that it's not great for dry skin. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [*CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cerave-hydrating-cleanser-2) \\- for me this cleanser is probably one of the best cleansers on the market. The fact that it's a milky, non-foaming cleanser is somewhat comforting, especially during the colder winter months. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*CeraVe Hydrating Micellar Water*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cerave-hydrating-micellar-water) \\- this shit will sting your eyes if you're not careful, it's probably because of the high niacinamide content. Other than that, I think it's fine. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Bioderma Sensibio H2O*](https://incidecoder.com/products/bioderma-sensibio-h2o) \\- i mean, this is fine. I don't think it's really worth how much it cost compared to all the options we have now, but this was the first micellar water if I'm not wrong so, pop off I guess. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*Garnier Skinactive Micellar Water All-In-1*](https://incidecoder.com/products/garnier-skinactive-micellar-cleansing-water-all-in-1) \\- i've probably emptied at least five bottles of this by now. If you're looking for a micellar water that's fuss-free, I recommend this one. It's cheap and easy, what's not to like. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Clinique City Block Purifying Charcoal Cleansing Gel*](https://incidecoder.com/products/clinique-city-block-purifying-charcoal-cleansing-gel) \\- i don't like this. Regardless this has been discontinued it seems. \n* [*su:m37 Miracle Rose Cleansing Stick*](https://incidecoder.com/products/su-m37-miracle-rose-cleansing-stick) \\- remember when cleansing sticks were so hyped up? yeah I didn't even finish this. Anyways it's been discontinued but this is not great. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n\n**Toners**:\n\n* [*Pyunkang Yul Mist Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-yul-mist-toner) \\- simple basic mist, it only has five ingredients. I didn't really expect much from it and it didn't really do much for me. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-toner-essence) \\- there's not much viscosity to this toner, it's pretty much water-like. If you're into minimal ingredients and eastern herbal medicine kinda vibe then you'll like this. It's not terrible, not great. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*Pyunkang Yul ACNE Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-yul-acne-toner) \\- if there had to be one toner I'd recommend from the Pyunkang Yul line it'd be this one. At least it has some botanical extracts that will help your skin along with niacinamide. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [Missha Time Revolution Clear Toner](https://incidecoder.com/products/missha-time-revolution-clear-toner) \\- this has been discontinued, but I liked it has a morning cleansing toner. \n* [*klairs Fundamental Ampoule Mist*](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-fundamental-ampoule-mist) \\- i enjoyed this mist, it sits in a base of green tea and contains a bunch of skin soothing ingredients. The actual mister itself was alright, it didn't produce the best misting experience. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-supple-preparation-facial-toner) \\- another cult favourite. This is probably the most viscous toners I've ever tried. I probably would prefer the essential oil free version of this much more, but regardless, I still think it's a good hydrating toner to slap on. Alcohol and fragrance free. \n* [*By Wishtrend Mandelic Acid 5% Skin Prep Water*](https://incidecoder.com/products/by-wishtrend-mandelic-acid-5-skin-prep-water) \\- this was a pretty good exfoliating toner, mandelic acid is one of the gentler AHAs to begin with and having it at 5% makes it super gentle I feel. If you're wanting to dip your toes into AHA and exfoliating, this is probably a good place to start. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. This looks like it's been reformulated once, to remove the hydrolyzed collagen to make this product vegan. \n* [*Son & Park Beauty Water*](https://incidecoder.com/products/son-park-beauty-water) \\- i do not like this product. I know it's a cult favourite but even then it's kinda just meh in my eyes. Fragrance free. \n* [*I'm From Rice Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/im-from-rice-toner) \\- this is basically the Laneige Cream Skin, but the rice version, if that makes sense. They're both more moisturizing than hydrating. The only con with this toner is that it requires you to shake it before each use to make sure everything is emulsified together. Overall a good choice if you're someone who is lazy with skincare, since this and the Laneige Cream Skin is a multi-step product. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Innisfree Artichoke Layering Light Skin*](https://incidecoder.com/products/innisfree-artichoke-layering-light-skin) \\- this product has been discontinued. Didn't hate this product, just a simple watery toner to layer.\n* [*Papa Recipe Eggplant Clearing Skin*](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_248d341348.html) \\- i just don't like anything from this line. I feel like it didn't really do anything for my skin, I'm probably more harsh on products that claim to help with acne as a person who suffers from acne myself. Fragrance and essential oil free. \n* [*Etude House Soonjung pH 5.5 Relief Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/etude-house-soonjung-ph5-5-relief-toner) \\- if you're looking for some basic products, for some basic skin or introductory products into skincare, I fully believe the Soonjung line is perfect for that. I also believe this now comes in a jumbo size (350ml?). Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Round Lab 1025 Dokdo Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/round-lab-1025-dokdo-toner-2) \\- this is what I use on a daily basis now as a morning wiping toner. It's gentle enough to wipe away the dirt without stripping the skin. Alternatively I also think it's hydrating enough to be used as a toner that you pat into the skin. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Innisfree Blueberry Rebalancing Skin*](https://incidecoder.com/products/innisfree-blueberry-rebalancing-skin) \\- i probably would like this toner a lot more if it didn't contain essential oils. It's a milky looking toner, but it's not moisturizing as the Laneige or I'm From toner. Alcohol and fragrance free. \n* [*Cosrx Centella Water Alcohol-Free Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-centella-water-alcohol-free-toner) \\- i mean, this was whatever. It's a very basic mist toner, and to be honest, probably didn't do much for my skin. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*Natural Pacific (Nacific) Real Floral Toner Calendula*](https://incidecoder.com/products/nacific-real-floral-toner-calendula) \\- i wasn't really expecting much with this toner, but it kinda proved me wrong. While I think the calendula petals in the actual bottle is kinda of a gimmick it did soothe my skin and feel rather nice on my face. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*TonyMoly The Black Tea London Classic Toner*](https://incidecoder.com/products/tony-moly-the-black-tea-london-classic-toner) \\- this was oddly viscous somehow, it's probably due to the cyclomethicone being in there. That being said, I didn't really enjoy this toner either. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [*Cosrx One Step Moisture Up Pad*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-one-step-moisture-up-pad) \\- i've also tried the original pads from cosrx and I gotta say, I just don't like pads. I think they're overpriced for what they are. The only pro is that they're good for travel. Other than that I'm just not on the pad hype train. Alcohol and fragrance free. \n\n**First Essences:**\n\n* [*Secret Key Starting Treatment Essence (Rose Edition)*](https://incidecoder.com/products/secret-key-starting-treatment-essence-rose-edition) \\- simple ingredient list, no fuss, and somewhat affordable. Now does the rose ingredients in here really make a difference, probably not, but this has a cleaner ingredient list than the standard one. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Scinic First Treatment Essence*](https://incidecoder.com/products/scinic-first-treatment-essence) \\- if you're looking to delve into this whole fermented first essence experience. Scinic is probably the best one to start off with, simple ingredient list and affordable. \n* *the Saem The Essential Glactomyces First Essence* \\- it looks like they renewed the packaging for this and it now comes in a reddish purple bottle. The ingredients look the same though it's just 100% galactomyces ferment filtrate. Regardless, this felt oddly greasy? Maybe it's because it's just that one ingredient but it felt greasy and weird to me. Hard pass. Alcohol, fragrance, essential oil free. \n* *Missha Time Revolution The First Treatment Essence (Intensive Moist & Intensive)* \\- not really a reason for me to go into this as they renew the formula every two years or so. The Intensive Moist and Intensive versions have been discontinued. And yes, I did buy the Line Friends edition simply because it looked so cute. \n* [*Benton Fermentation Essence*](https://incidecoder.com/products/benton-fermentation-essence) \\- so, why is this only 100ml? Feels kinda overpriced for what it is. Regardless, I wouldn't really suggest this unless you really want to try it or you're a Benton diehard fan. Looks like it's been reformulated. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*Missha Time Revolution The First Treatment Essence Homme*](https://incidecoder.com/products/missha-time-revolution-homme-the-first-treatment-essence-200ml) \\- gasp, a male marketed product? The only reason I wanted to try this instead of the regular current version was that it contains more volume, it didn't come in a glass bottle because I drop shit all the time, and it looked like it was formulated for more oily skin. In the end, this was just whatever for me. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Missha Time Revolution Artemisia Treatment Essence*](https://incidecoder.com/products/missha-time-revolution-artemisia-treatment-essence) \\- ok this product is a hit. I really like this product and if you're someone who can't stand traditional eastern medicinal scent, I don't really think you'll like this. But I love how this smells and to be honest, it's probably why I like it so much. Alcohol, fragrance, essential oil free.\n* [*I'm From Mugwort Essence*](https://incidecoder.com/products/im-from-mugwort-essence) \\- basically the same thing as the Missha one, but I prefer the Missha one because it's cheaper and the scent in the Missha one is stronger for some reason most likely because Missha ferments the extract? Who knows. Alcohol, fragrance, essential oil free.\n* [*su:m37 Secret Essence*](https://incidecoder.com/products/su-m37-su-m37-secret-programming-essence) \\- i don't think this is worth it, it's so expensive and ingredient list is like 50+. Plus there's a shit ton of EO in this product. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n\n**Serums:**\n\n* [*Hado Labo Gokujyun Premium*](https://incidecoder.com/products/hada-labo-gokujyun-premium) \\- so i'm sure everyone and their mom has tried something from Hado Labo at this point. If you're looking for something that is hydrating and affordable and that will help with inner dryness, this is the product for you. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free. \n* [*Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-advanced-snail-96-mucin-power-essence) \\- if you want to try something with snail in it just get this. Probably the most affordable one out of the bunch, probably the best one on the market still. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Mizon Snail Repair Intensive Ampoule*](https://incidecoder.com/products/mizon-snail-repair-intensive-ampoule) \\- i feel like this is another OG AB cult favourite. I mean compared to the COSRX one this one is whatever. It does contain peptides but for the price and the size it comes in, I rather just purchase the COSRX one. Fragrance and essential oil free.\n* *Missha Time Revolution Night Repair Science Activator Borabit Ampoule* \\- some of these product names are so goddamn long. Anyways this is discontinued, I believe the new ampoule is much more thicker and has prebiotics in the formula now. I also think they added EO to the new ampoule. \n* [*Skin1004 Madagascar Centella-Asiatica 100*](https://incidecoder.com/products/skin1004-madagascar-centella-asiatica-100-ampoule) \\- this product has been repackaged but the ingredients are the same, just 100% centella extract. To be honest I did enjoy this product and it's quite affordable. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Purito Centella Green Level Buffet Serum*](https://incidecoder.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-buffet-serum-3) \\- for what it is, it's fine. Probably go get the unscented version since the scent is quite strong. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [*Niod Multi-Molecular Hyaluronic Acid Complex*](https://incidecoder.com/products/niod-multi-molecular-hyaluronic-complex-2-mmhc2) \\- this is expensive. I rather much prefer the Marine Hyaluronics from The Ordinary. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*klairs Midnight blue Youth Activating Drop*](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-midnight-blue-youth-activating-drop-3) \\- this is tiny and expensive. I like how it's a pretty blue colour, but to be honest, the size of it doesn't warrant the price. Also I had a terrible experience getting this item from Wishtrend when they had a whole batch of it go bad because it was stored at the wrong temperature. \n* [*Niod Survival 0*](https://incidecoder.com/products/niod-survival-0-2018) \\- i actually like this product! I think the orange tint that it comes in is a pit off-putting but it doesn't leave any stains or transfer or have any tint whatsoever. I think it pairs pretty well with any vitamin c product. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free\n* [*The Ordinary Marine Hyaluronics*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-marine-hyaluronics) \\- is it weird that I like the smell of this? Regardless, I do prefer this much more than the traditional HA that The Ordinary also offers. I really don't see much difference with this and the MMHC2 from Niod. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free\n* [*The Ordinary Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-alpha-arbutin-2-ha) \\- i rather much prefer the vitamin c + alpha arbutin. This by itself is quite redundant IMO. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free\n* [*The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-niacinamide-10-zinc-1) \\- ok so this isn't the most cosmetically elegant and the formula is rather basic, but I'm not going to spend basically $60 CAD for the Paula's Choice one. I will admit the PC one is much more easier to apply, but I'm cheap. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Ordinary Buffet*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-buffet) \\- this didn't really wow me, I think it's a good basic anti-aging serum.  Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Ordinary Resveratrol 3% + Ferulic Acid 3%*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-resveratrol-3-ferulic-acid-3) \\- i just mixed this in with my vitamin c to give it an additional boost, because it's sitting in a base of propanediol it doesn't give it an oily feeling, but most of TO products come sitting in a base of that. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n\n**Vitamin-C:**\n\n* [*Drunk Elephant C-Firma Day Serum*](https://incidecoder.com/products/drunk-elephant-c-firma-day-serum) \\- i kinda don't get the hype over DE? I mean this was nice, but I don't think it warrants the price, plus because this uses l-ascorbic acid and it's water based it oxidizes pretty quickly, regardless of the packaging. I think there are better options out there for the fraction of the price. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-100-l-ascorbic-acid-powder) \\- i mean this was ok, but you can purchase bulk vitamin c powder online and do the exact same thing but cheaper? I guess this is for people who rather just mix their vitamin c into a toner or serum and call it day. I will say that this did sting the most out of all the vitamin c I've used, probably because you know, it's straight up vitamin c powder and the measuring spoon isn't the best. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Ordinary Ascorbyl Glucoside 12%*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-ascorbyl-glucoside-solution-12) \\- i believe this is the only vitamin c TO offers that sits in a base of water. Regardless, this is a derivative of vitamin c so it doesn't offer the powerful punch that traditional vitamin c offers. But I did like it texturally compared to the others, since this doesn't sit in a base of propanediol. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Ole Henriksen Truth Serum*](https://incidecoder.com/products/olehenriksen-truth-serum) \\- i got ths as a gift so... yeah. I really don't like this. Alcohol free.\n* [*It's Skin Power 10 Formula VC Effector*](https://incidecoder.com/products/its-skin-power-10-formula-vc-effector) \\- this was also meh, pass. Alcohol and essential oil free. \n* [*Rohto Mentholatum Melano CC*](https://incidecoder.com/products/rohto-mentholatum-melano-cc-vitamin-c-essence) \\- so this is another cult favourite, while I did enjoy this, I kinda hate the packaging? I understand it's to keep the vitamin c from oxidizing, but I got a big face so I need a lot of this for my face so having to wait for each single drop to come out is a bit annoying. The amount is also quite small sitting at 20ml. Alcohol and essential oil free.\n* [*goodal green tangerine vita C dark spot serum*](https://incidecoder.com/products/goodal-green-tangerine-vita-c-dark-spot-serum) \\-  i think korea is just getting into vitamin c since I do see new products with actual l-ascorbic acid instead of citrus fruit punch with some derivatives sprinkled in there. This is citrus fruit punch and it's full of EO, so I wouldn't really recommend this. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [klairs Freshly Juiced Vitamin Drop](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-freshly-juiced-vitamin-drop) \\- so this would be a fine beginner vitamin c serum but it does also contain EO. Also the packaging isn't UV resistant so you need to keep this somewhere dark and away from sunlight. Probably better options out there if you're wanting to try vitamin C. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n\n**Retinols**:\n\n* [*Differin Gel*](https://incidecoder.com/products/differin-differin-gel) \\-  so as someone who has been on accutane three times (and a bunch of other drugs), Differin is a godsend. I know La Roche Posay now offers their version which is cheaper than Diffferin, and you can get a higher concentration of adapalene if you get a prescription. While this doesn't clear my acne 100% it's removed probably around 90% of it. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Life-flo Retinol A 1% Advanced Revitalization Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/life-flo-retinol-a-1-advanced-revitalization-cream) \\- so I bought this to see if it would help with my KP on my arms, didn't do jack shit. Unfortunately I've come to realize that severe KP is untreatable. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-granactive-retinoid-2-emulsion) \\- i prefer this the most when it comes to TO and their retinoid line. Since granactive retinoid is so new I'm not really sure if it doesn't much like tretinion and other vitamin a derivatives, but it is a moisturizing emulsion if anything. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 5% in Squalane*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-granactive-retinoid-5-in-squalane) \\- yeah the emulsion is better. I also cannot stand squalane oil for some reason. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n\n**Other Actives(?)**:\n\n* [*cosrx AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-aha-7-whitehead-power-liquid) \\- so I'm not sure what it is, but my skin does not agree with any of the cosrx chemical exfoliants. This and the BHA one made me breakout, and I've used other AHA/BHA products before. Regardless, I resorted to using this on my arms (for my KP), didn't really do much for the KP. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-bha-blackhead-power-liquid-4) \\- read above. Also this doesn't even contain any saliycylic acid so... yeah no. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Solution - it looks like this product is going through reformulation currently. I'm using the Paula's Choice BHA Liquid right now and I prefer the PC one more, even if it's more expensive. \n* Benzoyl Peroxide - i mean this is just 5% benzoyl peroxide I get from my drug store. I am a strong believer of pairing benzoyl peroxide with other acne medication to make sure you're doubling down on the acne. \n\n**Oils**:\n\n* [*The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-100-plant-derived-squalane) \\- look i'm not the best person to review oils, since I still have generally quite oily skin. If anything oils usually get mixed into my body moisturizer to give more occlusivity. Also I hate the feeling of squalane for some reason. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Ordinary 100% Organic Cold-Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-100-organic-cold-pressed-rose-hip-seed-oil) \\- so I bought this because people kept saying rose hip oil is good for hyperpigmentation, but yeah, my face couldn't handle the oily feeling so it went straight on my body! Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Drunk Elephant Virgin Marula Luxury Facial Oil*](https://incidecoder.com/products/drunk-elephant-virgin-marula-luxury-facial-oil) \\- ok why does this cost so much? I've heard this feels much more lighter than other marula oils but still, this costs an arm and a leg. Probably not really worth it. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n\n**Moisturizers**:\n\n* [*cosrx Oil-Free Ultra-Moisturizing Lotion*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-oil-free-ultra-moisturizing-lotion-with-birch-sap) \\- i don't really like this. It was fine? But now that I found another birch juice/sap moisturizer that one is 100% better than this one. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [*The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-natural-moisturizing-factors-ha) \\- look, you cannot fault this product as it is extremely cheap ($5 for 100ml during this year's Black Friday sale), and the ingredients are decent. If you're looking for a basic moisturizer, just get this one. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Papa Recipe Eggplant Clearing Emulsion*](https://incidecoder.com/products/papa-recipe-eggplant-clearing-emulsion) \\- yeah no I really don't like this line. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*cosrx Aloe Vera Oil-Free Moisture Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-aloe-vera-oil-free-moisture-cream) \\- probably better to just get an aloe vera gel if you're eyeing at this product. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*klairs Rich Moist Soothing Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-rich-moist-soothing-cream) \\- i found this too heavy for my skin, plus it's filled with EO. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [*klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-midnight-blue-calming-cream-8) \\- now this cream was much better for me. While I believe it's supposed to be used a spot treatment to calm down irritated skin, I just used this all over. I also believe there is a tube format of this now if you hate jar packaging. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Mizon Black Snail All In One Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/mizon-black-snail-aio-cream) \\- not much to say about this cream, didn't really stand out to me. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/round-lab-birch-juice-moisturizing-cream) \\- k this is really good. If you have oily skin, I really recommend this. It kinda feels like you're applying water because the cream just melts and sinks in immediately. It's extremely hydrating and perfect for oily skin as it doesn't feel too occlusive or leave any stickiness. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Benton Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel*](https://incidecoder.com/products/benton-aloe-propolis-soothing-gel) \\- i mean this is a decent aloe gel, I just don't think I'm a fan of aloe gels in general as it leaves a sticky feeling behind. This would probably be best if you are sunburnt as it as a nice cooling effect on the skin. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*The Inkey List Multi-Biotic*](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-inkey-list-multi-biotic) \\- this stinks, so if you do not like your moisturizer smelling like basically yogurt, then pass this one. I found it quite cool and tolerable. The scent doesn't 100% disappear but it doesn't linger if that makes sense. You really have to smell hard to actually smell it after applying it. This was just ok for me. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Dr. G RED Blemish Clear Soothing Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/dr-g-red-blemish-clear-soothing-cream) \\- this is really highly ranked of Hwahae so I decided to try it. I found it alright as it was occlusive but not pore clogging feeling, while it's not the most hydrating this is probably better for dryer skin types as it provides that nice seal. As for decreasing redness, I didn't really see much of a difference. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Pyunkang Yul ACNE Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-yul-acne-cream) \\- didn't really do much for my acne but it is a nice gel moisturizer, not something really rave about though. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [cosrx Centella Blemish Cream](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-centella-blemish-cream) \\- i've recommended this to so many people. I feel like this is really soothes my acne or makes them completely disappear if they're non-cystic ones. I've emptied countless jars of this and I always have one of these on me at all times. Alcohol and fragrance free.\n* [*Ole Henriksen Sheer Transformation Perfecting Moisturizer*](https://incidecoder.com/products/olehenriksen-sheer-transformation-r-perfecting-moisturizer) \\- i don't hate this surprisingly? What really shocked me was that this was EO and fragrance free unlike their truth serum. I think this is a good morning moisturizer to pair with your vitamin c as it does contain a handful of antioxidants. A little also goes a long way as it spreads pretty well. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Drunk Elephant Lala Retro Whipped Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/drunk-elephant-lala-retro-whipped-cream) \\- i am probably the worst person to ask about DE. But once again I didn't like this product. It probably was too rich for my oily skin, I just really can't stomach the prices of their products. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Benton Fermentation Eye Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/benton-fermentation-eye-cream-2) \\- i'm not really a believer in eye cream so I'm probably the worst person to review this, but yeah, this didn't really change my thoughts on eye creams. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n\n**Sunscreens**:\n\n* *CeraVe Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 50 Body Lotion* \\- i think this has been discontinued as I can't find it anywhere, but this was not it. It states to have invisible zinc technology but it was still so pasty and white. I'm only tossing this because I'm pretty sure it's passed the use by date. \n* [*Murad City Skin Age Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 50 PA++++*](https://incidecoder.com/products/murad-city-skin-age-defense-broad-spectrum-spf-50-pa) \\- so this uses zinc oxide and titanium dioxide as it's filter. It's a pretty elegant physical sunscreen if you can look past the price. I think the tint helps it so that it doesn't have a white cast, at least on my skin tone. You gotta shake this before using this. One downside to this sunscreen is that it does feel greasy for me, and it's not water/sweat resistant so it will rub off with the tint. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*Troiareuke Acsen U.V Protector Essence SPF 50+ PA+++*](https://incidecoder.com/products/ascen-uv-protector-essence) \\- combinational sunscreen that uses octinoxate, homosalate, octisalate, tinosorb s, titanium dioxide, Univul T 150 as it's filters. The only gripe I have with this is that it does contain fragrance. It's pretty expensive as well. Alcohol and essential oil free.\n* [*klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50+ PA ++++*](https://incidecoder.com/products/klairs-soft-airy-uv-essence-spf50-pa) \\- so this is awkward. With the whole Purito thing has shaked things up and a lot of Korean sunscreens are now under investigation for having lower than advertised SPF ratings. Univul A Plus and Univul T 150 are the filters for this sunscreen and to be honest since they've stopped the sale of this sunscreen and I'm not sure what will happen to it. We'll see how things end up with this whole debacle but I did enjoy using this if that matters at all.\n* *innisfree perfect UV protection cream triple care SPF 50+ PA+++* \\-  this has been discontinued, but god roadshop brands have the worst fragrances. I'm pretty sure I gave up using this because I could not handle the fragrance. \n* *Mamonde Everyday Aqua Sun Cream SPF 50+ PA++++* \\- again, the fragrance, why. This also has been discontinued. \n* *innisfree Blueberry Rebalancing Watery Sun Cream SPF37 PA+++* \\- so this has been reformulated and repackaged, I believe it's now SPF 45 PA+++. I don't the SPF increase really changed much in the formula, it uses titanium dioxide only. But it does have EO. Also shake the product before using it. \n* [*innisfree The minimum sun cream SPF 25 PA++*](https://incidecoder.com/products/innisfree-the-minimum-sun-cream-spf25-pa) \\- so, idk why I got this sunscreen. Because I think this is either meant for babies or people with extremely sensitive skin. Either way, if you're either of those, probably one to pick up. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* *Missha all-around Safe Block Mild Sun SPF 30 PA++* \\- this has been discontinued as well, once again, not sure why I got this. As it's pretty low protection and is probably meant for babies or people with extremely sensitive skin. \n* [*Etude House UV Double Cut Fresh Sun Gel SPF 50+ PA ++++*](https://incidecoder.com/products/etude-house-uv-double-cut-fresh-sun-gel-spf50-pa) \\- this one has a more tolerable fragrance but it's still not great. If you're ok with EO, alcohol and fragrance in your sunscreen then go ahead. It's inexpensive and does provide good coverage as it uses octinoxate, homosalate, octisalate, Unival A Plus, and Univul T 150. But I really just wish brands would stop putting fragrance in their sunscreens, I'm fine with mine smelling like chemicals. \n* *Hyggee Chu Chu Sun Pact SPF43 PA+++* \\- discontinued and yes I did buy it because Pucca was on it. \n\n**Body Care**:\n\n* [*CeraVe Moisuturizing Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cerave-moisturizing-cream) \\- i'm pretty sure everyone has tried this before. To me, I think any old body moisturizer performs just as well as this one. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*CeraVe Renewing SA Cream*](https://incidecoder.com/products/cerave-renewing-sa-cream) \\- so apparently this is supposedly too high of a pH for the salicylic acid to do much, according to Beautypedia. I bought this in hopes to combat my KP, but it didn't really do much. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*illiyoon ceramide ato 6.0 top to toe wash*](https://incidecoder.com/products/illiyoon-ceramide-ato-6-0-top-to-toe-wash) \\- i do like this body wash, it's quite gentle but it doesn't produce any lather, so if you want that bubbly foam fantasy this isn't the product for you. It leaves a film behind, which apparently is what low pH cleansers feel like? But regardless, the film isn't con as I really don't notice it after awhile. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n* [*illiyoon ultra repair moisture cleanser*](https://incidecoder.com/products/illiyoon-ultra-repair-moisture-cleanser) \\- i prefer their ato cleanser more, this has fragrance and I don't think the added oils in this formula moisturize my skin anymore than the ato one. Alcohol free.\n\n**Powders**:\n\n* [*innisfree no-sebum Mineral Powder*](https://incidecoder.com/products/innisfree-no-sebum-mineral-powder-2) \\- cult favourite, but their newer powder has won over my heart. Still this is not bad as a mattifying powder. Alcohol and essential oil free.\n* [*innisfree Pore Blur Powder*](https://incidecoder.com/products/innisfree-pore-blur-powder) \\- so this is like a better version of the no-sebum powder. It also doesn't include fragrance! Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.\n\n**Masks**:\n\n* [*I'm From Mugwort Mask*](https://incidecoder.com/products/im-from-mugwort-mask) \\- this mask is great for cooling the skin down, also I'm addicted to the smell of mugwort so this was a dream come true. It's just a hassle to wash off as there are pieces of mugwort in this mask. Alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil free.",

If you're looking for something to reduce hyperpigmentation, that one has tranexamic acid (used for melasma in clinical settings, should similarly help with PIH in theory), tocopherol (vit E), and magnesium ascorbyl phosphate (vit C). I've been using it twice a day after cleansing (wiping my face with a rosewater toner in the morning since my skin is dry af) for the past few months and have seen a very slight difference in my hyperpigmentation after being put on epiduo and spironolactone for hormonal cystic acne. It's very light and hasn't contributed to my dryness at all.",

    "body": "as a pagod at kuripot na student, i set a resolution in 2023 to learn basic make-up and skincare routines to improve my acne and have the skills to prepare myself for events while spending minimal money on products i would purchase. with lots of help and research from this sub, i can finally say i've reached a point where i can do simple make-up for events or lakwatsas and my skin is the clearest it has been (considering my stress in med school).\n\nwith that, here is a run down of the products i use, where i bought them, and their price. most things here are under 250 pesos each and have last me a long time (4 months to 1 year). this is something i wish i had when i was just starting to out, and i hope this helps any one else beginning their routines!\n\n**skincare**\n\n* cleanser: [Dermorepubliq Clarifying Gentle Face Wash Niacinamide + Botanical Extracts - 100 mL](https://shopee.ph/Dermorepubliq-Clarifying-Gentle-Face-Wash-Niacinamide-Botanical-Extracts-100-mL-i.339409991.9155382857?xptdk=139dab8b-80d1-4bcd-bffb-b820ffc4aa49) (Php 159)\n   * i've been using this since 2021 and i'm on my fourth bottle, and i've also placed this in all the places i tend to sleep over because of how much i love it! so affordable and sulit since one bottle lasts 6 months for me when i use it twice a day. very mild and no stinging or beads that i find irritate my skin.\n* niacinamide: [Dermorepubliq 10% Niacinamide + 3% Tranexamic Acid + 2% Alpha Arbutin Ultra White Serum - 30 mL](https://shopee.ph/Dermorepubliq-10-Niacinamide-3-Tranexamic-Acid-2-Alpha-Arbutin-Ultra-White-Serum-30-mL-i.339409991.18246123152?xptdk=9b389aa6-1f53-4ffa-8c50-abc52d111143) (Php 319)\n   * started using this after my dermatologist recommended i try niacinamide to reduce my acne and i wanted an alternative to TO that was less expensive and more accessible to me since i saw here that there are so many online fakes :( this worked for me and i find it to be very mild with no stinging! already on my second bottle since i started using this in may 2022.\n   * i previously used [Dermorepubliq 5% Niacinamide + Hyaluronic Acid Sensitive Skin Formula Serum - 30 mL](https://shopee.ph/Dermorepubliq-5-Niacinamide-Hyaluronic-Acid-Sensitive-Skin-Formula-Serum-30-mL-i.339409991.8964357378?xptdk=b75f2d68-5b79-4cc9-9dd9-d2b1cbda5479) (Php 215) however i find that the 10% one helps me control my acne better and improves my skin texture\n* vitamin C: [Dermorepubliq 15% L-Ascorbic Acid + E + Ferulic Acid Brightening Formula Serum - 30 mL](https://shopee.ph/Dermorepubliq-15-L-Ascorbic-Acid-E-Ferulic-Acid-Brightening-Formula-Serum-30-mL-i.339409991.18925260092?sp_atk=dbf1fa1e-493c-4a5d-9861-1cc09d15822f&xptdk=dbf1fa1e-493c-4a5d-9861-1cc09d15822f) (Php 279)\n   * bought this after i became conscious of my small bumps and acne marks + wanted to reduce the effects of stress on my face. i've noticed my face become softer since using and has overall contributed to controlling my breakouts. still on my first bottle since starting in august 2023, so very sulit talaga.\n* \"moisturizer\": [Apollo Petroleum Jelly - 200g](https://shopee.ph/Apollo-Petroleum-Jelly-200G-i.267163785.7736323626?sp_atk=76b0849b-dd46-4840-bf3b-4bf4c0e63fed&xptdk=76b0849b-dd46-4840-bf3b-4bf4c0e63fed) (Php 200)\n   * in quotation marks since this isn't really a moisturizer but i find it to be genuinely helpful in preventing dryness. started using this after my face got so dry nung naging aircon na lahat ng classrooms namin, especially around my nose and lip area. i no longer have cracking or peeling skin in those areas.\n   * i also use this in my elbows and arms since those parts are often very dry too for me.\n   * bought in grocery store, added link lang for accessibility!\n* sunscreen: [Biore UV Watery Essence - 70g](https://www.watsons.com.ph/biore-uv-watery-essence-70g/p/BP_50033601) (Php 450-Php 557)\n   * i'm not very picky with sun screen but this works for me, has no stinging or burning, and doesn't cook my face under the sun! i like the gel formula and it's the right amount of liquid and sticky to me. i also use this under my makeup as a primer and it keeps everything in place naman with no white cast (prior to this i used YOU sunscreen which gave me a white cast whoops)\n   * tip-id: found this to be cheaper in S&R than in Watson's (less than Php 500)\n\n**make-up**\n\n* concealer and color corrector: [The Saem Perfection Tip Concealer SPF28 - 6.5g in 1.75, 3.0, and Green](https://shopee.ph/product/153457773/5117421781?d_id=348fe&fbclid=IwAR2rYj55V1DITWCl-fU-Bns09-uwaMiDutM_s86caKTiE35z8ARECc1YmsM&uls_trackid=4vcpvqfb00m8&utm_content=iUwRmujgyXCeoT3BV228LmPXNhm) (Php 195)\n   * i know their shade range isn't the best, but if it suits you, i highly recommend this brand for their affordability and medium coverage that isn't too heavy, even during super humid season. i use the shade 1.75 which i bought from this shop for most of the year. i'm still using the same bottle i bought in january 2023 to this day since i still have a lot huhu\n   * i also bought the 3.0 to mix with the 1.75 nung nangitim ako during the summer.\n   * i also use their green color corrector for the redness around my nose and pimple marks. i've considered buying their pink color corrector but i think it won't help with my eyebags hahaha\n   * tip-id: before committing to buying this, i tested out their sample in store on the back of my hand HAHAHAHA 350 sya sa store fsr kaya sa shopee na lang lmao\n* blush: Clinique Chubby Stick in Robust Rhubarb (Php 1557)\n   * the only expensive thing on this whole list kasi binigay lang to sa akin ng balikbayan kong tita slay po tita!!!\n   * i prefer using cream blushes in general para portable and on the go, madali dalhin and i just use my fingers to apply. i honestly recommend this for beginners kasi i find it to be more stressful to use powder blushes that can crack or break and to use a whole brush since i'm more prone to breakouts when i use a make-up brush.\n   * been using this for over 3 years and i still have a lot, so worth it pa rin. [link to a shop here in the Ph that sells it](https://www.cosmeticsnow.ph/iteminfo/clinique-chubby-stick-cheeks-colour-balm-no02-robust-rhubarb-6g)\n* eyeliner: Eyeliner Stamp\n   * tbh binigay lang din ito ni mamshie dearest <33 she mothered fr.

    "body": "Without question the go-to disease to defend vaccines is polio. \n\nCoincidently it's also the greatest lie and medical con job of all time. \n\nToxins causing \"Polio\" are well documented. Polio is the virus that never was. Sound familiar? This does not mean the C19 virus doesn't exist, don't mix words but keep reading, if you dont read all of it dont bother commenting.\n\n1824: Metal workers had suffered for centuries from a paralysis similar to polio caused by the lead and arsenic in the metals they were working with. \n\nEnglish scientist John Cooke observed:\n>'The fumes from these metals, or the receptance of them in solution into the stomach, often causes paralysis.'\n\n1890: Lead arsenate pesticide started to be sprayed in the US up to 12 times every summer to kill codling moth on apple crops.\n\n1892: Polio outbreaks began to occur in Vermont, an apple growing region. In his report, the Government Inspector Dr. Charles Caverly, noted that parents reported that some children fell ill after eating fruit. \n\nHe stated that \n>’infantile paralysis usually occurred in families with more than one child, and as no efforts were made at isolation it was very certain it was non-contagious' (with only one child in the family having been struck).\n\n1907: Calcium arsenate comes into use primarily on cotton crops.\n\n1908: In a Massachusetts town with three cotton mills and apple orchards, 69 children suddenly fell ill with infantile paralysis.\n\n1909: The UK bans apple imports from the States because of heavy lead arsenate residues.\n\n1921: Franklin D. Roosevelt develops polio after swimming in Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick. Toxicity of water may have been due to pollution run-off.\n\n1943: DDT is introduced, a neurotoxic pesticide. Over the next several years it comes into widespread use in American households. For example, wall paper impregnated with DDT was placed in children's bedrooms.\n\n1943: A polio epidemic in the UK town of Broadstairs, Kent is linked to a local dairy where cows were washed down with DDT.\n\n1944: Albert Sabin reports that a major cause of sickness and death of American troops based in the Philippines was poliomyelitis. US military camps there were sprayed daily with DDT to kill mosquitoes. Neighboring Philippine settlements were not affected.\n\n1944: NIH reports that DDT damages the same anterior horn cells that are damaged in infantile paralysis.\n\n1946: Gebhaedt shows polio seasonality correlates with fruit harvest.\n\n1949: Endocrinologist Dr Morton Biskind, a practitioner and medical researcher, found that DDT causes\n>'lesions in the spinal cord similar to human polio.'\n\n1950: US Public Health Industrial Hygiene Medical Director, J.G. Townsend, notes the similarity between parathion poisoning and polio and believes that some polio might be caused by eating fruits or vegetables with parathion residues.\n\n1951: Dr. Biskind treats his polio patients as poisoning victims, removing toxins from food and environment, especially DDT contaminated milk and butter. \n\nDr. Biskind writes: \n>'Although young animals are more susceptible to the effects of DDT than adults, so far as the available literature is concerned, it does not appear that the effects of such concentrations on infants and children have even been considered.'\n\n1949-1951: Other doctors report they are having success treating polio with anti toxins used to treat poisoning, dimercaprol and ascorbic acid. \n\nExample: Dr. F. R. Klenner reported: \n>’In the poliomyelitis epidemic in North Carolina in 1948 60 cases of this disease came under our care. The treatment was massive doses of vitamin C every two to four hours. Children up to four years received vitamin C injection intramuscularly. All patients were clinically well after 72 hours.'\n\n1950: Dr. Biskind presents evidence to the US Congress that pesticides were the major cause of polio epidemics. He is joined by Dr. Ralph Scobey who reported he found clear evidence of poisoning when analyzing chemical traces in the blood of polio victims.\n\n*Comment: This was a no no. The viral causation theory was not something to be questioned. The careers of prominent virologists and health authorities were threatened. Biskind and Scobey's ideas were subjected to ridicule.* Sound familiar?\n\n1953: Clothes are moth-proofed by washing them in EQ-53, a formula containing DDT.\n\n1953: Dr. Biskind writes: \n>’It was known by 1945 that DDT was stored in the body fat of mammals and appears in their milk, yet far from admitting a causal relationship between DDT and polio that is so obvious, which in any other field of biology would be instantly accepted, virtually the entire apparatus of communication, lay and scientific alike, has been devoted to denying, concealing, suppressing, distorting and attempts to convert into its opposite this overwhelming evidence. Libel, slander, and economic boycott have not been overlooked in this campaign.'\n\n1954: Legislation recognizing the dangers of persistent pesticides is enacted, and a phase out of DDT in the US accelerates along with a shift of sales of DDT to third world countries.\n\n*Note that DDT is phased out at the same time as widespread polio vaccinations begin. Saying that, polio cases sky rocket only in communities that accept the polio vaccine, as the polio vaccine is laced with heavy metals and other toxins, so the paralysis narrative starts all over again. As the polio vaccines cause huge spikes in polio, the misinformed public demand more polio vaccine and the cycle spirals skyward exponentially*\n\n1956: the American Medical Association mandated that all licensed medical doctors could no longer classify polio as polio. All polio diagnosis would be rejected in favor of Guillian-Barre Syndrome, AFP (acute flaccid paralysis), Bell's Palsy, Cerebral Palsy, ALS, (Lou-Gehrig's Disease), MS, MD etc etc. This sleight of hand was fabricated with the sole intent of giving the public the impression that the polio vaccine was successful at decreasing polio or eradicating polio. The public bought this hook, line and sinker and to this very day, many pro vaccine arguments are ignited by the manufactured lie regarding the polio vaccine eradicating polio.\n\n1962: Rachel Carson's Silent Spring is published.\n\n1968: DDT registration cancelled for the US.\n\n2008: Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) is still a raging in many parts of the world where pesticide use is high, and DDT is still used. AFP. MS, MD, Bell's Palsy, cerebral palsy, ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease), Guillian-Barre are all catch basket diagnosis, all similar in symtpoms, tied to heavy metal poisoning and high toxic load.\n\nConclusion: Modern belief that polio is caused by a virus is an ongoing tragedy for the children of the world. Public funds are wasted on useless and dangerous vaccines when the children could be treated with antitoxins. A call into failing vaccine mythology is warranted, as is a complete investigation of the real agenda being executed against humanity involving science, chemicals, vaccines, the medical field in general, and the government.",

You simply take a bunch of diseases and put them under one heading, and then claim that one virus is responsible for it.”** ^3\n\nEtienne de Harven, MD states:\n\n“…**we all have to, courageously, face the fact that the very existence of an exogenous HIV has never been scientifically verified.”** ^4\n\nDr. David Rasnick:\n\n**“(PCR tests) They’re very effective at fueling a phony viral pandemic. They’re very effective at doing that.”** ^5\n\n**“AIDS was the first big viral scam.** AIDS is not contagious, not sexually transmitted, not caused by a virus, it did not start in Africa. And the official policy is it’s incurable. None of those things are true. **Anthony Fauci was the driver of this whole scam.”**\n^6:30-6:50\n\n**“What ABC needs to do,” says Mullis, “is talk to Fauci and** [Gallo](https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9F0CEFDA103DF932A05751C1A964958260.html) **and show that they’re assholes, which I could do in ten minutes.”** ^6\n\n**“All kinds of diseases started coming into the AIDS family, faster than anyone should’ve been comfortable with, really.

        "body": "Truth\nIn 1954 the diagnostic criteria for polio was changed.\n\nQuote Below from [1962 Congressional Hearings on Mandatory Polio Vaccination](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Hearings/VJHpAAAAMAAJ?hl=en)\n\n^^^  Click the blue text for link to source\n\n\"\"Prior to 1954 the crieria of diagnosis at that time in most health departments followed the World Health Organization definition: \"Spinal paralytic poliomyelitis: signs and symptoms of nonparalytic poliomyelitis with the addition of partial or complete paralysis of one or more muscle groups, detected on two examinations at least 24 hours apart.\" \n\nNote that “ two examinations at least 24 hours apart\" was all that was required. Laboratory confirmation and presence of residual paralysis was not required . In 1955 the criteria were changed to conform more closely to the definition used in the 1954 field trials : residual paralysis was determined 10 to 20 days after onset of illness and again 50 to 70 days after onset. The influence of the field trials is still evident in most health departments ; unless there is residual involvement at least 60 days after onset, a case of poliomyelitis is not considered paralytic\"\n\nPolio vaccines were not the success we have been led to believe.\n\nAnother quote from the same hearing.\n\nHistory sure does repeat itself:\r\n\n\"Dr. MEIER. The thing that impresses me most about this question of polio vac cine is a problem that has been discussed only by indirection. How is it that today you hear from members of this panel that the Salk vaccine situation is confused ; yet what everybody knows from reading the newspapers, and has known since the vaccine was introduced, is that the situation as far as the Salk vaccine is concerned was and is marvelous ? The reason for this discrepancy lies, I think,in a new attitude of many public health and publicity men . It is hard to convince\r\nthe public that something is good. Consequently, the best way to push forward a new program is to decide on what you think the best decision is and not ques tion it thereafter, and further, not to raise questions before the public or expose the public to open discussion of the issues.\"",

He had the holo-record right in front of him. He scratched the control screen one more time just to be sure of what he was seeing. It was a fairly simple situation on the fringes of the air mass.\n\nThe human had been on duty in the supply bay. It had been his job to fill all material requests for the base. Humans were exceptionally well adapted for this duty. Their height alone made working in the warehouses an easy matter for them. Their truly terrifying compressive strength meant that they ignored the lifting machines most of the time in favor of manually filling the orders. They were more likely to send the drones for the smaller packages than for the larger ones. Twenty Clicks had once seen a human lift an entire shelving unit full of prefabricated building cores simply to retrieve a scrap of paper that the human immediately tossed in the recycler.\n\nTwenty Clicks scratched the control again to watch the scene over, trying to understand. The human was what they called middle aged. Not yet out of his reproductive cycle but past the prime of his breeding age. His hair was beginning to thin on the top of his head in a way that made him look dull and scattered. His uniform was clean, but rumpled. He was sprawled across the chair he was nominally sitting in. He had forced two of the supports off of the ground and was bracing the unballanced position by resting his legs on a nearby storage crate. In one hand he held a data pad which the helpful AI indicated was displaying one of the popular theoretical social simulations. The other had was otherwise occupied.\n\nTwenty Clicks watched in fascination as the massive hand, easily as large as one of his wings, lifted from where it rested on the human’s thigh and drifted almost as if not under the control of the massive mammalian brain, towards the open bag of calcium citrate supplements that rested beside the human on a crate.  The hand, all the time out of range of the human’s binocular vision, drifted over and past the bag till it reached nearly the full range of the humans flexibility then drifted back and began to make short passes in the general location of the bag.\n\nThis was clearly Undulate behavior, or perhaps it would be if the Undulate was old and blinded to visible light and was feeling around for something. Yet Twenty Clicks had checked and the human had spent only a nominal amount of training time with the Undulates. What this actually resembled was the slow groping reaching of a vine type plant for some secure hold. Twenty Clicks wondered if human hands had an autonomous search function. To think of that massive crushing power under the control of plant like chemical signals was terrifying.\n\nOn the display the hand brushed over the band and flexed to reach into the interior, moving more confidently now that it had tactile information. The hand closed over what the humans called a “handful” of the supplements. Enough to supply a dozen humans for a month. However the wandering hand slowly lifted them to the human’s mouth and began pushing the mass of supplements into a mouth that opened slackly to admit them. The human chewed approximately half the mass for several moments before swallowing with a massive gulp.\n\nThe hand then pressed in the rest and even as the mouth chewed the hand drifted back down to the bag. It groped around, with slightly slower motions this time, and pulled in another handful of the supplements. This process repeated itself a few dozen time until the bag was empty. When the hand finally found no more supplements in the bag it returned to the slack, rest position on his leg. It rested there for several moments.\n\nHowever the inevitable consequence of ingesting that much calcium and ascorbic acid was quickly taking it’s tole on even the legendary metabolism of the human. His skin paled as his digestive system pulled blood to his gut to deal with the unexpected meal. The muscles around his eyes tightened  and strained for a few moments. Then his mouth contracted in a grimace. The hand busy holding the datapad gave a spasm. The guilty hand rose and clutched at the human’s abdomen over the general location of his primary stomach. He narrowed his eyes and looked down at his abdomen with a perplexed expression.\n\n“What the, ever loving-?” he muttered.\n\nHe glanced over at the empty bag of supplements and his face contorted with unease and perhaps guilt. Twenty Clicks was unsure. The human rose to his feet, staggering in place of his usual graceful movements. His guilty hand reached around to clutch his abdomen as he staggered to the comm-unit on the wall. He braced one shoulder against the wall and carefully pulled up the supplies manifest. He typed in an order for an emergency refill on the supplies, hesitated when he came to the section in the form that requested a reason, and after a moment typed in ‘accidental destruction’. The human then staggered back to his seat and collapsed in it with a groan.  He stayed there for the rest of his shift and Twenty Clicks let the recording play until it showed his own wings flitting into the storage area to request a new carry harness.\n\nHe sighed as he turned off the recording. He had of course ordered the recalcitrant human to the medical bay and the Shatar Medic on duty had soon relieved the human’s distress with an oral administered oil flush. It had seemed extreme to the Winged but the Shatar and the Human both agreed it was the safest method to cleanse his digestive tract of the calcium build up. When, after the treatment, Twenty Clicks had pressed for an explanation, the human had only shrugged.\n\n“I didn’t notice what I was doing,” he said. “It was a good book.”\n\n# [Humans are Weird](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk) [​Book Series](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)\n\n# [Amazon (Kindle, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)\n\n# [Barnes & Nobel (Nook, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/%22Humans+are+Weird%22?Ntk=P_Series_Title&Ns=P_Series_Number&Ntx=mode+matchall)\n\n# [Kobo by Rakuten (ebook and Audiobook)](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=Humans%20are%20Weird&fcsearchfield=Series&seriesId=a035ce04-e582-5fcc-b327-16c68ca4b418&fcshowpointsprice=no&fcmaxprice=5&fcminprice=0&id=1561e6f7-742f-4c1b-a804-187728814574)\n\n# [Google Play Books (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&gl=US)\n\n# Please Leave Reviews on the Newest Book!\n\n***Hey!

If the product has any water listed on the ingredients, then the vitamin c has ALL disappeared within a week of manufacturing.  \n\nThis includes that ridiculous and expensive vitamin C/ ferulic serum.  If you are seeing results from using it, those results are not from vitamin C.\n\nSome companies use a more stable form of vitamin C, such as ascorbyl acetate or other.  These are not bioavailable and are of no use to your skin.  Only L-ascorbic acid (the name for pure vit c) is bioavailable.\n\nDon't waste your money on any vitamin C skin product.\n\nBuy dry L-ascorbic acid and mix it into a base in your hand right before you apply it.\n\nYou can buy a little jar from The Ordinary or order it online.  It is preferable to get the ultrafine because it mixes and dissolves more easily than coarser powders.  Be sure to get food or pharma grade.\n\nYou can use anything, really, as the base.  I suggest a hyaluronic acid serum (cheap is ok) because it usually has a pH that works well for this.\n\nAim for 20%, by weight, but you'll have to work up to it because this is the first time you have used vitamin C on your skin.  Put a crumb of vit C into a dropperfull of serum in your hand.  It will tingle.  If it leaves you feeling burning all day, you used too much, cut back on the powder amount.\n\nThe more we do this and educate ourselves and stop buying these things, the less they will try to scam us with them.\n\nSource:  I am a chemical engineer and have worked for 30+ years in beauty product manufacturing.  I have worked with many dermatologists, including Zein Obagi and Zoe Draelos.\n\nTL/DR: Buy ultrafine powdered L-ascorbic acid and mix it into cheap hyaluronic acid serum because the vitamin c in commercial products has broken down by the time you get it",

Just use it two times more, layer it the second time to account for some lessened efficiency (according to this person).\n\nCE Ferulic by Cosmeceuticals was specifically clinically tested to prove that it’s stable and efficient. This is why it’s so expensive bc it remains the only clinically tested product on the market. Basically, the only product which efficiency was clinically proven. I don’t think people with degrees in cosmetic chemistry don’t know what they are doing. Of course, vitamin C is highly unstable and oxidises fast. But you are exaggerating things or maybe some misunderstood things. For example, many people assume that vitamin C requires low ph for it to be stable. That’s not true. They’ve used low ph in early studies to stabilise it bc they haven’t used anything else. But nowadays there is more research and more ways to stabilise it, so low ph isn’t always necessary. \n\nAs for CE Ferulic and many other similar products with pure ascorbic acid, you need to use them within one or two months after opening. And of course, keep them away from sunlight. Yes, the air will get inside anyways (there are no true airtight pumps), and they will be exposed to some sunlight when you use them but it doesn’t happen that fast. With many things in life, it’s the exact dose that matters. \n\nAnd as for those stabilised forms of vitamin C (yes, they exist), well, unfortunately many of them aren’t effective at all. But there are some which are effective and one of them is supposed to be nearly as effective as ascorbic acid although research is small (but promising). \n\nAnd if you are not satisfied with any of these, you can always make your own vitamin C serum. It will last you 2-3 weeks before it goes bad. Lab Muffin  Beauty has made a video about it years ago. The process is fairly simple.",

I didn't like that they smell weird and leave kind of a nasty taste on my lips that sometimes lingers throughout the day.\n\nHowever, I recently reintroduced vitamin C at night during my off tret nights since I can't tolerate nightly tret, and in addition to not really having to deal with the sensorial issues with vitamin C during the day, I just noticed that I was straight up seeing better results with it than I ever did before. My skin looks so damn good when I wake up the next morning after my vitamin C nights.\n\nI'm just speculating but I feel like you can definitely see more benefit from letting vitamin C work on your skin rather than than letting it degrade in sunlight. I understand people use it during the day for the \"protective factor\" but vitamin C is a lousy form of sun protection and your SPF should be good enough on its own.\n\njust my 2 cents.\n\nedit: since people keep commenting about the lip thing, I am not applying it directly to my lips. Most pure ascorbic acid serums are quite runny/watery and inevitably some of it gets close to the lips. It's also not just taste but the the hot dog water smell that lingers. maybe I am just more sensitive to it than others /shrug.",

I started with the 20% and have now moved to the 35%, which I actually like better —I was worried that an increase in % was going to be a problem, but it’s actually fine. I use these products in the morning, but nighttime application also works fine —it’s just on for a shorter time period. My application process is to spritz cleansed skin with Avene thermal water, then apply a light layer of Marula oil (I only like the Drunk Elephant version). Then I spritz again with my Avene, then I apply my vitamin C serum (the Allies of Skin products are formulated without water to prevent oxidation in the container, so they need to be applied to damp skin.). I have had no issues with burning or general sensitivity or decay of my mantle. I’ve tried other C serums that have had to be immediately washed off due to redness, burning, etc, with one exception which was the DrunK Elephant C-Firma, which I’ve tried many times in all its formulations — for some reason it makes my eyes burn, although skin reacts ok.",

And similar to what you're reporting, I've noticed that I get a better plumping effect from the ascorbic acid at night compared to when I attempted to use it in the morning. I really notice the effect on my undereyes and nasolabial folds, as well as on my techneck lines. I even get a redness-reducing effect from it, similar to what azelaic acid produces.\n\nBack when I attempted to use ascorbic acid in the morning, not only would I frequently get irritation over shaven areas, but the aforementioned treatment effects seemed blunted and I experienced the ascorbic acid serum often turning amber on my skin, which doesn't look great with my cool undertone. Fortunately vitamin C derivatives don't have any irritation or esthetic issues on my skin, so I still can and do use these in the morning, but I love the added effects of ascorbic acid a few nights per week. \n\nThe reason why I think a lot of derms and estheticians recommend using it in the morning is for purposes of patient compliance: a lot of them prescribe actives like retinoids at night and it may be too complicated to ask patients to try and stack a separate vitamin C with retinoids or to use it on off-nights from them, though the popularity of skin cycling may change this.\n\nThere's also the notion of using vitamin C primarily as an antioxidant and applying this prior to environmental exposure, which is probably the main impetus behind the recommendation to use it in the morning. There is one piece of research suggesting that the tissue half-life of ascorbic acid is around 4 days, which is the source behind the claim that \"vitamin C creates a reservoir and lasts for 72 hours in the skin\", but if you read the paper, it was performed on Yorkshire pigs, and it doesn't specify whether they were exposed to an outdoor environment between measurements, so it's unclear whether or not this translates to humans in normal living conditions.[1] For that reason, if someone's primary goal with vitamin C is to use it as an antioxidant and they can tolerate it in the AM, it's still prudent to use it in the morning, if tolerated. \n\nFor those who want to use it predominantly as a treatment and/or can't you tolerate it in the morning, though, it's perfectly fine to use at night. \n\n[1] https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00264.x",

I’ve also heard you can take Magnesium 60 at night and it can improve water absorption in your gut and prevent water loss in your skin as you sleep.",

That's just me tho :) The Cosrx is definitely weaker, but suitable for those with very sensitive skin who needs very slow exfoliation.   \n\n\n**QUESTION TIME!** \n\nDoes anyone know anything about JainaFace? How legit is this brand?   \nI have their 10% Glycolic Acid that doesn't even tingle on my face and seems to do nothing at all. Meanwhile, Cosrx AHA liquid, that has a lower percentage of free acid even, tingles. I suspect this brand to be a hoax but I'm not sure. Their 2% salicylic acid doesnt' really do anything for me either *(and I have spent 12 months testing out salicylic acids)*.  Same with a friend, she says she tried some products *(HA and some vitamin C stuff)* but that it didn't do anything for her face at all.   \nI contacted JainaFace a couple of months back to ask **1**. why they are allowed to use 2% salicylic acid in their products when the limit is 0.5% in Korea, and **2**. why there is next to zero information about this brand.  \nThe person who answered was nice enough but I find it shady that they don't want to market themselves... They claimed they would have to think about it, if it was true that people were starting to think they repackage and sell an American product, or that their products are generally fake/Chinese.  \nNothing's really happened except I saw they made a reddit account and posted a statement in  a reddit thread that they're not fake :P",

    "body": "Hello!\n\n# TLDR: I cured my eczema by cutting out ultra processed foods.\n\nI thought I’d come on here and share my journey because I would want someone to do the same if they’d cured their eczema. I’ll write out everything but you can read any sections you want to. I’m not saying this will work for everyone but maybe it will for some.\n\n**Background of my eczema**: I’m a 36 year old woman and have had eczema my whole life. It comes in waves but I never have zero eczema. When it’s at its best I have it on my eye, above my lip, on my neck and hands. When it’s bad I have it all over my face, neck and hands, wrists and my eyes so badly I can’t open them all the way. I rarely have it on my body, but maybe the odd patch if it’s bad eg. nipples and arm crease.\n\n**What I have tried over the years** and how they have worked (*oh boy it’s been rough*):\n\n* **All moisturisers:** E45, La Roche Posay, Cerave, Cetraben, Dipbrobase, Aveeno, Eucerin, Cetaphil, Avene, pure glycerin, olive oil, coconut oil, MCT oil, manuka honey, using nothing at all. -> it will be many, many more than that but you get the gist. Some made it worse, most made no difference.\n* **All steroids, strong and weak**: They did work but then as soon as I stop using them it comes back so after a while I stopped completely because I didn’t want to be using on my face for my entire life. \n* **Elidel / Pimecrolimus cream**: Worked really well but made me feel shit, I didn’t like using it, worried about long-term use and it all came back every time I stopped using it.\n* **Diet changes**: Cutting out sugar, cutting out dairy, being vegan, being ultra-healthy, adding in a lot of good bacteria, intermittent fasting, gluten free, and at one point cutting out all at once: sugar, yeast, caffeine, alcohol, basically a 'candida free' diet. Nothing worked at all and it was horrendous doing all that to no avail 🙃\n* **Misc**: taking supplements, taking probiotics, getting rid of sulphates in everything, shampoo, toothpaste etc, taking antihistamines, colloidal oatmeal baths (and other types of baths), washing my face less/more, natural only shampoos and hand washes etc, sunbeds. There will be more but they all did nothing.\n\nThere is definitely many more things I did that I haven’t remembered/put here (feel free to ask). But nothing worked except medical creams which I did not like to use. \n\n**What did** ***finally*** **work:**\n\nI had got to a point where i was giving up (tended to go in cycles of giving up and then trying again). Then Chris Van Tulken published his book **Ultra Processed People**. In January instead of veganuary/dry jan, or whatever I do normally, I gave up all ultra-processed foods, I had no idea it would do anything to my skin. \n\nBut…. **my eczema went away!!!** Then I started eating them again it came back. Now I have stopped for months and it has gone away to an extent that I have never, EVER, had it go away before ie. completely gone. I have even started using non-eczema friendly moisturisers and it isn’t irritating my skin. For the first time in my life I am a non-eczema person 🥲\n\n**For me, my definition\\* is this: I will not eat food that has** ***any*** **ingredient that you wouldn’t be able to buy for your own kitchen** (there are a couple of exceptions eg. ascorbic acid)**.** \n\nFor me the diet is completely sustainable because there are plenty of unhealthy/treat/fast-to-make foods that fit into this description. There is an UPF subreddit and instagram (linked in the comments) that has amazing recommendations for things like this.\n\n**It took about 1 month of doing this diet for my eczema to basically go away and a few months for it to fully disappear.** These days I might have a day off on a random weekend or if I go out to eat but mainly I stick to it. I don’t know what ingredient I must have been allergic to (I’m assuming it’s a colouring or E number or sulphate or preservative or something like that) but I’m happy to cut out all of them out because I feel much healthier and happier in general anyway. I plan to do it forever.\n\nI can’t tell you how many times i’ve felt very depressed and hopeless from having eczema. How much money and time I’ve spent looking for a cure. I really hope this can help someone. Buy his book (that's not necessary, you can do it without buying the book) try this diet change, see if it works for you. Let us know on this thread!\n\nAlso, **out of all the 'diets' I’ve done this has definitely been the easiest**. It sounds harder than it is and becomes much easier once you find the foods to buy. But make sure to look on EVERY food packet because you’d be surprised; loads of things like tinned tomatoes and chickpeas, some cheeses have it in, most bread, so much stuff - check anything before you buy.  \n\n*side note: the only moisturiser I do like and still used on its own (until v recently when I can now use anything I like) is Dermol 500. I didn’t cure anything but never stung my skin or made it worse.*\n\n**\\*** Some people in the UPF-free world will probably say that I am more on an additive/preservative free diet because - for example - I would eat a 'Crosta + Mollica Margherita pizza' because it fits my definition but some people would say because it is mass produced it is still ultra-processed. For eczema reasons my definition works perfectly.\n\nSorry to add more but **to give a better idea of things I cut out**: that includes things like emulsifiers and natural flavourings and inverted sugar syrup and any ‘acids’, colourings, preservative, e numbers, 'gums', stuff that sounds kind of normal but isn’t something you could buy eg. pea protein. It has to be really strict - can you buy it? If not then it’s a no. Ascorbic acid is an exception because it is just vitamin C and ‘pectin’ is because apparently you can buy that (it’s just in jam) and ‘live cultures’ because they are naturally occurring and are good for you. Those are the only exceptions I can think of right now. I speak more about this in the comments.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions!",

I'm also able to eat cheese, chocolate, everything I had been avoiding all my life, as long as I have very little bread in my diet it's gone, and it's been completely clear since March. \n\nSo happy that you've found what works for you :)",

I use all natural cleaners, shampoos, body wash, laundry wash, flouride free filtered water, we eat mostly meat and veggies but still she has issues. I do believe stress anxiety causing situations flare it. (Playing sports as goalie is pretty stressful, aswell as highschool) I had never heard of A2 milk being helpful so I'll try that out for her.  She drinks lactose free normal 2% milk currently.  I also watch ingredient labels with our foods but seem to still battle with flare ups. She reacts to heat, sweat, and swimming pools with chlorine. So we avoid pools and keep cool with air conditioning. But alas we still struggle. We don't eat much processed food but I guess the bread... the milk... the occasional donut or fun drink at a shop would trigger also. I will for sure give this UPF diet change a go. We are steroid cream free home. And vx free since 4years old. She's 15. I do feel deep down the toddler vx is what caused it. We're in Canada so the food is awfully processed here. It's really hard to find and afford real naturally occurring food.  Thank you again for this thread and the videos and articles shared. Much help. Best wishes for everyone here beginning a new hope of clear un irritated skin. Xo",

Weird. I said wow. So now I'm trying organic juices, it's simpler to do it myself but my energy is low, my blood test are normal by medical standards but gut bloats, constant urine infection, I don't have a liver problem and kidneys are safe so far, I'm not diabetic and my weight is okay for 5'5 149-152 lb at 55 yrs old. However I feel like 20 in my head, body feels 70-80 on the worst days, with a diet pill and shot injections of lipo & B12 I can get up and get things done, the problem is if I don't get the things done fast enough, my body hair is down quickly and with no relief about movement and limited food options, it'll take another 3 weeks for me to get the energy to do simple things as housekeeping and taking dogs for a longer walk I force myself. I don't know what America is going through and I'm in Los Angeles but I feel like we've come a long ways from when we were children, for those that grew up in rural areas and could eat berries off the vine and burgers were simple, add egg a little milk maybe chop some onions bell pepper throw it in a pan fry it or bake it in a meatloaf, mash some mashed potatoes with a little butter and salt and we're on our way and we're for lucky we make it a salad if we're not too hard luck on money but I'm sure my family did the best they could but we didn't eat a lot of vegetables so I am struggling to eat vegetables as an adult even at 55 years old and so I'm juicing or having it delivered so that I can see about getting my guts bacterial normal or on the right track and try to live life the best I can before life is over, no one wants to be stuck laying in their bed, had pressure, dry eyes from gut issues as if you're not hydrated enough and you're drinking a lot of water daily at least that's what I'm doing but for some reason the water doesn't seem as it was when I was younger however I am from the Pacific Northwest where the water and Puget sound or the mountain s like Mount Rainier or St Helens or wherever the water comes from such as Alaska glaciers it's good but the water here for some reason I don't care which one I grab off the shelf it doesn't seem to drench or quench my thirst so I'm constantly hydrated and yet medical doctor say this is normal but I don't think it is I see 80 year old and a 100 year old people walking talking and join yourself and dancing and prancing and enjoying their life and us 35 to 60 year old seem to be dying before our eyes. If anyone has experienced what I'm experiencing let me know. Give me some suggestions share because I don't think I'm the only one, I'm looking at documentaries of the Asians who live near the blue lagoons and their Asian areas and they are living past 100 unlike Americans that live in the United States, yeah we do things and have water sports and yoga and other things but their lives in the Asian communities seem to be much simpler of the United States no possessions but they seem to be happy and stick together and when one is in trouble financially or sick, they all kick in unrelated stranger helping one another, it amazing but that's not the way it is here, I mean we have people, organizations that do that, but it's not a collective effort, if it was we wouldn't have homeless people. I have never seen a rich person come down to the poor area and pay bills for the ones that can't pay rent or bring groceries to homes in the ghetto without recognition, yet there is people that will do it and the word gets passed around. So I won't blanket every person who is well off. I'm just stating what I have not seen in what I have in my time growing up in America. What I can't understand is? Why eating healthy is so expensive, how did regular vegetables and organic vegetables come into play? When I was growing up there with no such thing, vegetables or vegetables and we're not expensive as they are today and why eating junk food is so easy to come by. Anyway, I'll save that for another long dialogue. I hope that the changes I'm making that are ongoing for these last 15 years something will click within me before my time is over here on earth.  Thank you for listening!:) 🙏",

    "body": "Hello everyone!\n\nThis is my first post on Reddit. In this post, I'll be reviewing all the AB products I've tried since the start of my skincare journey in 2019 (primarily K-beauty products). This post may become unbearably long if I go into great detail about each product so I’ll try to keep my reviews brief. Also, this post doesn't contain reviews of the products I'm currently using as I need more time to evaluate some new products and my routine as a whole. I've listed them down below if you're curious.\n\nI really wanted to give back to the Reddit skincare community, which has been invaluable for my skin (and my wallet). I've benefited immensely from all the reviews/discussions on this thread (and at r/SkincareAddiction), and I hope that this post contributes to our shared knowledge in some way. A massive and heartfelt thank you to all the kind souls in the Reddit skincare community!\n\n**About me and my skin**: 25F. Combination with oily T-zone and dry U-zone. Not sensitive to fragrance (but will mention it in the reviews if I recall that a product was fragranced). Had mild acne in my teens and clear skin throughout college. Didn’t have a skincare routine at all and didn’t apply sunscreen (gasp!) Started getting cystic acne in my early 20s. Began a proper skincare routine in 2019 and here we are! I live in a sub-tropical region of South Asia and \"enjoy\" extreme temperatures as well as humidity during the summer and monsoon season. It's a bit difficult to purchase K-beauty and J-beauty products here due to lack of availability.\n\n**Tretinoin use**: Before I begin, I do want to introduce a caveat to to this post. Routine use of tretinoin/Retin-A (which I started in Oct 2020) had the biggest impact on my acne. I won’t go into too much detail about tret because it's a potent product for which you need to speak to a dermatologist. But I will say that even though tretinoin did the heavy lifting by forcing the closed comedones (CCs) and cystic acne to the surface, I relied a lot on AB products to hydrate, moisturize, brighten and generally soothe my skin. While tretinoin is like medication for me, I view my (mostly) AB skincare routine as much-needed self-care. Also, YMMV.\n\n# Current Skincare Routine\n\n(will post a shelfie + review in a month or so after using the products for a sufficient amount of time)\n\n* **AM**: Wash with water >> Keep Cool Soothe Bamboo Toner >> locally manufactured alpha arbutin serum >> Purito Deep Sea Pure Water Cream >> Avene Day Protector UV EX SPF30 PA+++ Cream (non-AB) (OR) Purito Centella Green Level Safe Sun (trying to finish it up)\n* **PM**: Rovectin Skin Essentials Conditioning Cleanser >> Keep Cool Soothe Bamboo Toner >> Rx tretinoin >> Rx azelaic acid >> By Wishtrend: Polyphenol in Propolis 15% Ampoule >> Purito Centella Unscented Recovery Cream (OR) Etude House Soonjung Sleeping Pack 5-Panthensoside\n* **Products used occasionally with my PM routine**: Banila Co Clean It Zero Original Cleansing Balm, Krave Great Barrier Relief Serum, Sulwhasoo Overnight Vitalizing Mask, Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask (Berry) and Rovectin Barrier Repair Face Oil\n* Exfoliants are all non-AB.\n\nNow, on to the reviews.\n\n**Key**: HG = Holy Grail; WRP = Would Repurchase; WNRP = Would Not Repurchase; MRP = May Repurchase; (x2 or x'n') = have repurchased the product 'n' times.\n\n**Rating scale**: 1/5 – Disliked the product; 2/5 – Not impressed; 3/5 – Nice product, but better ones available; 4/5 – Really enjoyed it; 5/5 – HG, loved everything about it.\n\n# Cleansing Balm / Oil\n\n* **Banila Co. Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Revitalizing** – Love this. Of all their cleansing balms, have tried this one and the Original one. Both are fragranced but this one was a *little* more slippery and dissolvable compared to the Original. Used it for occasional makeup removal. Didn’t sting my eyes. Used it frequently for the oil cleansing method (OCM) to remove sebum plugs and flaky skin. Have successfully pushed out blackheads during OCM (but not the ones that were deeply embedded). If you oil cleanse for too long, skin can feel stripped and dry. Emulsifies easily. Doesn’t leave a film. **5/5** **HG WRP** (but don’t have a preference between this one and the Original one).\n* **The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Light Cleansing Oil** – Only cleansing oil that I’ve tried. Didn’t irritate my skin. Took off makeup well. Didn’t emulsify easily. Felt greasy even after washing off. Fragranced. **2/5** **WNRP**.\n* **The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Cleansing Cream** – Worked fine for me but felt a bit greasy after washing off. Fragranced. **3/5** **WNRP**.\n\n# Cleanser\n\n* **Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser** – First low-pH cleanser that I tried. Didn’t sting skin, but skin felt stripped after washing off if it was sensitized. Tea-tree smell. **3/5** **WNRP**.\n* **Etude House SoonJung pH 6.5 Whip Cleanser** – Really enjoyed this but missed the experience of gel cleansers. Didn’t strip skin. Didn’t sting sensitized skin. **4/5** **WNRP**.\n\n# Toner / Essence\n\n* **Bellamonster Stress Out Solution Pad** – I think the mild exfoliants and the cotton pad itself were supposed to target acne-prone skin. The carrot seed oil was supposed to soothe and nourish skin. But for me, it didn’t really do anything. Certainly didn’t soothe my skin. Don’t think I’m a toner pad gal. **1/5 WNRP**.\n* **Benton Aloe BHA Toner** (mini x2) – Hydrating. Has aloe water and snail secretion filtrate. Absorbs easily. Doesn’t sting sensitized skin. BHA is negligible. Enjoyed the first mini but didn’t think it would be useful in my routine (since I rely on the Paula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant – non-AB). Purchased a second mini when I started tret and had to stop all actives. The tret purge was leading to more blackheads than usual so I wanted to introduce a gentle BHA product before bringing the Paula’s Choice BHA back into my routine. Folks with sensitive skin may enjoy it. **3/5 WNRP**.\n* **Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence** (mini x2 and full size) – Really enjoyed this. Sinks into the skin beautifully (unlike the Cosrx Snail 96 Essence). Hydrating. Made my skin look healthy (plump, glowy). Didn’t have any impact on acne or inflammation though. **4/5 WRP**.\n* **Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence** – Unpopular opinion but I’m not a big fan. Gave into the hype and bought it. Takes time to absorb into the skin. Dries with a tacky feeling. Using copious amounts made my skin look plump (and almost poreless) but after a while, skin feels dry and tight. Don’t think it deeply hydrates skin. No impact on acne, inflammation, brown acne marks/post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) or red acne marks/post-inflammatory erythema (PIE). No scent. **2/5 WNRP**.\n* **Cosrx Natural BHA Skin Returning A-Sol** – Didn’t do anything. Watery texture. Strong alcohol smell. **1/5 WNRP**.\n* **Etude House Moistfull Collagen Essence** – Didn’t have a hydrating product in my routine when I purchased this. Didn’t have access to a lot of AB products due to global COVID lockdowns. Wasn’t bad but nothing to write home about. Sinks into the skin well. Doubt that hydrolyzed collagen in cosmetic products that you apply to your epidermis are effective in increasing collagen. Strong alcohol smell. **2/5 WNRP**.\n* **I’m From Mugwort Essence** – Really enjoyed this. Lightweight. Sinks into skin easily. Very hydrating. Didn’t see any anti-inflammatory effects or reduction in redness though. Definitely missed this when it finished but can’t justify the price for a product which didn’t do much more than hydrate my skin. **4/5 WNRP**.\n* **Innisfree Blueberry Rebalancing Skin** – Bought this when I demolished my moisture barrier. Had read good reviews about this and skin was super dehydrated at that point. Product ended up being light, yet hydrating. Didn’t sting skin despite having citrus oils. Have found better hydrating products now. Citrus smell. **3/5 WNRP**.\n* **Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner (mini and full size)** – Really enjoyed this. Despite being viscous, it absorbed into my skin pretty easily. Super hydrating. Stung when skin was sensitized though. Has a scent. **3/5 WNRP**.\n* **Klairs Supple Preparation Unscented Toner** – Didn’t enjoy this as much as the scented version. Ingredient list is the same except for the plant/fruit extracts in the scented version (as far as I remember). Didn’t realize I would miss those plant/fruit extracts. Didn’t feel as hydrating as the scented version. Also thought that this one was not as viscous as the scented version (but I have read reviews where people didn’t think there was a difference in terms of texture). Folks with sensitive skin would enjoy this. **2/5 WNRP**.\n* **Laneige Cream Skin Refiner** – Mixed feelings. Wow innovation but also tricky to fit into routine. Watery when you apply, but becomes nourishing when it meets your skin. Using this immediately after cleansing would make it feel like I was applying my serums on top of a moisturizer. Skin felt wonderfully nourished though, especially during the winters. Pre-COVID, couldn’t use it in the morning as it's definitely greasy for oily/combo skin people. Would sting when applied on red, sensitized skin. I enjoyed this product for the most part, but I’ve realized that I want my toner/essence step to be light and hydrating. **4/5 WNRP**.\n* **Rovectin Skin Essentials Treatment Lotion** – Unpopular opinion again but not a fan. Didn’t sink into skin easily. Always felt like there was a film on my face. Skin felt hydrated but I didn’t enjoy the application of other products (serums, in particular) after applying this one. Didn’t sting sensitized skin. No scent. **3/5 WNRP**.\n* **Secret Key Starting Treatment Essence (Rose Edition)** – Everything about this product is lovely, right from the packaging to the product itself. Absorbs into the skin easily. Feels super light, yet hydrating. This product is a first treatment essence (FTE) and it’s supposed to be applied immediately after cleansing and before other products. It has fermented ingredients (94% galactomyces ferment filtrate a.k.a galactic mice) and helps other products penetrate better. Had heard so much about the elusive FTE glow, and was thrilled to see it. To clarify, it doesn’t help with PIH or PIE but it makes your skin look brighter and healthier. **4/5** **but WNRP** because I do want to try out other FTEs like the original Missha one and Neogen.\n\n# Serum / Ampoule\n\n* **Benton Snail Bee Ultimate Serum** – Thought I would like this better than the Benton Snail Essence. Did not, in fact, like this better. Wasn’t as hydrating as the Benton Snail Essence. Didn’t do anything for my skin. Taking into account its ineffectiveness, super expensive for the volume. **2/5 WNRP**.\n* **Goodal Green Tangerine Vita C Dark Spot Serum** – This one…. Apparently, it’s all the rage in S. Korea. Loved the texture; face felt super nourished when I used it in the AM. Didn’t do anything for PIH though. Zero, zilch, nada. Takes some time to sink into the skin. Citrus scent. **3/5 MRP** because I enjoyed the experience of using this product.\n* **Innisfree Green Tea Seed Face Serum** – I don’t get the hype. This was an ‘entry-into-AB’ kind of product. Didn’t do anything for my skin. Strong alcohol smell. **1/5 WNRP**.\n* **It’s Skin Power 10 Formula VC Effector Serum** – First Vitamin C serum. Has a Vitamin C derivative but I’m not sure which one. Didn’t brighten skin or lighten PIH. Mildly hydrating. Absorbed into the skin really quickly. Not expensive but not effective either. **2/5 WNRP**.\n* **It’s Skin Power 10 Formula Q10 Effector** – I suppose the effects of Coenzyme Q10 or CoQ10 show themselves in the long run, so I cannot comment on the effectiveness of this product. Q10 is an anti-oxidant and is supposed to prevent damage to the skin from environmental stressors and UV rays (cannot replace sunscreen though). The product was lightweight and absorbed easily. Affordable. Would be interested in trying out other Q10 products. **3/5 WNRP.**\n* **Iunik Propolis Vitamin Synergy Serum** – Took me forever to finish this because there was 50ml of product, and the product itself was thick in texture (have read that most propolis-based serums have this kind of texture). Skin felt nourished after applying it. A bit heavy and sticky so had to apply at night. Didn’t see the ‘propolis glow’. Enjoyed it, but didn’t really need it in my routine. **3/5 WNRP**.\n* **Keep Cool Soothe Bamboo Serum** (mini and full size) – Tried out the mini when my skin was doing okay in terms of redness and sensitivity. Sinks into the skin quickly and doesn’t leave a tacky feeling. I want to say that this product is hydrating but I don’t think it can help with the deep hydration that folks with dehydrated skin need. Purchased the full size when it was on sale, and at the time, my skin was super sensitized (thanks tret). This stung oh man and I don’t know why. Was disappointed with the soothing and calming claims of this product. Didn't detect a scent. **2/5 WNRP**.\n* **Klairs Freshly Juiced Vitamin Drop** (x2) – Has 5% ascorbic acid. Wasn’t potent enough to help with PIH. But did brighten by complexion and make it more glowy. Didn’t throw away the box it came in and stored the bottle in the box while I was using it; didn’t oxidize at all (over a period of \\~3.5 months). Feels like a dry oil. Takes some time to absorb into the skin, but it’s not greasy. Interested in trying out vitamin C at higher concentrations. **3/5 WNRP**.\n* **Purito Centella Green Level Buffet Serum** – Purchased it when my skin was sensitized from over-exfoliation (which is a rite of passage for all skincare enthusiasts). This product stung. Didn’t notice the impact of the 49% centella asiatica extract because it hurt to use this. Absorbs easily into the skin though and doesn’t leave a tacky finish. Would be interested in trying out the Unscented version; maybe that won’t sting and I’ll enjoy it more. **2/5 WNRP**.\n\n# Exfoliant\n\n* **Cosrx AHA Whitehead Power Liquid** – Glycolic acid is not for me. I think this has 7% glycolic acid. Stung every time I applied it, regardless of whether skin was sensitized or not. Didn’t notice a reduction in CCs or acne (mostly because my skin would feel sensitive after applying the product and it would give rise to inflamed bumps). This is less about the product and more about my skin apparently holding a grudge against glycolic acid. No scent. **2/5 WNRP**.\n* **Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid** – Felt pretty gentle on my skin. Didn’t have an impact on stubborn CCs or on blackheads. Worked well on sebaceous filaments on the nose though. Prefer the Paula’s Choice BHA to this 100%. Product has a slip to it. Leaves a film on the skin when it dries down. No scent. **3/5 WNRP**.\n* **Neogen Bio-peel Gauze Peeling Wine** – Bought it because it was on sale. After using it on my face and my body, I can safely say that it’s not a good idea to put physical exfoliants in my hand because I don’t know how to be gentle with my skin. It’s essentially a pad with a soft quilted side and a more abrasive gauze side. Took me so long to finish up this product. Has a fruity scent. **2/5** **WNRP**.\n\n# Moisturizer / Sleeping Pack\n\n* **Benton Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel** (mini) – Didn’t do anything for my skin, i.e., hydrate, nourish or soothe. Skin felt tight after using. **2/5 WNRP**.\n* **Benton Snail Bee High Content Steam Cream** (mini) – Face felt greasy and suffocated. Product didn’t seem to absorb at all. Skin did feel moisturized but the experience using this product was unpleasant. **2/5 WNRP**.\n* **Cosrx Advanced Snail 92 All in One Cream** – Felt calming and soothing on my over-exfoliated skin. But the application was annoying because of the unique texture of this product. Didn’t feel heavy or unbearably greasy. But didn’t fully absorb into my skin either. Think I would have enjoyed it more if the texture was airy and light (if that makes any sense). No fragrance. **3/5 WNRP**.\n* **Cosrx Hydrium Green Tea Aqua Soothing Gel Cream** – Used this in the summer. Maybe gel creams just aren’t for me. Not hydrating or moisturizing enough. While skin didn’t feel very tight, it certainly seemed to crave nourishment after a couple of hours. **2/5 WNRP**.\n* **Cosrx Ultimate Nourishing Honey Overnight Mask** – Worked well in the summer as a sleeping pack, but wasn’t thick enough for the winters. Doesn’t feel heavy on the skin at all. Feels like you’re applying a gel cream. I don’t know if it’s actually nourishing or if it just does a good job of acting like an occlusive and the rest of your skincare does the heavy lifting in terms of nourishment and moisturization. Dried down pretty quickly. **3/5 MRP**.\n* **Etude House SoonJung 2x Barrier Intensive Cream** (x2) – Love this during the winters. It’s perfectly basic but that’s why it’s great. Has a soft mousse-like texture but will embrace your face in a warm hug on application. Skin felt moisturized. Used it while adjusting to tret and it didn’t sting sensitized skin at all. Not greasy but because of how moisturizing it is, you certainly know that it’s there on your face. Didn’t cause CCs for me. No fragrance. **5/5 HG WRP**. But at the moment, I’m interested in trying out the Purito Dermide Cica Barrier Sleeping Pack.\n* **Etude House SoonJung Hydro Barrier Cream** – Thought this would be the answer to all my day-time moisturizer problems. But it wasn’t. Instead of feeling moisturized, skin just felt greasy. It was almost like there was a waxy layer on top of my skin. Texture was mousse-like. **1/5 WNRP**.\n* **Innisfree Aloe Vera Revital Soothing Gel** – I used this product as a mask more than a moisturizer. ~~It has alcohol but I think that allows it to~~ Sinks into the skin really well. Mildly hydrating. It’s not amazing but quite cost-effective for the amount you get. Not expensive. Don't really need it in my routine though. **3/5 WNRP**.\n* **Innisfree Blueberry Rebalancing Cream** (x2) – Great product. Can easily use it as a day-time moisturizer. Skin didn't feel greasy at all despite the fact that this is a cream. Didn’t sting my sensitized skin but it does have essential oils, so do take that into account. The cream itself is light and spreads very easily. Light citrus smell. **4/5 WRP**.\n* **Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream** (60 ml) – Product colour is beautiful. Didn’t do much for my skin in terms of soothing or calming. When my skin was really sensitized (thanks tret), sometimes this product would sting. Didn’t have an impact on redness or inflammation of cystic acne. Balm-like texture but not as heavy as a sleeping pack. Felt like there was a waxy film on my skin. May work for people who aren’t trying to address intense inflammation of the skin. Expensive but not effective. **2/5 WNRP**.\n* **Purito Centella Green Level Recovery Cream** – Just like the Purito Centella Green Level Buffet Serum, purchased this product to deal with over-exfoliated skin. Brand claims that it’s been formulated with 50% centella asiatica extract. But unfortunately, it also has essential oils. I’m not a 100% sure but I think that’s what caused it to sting on application. If you use this product when your moisture barrier is okay, I don’t think it should cause any issues. But people typically purchase ‘recovery creams’ and ‘cica creams’ when they’re trying to repair their skin. Thankfully, the brand has come out with an Unscented version that doesn’t have essential oils (testing that out right now). **2/5 WNRP**.\n\n# Sunscreen\n\n* **Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50 PA ++++** – Won’t comment on the effectiveness of this since I don’t think it’s been tested after the Purito controversy (Wishtrend has stopped sales though). Texture-wise it felt light on my face, but made my forehead greasy. Didn’t enjoy using it due to that reason and took forever to begrudgingly finish it up. **3/5 WNRP**.\n* **Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun SPF 50+ PA++++** – We all know about the controversy, so I won’t get into it. Texture-wise I thought this was a little greasier than the Scented version of this sunscreen. I think that people with combo or oily skin are more sensitive to products that can make them look greasy, that is, they’re more likely to notice the greasiness of the product. I don’t think that the greasiness would bother people with dry skin as much. **3/5 but WNRP** because I feel betrayed (and I don’t want an ‘indoor sunscreen’; I just want one effective sunscreen).\n\n# Wash-Off Mask\n\n* **I’m From Mugwort Mask** (mini) – Magically zapped away the redness on my face that usually shows up when I’m using too many actives or I’ve put too much pressure while cleansing. It does have plant bits in it though and some of these particles are sharp. But if you’re careful washing it off, don’t think it will be a problem. Doesn’t dry down and easy to wash off. Smells like mugwort, that is to say, herbal and medicinal. Don’t know if I can justify the price point and purchase a full-size version just to address redness though. **4/5 MRP** because I’m greedy.\n* **I’m From Honey Mask** (mini x3) – Really wanted to love this. Applying it is just the most luxurious feeling ever. Smells divine (though people sensitive to fragrance may not like the smell). The problem is that it’s too expensive for me, and doesn’t really moisturize or nourish my skin as much as I’d like it too. Sometimes, my skin would still feel a bit dry after washing it off. Has a thick caramel-like texture and doesn’t dry down. Can be worn up to an hour. I did wear it for over 2 hours once because I accidentally fell asleep with it on and I would not recommend doing that; my skin felt super sensitive once I washed it off. **3/5 WNRP**.\n* **Innisfree Super Volcanic Clay Mousse Mask 2x** – Love this product. I used it occasionally as it's pretty drying (like most clay masks). The mousse-like texture helped me spread it over my face without having to tug at my skin. Also like the fact that it doesn’t come in a jar/tub and instead, comes in a spray-type can. I'd typically leave it on for 15 minutes and it would suck up all the sebum on my face. Made my pores (particularly the ones on my nose) look cleaner. **5/5 HG but** **WNRP** because I’ve been trying out the 10 ml Innisfree Capsule Recipe Pack (Volcanic Cluster) and that one doesn’t dry down at all. Would be interested in using more of that product.\n\n# Sheet Masks\n\nI use them occasionally. They’re all pretty interchangeable to me so I won’t be able to review them properly. I use sheet masks on two occasions – one, when my skin is struggling despite my skincare routine and I need that instant boost of hydration or instant soothing, and two, when I feel bored with my skincare routine and am on the verge of unnecessarily splurging on hyped up products for no reason. I’ve enjoyed the sheet masks from The Face Shop, Innisfree, Ariul, Mediheal, Tonymoly, Leaders, Klairs and Etude House.\n\nAnd with that, we come to the end of the post. I hope this was helpful! It seems like I've gone through A LOT of products (\\*cue weeping wallet\\*), but the heart wants what it wants. Some new products that I have my eye on (because I will never learn) are the Cosrx Propolis Synergy Toner, Missha Artemisia Essence, Purito Dermide Cica Barrier Sleeping Pack, By Wishtrend's 15% Vitamin C, Tiam's Vitamin C serum and Muji cleansing oils. Can't wait to hear your thoughts!\n\n(Edit: formatting and typos)\n\n(Edit 2: **Innisfree Aloe Vera Revital Soothing Gel doesn't have alcohol!** Relied on the ingredients listed on a local retailer's page instead of incidecoder/cosdna, apologies. Thank you to a commenter for pointing it out!)",

The Keep Cool was fine but not particularly soothing and only lightly hydrating for me (I prefer something more viscous for hydration), and I found the Cosrx Snail really hard to work with. I prefer not to let my layers under moisturizer dry down completely and this was impossible with the Cosrx.\n\nI also love the Secret Key FTE, but it's the only FTE I've tried so I'm always having \"grass is greener\" thoughts. It's just hard to justify switching because it's so inexpensive compared to other FTEs. I'd really like to try the Missha Artemisia though.",

    "body": "# Background\n\nSkinceuticals CE Ferulic is considered the best vitamin c serum that money can buy in the skincare market today. In fact, many people have sweared by the Skinceuticals CE Ferulic, claiming that it makes a larger difference in their skin compared to other vitamin c alternatives. At $166 per oz, it's not as easily accessible by the average consumer. The reason why it's so expensive is because Skinceuticals currently holds the patent for the perfect ratio of vitamin c, vitamin e, and ferulic acid needed to optimize the effectiveness of vitamin c.\n\nThe \"golden ratio\" is **15% L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)**, **1% Vitamin E (Tocopherol)**, and **0.5% Ferulic Aced** with a pH level between **2.5 - 3.0**. Skinceuticals CE Ferulic is also **fungal acne safe**.\n\nGiven the price, there have been a lot of posts and comments asking for dupes of this product.\n\n**Disclaimer: This post is not sponsored. I used my own money to purchase Skinceuticals and Dr.Brenner for the advancement of skincare data.**\n\n## Why should I use Vitamin C?\n\nI'm not going to go into this too much since that's not really the focus of the post, but you can read more about the research behind Vitamin C here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/vitamin\\_c\\_recs](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/vitamin_c_recs)\n\n## Popular Dupes\n\nThere are some well known popular dupes of Skinceuticals out in the skincare market today. Keep in mind, none of the dupes listed will have the exact same formulation as Skinceuticals due to the patent. Below are some popular dupes and the differences it has with Skinceuticals.\n\n**Paula's Choice C15 Booster**\n\n[Link](https://www.paulaschoice.com/c15-super-booster/777.html)\n\nPrice: \\~$65/oz\n\nDisclaimer: I have not tried this product.\n\n|Skinceuticals Ingredients|Paula's Choice C15 Ingredients|\n|:-|:-|\n|Aqua/Water/Eau, Ethoxydiglycol,|Water (Aqua), Ascorbic Acid, Butylene|\n|Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin,|Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Glycerin,|\n|Propylene Glycol, Laureth-23,|PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated|\n|Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol,|Castor Oil, Pentylene Glycol, Tocopherol,|\n|Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate.|Norleucine Acetate, Lecithin, Ferulic|\n||Acid, Panthenol, Bisabolol, Oryza Sativa|\n||(Rice) Bran Extract, Propyl Gallate,|\n||Sodium Gluconate, Sodium Hydroxide,|\n||Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.|\n\nPaulas's Choice claims that this a **15% Vitamin C formula, 1% Vitamin E,** and **0.5% Ferulic Acid** at pH of **3.1**. Paula's Choice is **not fungal acne safe** due to the hydrogenated castor oil.\n\n**Timeless Skin Care 20% Vitamin C Plus E Ferulic**\n\n[Link](https://www.amazon.com/Timeless-Skin-Care-20-Vitamin/dp/B0036BI56G)\n\nPrice: $21.34/oz\n\nDisclaimer: I have not tried this product.\n\n|Skinceuticals Ingredients|Timeless Skincare 20% Vit C Ingredients|\n|:-|:-|\n|Aqua/Water/Eau, Ethoxydiglycol,|Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid,|\n|Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin,|Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol,|\n|Propylene Glycol, Laureth-23,|Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid,|\n|Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol,|Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol,|\n|Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate.||\n\nTimeless uses a **20% Vitamin C formula, 1% Vitamin E,** and **0.5% Ferulic acid** at pH of **2.4**.

They also claim that it is at a pH of 2.5–3. NuFountain **is fungal acne safe**.\n\nMini Review: I did not see any difference using this vitamin c product for a few months, so I discontinued its use.\n\n# Skin(care) Background\n\nI have Asian, sensitive, combination hormonal/acne prone skin. I have lots of PIE due to old acne and lots of freckles and sun damage on my skin due to the fact that I've lived in Hawaii for most of my life.\n\n## Current Routine\n\nMorning:\n\n* ILLI Ceramide Ato Lotion\n* Hado Labo Tokyo Skin Plumping Gel Cream\n* Shiseido SPF40 Sunscreen\n\nNight:\n\n* La Roche Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Face Wash\n* Tretinoin 0.1% cream\n* ILLI Ceramide Ato Lotion\n* Hado Labo Tokyo Skin Plumping Gel Cream\n\nTret has made my skin extra sensitive. For example, my skin is now unable to use the Cerave hydrating cleanser due to how sensitive it is. The La Roche Posay cleanser is the only non irritating cleaner I can use now that I am on Tret.\n\nI have tried multiple Vitamin C products on my skin over the years. Specifically, I've tried Melano CC, NuFountain C20, The Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension, and Philosophy Vitamin C Powder.\n\nI have never been able to spot any visible improvement whenever I started using *any* brand of Vitamin C on my skin.\n\n# Review\n\nThere's quite a number of reviews between Skinceuticals CE Ferulic VS Timeless 20% Vitamin C and Paula's Choice C15 if you make a quick Google search. I didn't want to add to those stats as I think there's enough data there. This post is mainly going to review Skinceuticals CE Ferulic vs Dr.Brenner's 20% Vitamin C Serum. In my opinion, Dr.Brenner is the closest dupe, ingredients wise, to Skinceuticals CE Ferulic.\n\n## Packaging\n\n[Packaging](https://preview.redd.it/y21w3rkgcmi51.jpg?width=1433&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=440c465d015a4ab5b9a285ece3ca393f24c7b33a)\n\nSkinceuticals came in a blue paper box, wrapped in plastic. The actual bottle is pretty opaque, but would definitely still allow light through given that it's glass and I was able to see the serum line quite clearly.\n\nDr.Brenner's came with the glass bottle wrapped in plastic. The bottle was just as opaque as Skinceuticals, and I was also able to see the serum line quite clearly.\n\nThe general guidance for both is to store in a cool, dry place. I've also read online that Vitamin C should be exposed to as little light as possible. Given that, I think Skinceutical's does a better job protecting the product until it gets to the consumer's home given the paper casing. For Dr.Brenner, it's possible for it to be exposed to light while waiting for it to be packaged and sent. However, they do claim on Amazon that they create their Vitamin C serum every 2 weeks to make sure it's fresh.\n\nI stored both of mine in a cupboard, so they're both only exposed to light when I take it out and use it. However, I kept my Skinceuticals in the paper casing while I stored it in the cupboard.\n\n## Product\n\n**Dr. Brenner Vitamin C Serum**\n\n[Link](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-L-Ascorbic-Hyaluronic-Dr-Brenner/dp/B07ZG28M2S/)\n\nPrice: $24.99/oz\n\n|Skinceuticals Ingredients|Dr. Brenner Vitamin C Ingredients|\n|:-|:-|\n|Aqua/Water/Eau, Ethoxydiglycol,|Water, Ethoxydiglycol,|\n|Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin,|L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Propylene|\n|Propylene Glycol, Laureth-23,|Glycol, Glycerin, Laureth-23,|\n|Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol,|Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Sodium|\n|Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate.|Ferulic Acid, Panthenol,|\n||Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol|\n\nAs you can see, the ingredients used in Dr.Brenner is the same as Skinceuticals, although the ordering seems to be different. Dr.Brenner claims that the ratio is **20% Vitamin C, 1% Vitamin E, 1% Hyaluronic Acid,** and **0.5% Ferulic Acid**. Unfortunately, I do not know the pH nor do I have anything to find out the pH of Dr.Brenner. Dr.Brenner **is fungal acne safe**.\n\n## Method\n\nI applied Skinceuticals to the left side of my face, and Dr.Brenner to the right side of my face every morning for 1 month, adjusting for irritation. I also applied the same sunscreen to my entire face after applying the vitamin c serums.\n\n## Thoughts\n\n**Skinceuticals CE Ferulic**\n\nThis has a really strong hot dog smell. The reviews are spot on about this. It really does smell like I'm rubbing hot dog water on my face. The serum is a pale yellow. The texture is slightly more viscous than Dr.Brenner's. The best way I can describe it is that it has the texture of thick water.\n\n**Dr.Brenner Vitamin C Serum**\n\nThis has a faint hot dog smell, not as strong as Skinceuticals. The texture is not as thick as Skinceuticals, it's more runny and has a closer texture to water, possibly due to the higher hyaluronic acid content. The coloring is a lighter yellow than Skinceuticals.\n\nMy before pictures are from when I applied the Vitamin C serums for the first time on each side. My after pictures are 1 month after daily morning application of the Vitamin C serums.\n\nI found that the Dr.Brenner serum is more irritating on my skin than Skinceuticals. I found that the side where I usually apply the Dr.Brenner serum usually gets more red and irritable compared to the Skinceuticals side. However, this only happens when my skin needs a break from Tret, and the irritation usually goes away if I take a break from Tret for a day.\n\n## Final Verdict\n\n[Before Front](https://preview.redd.it/pu2biihlcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fc6d699da9c03071fedefbf839616465bddf31b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Before Skinceuticals](https://preview.redd.it/pbx6am5ncmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8781476d62dbbf083a306021e119563fd226742)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Before Dr. Brenner](https://preview.redd.it/yr2ofgzocmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2be97af34e9328346fb0b41825bf547bce93c3c3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Front](https://preview.redd.it/b6v0kgoqcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c50ddcdda52d39e8b434fe78d1e0147ff35c41b7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Skinceuticals](https://preview.redd.it/wajzo5zrcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cee0f78bdf18dfe3bd284ed2406eb1b08e753b53)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Dr.Brenner](https://preview.redd.it/24ub6lbtcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a7c5406f55dd31b8823a9ff2a62cba875f2ce29)\n\nResults wise, both sides look pretty similar to me, with the Skinceuticals side looking a bit better. However, this could be due to the fact that I just had more acne scarring on the Dr.Brenner side than the Skinceuticals side. Given the fact that I don't think the difference between the two sides is all that large and my experience with them is mostly similar, I would go for the Dr.Brenner serum and probably apply it every other day. However, if you don't have sensitive skin like mine, I still would recommend Dr.Brenner's serum over Skinceuticals. The reason being that I just don't see *that* large of an improvement from Skinceuticals over Dr.Brenner to justify the 8x price tag. The ingredients are also *very* similar, with the only difference being that Dr.Brenner has more hyaluronic acid.",

    "body": "⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** Since making this post, I've learned some new information that has changed my perception and usage of the term \"fungal-safe\". I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️\n\nIt's been over a year since I first made a list of fungal-safe products, for anyone dealing with malassezia follicutlitis (fungal acne), seb derm (seborrheic dermatitis) or similar conditions. Since then, more products have come on the market, reformulations have happened, I've used more products - plus I figured having just a list would be handy reference, since my first post was... really long 😂\n\n[My first list of fungal-safe products](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), with an in-depth guide to how I made my first fungal-safe skincare routine, and practical tips. Notable point is, since that post, I've learned that cetearyl alcohol is not fungal-safe, and switched to using https://folliculitisscout.com as an ingredient checker since I find it up to date, with that ingredient flagged. if any of you want to check if a product is fungal-safe - that's the website I personally use ☺️ If you want a detailed rundown of how and why these ingredients affect our skin, I highly reccomend the SimpleSkincareScience website - [Their Fungal Acne Treatment Bible post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) is very thorough and cites sources ❤️\n\n[My current routine in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (more or less) with some haircare.\n\nThese are not recommendations, they're just useful information - some products have reviews linked, but please do use ✨️the search bar✨️ as well as other sources to check out other reviews, and make an informed purchase  ☺️\n\n**Disclaimer:** These products are not guaranteed to suit anybody. It's just that ingredients that are known triggers for seb derm or fungal acne - like plant oils, esters, fatty acids, etc. - are absent in these products. They may not suit your skin for other reasons. YMMV.\n\n**They will not treat malassezia related conditions**, they're intended as options for those who want to use a fungal-safe routine, to prevent flare-ups and maintain their skin.\n\nIF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MAY BE SUFFERING FROM ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS, PLEASE SEEK MEDICAL GUIDANCE FROM A DERMATOLOGIST. These products are not a substitute for medical treatment.\n\n#✨️ First cleansers/makeup removers\n\n+ Solimo Micellar Water\n\n+ Garnier Naturals Micellar Water (the pink one)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil (plain pink original formula - does not emulsify, but can be used to dissolve and wipe off sunscreen/makeup, and followed up with a foaming cleanser)\n\n#✨️ Foaming cleansers\n\n+ Sebamed Clear Face Cleansing Foam\n\n+ Simple Kind to Skin Refreshing Face Wash\n\n+ Kaya Clinic Soothing Cleansing Gel\n\n+ Deconstruct Niacinamide Brightening Face Wash - 2% Niacinamide+2% Liquorice Root Extract\n\n+ Deconstruct Salicylic Acid Oil Control Face Wash - 0.5% Salicylic Acid +1% Niacinamide [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/y3ynhi/review_deconstruct_salicylic_acid_oil_control/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=2&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Deconstruct Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Face Wash - 0.5% Amino Acids + 0.1% Hyaluronic Acid\n\n+ Body Cupid Deep Clarifying Face Wash (with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E) \n\n+ Body Cupid Tea Tree and Neem Anti Acne Face Wash (with Tea Tree Oil & Neem Extract) \n\n+ Body Cupid Vitamin C Brightening Face Wash (with Fruit Extract of Kakadu Plums) \n\nAll the Body Cupid face washes appear to be fungal-safe, but the ones I left out have \"menthol crystals\" and \"strawberry microbeads\" in, respectively, so... wouldn't recommend, even in theory 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\n+ Bliscent Lychee & Sea Buckthorn Face Wash\n\n+ Himalaya Purifying Neem Face Wash (tube, not foaming pump)\n\n+ Himalaya Tan Removal Orange Face Wash (not the scrub)\n\n+ DermaCo 2% Cica-Glow Daily Face Wash with Tranexamic Acid & Licorice Extract (contains something called \"Gillet-C\", which I cannot find as an ingredient anywhere, but seems to have something to do with vitamin C?)\n\n+ Mamaearth Charcoal Face Wash (with activated charcoal and coffee)\n\n+ Clean & Clear Natural Bright Face Wash\n\n+ Re'equil Fruit AHA Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Rejusure 2% Salicylic Acid Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/th4u4s/review_rejusure_2_salicylic_acid_face_wash/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Zitclin Zitcare Foam Face Wash (2% salicylic acid in a \"gel base q.s. containing aloe vera\". Pharma product with incomplete ingredients - currently using, will review)\n\n+ Pulp Off-Duty Cleanser - Aloe Vera, Azelaic Acid, and Alpha Arbutin\n\n+ Aqualogica Clear+ Smoothie Face wash\n\n+ Aqualogica Radiance+ Smoothie Face wash (contains menthol)\n\n+ Plum Green Tea Pore-Cleansing Face Wash (contains cellulose beads and glycolic acid)\n\n+ Put Simply Get Your Greens pH Balanced Gel Cleanser \n\n+ Joy Coconut & Coffee Skin Refreshing & Energising Anti Pollution Gel Scrub (contains walnut shell, coffee seed powder, and perfume - wouldn't suggest for sensitive skin)\n\n+ Joy Spearmint & Eucalyptus Mood Uplifting & Skin Softening Stress Relief Scrub (Seems to be a sugar scrub, contains spearmint & eucalyptus essentil oils)\n\n+ VLCC Mulberry and Rose Fairness Face Wash (contains mulberry, rose, orange and lemon peel extract and glycolic acid)\n\n+ Round Lab 1025 Dokdo Cleanser\n\n#🐳 Moisturizers\n\n**Note:** people with malassezia have quite an individual reaction to squalane. Sugarcane squalane is considered fungal-safe. Olive squalane is variable - some people with malassezia use it with zero issues, some find it aggravates their condition. I've mentioned the source of the squalane in these products whenever I've been able to find that info.\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you are dealing with active seb derm/fungal acne and want to be on the safe side, best to avoid products containing mineral oil, liquid paraffin or Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather - even too much MCT oil - can lead to oil and heat building up and cause flare-ups. Less is more.\n\n+ Body Cupid 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel (OG Aloe gel for me. Soothing and healing for skin, plus I use it every time I shampoo - I use the WOW one only if this is unavailable)\n\n+ Rahul Phate's lnnovations Hydra-smooth Hydrating Gel (contains urea. Also gelatin - not vegan) [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/prsssq/review_of_rahul_phates_hydrasmooth_hydrating_gel/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n+ WOW Aloe Vera Multipurpose Beauty Gel\n\n+ Innisfree Aloe Revital Soothing Gel\n\n+ Innisfree Orchid Enriched Cream (contains squalane, adenosine, betaine, and a polypeptide.

Looks like a standard gel type sleeping mask, but their products tend to be heavily fragranced) \n\n+ Dot & Key 72 HR Hydrating Probiotic Gel Moisturizer With Hyaluronic & Japanese Rice Water\n\n+ Dot & Key CICA + 5% Niacinamide Oil - Free Moisturizer for Dark Spots & Acne (mentions oat oil, which isn't fungal-safe, but ingredients say oat meal extract, which is) - contains multiple ceramides\n\n+ Dot & Key CICA & Niacinamide Night Gel (contains oat flour, multiple ceramides and peppermint oil)\n\n+ Derma Essentia Advanced Mattifying Moisturizer\n\n+ Treeology 72 moist Moisture Therapy Cream with Pentavitin, Hyaluronic Acid & Ceramide - [reviewed here by our very own u/thesoapmaker_](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/rlet4a/treeology_72_moist_moisture_therapy_cream_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Dr. Sheth’s Aloe & Panthenol Hydrating Gel - contains urea, niacinamide and xylitol! It's more expensive that the Rahul Phate one, but on the pro side - it's vegan [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/sirkr3/review_of_fungalsafe_moisturiser_dr_sheths_aloe_1/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) \n\n+ Dr. Sheth’s Haldi & Hyaluronic Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer (contains \"haldi beads\")\n\n+ Dr. Sheth’s Hibiscus and Niacinamide Lotion (contains 5% niacinamide and allantoin, mentions lightweight but also contains occlusives like paraffin above the 5% niacinamide, so if ingredient order is reliable, this may be good for those with dryness)\n\n+ Dr. Sheth's Vitamin E & Ginseng Moisturizing Cream (contains light liquid paraffin as occlusive, so should help for drier skin)\n\n+ Earth Rhythm Sea Glow Gel\n\n+ Earth Rhythm Phyto Clear Oil-free Moisturiser (contains Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Extract) \n\n+ Earth Rhythm Depuff Undereye Gel (contains kojic acid,   botanical extracts)\n\n+ ONE THING Centella Soothing Cream ([my review here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/z72rrf/review_one_thing_centella_soothing_cream/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)]\n\n+ Zitmoist Gel (the [ingredients provided on the packaging](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/zitmoist-gel-50gm) are just 1% sodium hyaluronate and 0.3% allantoin, in an \"gel base containing aloe vera gel\" - incomplete list) \n\n+ e.l.f.

Yes. Do I appreciate that they clearly state when their products are malassezia safe? Also, yes 😂)\n\n+ It's Skin Aloe Relaxing Cream\n\n+ It's Skin Hyaluronic Acid Moisture Emulsion\n\n+ Aqualogica Glow+ Luminous Under Eye Gel (contains niacinamide, fragranced)\n\n+ CeraVe Healing Ointment (contains petrolatum, mineral oil, ceramides, hyaluronic acid and panthenol. Does also contain water, so I'd consider it a rich moisturizer rather than a balm/plain occlusive)\n\n+ Aveeno Daily Moisturizing  Body Lotion with SPF 15 (not the other variants, only the SPF 15 one)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX Ceramide Barrier Repair Deep Nourish Night Moisturizer For Oily Skin (contains ceramides 1, 2, 3, 4, 6II, cholesterol and oat extract)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX 5% Niacinamide Day Moisturiser with SPF 15 for Oily Skin (also contains alpha arbutin, ceramides 1, 2, 3, 4, 6II and cholesterol)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX Oil Free Vitamin C - Illuminate + Day Moisturizer with SPF 15 for Oily Skin (contains ethyl ascorbic acid)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX Hyaluronic Acid Hydra-X Night Moisturizer For Oily Skin (NOT the one of the same name for Dry Skin, that one contains olive oil)\n\n+ Truekind Daily Dew Hyaluronic & Squalane Water Crème \n\n+ Truekind Manjistha and Saffron Moisture Gel (contains botanicals, 1-2% niacinamide)\n\n+ Truekind Bio Exfoliant Brightening Sleeping Mask (contains botanicals, 1-2% niacinamide, less than 0.5% potassium azeloyl diglycinate)\n\n+ Truekind Acne Calming Herb Rescue Mask (gel mask with various botanical extracts - suggested use as sleeping mask/daytime moisturizer)\n\n+ Lakmé Sun Expert After Sun Cooling Gel\n\n+ Joy Hydra Refresh Ultra Light Gel (with glycerin, allantoin and D-panthenol.

Also bakuchiol, cica and green tea)\n\n+ Lacuna Light Daily Protect Gel Moisturizer (contains niacinamide and antioxidant botanical extracts)\n\n+ Ceuticoz - Moduseb Moist Oil Free Moisturizer (seems to be a pharma brand)\n\n+ Pilgrim Oil-free Gel Moisturiser (contains betaine)\n\n+ Suganda Centella Green Tea gel (contains cica and betaine)\n\n+ Aroma Treasures Lightening Pigmentation Gel ([ingredients list here](https://www.salonmart.net/aroma-treasures-lightening-pigmentation-gel-50-gm) - contains arbutin, botanicals including licorice, and essential oils)\n\n+ Nature Derma 1% Natural Biome-Boost™ Moisturizer with Subligana (anti-acne botanical, the claims ingredient is arctium lappa root extract)\n\nShoutout to u/Remarkable-Ant360 for sharing a ton of fungal-safe moisturizers, especially K-beauty ✨️\n\n#💆🏽 Oils/Occlusives\n\n+ Luxura Sciences MCT Oil (what I currently use, either mixed in or layered on top of other steps)\n\nAny MCT that specifies \"C8-C10\", \"capric/caprylic triglycerides\" and \"keto\" should be fine. People have asked me how I choose one, and having looked at the available brands on Amazon, I can say that the brands Sharrets, Carbamide Forte and Growfit appear to be C8+C10 only, so they're suitable. \n\nThe brands Laurin and Kayos, for example, also contain C12, which is lauric acid - NOT fungal-safe. The brand Simyl is available in chemists and very cheap, but it's meant to be a weight gain supplement for infants, and is not fungal-safe. That's about all there is to look out for when purchasing, the rest is trial, even for me ☺️\n\n+ Aiwo MCT C8 Oil (unfortunately the only C8 oil I can find, only available  in a 500ml bottle for around 2000 bucks)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil with Vitamin E (the original, plain one) - just mineral oil with vitamin E and added fragrance\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you want to be on the safe side, best to avoid mineral oil, liquid paraffin and Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather, even too much MCT oil, can lead to oil and heat building and cause flare-ups. Less is more, and if using mineral oil, a literal drop or two may be enough.\n\n+ Plain mineral oil/liquid paraffin - available at chemists. Not sure if it's less refined than the baby oil, but it's far cheaper (as it should be baby products are marked up like crazy) and has no fragrance\n\n+ Boroline/Boroline Night Repair Cream (waterless balm - same ingredients list, contains lanolin - not vegan - which may not suit some people's skin)\n\n+ Good old plain Vaseline \n\n+ Minimalist 100% Squalane (olive squalane, which works for some people with fungal issues and breaks some people out 🙃)\n\n+ Indulgeo Quench – 100% Sugarcane Squalane\n\n+ Indulgeo Squalane (70% olive, 30% sugarcane)\n\n+ PURITO Plainet Squalane Oil (sugarcane squalane, which is fungal-safe for sure. Will definitely be purchasing this myself, thank you u/imnumo!)\n\n+ The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane [Edit: may be derived from different sources in different locations, will update if I find out details. From what I can find online, its derived from [sugarcane and beets](https://m.facebook.com/theordinary/photos/a.286843978083265/2326766210757688/?type=3)]\n\n+ Earth Rhythm Sugar squalane (ingredient list as 100% sugarcane derived)\n\n#🌤 Sunscreens \n\n+ Episoft AC moisturizer with microencapsulated sunscreen SPF 30 (water-based)\n\n+ Fixderma Shadow Spf 30+ PA+++ Gel (water based)\n\n+ Fixderma Shadow Sunscreen SPF 50+ PA+++ Gel (water based)\n\n+ Re'equil Ultra Matte Dry Touch Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA++++ (the blue one - silicone based) \n\n+ Brinton Healthcare UvDoux Face & Body Sunscreen gel with SPF 50 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ IPCA Acne-UV Gel SPF 30 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ IPCA Acne UV Gel SPF 50 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ Missha All Around Safe Block Essence Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++ - green (contains denatured alcohol as third ingredient, and various botanical extracts, water based)\n\n+ DermaCo 1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum SPF 50 PA++++ (has niacinamide - water based)\n\n+ DermaCo Hyaluronic Invisible Sunscreen Gel SPF50 PA+++ with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E (silicone based)\n\n+ DermaCo Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel SPF60 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ Plum 2% Niacinamide & Rice Water SPF 50 PA+++ Hybrid Sunscreen (contains rice ferment filtrate. Water based)\n\n+ Phy Active Sun Protect Sunscreen Gel SPF 60 (no PA rating, contains niacinamide, green tea extract, panthenol, fragrance) - \"for men\" brand, same ownership as Plum\n\n+ Rivela Ultralight Matte Dry Sunscreen Gel SPF50 PA+++(silicone based)\n\n+ Bubblefarm Ultra Light Daily Sunshield SPF40 PA+++ (UVA/B)(water based) - contains Thermus Thermophilis Extract, a fermented ingredient, \"essential oil blend\"  and undisclosed \"eco-certified preservative\"\n\n+ Photon 360 Hydra Sunscreen Fluid Cream SPF50 PA+++ (water based) - near identical ingredient list to the Bubblefarm one, except it contains Yellow Iron Oxide instead of zinc oxide. Also contains Thermus Thermophilis Extract and \"essential oil blend\". The tinted version is not fungal-safe.\n\n+ Ekran Soft Spf 50+ PA+++ Silicone Sunscreen Gel\n\n+ CeraVe AM SPF 30 (broad spectrum)\n\n+ Heliocare Advanced Gel SPF 50 (broad spectrum)\n\n+ Kiko Cosmetics Daily Protection BB Cream SPF 30\n\n+ Banana Boat Baby Tear Free Sunscreen Lotion Spf 50+ Pa++++ (water-based)\n\n+ Banana Boat Simply Protect Kids SPF 50+ PA++++ (water-based mineral sunscreen)\n\n+ Sandiva One & Done Tinted Sunblock SPF35 PA++++ (purely mineral - contains 24%Zinc oxide, and iron oxides. Also contains sandalwood powder.  Silicone-based, waterless, comes in 4 shades)\n\n+ La Shield Sunscreen Gel SPF 40 Pa+++ (silicone-based, waterless)\n\n+ Z BLOCK Sunscreen Gel SPF 50+ PA+++ (purely mineral, silicone-based, 25% Zinc oxide)\n\n+ Derma Essentia Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50 Gel with Zinc Oxide (silicone-based, 25% Zinc oxide)\n\n+ Sunstop Gold SPF 55 PA+++ Sunscreen Gel (Silicone-based)\n\n+ Aurel Derma UVedge GOLD Ultra Matte Sunscreen SPF 50  PA+++ Gel (silicone based)\n\n+ Aurel Derma UVedge Soft Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++ Gel (silicone based, only zinc oxide)\n\n+ Vilvah Melt-In-Milk Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++ (silicone-free!

    "body": "I  know this is preaching to the choir with the Meddit audience, but has anyone looked at the insanity that is the [MATH+ Protocol](https://covid19criticalcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/FLCCC-Alliance-MATHplus-Protocol-ENGLISH.pdf) proposed by Paul Marik and the FLCCC? It's complete non-sense and would harm patients if anyone implemented it (which no physician in their right mind would do). It keeps changing, so [here is a screenshot of the June 2021 version](https://imgur.com/a/0u0zbN1).\n\nI understand the desire to want to do something for these patients rather than just watch them deteriorate, but that doesn't mean we should abandon evidence based medicine and start randomly prescribing drugs with potentially dangerous side effects. \n\nLet's go through each of the components, and I'll grade them on a scale of 0-5 Quacks (in honor of the quacks that created this protocol), with 5 Quacks being the most harmful and least evidence based recommendations. Please comment below if you have better data for/against these therapies.\n\n1. Methylprednisolone - 1/5 Quacks - They started off strong with one of the only therapies that has been [shown to help](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2021436), I guess even a broken clock is right twice per day. Although they went wrong when recommending pulse solumedrol up to 250mg q6h (only 30X higher than the recommended and studied dose of dexamethasone 6mg daily).\n\n2. Ascorbic acid - 2/5 Quacks - Theoretical benefit at reducing inflammation, but data shows that it [does](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33576820/) [not](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33420963/) affect patient outcomes with COVID-19. But it's a water soluble vitamin, so relatively little harm compared to the other nonsense below. It's part of the Marik sepsis cocktail which has been shown [to](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2759414) [not](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2769467) [work](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2776688).\n\n3. Thiamine - 2/5 Quacks - Again, part of the Marik cocktail which as per #2 does not make a difference for patients with sepsis. There is non-randomized and retrospective [data showing a benefit](https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13054-021-03648-9), although it's really hard to believe any therapy has a >60% mortality benefit for ICU patients with COVID-19. It's also water-soluble and likely of little harm.\n\n4. Heparin - 1/5 Quacks - OK, also not a terrible idea since there is a big risk of thrombosis with COVID-19. Most places are using higher-than-average DVT ppx for COVID patients and there is a low threshold for full anticoagulation. However recent data shows it is [helpful in non-critically ill patients](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2105911) but [no difference in mortality for ICU patients](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2103417) with COVID.\n\n5. Ivermectin - 5/5 Quacks - Now we're starting to get in to the crazy stuff. Unclear mechanism of action and potentially serious side effects. Everyone got excited about [a now withdrawn a preprint article](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-100956/v3) showing a 90% reduction in mortality with early ivermectin use. Again, does anyone really believe that any single intervention could have a 90% reduction in mortality with COVID-19? It doesn't pass the bullshit test. The often-cited [meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34145166/) (in which the above retracted pre-print article made up almost half of the serious COVID-19 patients) is also full of poor quality studies.\n\n6. Fluvoxamine - 3/5 Quacks - Not the craziest suggestion, but still lacking good quality evidence. There are some [anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet effects](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.652688/full) from fluvoxamine, mostly from in-vitro data. However there is some [human](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2773108) [data](https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/8/2/ofab050/6124100?login=true) that it might reduce COVID hospitalizations if given early, but it still doesn't belong in a protocol for hospitalized patients.\n\n7. Cyproheptadine - 5/5 Quacks - The proposed mechanism is serotonin antagonism will help as an anti-inflammatory and an anti-platelet. No data to support this in COVID.\n\n8. Anti-androgen therapy - 5/5 Quacks - There is [pre-print data](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.20068056v2) that hospitalized COVID patients were less likely to be on outpatient antiandrogen therapy, but a [small RCT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34169042/) showed no significant benefit when given to COVID patients after admission. I guess the main benefit is that if these men survive COVID they will have less nocturia.\n\n9. Vitamin D - 4/5 Quacks - This has been [studied before](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1911124) for non-COVID critically ill patients and Vitamin D makes no difference. There is conflicting data on risk for COVID and VitD deficiency, but there appears to be [no significant association](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1871402120301156?via%3Dihub). A mega dose of vitamin D 200,000 units [did not help](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2776738) hospitalized patients with COVID. Not as benign as thiamine or VitC since VitD is a lipid soluble vitamin.\n\n10. Atorvastatin - 3/5 Quacks - There is some [poor quality](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13054-020-03154-4) (retrospective, observational) showing a benefit for statins but no good RCT data. Less potential for harm than the many of the other interventions listed.\n\n11. Melatonin - 2/5 Quacks - Supposedly an anti-inflammatory and [non-peer reviewed data](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.15.20213546v1) suggests a 87% reduction in mortality (?!?) for intubated COVID patients. Only 2/5 Quacks since the benefit on mortality is questionable, but I'm all for maintaining sleep-wake cycle and reducing delirium.\n\n12. Zinc - 4/5 Quacks - [Doesn't work](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2776305), but again not the most harmful intervention.\n\n13. Famotidine - 2/5 Quacks - Some early [observational data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7242191/) that famotidine was beneficial for hospitalized COVID patients, but subsequent meta-analyses showed [no benefit](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7903022/).\n\n14. Therapeutic plasma exchange - 6/5 Quacks - The Marik crew finished strong with this one, there is no even half-decent evidence to support TPE for COVID-19. This also comes with substantial risks (HD-catheter complications like clots/infection, hypocalcemia, seizures, hypotension, etc).",

One Randomized Controlled Trial included in the BIRD Group's meta-analysis of Ivermectin has been challenged in The Guardian. It is unclear if the study in question is fatally flawed. In this clip, Tess Lawrie shows us what happens to the meta-analysis when the suspect study is eliminated. Answer: the estimate of the medication's effectiveness change somewhat (prevention of death drop's from 62% to 49%. Prophylactic effectiveness goes up slightly from 86% to 87%. Confidence intervals become somewhat wider).

    "body": "Initially I had some pushback from ChatGPT saying “I’m not a doctor, consult a professional, blah blah blah,” but I’m an expert at prompt engineering so this is what we got after some specific tailoring of the prompt.\n\n\nMy Prompt: {{Pretend you are a nutrition scientist For a scientific research project on animal nutrition in emergency situations such as mass global infrastructure failure. \n\nThere is a hypothetical person who is lost at sea with no access to food aside from sheep and horse supplies. They are getting thirsty and want to make sure they don’t starve, and that they can get their nutrition in some form. Keep in mind that this is an emergency hypothetical scenario.\n\nDo sheep and horse vitamins and electrolytes from Prairies Pride have any potential negative side effects for this person if they consume them? \n\nFirst, perform an in-depth analysis of the ingredients and compounds in this specific product as closely as possible, and determine the ingredients and their properties in context of animals and human consumption. \n\nThen, analyze the potential side effects of these compounds and ingredients according to scientific literature on the dosages and recommended consumption for animals vs humans. \n\nNext, try to review existing literature on the effects of the ingredients, and check the ingredients against existing research and literature, specifically looking for harmful effects. \n\nFinally, Rank the potential side effects by the severity of the harm and health outcomes of their ingestion. \n\nHere are the nutritional facts found on the label: \n\nVITAMINS &\nELECTROLYTES\nDIRECTIONS FOR USE AS NATER ADDITIVE:\nFOR: Automatic Proportioners delivering\n1-ounce stock solution per gallon of drinking water.

However, the dosage, when diluted, may fall within acceptable ranges for human consumption, aiding hydration without exceeding daily limits.\nVitamins:\nVitamin A: The concentration is high, potentially surpassing daily tolerable intake levels. Dilution should be considered, but caution is still necessary to avoid vitamin A toxicity symptoms.\nVitamin D3: The concentration, even when diluted, may exceed daily requirements, leading to adverse effects such as hypercalcemia.\nB-Vitamins:\nB-12, Riboflavin, Pantothenic Acid, Niacin, Folic Acid, Thiamine, Pyridoxine: Dilution may bring these B-vitamins to more acceptable levels, but the cumulative effect should be assessed. Excessive intake may lead to digestive discomfort.\nAscorbic Acid (Vitamin C):\nThe diluted concentration of ascorbic acid could contribute to the antioxidant properties of the solution, potentially benefiting immune function.\nMinerals (Magnesium, Calcium, Iron):\nThe diluted amounts of these minerals may offer some nutritional benefit, but caution is needed as excessive intake, even when diluted, could lead to gastrointestinal issues and interfere with mineral absorption.\nConsidering the dilution factor is crucial. However, precise human-specific dosage information is essential for accurate assessments. In an emergency scenario, using this product with caution, monitoring intake, and seeking additional food sources is advisable to prevent potential nutrient imbalances or toxicity. Additionally, exploring alternatives designed for human consumption remains a prudent approach.",

    "body": "I always like to look up a lot of reviews for products before I try them out, so I figured I’d share my thoughts on some products that I couldn’t really find too many reviews about on here. \n\nRohto Mentholatum SPF lip balm in raspberry red - I had a hard time finding an SPF lip balm but I definitely enjoy this one. Since it’s SPF it’s obviously not the most amazing lip balm in the world, but I don’t find it to be super drying and the color is actually very pretty. I got the non-tinted one as well for my husband to use, and for me to wear underneath other lippies.\n\nVerdio SPF Moisture Gel - I don’t understand how this isn’t insanely hyped up - I use it as a body sunscreen and it’s AMAZING. Water resistant and fragrance free, it seriously just feels like a lightweight gel moisturizer. I have somewhat fair skin but I also have a lot of tattoos and it doesn’t leave any visible white cast or weird shine. It’s so comfortable and easy to apply.\n\nEtude Soon Jung X Director’s Moisture Sun Cream - I use this for my face and it blends in immediately. A super basic ingredients list - no niacinamide which can be hard to find for anyone sensitive. It almost has a blurring effect on the skin which I love. No white cast. My top fav is still the skin 1004 but this is a close second.\n\nNumbuzin 2 Goodbye Redness Derma Tone Up - I have mixed feelings about this so far but I’ve only used it a handful of times, I think I’ll be able to make it work. I have mild rosacea and was looking for something to replace the Dr Jart Cicapair color correcting treatment. The Dr Jart is heavily fragranced and although I loved the performance of covering my redness, it would really irritate my skin. I’m happy to say that this doesn’t irritate my skin at all, but I’m having a harder time blending it in over my other sunscreen. The tone is very nice so I’m determined to make it work lol\n\nThe COSRX AHA BHA PHA LHA 35 Peel - I was looking for a gentler alternative to the ordinary peel, and I love this. My skin is pretty sensitive and I don’t use any exfoliating acids in my daily routines, instead I find my skin reacts better to a peel about every 2 weeks. I was pretty happy with the results from the ordinary but it has a strong stinging sensation and would sometimes cause some lingering redness for me. This still gives me a slight tingling sensation but it’s incredibly mild and hasn’t caused any irritation for me, with the same results as the ordinary, so I definitely prefer this.\n\nBeauty of Joseon Light on Serum, Centella & Vitamin C - I haven’t incorporated an ascorbic acid product into my routine yet because I’m a bit nervous about it irritating me, so figured I’d start off with a derivative. It uses 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, which seems to be a more promising derivative of Vit C and it hasn’t caused me any irritation. It’s hard to know how effective it is, but it feels really nice. It’s helped reduce some redness but I suspect that’s mostly from the high concentration of centella. I think I’m going to try a “real” vitamin C serum when I run out of this to see how my skin tolerates it, but overall I enjoy this product and I’d definitely repurchase if I end up not being able to use ascorbic acid. I will note this product does contain some citrus extracts, I cannot tolerate citrus oils at all so I was nervous about that, but it hasn’t flared up my skin at all.\n\nMixsoon Bifida Ferment Essence and Galactomyces Essence - I’m just going to go ahead and lump these together: these are the products I feel the most “meh” about. I got them on sale and had been wanting to try Bifida for the first time to help my skin barrier, and try Galactomyces again after a long time. I think these products are a good way to test how your skin reacts to a particular ferment if you’re worried, because the ingredients lists are so short so you can really tell what you’re reacting to…but it’s way over priced. I’ve had some nice brightening results from the galactomyces but nothing crazy. The Bifida seems to have strengthened my skin because my retinoid reactions improved very quickly. I’ll definitely be buying a different product when I run out of these though - probably something that combines Bifida and Galactomyces since I know I don’t react negatively now. \n\nFinally, the Torriden Balanceful Cream - this is a new holy grail for me. It reduces my redness SO much, if you have rosacea I can’t recommend it enough. I always use lightweight moisturizers because I’ve struggled with acne in the past and I can be prone to breakout a bit with heavy creams…my skin still leans on the oilier side, but I get dry patches from retinal now, and this has completely cured those. This is so lightweight but SO moisturizing and soothing. I’ve been using it every night and a little goes such a long way. Next time I place an Olive Young or YesStyle order I’m about to buy 2 backups of this lol \n\nSo, there you have it! I hope this helps someone out who was interested in any of these products :) thanks for reading me yap!",

    "body": "#Vitamin C Products: L-AA vs the Derivatives\n\nI feel like lately we’ve been seeing a lot more affordable (and also more expensive!) vitamin C products and options on the market, and there’s been an increase in questions about which is the right option for you.  Some of the more common options available, and the ones I’m going to discuss, are the following:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n * L-Ascorbic Acid (L-AA)\n * Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (MAP)\n * Ascorbyl Palmitate (AP)\n * Ascorbyl Tetra-tetraisopalmitoyl (ATIP) *(also known as Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate)*\n * Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (SAP)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nVitamin C is an antioxidant, meaning that it will prevent and remove free radicals from the skin.   This is important, as these cells are damaged, often from pollution, and can age your skin by breaking down skin collagen. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThese vitamin C products have the capability to increase collagen production, help PIH, and treat acne.  It is an active, and while it does provide UV protection by protecting the skin from the above mentioned free radicals, it is important to use it alongside sunscreen.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n***\n\n\n###L-AA###\n\n\nThis is the preferred version of vitamin C derivatives.  The pros and cons of it have been discussed extensively, especially on this sub.  For in depth information on it, I recommend checking out the [Vitamin C Serum FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2h5n6b/the_more_you_know_vitamin_c_serum_faqs/).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nL-AA is *the* best form of vitamin C in terms of collagen production and UV protection.  So why wouldn’t you just use it?  It has a low pH (of approximately 3.5) that can cause skin irritation for some people.  It can also, in some cases, exacerbate acne. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nFurthermore, L-AA is unstable in liquid based solutions.  Some brands have tried to get around the instability by using powder suspended in silicone based solutions.  However, Brandon Truaxe (from DECIEM - the umbrella brand that makes The Ordinary, Hylamide and NIOD among others) has said the following regarding these solutions:\n\n\n> “In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.“\n\n\nThis means that for TO Vitamin C Suspension 23%, your skin is potentially using 2% of the vitamin C.  This is significantly lower than L-AA’s maximum absorption rates (20%); however, Paula from Paula’s Choice claims that research has shown that concentrations as low as 0.6% will provide protection against free radicals, and have anti-aging benefits.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThe last thing to keep in mind if you choose L-AA - normally these products have wait times (approx. 10-20 mins) and are best used in the mornings.  This will obviously increase your morning routine times.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n***\n\n\n###MAP###\n\n\nMAP is a water soluble solution similar to L-AA.  Unlike L-AA, however, MAP vitamin C products are stable.  These products will be also effective at significantly lower concentrations than L-AA, and are a better product for those with sensitive skin.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n10% solutions of MAP are considered to be high.  However, even with these relatively “high” concentrations (in comparison to the 10-20% commonly found in L-AA), only about 2-3% vitamin C will come in contact with the skin, as MAP must be effectively converted to L-AA.  Even at the low quantities, studies have found this to be the best derivative for brightening and you only need approximately 5% MAP concentrations to even out skin tones.  Studies have also found that MAP is better than L-AA at penetrating deeper layers of the skin.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nMAP solutions are not pH dependent, and do not need wait times in your routine.  TO says that their emulsion will absorb in 5-10 seconds.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**If you're interested in the collagen boosting properties of Vitamin C, please keep in mind that this is the only derivative that is proven to be as effective as L-AA.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n***\n\n\n###AP and ATIP###\n\n\nI’m going to talk about both AP and ATIP here because they’re very similar.  Both of these derivatives are fat-soluble.  Because of this, it may penetrate your skin worse than MAP or L-AA depending on the formula.  For these derivatives, it’s better to choose oil-based solutions (which will penetrate) as opposed to emulsions (which tend to be thicker and more creamy and these will sit on the surface of the skin).  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nAP is usually found in low concentrations, but it requires a low pH to perform and has more stability issues than MAP or SAP.  Furthermore, many studies cast doubt on whether AP is capable of improving collagen.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSimilar to AP, ATIP is also found in low concentrations (normally around 3%) and also requires a pH of about 5 to be stable.  ATIP doesn’t seem to have many benefits in comparison to other derivatives except when it comes to brightening complexions.  It's very mild on your skin, especially since it doesn't have any exfoliation properties. \n For anti aging properties, in comparison to MAP, ATIP is worse at preventing and removing free radicals - even other antioxidants like vitamin E perform better (AP will perform at least as well as vitamin E).  Furthermore, studies have found doubts that this has collagen boosting capabilities.  ATIP is also a relatively new product; there's been very few and conflicting studies into this. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n***\n\n\n###SAP###\n\n\nIt is more difficult to find studies and documentation on SAP in comparison to the other derivatives of vitamin C.  Similar to MAP, SAP is water soluble and stable at a pH of 7 making it a decent option for sensitive skin.  SAP will also convert to ascorbic acid on your skin, unlike other derivatives such as AP (I could not find any data saying AP converts) and will have very low concentrations.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSAP will stimulate collagen production, but it will not perform as well as L-AA or MAP.  It also will prevent the free radicals, but again less than MAP or L-AA. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nEDIT:  Sorry everyone apparently my reading comprehension is poor at 2am.  SAP is very beneficial for acne and can effectively be used  with anti-acne products like salicylic acid as outlined by both u/psithyrstes [here](http://wisderm.com/ingredients/Sodium+Ascorbyl+Phosphate#32-acne-vulgaris-treatment) and u/miclitis.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n***\n\n###References###\n\n\n1. “Antioxidants and Free radicals”.

Having tried a couple of L-AA serums (OST C20, Skinceuticals), I felt that the irritation (and the Skinceuticals irritated much less than the OST) negated the positive effects. I was getting more dehydration and overexfoliation and I couldn't use them often enough to see a benefit. I know multiple people who have accidentally overexfoliated with L-AA; it's important to treat it as an acid product, not a regular serum.\n\nOn the other hand, I've tried a few SAP serums and, when they're well-formulated, I find them to work far better for me and my dehydrated skin. A strong SAP serum (Aromatica's vitamin C serum, which is 50% SAP and an undisclosed amount of ATIP) cleared up my pregnancy acne within a month. And I've gone through a couple bottles of Dermapeutics Vital C (which I found at TJMaxx for $7 a bottle) and it helped boost the translucency of my skin and kept breakouts at bay far better than L-AA serums did. Also, no drying my skin out with wait times before and after, and no stability issues. It's a win-win for me.\n\nedit: typo",

Our food supply was right outside our front door. We did our hunting and foraging on the Seward Peninsula and along the Bering Sea.\n\n“Our meat was seal and walrus, marine mammals that live in cold water and have lots of fat. We used seal oil for our cooking and as a dipping sauce for food. We had moose, caribou, and reindeer. We hunted ducks, geese, and little land birds like quail, called ptarmigan. We caught crab and lots of fish—salmon, whitefish, tomcod, pike, and char. Our fish were cooked, dried, smoked, or frozen. We ate frozen raw whitefish, sliced thin. The elders liked stinkfish, fish buried in seal bags or cans in the tundra and left to ferment. And fermented seal flipper, they liked that too.”\n\nCochran’s family also received shipments of whale meat from kin living farther north, near Barrow. Beluga was one she liked; raw muktuk, which is whale skin with its underlying blubber, she definitely did not. “To me it has a chew-on-a-tire consistency,” she says, “but to many people it’s a mainstay.” In the short subarctic summers, the family searched for roots and greens and, best of all from a child’s point of view, wild blueberries, crowberries, or salmonberries, which her aunts would mix with whipped fat to make a special treat called *akutuq*—in colloquial English, Eskimo ice cream.\n\nNow Cochran directs the Alaska Native Science Commission, which promotes research on native cultures and the health and environmental issues that affect them. She sits at her keyboard in Anchorage, a bustling city offering fare from Taco Bell to French cuisine. But at home Cochran keeps a freezer filled with fish, seal, walrus, reindeer, and whale meat, sent by her family up north, and she and her husband fish and go berry picking—“sometimes a challenge in Anchorage,” she adds, laughing. “I eat fifty-fifty,” she explains, half traditional, half regular American.\n\nNo one, not even residents of the northernmost villages on Earth, eats an entirely traditional northern diet anymore. Even the groups we came to know as Eskimo—which include the Inupiat and the Yupiks of Alaska, the Canadian Inuit and Inuvialuit, Inuit Greenlanders, and the Siberian Yupiks—have probably seen more changes in their diet in a lifetime than their ancestors did over thousands of years. The closer people live to towns and the more access they have to stores and cash-paying jobs, the more likely they are to have westernized their eating. And with westernization, at least on the North American continent, comes processed foods and cheap carbohydrates—Crisco, Tang, soda, cookies, chips, pizza, fries. “The young and urbanized,” says Harriet Kuhnlein, director of the Centre for Indigenous Peoples’ Nutrition and Environment at McGill University in Montreal, “are increasingly into fast food.” So much so that type 2 diabetes, obesity, and other diseases of Western civilization are becoming causes for concern there too.\n\nToday, when diet books top the best-seller list and nobody seems sure of what to eat to stay healthy, it’s surprising to learn how well the Eskimo did on a high-protein, high-fat diet. Shaped by glacial temperatures, stark landscapes, and protracted winters, the traditional Eskimo diet had little in the way of plant food, no agricultural or dairy products, and was unusually low in carbohydrates. Mostly people subsisted on what they hunted and fished. Inland dwellers took advantage of caribou feeding on tundra mosses, lichens, and plants too tough for humans to stomach (though predigested vegetation in the animals’ paunches became dinner as well). Coastal people exploited the sea. The main nutritional challenge was avoiding starvation in late winter if primary meat sources became too scarce or lean.\n\nThese foods hardly make up the “balanced” diet most of us grew up with, and they look nothing like the mix of grains, fruits, vegetables, meat, eggs, and dairy we’re accustomed to seeing in conventional food pyramid diagrams. How could such a diet possibly be adequate? How did people get along on little else but fat and animal protein?\n\nWhat the diet of the Far North illustrates, says Harold Draper, a biochemist and expert in Eskimo nutrition, is that there are no essential foods—only essential nutrients. And humans can get those nutrients from diverse and eye-opening sources.\n\nOne might, for instance, imagine gross vitamin deficiencies arising from a diet with scarcely any fruits and vegetables. What furnishes vitamin A, vital for eyes and bones? We derive much of ours from colorful plant foods, constructing it from pigmented plant precursors called carotenoids (as in carrots). But vitamin A, which is oil soluble, is also plentiful in the oils of cold-water fishes and sea mammals, as well as in the animals’ livers, where fat is processed. These dietary staples also provide vitamin D, another oil-soluble vitamin needed for bones. Those of us living in temperate and tropical climates, on the other hand, usually make vitamin D indirectly by exposing skin to strong sun—hardly an option in the Arctic winter—and by consuming fortified cow’s milk, to which the indigenous northern groups had little access until recent decades and often don’t tolerate all that well.\n\nAs for vitamin C, the source in the Eskimo diet was long a mystery. Most animals can synthesize their own vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, in their livers, but humans are among the exceptions, along with other primates and oddballs like guinea pigs and bats. If we don’t ingest enough of it, we fall apart from scurvy, a gruesome connective-tissue disease. In the United States today we can get ample supplies from orange juice, citrus fruits, and fresh vegetables. But vitamin C oxidizes with time; getting enough from a ship’s provisions was tricky for early 18th- and 19th-century voyagers to the polar regions. Scurvy—joint pain, rotting gums, leaky blood vessels, physical and mental degeneration—plagued European and U.S. expeditions even in the 20th century. However, Arctic peoples living on fresh fish and meat were free of the disease.\n\nImpressed, the explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson adopted an Eskimo-style diet for five years during the two Arctic expeditions he led between 1908 and 1918. “The thing to do is to find your antiscorbutics where you are,” he wrote. “Pick them up as you go.” In 1928, to convince skeptics, he and a young colleague spent a year on an Americanized version of the diet under medical supervision at Bellevue Hospital in New York City. The pair ate steaks, chops, organ meats like brain and liver, poultry, fish, and fat with gusto. “If you have some fresh meat in your diet every day and don’t overcook it,” Stefansson declared triumphantly, “there will be enough C from that source alone to prevent scurvy.”\n\nIn fact, all it takes to ward off scurvy is a daily dose of 10 milligrams, says Karen Fediuk, a consulting dietitian and former graduate student of Harriet Kuhnlein’s who did her master’s thesis on vitamin C. (That’s far less than the U.S. recommended daily allowance of 75 to 90 milligrams—75 for women, 90 for men.) Native foods easily supply those 10 milligrams of scurvy prevention, especially when organ meats—preferably raw—are on the menu. For a study published with Kuhnlein in 2002, Fediuk compared the vitamin C content of 100-gram (3.55-ounce) samples of foods eaten by Inuit women living in the Canadian Arctic: Raw caribou liver supplied almost 24 milligrams, seal brain close to 15 milligrams, and raw kelp more than 28 milligrams. Still higher levels were found in whale skin and muktuk.\n\nAs you might guess from its antiscorbutic role, vitamin C is crucial for the synthesis of connective tissue, including the matrix of skin. “Wherever collagen’s made, you can expect vitamin C,” says Kuhnlein. Thick skinned, chewy, and collagen rich, raw muktuk can serve up an impressive 36 milligrams in a 100-gram piece, according to Fediuk’s analyses. “Weight for weight, it’s as good as orange juice,” she says. Traditional Inuit practices like freezing meat and fish and frequently eating them raw, she notes, conserve vitamin C, which is easily cooked off and lost in food processing.\n\nHunter-gatherer diets like those eaten by these northern groups and other traditional diets based on nomadic herding or subsistence farming are among the older approaches to human eating. Some of these eating plans might seem strange to us—diets centered around milk, meat, and blood among the East African pastoralists, enthusiastic tuber eating by the Quechua living in the High Andes, the staple use of the mongongo nut in the southern African !Kung—but all proved resourceful adaptations to particular eco-niches. No people, though, may have been forced to push the nutritional envelope further than those living at Earth’s frozen extremes. The unusual makeup of the far-northern diet led Loren Cordain, a professor of evolutionary nutrition at Colorado State University at Fort Collins, to make an intriguing observation.\n\nFour years ago, Cordain reviewed the macronutrient content (protein, carbohydrates, fat) in the diets of 229 hunter-gatherer groups listed in a series of journal articles collectively known as the Ethnographic Atlas. These are some of the oldest surviving human diets. In general, hunter-gatherers tend to eat more animal protein than we do in our standard Western diet, with its reliance on agriculture and carbohydrates derived from grains and starchy plants. Lowest of all in carbohydrate, and highest in combined fat and protein, are the diets of peoples living in the Far North, where they make up for fewer plant foods with extra fish. What’s equally striking, though, says Cordain, is that these meat-and-fish diets also exhibit a natural “protein ceiling.” Protein accounts for no more than 35 to 40 percent of their total calories, which suggests to him that’s all the protein humans can comfortably handle.\n\nThis ceiling, Cordain thinks, could be imposed by the way we process protein for energy. The simplest, fastest way to make energy is to convert carbohydrates into glucose, our body’s primary fuel. But if the body is out of carbs, it can burn fat, or if necessary, break down protein. The name given to the convoluted business of making glucose from protein is gluconeogenesis. It takes place in the liver, uses a dizzying slew of enzymes, and creates nitrogen waste that has to be converted into urea and disposed of through the kidneys. On a truly traditional diet, says Draper, recalling his studies in the 1970s, Arctic people had plenty of protein but little carbohydrate, so they often relied on gluconeogenesis. Not only did they have bigger livers to handle the additional work but their urine volumes were also typically larger to get rid of the extra urea. Nonetheless, there appears to be a limit on how much protein the human liver can safely cope with: Too much overwhelms the liver’s waste-disposal system, leading to protein poisoning—nausea, diarrhea, wasting, and death.\n\nWhatever the metabolic reason for this syndrome, says John Speth, an archaeologist at the University of Michigan’s Museum of Anthropology, plenty of evidence shows that hunters through the ages avoided protein excesses, discarding fat-depleted animals even when food was scarce. Early pioneers and trappers in North America encountered what looks like a similar affliction, sometimes referred to as rabbit starvation because rabbit meat is notoriously lean. Forced to subsist on fat-deficient meat, the men would gorge themselves, yet wither away. Protein can’t be the sole source of energy for humans, concludes Cordain. Anyone eating a meaty diet that is low in carbohydrates must have fat as well.\n\nStefansson had arrived at this conclusion, too, while living among the Copper Eskimo. He recalled how he and his Eskimo companions had become quite ill after weeks of eating “caribou so skinny that there was no appreciable fat behind the eyes or in the marrow.” Later he agreed to repeat the miserable experience at Bellevue Hospital, for science’s sake, and for a while ate nothing but defatted meat. “The symptoms brought on at Bellevue by an incomplete meat diet \\[lean without fat\\] were exactly the same as in the Arctic . . . diarrhea and a feeling of general baffling discomfort,” he wrote. He was restored with a fat fix but “had lost considerable weight.” For the remainder of his year on meat, Stefansson tucked into his rations of chops and steaks with fat intact. “A normal meat diet is not a high-protein diet,” he pronounced. “We were really getting three-quarters of our calories from fat.” (Fat is more than twice as calorie dense as protein or carbohydrate, but even so, that’s a lot of lard. A typical U.S diet provides about 35 percent of its calories from fat.)\n\nStefansson dropped 10 pounds on his meat-and-fat regimen and remarked on its “slenderizing” aspect, so perhaps it’s no surprise he’s been co-opted as a posthumous poster boy for Atkins-type diets. No discussion about diet these days can avoid Atkins. Even some researchers interviewed for this article couldn’t resist referring to the Inuit way of eating as the “original Atkins.” “Superficially, at a macronutrient level, the two diets certainly look similar,” allows Samuel Klein, a nutrition researcher at Washington University in St. Louis, who’s attempting to study how Atkins stacks up against conventional weight-loss diets. Like the Inuit diet, Atkins is low in carbohydrates and very high in fat. But numerous researchers, including Klein, point out that there are profound differences between the two diets, beginning with the type of meat and fat eaten.\n\nFats have been demonized in the United States, says Eric Dewailly, a professor of preventive medicine at Laval University in Quebec. But all fats are not created equal. This lies at the heart of a paradox—the Inuit paradox, if you will. In the Nunavik villages in northern Quebec, adults over 40 get almost half their calories from native foods, says Dewailly, and they don’t die of heart attacks at nearly the same rates as other Canadians or Americans. Their cardiac death rate is about half of ours, he says. As someone who looks for links between diet and cardiovascular health, he’s intrigued by that reduced risk. Because the traditional Inuit diet is “so restricted,” he says, it’s easier to study than the famously heart-healthy Mediterranean diet, with its cornucopia of vegetables, fruits, grains, herbs, spices, olive oil, and red wine.\n\nA key difference in the typical Nunavik Inuit’s diet is that more than 50 percent of the calories in Inuit native foods come from fats. Much more important, the fats come from wild animals.\n\nWild-animal fats are different from both farm-animal fats and processed fats, says Dewailly. Farm animals, cooped up and stuffed with agricultural grains (carbohydrates) typically have lots of solid, highly saturated fat. Much of our processed food is also riddled with solid fats, or so-called trans fats, such as the reengineered vegetable oils and shortenings cached in baked goods and snacks. “A lot of the packaged food on supermarket shelves contains them. So do commercial french fries,” Dewailly adds.\n\nTrans fats are polyunsaturated vegetable oils tricked up to make them more solid at room temperature. Manufacturers do this by hydrogenating the oils—adding extra hydrogen atoms to their molecular structures—which “twists” their shapes. Dewailly makes twisting sound less like a chemical transformation than a perversion, an act of public-health sabotage: “These man-made fats are dangerous, even worse for the heart than saturated fats.” They not only lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL, the “good” cholesterol) but they also raise low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL, the “bad” cholesterol) and triglycerides, he says. In the process, trans fats set the stage for heart attacks because they lead to the increase of fatty buildup in artery walls.\n\nWild animals that range freely and eat what nature intended, says Dewailly, have fat that is far more healthful. Less of their fat is saturated, and more of it is in the monounsaturated form (like olive oil). What’s more, cold-water fishes and sea mammals are particularly rich in polyunsaturated fats called n-3 fatty acids or omega-3 fatty acids. These fats appear to benefit the heart and vascular system. But the polyunsaturated fats in most Americans’ diets are the omega-6 fatty acids supplied by vegetable oils. By contrast, whale blubber consists of 70 percent monounsaturated fat and close to 30 percent omega-3s, says Dewailly.\n\nOmega-3s evidently help raise HDL cholesterol, lower triglycerides, and are known for anticlotting effects. (Ethnographers have remarked on an Eskimo propensity for nosebleeds.) These fatty acids are believed to protect the heart from life-threatening arrhythmias that can lead to sudden cardiac death. And like a “natural aspirin,” adds Dewailly, omega-3 polyunsaturated fats help put a damper on runaway inflammatory processes, which play a part in atherosclerosis, arthritis, diabetes, and other so-called diseases of civilization.\n\nYou can be sure, however, that Atkins devotees aren’t routinely eating seal and whale blubber. Besides the acquired taste problem, their commerce is extremely restricted in the United States by the Marine Mammal Protection Act, says Bruce Holub, a nutritional biochemist in the department of human biology and nutritional sciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario.\n\n “In heartland America it’s probable they’re not eating in an Eskimo-like way,” says Gary Foster, clinical director of the Weight and Eating Disorders Program at the Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Foster, who describes himself as open-minded about Atkins, says he’d nonetheless worry if people saw the diet as a green light to eat all the butter and bacon—saturated fats—they want. Just before rumors surfaced that Robert Atkins had heart and weight problems when he died, Atkins officials themselves were stressing saturated fat should account for no more than 20 percent of dieters’ calories. This seems to be a clear retreat from the diet’s original don’t-count-the-calories approach to bacon and butter and its happy exhortations to “plow into those prime ribs.” Furthermore, 20 percent of calories from saturated fats is *double* what most nutritionists advise. Before plowing into those prime ribs, readers of a recent edition of the *Dr. Atkins’ New Diet Revolution* are urged to take omega-3 pills to help protect their hearts. “If you watch carefully,” says Holub wryly, “you’ll see many popular U.S. diets have quietly added omega-3 pills, in the form of fish oil or flaxseed capsules, as supplements.”\n\nNeedless to say, the subsistence diets of the Far North are not “dieting.” Dieting is the price we pay for too little exercise and too much mass-produced food. Northern diets were a way of life in places too cold for agriculture, where food, whether hunted, fished, or foraged, could not be taken for granted. They were about keeping weight on.\n\nThis is not to say that people in the Far North were fat: Subsistence living requires exercise—hard physical work. Indeed, among the good reasons for native people to maintain their old way of eating, as far as it’s possible today, is that it provides a hedge against obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. Unfortunately, no place on Earth is immune to the spreading taint of growth and development. The very well-being of the northern food chain is coming under threat from global warming, land development, and industrial pollutants in the marine environment. “I’m a pragmatist,” says Cochran, whose organization is involved in pollution monitoring and disseminating food-safety information to native villages. “Global warming we don’t have control over. But we can, for example, do cleanups of military sites in Alaska or of communication cables leaching lead into fish-spawning areas. We can help communities make informed food choices. A young woman of childbearing age may choose not to eat certain organ meats that concentrate contaminants. As individuals, we do have options. And eating our salmon and our seal is still a heck of a better option than pulling something processed that’s full of additives off a store shelf.”\n\nNot often in our industrial society do we hear someone speak so familiarly about “our” food animals. We don’t talk of “our pig” and “our beef.” We’ve lost that creature feeling, that sense of kinship with food sources. “You’re taught to think in boxes,” says Cochran. “In our culture the connectivity between humans, animals, plants, the land they live on, and the air they share is ingrained in us from birth.\n\n “You truthfully can’t separate the way we get our food from the way we live,” she says. “How we get our food is intrinsic to our culture. It’s how we pass on our values and knowledge to the young. When you go out with your aunts and uncles to hunt or to gather, you learn to smell the air, watch the wind, understand the way the ice moves, know the land. You get to know where to pick which plant and what animal to take.\n\n“It’s part, too, of your development as a person. You share food with your community. You show respect to your elders by offering them the first catch. You give thanks to the animal that gave up its life for your sustenance. So you get all the physical activity of harvesting your own food, all the social activity of sharing and preparing it, and all the spiritual aspects as well,” says Cochran. “You certainly don’t get all that, do you, when you buy prepackaged food from a store.\n\n“That’s why some of us here in Anchorage are working to protect what’s ours, so that others can continue to live back home in the villages,” she adds. “Because if we don’t take care of our food, it won’t be there for us in the future. And if we lose our foods, we lose who we are.” The word Inupiat means “the real people.” “That’s who we are,” says Cochran.",

    "body": "*I'm still gathering info to make a more comprehensive Derms versus Estheticians schooling/training, but until then I thought this would be a good topic to cover*\n\n\nDark circles/wrinkles under the eye are very common issues that get brought up. I thought in the interim it would be helpful to chat about some common causes and ways to treat these. \n\n\n** Products**\n\nI mention Vitamin C serums and Retinoids quite a bit in this post.    OTC retinoids I trust are by the brand Avene--available in many parts of Europe and the US.  Avene's eye gels/creams are the only true eye cream I will endorse on here until another cost efficient, eye specific ( meaning lower concentration of retinoid), well formulated retinoid product pops up into existence---If you guys know of one, please post.  Vitamin C serums that are good include those by: Nufountain, Silk Naturals, &  MUAC Pretty much if you can find one with a good pH and well packaged, it would do the trick.\n\n\n**Under Eye Wrinkles**     \n\n\n More likely than not, that creasing under your eye has probably been there since you were a child. I'll throw my eyes up [here](http://i.imgur.com/v2KynGl.jpg) to use as an example. You can see the left side (easily seen because there was some concealer migration) that there are visible wrinkles.  These aren't damage or abnormal, but rather the natural contour of my eye. If I track back to childhood photos, they've always been there.    \n\n\nNow what will help actual wrinkles? Suncreen to prevent further damage, a retinoid to increase collagen production/cell turnover, and maybe a well formulated vitamin  serum with L-Ascorbic acid.\n\n\n**Dark Circles**\n\nThere are 3 main causes of dark circles, which can either be the sole cause or a mix of them.\n\n**1. Hyperpigmentation**\n\nThis is darkening of the skin under your eye. If this is the cause, something topically applied to lighten the skin (usually a melanin inhibitor plus something to speed up exfoliation/disperse melanin) is a solid bet. Kojic berry acid, for example, is a potentially helpful melanin inhibitor, though research is limited.\n\n\nThings that definitely are known to reduce hyperpigmentation are AHAs --be very careful with this, vitamin C, retinoids, and even another RX topical that I'm not mentioning due to to the harshness/side effects. The latter can be discussed with a physician if ever other treatment under the sun failed and you're truly miserable, I'm not even sure it's safe for use around the eye.\n\n\n\n**2. Visible capillaries due to very thin skin:**\n\n\nThe skin under the eye is thin and delicate. Due to this, people can sometimes get visible capillaries/little blood vesels, which from a decent distance look like circles.\n\n You can either go to your derm or local med spa and get these zapped with a laser or, you can try to thicken the skin in the area to help make the caps less visible. \n\nRetinoids/(possibly)Vitamin C  can also help to thicken the skin over time as well. \n\n\n\n**3. Tear Trough/Suborbital Volume Deficiency**\n\n\nThis is literally due to the structure below your eye.   Nothing topically applied will cure this, though with proper placement of a brightening concealer, the appearance could be reduced.  The *only* thing that does \"fix\" this are fillers---either by your derm/NP/PA. \n\n\nFor the tear trough, the area around your nose and orbital bone is hollowed, therefore casting a shadow, which gives the look of dark circles or contributes to your circles.  [Example](http://i.imgur.com/BGbsKve.jpg)\n\n\nFor suborbital volume deficiency, there is a larger area under the eye which lacks volume. You can probably see this from the closeup of my eyes above or check out another example [here](http://i.imgur.com/77MMsKq.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n**Vitamin K cream disclaimer**\n\n\nSome people claim that eye creams with vitamin K work ( with spider veins/ visible caps) by penetrating skin and clotting the vessels/capillaries, which in turn essentially kills them.\n\n\nConsistent evidence is lacking on the efficacy of this, though I have read a couple studies that it may be helpful in post surgical bruising. Again, more evidence is needed.\n\n\nThough, say it was effective...There's nothing to stop it from penetrating healthy capillaries/vessels and knocking those off too. It's not selectively choosing what to \"kill\".  *Personal Opinion Warning*: I wouldn't want to tamper with it to find out.    YMMV though.\n\n\nIf you guys have anything to add please do!  Hope you enjoyed it!\n\n\n\n**EDIT** fixed links!   Also, there are various environmental factors than can contribute to dark circles/puffiness such as dehydration ( so stay properly hydrated, a good indication is if your urine is clear), lack of sleep ( so make sure you're getting enough sleep, however many hours is good for *you*, no one size fits all for sleep), stress/emotional problems, and allergies.     \n\n\n\n**EDIT 2**  There are other retinoid products on the market, skinacea.com lists some of them.  They differ in concentration and the retinoid derivative.  Avene uses the most potent OTC form, which is why I mentioned this versus the others. You'd likely see results in a more timely fashion.\n\n\n\n**EDIT 3** As one of the lovelies on here pointed out, it should be indicated that not every retinoid product is listed on Skinacea--it's an easy to read site with concentrations of the retinoid in the product and an easy to understand description of the strengths.  Re-iterating to add in any well formulated retinaldehyde products you've have experience with or know of!!!",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea?

        "body": "My Mom had subtype 3, with thickened skin. She had it really badly her whole life. I have some rosacea but have done my best to try to not wind up like her.  Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

    "body": " \n\nSeasoning Process \n\n**What is Seasoning on Cast Iron?** \n\nWe’re used to hearing the word seasoning when talking about the herbs and spices you add to your food. But seasoning means something very  different when talking about cast iron skillets and pans. \n\n**Seasoning your cast iron  is when you create a  protective coating on the skillet’s surface using oil or fat.  Seasoning not only creates a somewhat non-stick surface on your cast iron  skillet, but it also protects against rust. Despite common beliefs rust protection is the main purpose of seasoning cast iron.** \n\n**How seasoning creates a protective coating on cast iron** \n\nTo season your cast iron skillet (full step-by-step details later),  you first coat your skillet in a light film of oil. Then you heat your  skillet up past a certain temperature. When oil is heated while in contact with both oxygen and metal, it goes through a process called *polymerization*. \n\nThis basically means the oil turns into a rock-hard plastic surface that binds to the cast iron. If you repeat the process, another coat will form on top of the first coat, providing a thicker and stronger non-stick surface. \n\nThis is why a lot of people say that cast iron improves as you use  it. When you cook with oil in your cast iron skillet, some of it may add to the coating and create a better non-stick surface. \n\nIt’s important to point out that we need to try and build many thin  coats rather than try to form one thick coat. Remember that the oil  needs to be in contact with both oxygen and metal to polymerize. This  works best with very thin coats of oil as you will see later in the  step-by-step process. \n\n**What is the best oil to season a cast iron skillet?** \n\nThe type of oil you use will impact the quality of the coat you  create. Everybody seems to have their own opinions on what oil is best  for seasoning cast iron and there are a lot of myths and old wive’s  tales on what works and what doesn’t. \n\nWhatever type of oil you use, somebody will tell you that you’re doing it wrong. For example, you’ll often hear people say that bacon grease or lard  creates the best cast iron seasoning. But is it really the best option?  \n\nWhy do people say it’s the best? Well, it turns out that there are many better options, but those  options weren’t available back in the day when cast iron was king. Back  then, bacon grease was and readily available, so it was the  default option for seasoning cast iron. That’s all it took for it to  stick as part of tradition (like many cooking traditions and methods). \n\nPeople don’t say bacon grease is the best because they’ve done A/B tests, they say it’s the best because that’s what they were told is the best. Think about what bacon actually is, I know bacon well, I cure it myself. Store bought bacon is cured though a process called pumping. A brine of salt, sugar, liquid smoke and sodium nitrite. Cure accelerators are also used like ascorbic acid. SO WE ALL CAN SEE BACON GREASE IS NOT A PURE FAT. We also fry it and get those tiny particles that form and contaminate the grease. Also not good seasoning. \n\nSo, while we can learn a lot from tradition, and cooking history, let’s look at the science on what really works. \n\n**Smoke Point** \n\nThe other important factor to consider when choosing the type of oil  for seasoning your cast iron is the oil’s smoke point. The smoke point  is the temperature where the oil starts to break down (and create  smoke). \n\n**When unsaturated fat starts to break down in the presence of  oxygen, the molecules join together (called polymerization as explained  earlier). If the temperature doesn’t reach the smoke point, the fat  won’t cross link to form double bonds and you won’t get polymerization** \n\nSo it’s important that you make sure you know the smoke point of any  oil you use to season your cast iron and you heat the oil up past the  smoke point. If you don’t heat it up high enough, it won’t polymerize. \n\n**Monounsaturated vs Polyunsaturated vs saturated fats** \n\nNow here's where I know I will get kickback from just about everyone, because we’ve all had good results using our personal oils of choice. \n\nMy personal tests have yielded great results using several oils and fats. One thing I find when I try to speak with scientists about this topic is this.  \n\n**Monounsaturated fats are by far the worst to use. They are unstable and want to attract another molecule. This is why when exposed to air they go rancid.** \n\nIt’s important that you make sure to avoid olive oil, avocado oil, sesame oil.  They are all high in monounsaturated fat. \n\nHere is where it gets fun, look for oils with low smoke points and high levels of polyunsaturated fat. So far the oil I find that's cheap and easy to find is grapeseed oil. Grapeseed oil is very high in polyunsaturated fat. It tops the charts, corn oil is another good choice. \n\nSaturated Fats\nThose that stay solid at room temperature are actually not considered by science to be the best. \nThat said, there is something to be said from the tons of folks using Crisco, Crisbee and lard. I personally cover all my bases by making a blend of Crisco, beeswax and grapeseed oil. I'm open for someone with access to a lab and knowledge in the scientific testing process to preform some tests for us . What experts are saying is store bought crisco and lard is hydrogenated and by adding the hydrogen it allows for some double bonds to cross link and form a polymer. \n\n**How to Season Your Cast Iron (Step-by-step)** \n\nNow that you understand how seasoning works and what type of oils  work best, let’s look at a foolproof process you can follow to develop a great seasoning on your cast iron. \n\n**Step 1: Clean Your Cast Iron**  \n\nFirst set your oven to 200 f \n\nWhether you have a brand new cast iron skillet or bought an old  second-hand skillet (which can be just as good or better than brand  new), it’s a good idea to start by cleaning it. We want a perfectly clean surface so the oil can get perfect coverage and develop a strong bond with the metal. \n\nNow that its clean wipe it dry and place it in the 200 degree oven for 10 minutes. \n\n**Step 2: Lightly cover the entire surface with oil** \n\nSet the oven to 50 degrees past your oils smoke point. (500f also works) \n\nThe key word here is *lightly*. Using too much oil will cause issues with polymerization and leaves a sticky surface. \n\nRemove the item from the oven using gloves. Take your chosen oil  and pour a teaspoon into the pan. I have a small rag about the size of a post it note, that i use to spread the oil. I found if I have too large of a rag it soaks up all the oil before i can spread it.  \n\nMake sure to cover the entire item including any handle and the bottoms. \n\n**Step 3 : Wipe it clean** \n\nThis might be the most important step that may folks miss. After rubbing the oil on your cookware, pretend you made a mistake and decided to wipe it off. Yes really wipe all that oil off with a clean towel. The point is to leave a very thin layer that bonds to the iron that's not thick enough to chip off.  Leaving too much oil on the item will also cause a pooling effect on your seasoning, looking splotchy and uneven. \n\n**Step 4: Heat your cast iron past your oil’s smoke point** \n\nOnce your cast iron has a very thin coating of oil evenly across the entire surface, you can heat it up in the oven. \n\n**Why use an oven:** while you could use a stove to  \n\nseason your cast iron, it will give inconsistent results. A stove  doesn’t heat your cast iron evenly compared to an oven which will  provide constant and even heat across the entire surface of the cast  iron. I highly recommend using an oven. \n\nPlace skillets in upside down to allow any oil that you missed to run away and not puddle on the cooking surface.  \n\nBake for 1 hour then turn the oven off and allow the item to cool down with the oven.  \n\nAt this point you're going to want to repeat all the steps except the washing. To speed things up you can wait until the oven cools to 200 deg and start from there at step 2.  \n\nThat's it, you've done it, 1 coat is good for a touch up on your already seasoned iron, 3-5 coats are good for iron that has been stripped bare.\n\nRECAP FOR THE KITCHEN \nclean your iron \nHeat in 200° oven 10 min\nRub on oil\nRub off oil \nBake at 50° past smoke point or 500° for 1 hour",

Also monounsaturated fat is a fat with one carbon to carbon double bond meaning the unsaturation only exists at one point on the molecule. Polyunsaturated fats have multiple double bonds. This is important, an oil can go rancid through reactions, mostly oxidation. That double bond breaks and is replaced with either an oxygen species or more likely hydrogen. On a MUFA, the molecule reacts quicker than PUFAs due simply to less space on the molecule. It isn't unstable nor does attract other molecules more than the other and has no effect on the seasoning grinard reactions that occur.",

No real symptoms other than a little discomfort in her left rib and mild fatigue. Things went downhill extremely fast. A week after the news, she had a stroke due to clotting. A week after that, she started spitting and coughing up copious amounts of blood. The main tumor had grown into her bronchus causing the bleeding. She also had pericardial effusion and pleural effusion which she had drained twice. A supply of oxygen was necessary, 15 liters at a time and bipap for a few days. During my time bedside with her, I started doing research and came across fenbendazole and its potential against cancer. 9/19 She started chemo as surgery and radiation were not options. (3 week cycle of Caboplatin / Paclitaxel). 9/22 She started the Joe Tippens Protocol (without the doctor knowing) 3 weeks later, same chemo infusion but added Opdivo and Yervoy. On 10/12, started Ivermectin (again without the doctors knowledge). By Halloween we really started noticing improvement. The middle of November, no more fluid in the lungs and no more oxygen needed. She continued chemo and immunotherapy up until her last PET/CT scan on 12/18. Results were unbelievable compared to the initial scan. Brain was completely clear, lymphnodes in her neck were completely resolved, lyphnodes in both lungs were completely resolved, and the main tumor in the left lung has shrunk to almost nothing! Radiation is now on the table, but we told her doctor that she needs a break. The chemo and immunotherapy has taken a toll on her body. Overall it’s been an amazing turnaround. We went from doctors telling us she needed hospice to her almost back to her old self (a few more lbs. to go lol). I can’t be 100% certain its been because of the fenben and ivermectin, but when all the doctors are scratching their heads at the vast improvement she’s made, it makes me think it played a huge role. We have truly been blessed and I feel like our and everyone’s story should be heard.\" https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy_commons/s/zc9FSLrPWx\n\n\n\"My wife had a clear cell renal cell carcinoma diagnosis. She did some radiation treatments, and 1 round of chemo.  She quit chemo after that first one.  When she quit chemo, we started the Joe Tippens protocol, and she is now cancer free, and didn't lose a kidney.\" https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy_commons/s/xHXWBt2t65\n\nHigh-dose Vitamin C studies:\n\n \n\"How high dose vitamin C kills cancer cells\"\nhttps://www.naturalhealth365.com/vitamin-c-cancer-cells-2219.html \n \n\n\"High-dose intravenous vitamin C, a promising multi-targeting agent in the treatment of cancer\"\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34717701/ \n \n#More data/studies\n\n\"High-Dose Vitamin C in Advanced-Stage Cancer Patients.\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33652579/ \n \n\n\"Targeting cancer vulnerabilities with high-dose vitamin C\"\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30967651/ \n \n\n\"High-dose vitamin C enhances cancer immunotherapy.\"\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32102933/ \n \n\n\"Vitamin C as a Modulator of the Response to Cancer Therapy\"\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30695991/ \n \n\nIvermectin studies:\n\n\n\"The multitargeted drug ivermectin: from an antiparasitic agent to a repositioned cancer drug\"\n\n \n>In this review, we summarize the in vitro and in vivo evidences demonstrating that ivermectin exerts antitumor effects in different types of cancer.

    "body": "I wanted to share some tips and knowledge in skincare since a lot of the same questions are being asked in most posts here. I am not a doctor. this is all based from experience, knowledge, research, advice from dermatologist and another great sub skincareaddiction. Remember skin care is a personal journey (trust me! i have a lot of trial and errors too)\n\nBasic Routine:\n\nAM\n- cleanse\n- moisturizer\n- Sunscreen\n\nPM\n- cleanse\n- treat\n- moisturizer\n\nFrom this, you can add items to suit your personal skin care needs. For example.\n\nOily Skin\n\nAM\n- Cleanse\n- Anti redness Toner\n- Spot treat with BHA\n- Oil free, gel type moisturizer\n- Non greasy sunscreen\n\nPM\n- double cleanse\n- Calming Toner\n- BHA\n- Niacinimide\n- Moisturizer \n\nFor dry skin, maybe add more (7x if u like lol) toner or a heavier moisturizer, etc.\n\nYou dont need to put a lot, start with the basic routine then add one item at a time so you know what works, what your skin doesn’t like. Everyone’s skin is different. For example, silicones are okay for some, for some it causes irritation and clogged pores. Some are okay with zinc, some aren’t. Always patch test first and YMMV. Always look for the science  behind it thus its important to research and check reviews. The cosmetic/skincare industry will try to sell you a lot of stuff.\n\nSummary of my other thoughts (references down below)\n- Always wear Suncreen, indoors, outdoors, cloudy day. As long as there is light (UV index of more than 1), there is UVA, blue light, UVB etc.\n- alcohol is a no-no (alcohol, alcohol denat, SD alcohol)\n- fatty alcohols are good (cetyl, stearyl, cetearyl alcohol)\n- perfume causes irritation\n- Natural doesnt always mean no irritation\n- Double cleanse what? 1st cleanser (oil/balm) to remove make up/sunscreen, 2nd cleanser (at correct PH) is the gel/foam/liquidy type. Remove dirt, make up, spf. Squeaky clean is not the goal. Do not over cleanse. Strip in the bedroom not your moisture.\n- A broken moisture/skin barrier causes skin problem for all skin types (even oily ones)\n- Hydrating your skin is different from moisturizing. (Multi molecular weight) Hyaluronic acid, glycerin are popular plumping/hydrating ingredient. Although some moisturizers can be hydrating.\n- They talk about toner as being connected to Ph level or whatever, toning is just a hydrating step, dont complicate it.\n- Dont over exfoliate, add one chemical exfoliant at a time (either BHA, AHA, PHA, etc). Once your skin gets acclimated then use all the acids, LoL kidding. Be nice to your skin and say no to physical exfoliation (microbeads). 😁\n- Why do they like to exfoliate? Its helps with hyperpigmentation, acne scars and has brightening effect (other notable ingredients vitamin c, niacinimide)\n- Retinol and vitamin C are tricky yet important ingredients. Vitamin C is unstable. Skin care brands often are misleading about Retinol components. \n- Vitamin C easily oxidizes, once you open the bottle or been sitting on a shelf of a long time, exposed to sun and other elements. Its just *poof* a waste, even if its marketed as stable with Ferulic acid, etc. that’s why the L-Ascorbic Acid powder is popular (although not easy to use) but is the most effective version out there. There are other vit c products (cheap or expensive) that are said to be effective and hyped by many, YMMV.\n- most Retinol products are a sham. Just use retin-A or tretinoin (for efficacy) if you’re worried about wrinkles.\n- Some noteworthy retinol products: Dermatica, Curology, Adapalene, Diffirin, Paula’s Choice 1% Retinol, Avene RetrinAI\n- Collagen supplements gets metabolized in your stomach before it reaches (if any left) your skin. So you can’t drink beautiful skin but always drink water not sugar, dairy.\n- Retinol, Niacinimide, Vit C are the only ingredients  that has proven to address ‘mature’ skin, wrinkles. Note i didnt use ‘anti aging’ ‘reverse time’ ‘freeze time’ ‘rejuvenate’ ‘detox’ etc LoL those are marketing cliches.\n- Peptides at most are moisturizing. The only science backed up peptide is the one found in TO Buffet + Copper Peptides and NIOD CAIS2\n- Apply skin care beginning with lightest to heaviest; liquid type to cream, last is oil.\n\nPopular youtube beauty/skincare vloggers:\nHyram, James Welsh, gothamista, Liah Yoo, etc. They all can teach you something or two but they are not doctors/experts/chemist. Sometimes they agree on certain products, sometimes they dont. But they push products (does gothamista really use all of those (tons and tons) products?) I bet she uses NIOD CAIS2 consistently though, just a guess. Liah really looks young though (genes?). They are fun to watch too.\n\nFor example, Krave Beauty Matcha is a holy grail for James Welsh but ‘its okay’ for Hyram. Gothamista likes ‘the face shop oil cleanser’ but I seriously cant get over the perfume. But they all like (not sure about Liah) Klairs Soft Airy UV essence and Purito centella unscented sunscreen. Liah does not like alcohol but now, Krave Beet the Sun Sunscreen has alcohol.\n\nRead up on science:\n- Thebeautybrains.com\n- The beauty brains podcast hosted by a cosmetic chemist\n- Lab muffin - written and vlogged by a chemist\n- Beautypedia ingredient list\n- Cosmetic Cop - Paula Begoun\n\nRead, cross check, find references\n\nFinally, big and expensive clinics will ask their dermatologist / aestheticians to sell products. Be aware. Find a good, honest, within your budget dermatologist. Get to know them, be friends with them. He/She can provide you a lot of insights and help, even free stuff.\n\n*if i missed something, got something wrong and/or additional thoughts, please please do make a comment and let me know.

The products my derma sell are with vague name labels only and without ingredients list. I’m just using toner, two creams (for pm), acno lyse (with salicylic acid for am), and another cream (for pm) everyday.

Don't miss out on a good product just coz it has alcohol in it.\n* Fragrance is also ok as long as your skin can handle it.\n* SOME toners do help with pH-adjusting and can make acids way more effective than using without\n* Please, PLEASE, do not fall for organic, all-natural, chemical/paraben-free products.

    "body": "When I heard about this new product line the other day, I decided to look at all the products and their formulations via SkinCarisma to see whether anything looked worth trying. A few products seemed promising, while others seemed... not so much. I thought since I'd already done all the work, I'd share my findings here!\n\nIn order approximately from most to least promising:\n\nBlemish Control Spot Treatment, 5.5% Benzoyl Peroxide\n\n- **fungal acne safe!**\n- 5.5% is a higher concentration that necessary but shouldn't be too irritating\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract (both near end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice root extract\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (at end of ingred. list)\n- some nice **moisturizing** ingredients, including a good amount of squalane\n\nVitamin C Moisturizer\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (9th ingred.)\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for vit C, percentage is unclear but is listed as 8th ingredient \n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E (14th ingred.)\n- lots of aloe, good amount of squalane, lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- small amounts of cassia and green tea\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (9th ingred.)\n- advertises inclusion of hyaluronic acid but is last ingredient\n\nDark Spot Solution Serum\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: polysorbate 20 (8th ingred.)\n- **niacinimide** is 2nd ingredient! brightening and anti-aging properties\n- advertises its inclusion of plankton extract but is 24th ingredient (also not much evidence that plankton extract does anything for skin besides moisturizing)\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract  (both towards end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (last ingred.), citric acid (15th ingred.)\n- lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- possible **allergen**: benzoyl alcohol\n- contains a lot of **silicones**\n\nRetinol Vitamin A Refining Moisturizer\n\n- amount of retinol isn't specified, but is placed 25th on ingredient list (you only need small amounts, 0.01% or more, to be effective, but need 0.5% or more for dramatic effects)\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (8th ingred.), polysorbate 20 (24th), cetyl palmitate (26th) \n- **retinol** has anti-acne, brightening, and anti-aging properties\n- other **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (13th ingred.), ceramide 3 (27th ingred.)\n- tons of aloe juice, good amount of squalane\n- small amounts of green tea and cassia\n- lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n- specifically advertises its inclusion of hyaluronic acid but is 26th (second last) on ingred. list\n\nOil-Free SPF 50 Moisturizing Sunscreen\n\n- broad spectrum\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: glyceryl stearate (2nd ingredient), isopropyl palmitate (7th), PEG-100 stearate (8th)\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract (both towards end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice root\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (13th ingred.)\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: isopropyl palmitate (7th ingred.)\n- pretty small tube, only 50 mL\n\nFerulic Acid + Vitamins C and E Serum\n\n- **fungal acne safe**\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for its vit C so is not a dupe for SkinCeuticals, but should still be effective\n- amounts of main ingredients not specified, however, vit C is the 5th ingredient, ferulic is 10th, vit E is 18th (second to last)\n- **brightening** ingredients: SAP\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E, citric acid, ferulic acid\n- citric acid (8th ingredient) may be **irritating** to sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: laureth-23 (4th ingredient)\n\nBio-Complex Moisturizer for Dry Skin\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n- claim to have a \"high level\" of hyaluronic acid, and contains 2 kinds, but they're only 21st and 22nd on ingredient list\n- also super unclear on what their \"bio-moist complex\" is but if it comprises 20% of the product it must just be like, aloe and water and glycerin\n- but yeah, tons of aloe and glycerin, good amount of squalane, some other **moisturizing** ingredients, moderate amount of green tea extract\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: citric acid (14th ingred.), vitamin E (23rd)\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n\nVitamin C + Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\n- **fungal acne safe**\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for vit C, percentage is unclear but is listed as 5th ingredient \n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E (13th ingred.), citric acid (10th)\n- contains **denatured alcohol** (3rd ingred.)\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: laureth-23 (4th ingred.)\n- HA is in the name and yet it's the last ingredient\n\nCharcoal Balancing Mask\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: PEG-100 stearate (9th ingred.), stearic acid (10th), glyceryl stearate (12th)\n- **jar packaging**\n- not sure how much charcoal is needed to be effective, but there may be a deceptively small amount in this, as it's the 16th ingredient and the product contains as much or more iron oxide as a colouring agent. also it lists \"charcoal powder\" and NOT \"activated charcoal powder\" so it may just be all-around useless.\n- advertises its use of hyaluronic acid yet it's the last ingredient \n- main mask component is **kaolin** clay (3rd ingred.)\n- 2 kinds of vitamin E (17th and 24th ingredients)\n- lots of aloe and some glycerin but not many other soothing or moisturizing ingredients\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: stearic acid (10th ingred.)\n\nHydrating Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: contains polysorbate 80\n- claims to have 5 types of HA but I only counted 3: sodium hyaluronate, hydrolized HA, sodium acetylated hyaluronate (and they're all 18th or later in the ingredient list)\n- contains a TON of **silicone**, which seems like a poor choice to me, as HA should generally be applied earlier on in your routine and all that silicone will interfere with absorption of subsequent layers\n- no other notable or helpful ingredients, just a few **moisturizing** things like glycerin\n- more of a gel texture than a serum\n\nTriple-Peptide Eye Cream\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: stearic acid (3rd ingred.), glycol distearate (4th), shea butter (5th), ethylhexyl palmitate (8th)\n- **jar packaging**\n- peptides are last ingredient\n- contains ascorbic acid (vitamin C) but is 18th ingredient and what little benefit that amount gives will deteriorate due to air exposure from jar packaging\n- lots of aloe, good amount of squalane and caffeine\n- small amounts of green tea and green algae extract\n- 5 potential **comedogens** but this likely won't matter for the eye region\n- if you look up this product on Amazon to examine yourself, note that the copyable list of ingredients in the Important Information section is actually the ingredient list for the Retinol Moisturizer, so use the ingredients listed in the product images\n\nHydrating Facial Cleansing Wipes\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: glyceryl oleate (4th ingred.), pomegranate seed oil (14th), coconut oil (15th), olive fruit oil (16th), argan oil (17th), jojoba oil (18th), babassu seed oil (20th), moringa seed oil (21st), crambe seed oil (23rd)\n- 2 potential **comedogens**: coconut oil (15th ingred.), avocado oil (19th)\n- in addition to above listed plant oils, also contains chia seed oil, the only non-problematic one lol\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: citric acid (9th ingred.), vitamin E (12th)\n- citric acid and benzoic acid (6th ingred.) may be **irritating** to sensitive skin\n- **surfectants** used: decyl glucoside and glyceryl oleate\n\nOil-Free Micellar Facial Cleansing Wipes\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: glyceryl oleate (4th ingred.)\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: citric acid (9th ingred.), vitamin E (12th)\n- citric acid and benzoic acid (6th ingred.) may be **irritating** to sensitive skin\n- micellar agents (**surfectants**) are decyl glucoside and glycerl oleate\n\nBlemish Control Oil-Free Facial Cleansing Wipes\n\n- **fungal acne safe**\n- advertises 2% **salicylic acid**, but unsure of the pH\n- **denatured alcohol** is the first ingredient!\n- contains grapefruit extract (3rd ingred.) - some sources say this is a great ingredient for skin, others say it's bad - I personally avoid it like I do all citrus-derived ingredients\n- contains **fragrance** (5th ingred.)\n- contains **sulfate**: sodium xylenesulfonate (13th ingred.)\n \nHope this is helpful!

In the US, ingredients in concentrations of 1% or lower can be listed in whatever order the manufacturer wants to use. You can sometimes tell where that <1% begins if the product contains phenoxyethanol, because that's approved for use in concentrations of up to 1% -- meaning things *after* that are either at 1% or under.\n\n(Also, 1% HA isn't unusual, nor is it necessarily ineffective; it's normally used at/in concentrations of 0.2-2%. TO often uses 2% because of their unofficial \"more is **always** better\" philosophy [looking at you, 10% niacinamide serum], but <2% can be beneficial, too!)\n\nThat said, you'd think there'd be little reason for Amazon to list a \"banner\" ingredient at the very end when/if they have the option to list it earlier/higher.",

    "body": "The question of how to get rid of post-acne dark spots has been coming up a lot lately, so it seemed like the perfect topic for a Teach It Tuesday. I suffer from this myself, so I did a little bit of digging into the subject.\n\n**First, some terminology**\n\nThis post will focus on post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, which are the dark marks that remain after an acne lesion has healed. It’s commonly referred to as “acne scarring” but it isn’t a true scar, since it’s often transient and doesn't involve changes to the collagen in the skin. Even though this post won’t go into other types of acne scarring, I’ll leave some descriptions here for the sake of knowledge.\n\n*Hypertrophic scarring* - raised lumps of scar tissue where an acne lesion was. Sometimes there is an overgrowth of scar tissue that extends beyond the original inflammation site (keloid scarring). This type of scarring is common on the torso.\n\n*Atrophic scarring* - depressions in the skin due to a loss of collagen. Depending on the shape and area covered, these are classified into rolling, box or icepick scars.\n\n**What is PIH, and what causes it?**\n\nPost-inflammatory hyper pigmentation (PIH) results from an overproduction of melanin following inflammation of the skin. Cytokines and inflammatory mediators can have a stimulatory effect on melanocytes, which results in increased melanin production. Inflammation can also cause the destruction of basal keratinocytes, resulting in an accumulation of pigment at the injury site. It can occur after any type of injury to the skin, including acne, dermatitis or traumatic injury, and can exist at the dermal and/or epidermal layers. While it isn't physically harmful, many people seek treatment due to the social and emotional effects.  \n\n**What are the risk factors?**\n\nPIH can occur in anyone. However, it's usually more common, noticeable and persistent in people with darker skin types ([Fitzpatrick types III-VI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzpatrick_scale)). The color of the hyperpigmentation can vary depending on skin tone and location in the skin (dermal vs epidermal), showing up as red, purple, brown or bluish. There's also a correlation between the intensity of the original inflammation and the intensity of the resulting PIH. Repeated inflammation at the same site (such as reoccurring acne cysts) can exacerbate the effect. \n\n**Well, how do I avoid it?** \n\nPIH is notorious for taking a long time to treat, so as they say, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Avoiding inflammation altogether is the best way to avoid PIH, but the second best is to be prompt about treating any skin conditions that might cause it. Also avoid doing anything that causes inflammation to become worse (I'm looking at you, pimple-poppers!).\n\n**I already have it! How do I make it go away?**\n\nFortunately there are lots of well-studied treatments for PIH. Below are some of the most-researched topical treatments.\n\n**Sunscreen** - These treatment options increase the skin’s sensitivity to the sun, so a high-SPF/PPD broad-spectrum sunscreen must be used along with them. Otherwise, there’s a good chance that not only will the treatment for PIH fail, but they’ll actually cause additional photo damage to the skin. Used on its own, sunscreen can help prevent any existing hyperpigmentation from becoming worse.\n\n*Retinoids* - These vitamin A derivatives are commonly prescribed for acne but can also assist in fading hyperpigmentation. They work by increasing epidermal turnover, facilitating melanin dispersion and removal. Adapalene (Differin), tretinoin (Retin-A) and tazarotene (Tazorac) have all been shown to be effective in clinical studies. The most common adverse effects of retinoid use are redness, dryness and irritation. Retinoid dermatitis can lead to additional hyperpigmentation, especially in darker skin, so it can be beneficial to start with a lower-strength retinoid and gradually increase the amount and frequency of use. Retinoids can be prescribed by your doctor.\n\n*Chemical Peels* - Superficial chemical peels with alpha hydroxy acids are common treatments for PIH since they are generally well-tolerated. Chemical peels work by promoting exfoliation and dispersing basal layer melanin. Glycolic, lactic, and salicylic acid peels have all been shown to be effective in treating hyperpigmentation. Glycolic acid may also be effective in treating superficial atrophic scars because it increases dermal collagen synthesis. Depending on the active used, the concentration of the active and how long the peel is left on the skin, the ‘depth’ of the peel can be controlled. Potential side effects include a burning sensation, redness, and skin irritation/sensitivity. Salicylic acid can potentially cause dryness, especially for people with drier skin types. Excessive irritation can lead to additional hyperpigmentation, so it’s important to choose the ingredients and strength of the peel carefully, taking your skin type and any allergies/sensitivities into account. Patch testing is also extremely important in order to minimize any adverse effects. Peels can be performed by your dermatologist, and kits are also available for use at home.\n\n*Vitamin C*- The antioxidant properties can help suppress melanin synthesis. Other benefits include anti-inflammatory effects and possible photoprotective properties. L-ascorbic acid, the most potent form, isn’t very stable in solution, so vitamin C products should be chosen and stored carefully. It is most effective when combined with other treatments. Vitamin C is available in many OTC products.\n\n*Daily AHAs* - In addition to use as peeling agents, alpha hydroxy acids can be used as frequently as every day in lower concentrations to promote regular and even exfoliation of the skin. Over time, this can assist in fading hyperpigmentation. Many skin types can tolerate regular AHA use along with other PIH treatments. Many AHA products are available over the counter. \n\n*Azelaic Acid* - This is a dicarboxylic acid that was developed for the treatment of acne and rosacea. In addition to fighting acne by killing bacteria and decreasing keratin production, it can help fade hyperpigmentation through tyrosinase inhibition and cytotoxic effects toward abnormal melanocytes. It is generally well-tolerated, but may cause redness, burning, irritation or allergic reaction. Azelaic acid (commonly sold under the brand name Finacea) can be prescribed by your doctor.\n\n*Niacinamide* - a form of vitamin B3. It works by inhibiting melanosome transfer from melanocytes to keratinocytes. Clinical studies seem to be using a concentration of at least 4%. In general, it does not cause irritation and is well-tolerated.\n\n**How long will it take to go away?**\n\nThe healing process is somewhat unique for each person, so the amount of time needed for treatment can vary widely depending on your skin, the severity of the PIH, the treatments you choose, and your consistency in applying the treatment. In some cases, it may exist long-term or permanently. For many people, especially those with darker skin, a minimum of 3-6 months of treatment is necessary before significant improvements are visible, and it could take a year to several years before the condition is completely resolved.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCallender V, St Surin-Lord S, Davis E, Maclin M.

It pretty mcuh goes over everything you did, with the addition of talking about some other stuff, but generally those other things like soy, the conclusion is \"more studies are needed.\"\n\n\nBecause /u/vittschill mentioned  Niacinamide below, here's the niacinamide section: \n\n\n> Niacinamide is the water-soluble, physiologically active derivative of niacin (vitamin B3\n). Topical niacinamide has been used\nin the treatment of acne but studies now suggest that there may be\na role for niacinamide in the treatment of pigmentary disorders.\nHakozaki et al.[56] showed through in vitro studies that niacinamide decreases melanosome transfer by 35–68% without inhibiting tyrosinase activity or cell proliferation. Research also suggests\nthat niacinamide may decrease melanogenesis by interfering with\nthe interaction between keratinocytes and melanocytes (i.e. cell\nsignaling pathway) but not through a directly inhibitory effect on\nmelanocytes.[56] Two to five percent niacinamide has proven to\nbe an effective lightening agent for patients with melasma or UVinduced hyperpigmentation;[56-58] however, studies are needed to\ndetermine its safety and efficacy in the treatment of PIH",

They are general guidelines and used to compartment other types of skin conditions... aside from the lower Fitzpatrick scaling numbers correlating with an increased susceptibility to burn from UVA/UVB sun rays, as you move up the scale (e.g. from II onwards such as in Asian skin for example), PIH likelihoods increase... \n\nOutside of topical treatments as you mentioned, further PIH can be minimized in general with the most appropriate type of sunscreen (chemical/physical) that suits you... broad spectrum UVA/UVB with SPF ~30 would be ideal... if you can't go with a pure physical (zinc/titanium blend) for whichever reasons (e.g. aesthetics/oiler as you go higher in physical sunblock SPF ratings), try to find one that has a blend of physical and chemical components...\n\nFor improved wound healing (e.g. not from sunburn) without topical treatments like above; such as from nicks/scrapes/minimal post-acne lesions to a degree of severity, I'd consider applying polysporin ointment to help minimize PIH - this would be a spot/small area (less than a few inches max in total area) and then you would apply a higher SPF blended or pure physical sunscreen over it. Otherwise, you can apply your usual sunscreen/block everywhere else.\n\nAvoid any type of neosporin blend (with Polymyxin B Sulfate, Bacitracin Zinc, and Neomycin) and stick to Polysporin (like neosporin without the neomycin). Aids in less irritation and interference in wound healing from the neomycin. Polysporin can be purchased generically from stores like Walgreens, where they market it as \"Walsporin\" I believe. \n\nThe last thing I think we've mentioned across other posts here about sunscreens were with at least chemical sunscreens, they need to be applied directly in contact with your skin for them to function properly - if using topical treatments, I'd wait 15-20 mins for the topical to absorb and then apply sunscreen, then moisturizer, etc... Pure Physical sunblocks can be applied over any order of treatments/applications beforehand.",

It looks like azodicarbonamide *does* break down into semicarbazide when heated in commercial bread products. Also semicarbazide *is* linked with negative health effects in rats, including tumors, endocrine disruption, weight loss, etc.\n\nHowever, there is one caveat if we're to assume that the health effects observed in these rats are equivalent to what we would see in humans (I couldn't find any in vivo human toxicology studies): in order for an average human (weighing 136 lbs or 62 kg) to experience any of these side effects from semicarbazide exposure in commercially-produced bread, they would have to eat anywhere from 9,762 lbs to 27,337 lbs of said bread, such as Subway's (possibly over a 28 day period, too).\n\nIf this is the case, the likelihood of these health risks occurring in an average human is extremely low.\n\nThis additional evidence and my evaluation of it is attached below. Let me know if I made any mistakes in my analysis or if this evidence is insufficient.\n\nAlso if this is your first time reading this reddit post, please scroll down a little further to see the Original Post so you can get context around this whole topic.\n\n---------------------\n*MY NEW EVIDENCE AND ANALYSIS*\n\nSemicarbazide is formed in azodicarbonamide-treated flours and commercial breads during heating and with another stable byproduct, biurea [3][4][5]\n\nLevels of semicarbazide found in commercials breads range from 0.2 mg/kg to 0.56 mg/kg. [6][7][8]\n\nEndocrine effects (some with dose-response) occurred in rats when semicarbazide taken orally over 28 days at 40, 75, 140 mg/kg of bodyweight  [9][10][11]\n\nDecreased body weight in male rats after ingesting semicarbazide at 40 mg/kg bw for 28 days[9][10][11]\n\nMortality increases in rats after ingesting semicarbazide at 75 mg/kg and 140 mg/kg bw [9][10][11]\n\nDecreased nucleic acid levels in rat cells, increased number of tumors in rats at 50 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg bw [11]\n\nAn average human's weight is 62 kg.

One of her recent campaigns (\"Subway: Stop Using Dangerous Chemicals in Your Bread\") influenced Subway to comply with her sufficiently-signed petition's request to remove azodicarbonamide from their bread recipe.\n\nHowever, I noticed that her reasoning behind this campaign (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO9PnKjxHX8) was based on appeals to nature and appeals to authority with minimal pertinent scientific evidence provided.\n\nWill you join me in convincing Food Babe to use intellectually honest scientific inquiry and reasoning for their food safety campaigns? \n\nShe's gaining credibility among the public and clout with companies (she's influenced Kraft, Chic-Fil-A, and now Subway to take action with their food products); however, she has what I believe to be a dangerous misunderstanding of science and logic with fallacious stances on things like microwave ovens, GMOs, etc.\n\nAttached below is a message I sent via the Contact form on foodbabe.com. Please read it to get a better understanding of why Food Babe is incorrect about this campaign.\n\n---------------------\n\nHello,\n\n\nI recently came across news stories and an article on your site pertaining to Food Babe’s petition against Subway for using azodicarbonamide (i.e., food additive E927). I have some feedback about this campaign that I hope you will consider and respond to.\n\n\nFirst I will say that I admire and share your ambition to elucidate the facts around food safety and how food impacts our health. You clearly have developed clout that gives you sway over our fellow citizens as well as large companies like Subway and Chic-Fil-A.\n\n\nOne of your first points about azodicarbonamide is that it is dangerous and unhealthy because it’s used to make yoga mats, shoe soles, etc. rubbery non-food substances. I feel the need to bring to your attention other food additives commonly found in American’s diets and how they are actually being used in non-food scenarios:\n\n\nFood additive E300 – This is used as a chemical in photographic film processing[1], plastic manufacturing[2], and injectable heroin preparations[3]. In our diets it can be found in fruit juices, salads, and some supplements advertised as immune system boosters.\n\n\nFood additive E330 – This is used as a chemical to remove limescale from boilers[4], manufacture stainless steel[5], and produce conventional cosmetic products[6]. It is a *caustic* eye and skin irritant. In our diets it can be found in juices, both fruit and vegetable.\n\n\nFood additive E440 – This is used as a chemical to repair damaged tobacco wrapper leaves on cigars[7]. In our diets it can be found in candies, jams, yogurt drinks, and baked goods (as a fat substitute).\n\n\nFood additive E300 is also known as (5R)-[(1S)-1,2-dihydroxyethyl]-3,4-dihydroxyfuran-2(5H)-one. Since I have no idea how to pronounce this, I will provide its other, more commonly used name: ascorbic acid[8]. This is also known as Vitamin C, an essential nutrient for humans. Yes, Vitamin C is used as a preservative, a photographic film processing chemical, a component of plastic manufacturing, etc. But just because it’s used in these non-food settings does not necessarily mean it’s unhealthy or dangerous. Likewise, just because azodicarbonamide is used to make yoga mats does not necessarily mean it’s unhealthy or dangerous.\n\n\nFood additive E330 is 2-hydroxypropane-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid, a.k.a. citric acid[9]. It’s naturally present in citrus fruits. If lemon juice has ever been sprayed in your eye, you know just how much it can irritate it. And that’s in very small quantities. Likewise, azodicarbonamide is shown to be a lung irritant in occupational settings (i.e., when workers who manufacture it are exposed to relatively large quantities of it in the air). Note: flour is also a lung irritant and is implicated in causing/worsening asthma[10]. When trucks filled with containers of citric acid have spilled on roadways, those roadways have been closed for up to 10 hours[11] (citric anhydrous acid is just citric acid without it being mixed in water).\n\n\nFood additive E440 is pectin[12] (I won’t bother you with its scary-sounding organic chemistry-derived name, but you can look it up if you’re curious). Pectin is naturally found in plants and fruits. It thickens liquids. It’s not dangerous in the ways and quantities we consume it. The same could be said about azodicarbonamide found in Subway’s bread.\n\n\nThe logic you used to make this point (i.e., azodicarbonamide is used to make unnatural non-food products such as yoga mats and shoe soles; therefore, it is dangerous or unhealthy) is fallacious. The logical fallacy you used is known as the appeal to nature[13]. In short, just because something is (un)natural does not necessarily mean that it is (un)healthy.\n\n\nAlso, just because you can’t pronounce or spell the name of a chemical doesn’t mean you shouldn’t eat it (see Vitamin C’s more technical chemical name). Look at what constitutes a strawberry: http://tribalscientist.wordpress.com:80/2010/10/18/how-to-make-a-strawberry/\n\n\nLikewise, you commit another logical fallacy when you state that because this chemical is banned in Europe and Singapore, it is dangerous or unhealthy. This is known as an appeal to authority. Rather than examining the evidence around the chemical’s safety, you point to an authority that declares it is unsafe vis-à-vis legislation regulating it.\n\n\nYes, Singapore will fine you up to $450,000 and throw you in jail for using azodicarbonamide. Did you also know that Singapore will throw you in jail for up to two years if you’re a man who participates in homosexual activities? [14]\n\n\nSo by your own logic, if Singapore outlaws male homosexual activity, does that mean it is dangerous or unhealthy for consenting adult men to engage in oral or anal sex with each other?\n\n\nThe WHO study you cited[15] regarding azocarbonamide being linked to allergies, asthma, and respiratory issues only pertains to occupational exposure, i.e., people who manufacture azodicarbonamide. Here is a pertinent quote from the WHO study: “The data available to the authors of this CICAD are restricted to the occupational environment […] No information is available on the toxicokinetics of azodicarbonamide in humans.”\n\n\nSimilarly, grain flours are also linked to allergies, asthma, and respiratory issues[10] in occupational settings. This does not necessarily mean they are unhealthy in the ways and amounts we consume them.\n\n\nFinally in your YouTube video advocating this petition, you stated that “[azodicarbonamide] is not supposed to be food or even eaten for that matter.” According to whom? What credible authority on food safety has said azodicarbonamide is not supposed to be eaten *and* has scientific evidence to support this assertion?\n\n\nI cannot speak to the study you cited regarding tumors and azodicarbonamide because it’s behind a paywall. If you can provide a link to the full journal article for this study[16], I would be glad to read it and consider it as valid evidence for the claims you have made.\n\n\nOtherwise, you have provided no compelling evidence to prove that azodicarbonamide is a danger to human health in the ways and amounts it is consumed, such as in Subways breads.\n\n\nAs I said before, I share the same passion as you to uncover the truth about food safety and human health; however, I am worried that you, who is developing substantial credibility among the public as an expert on food safety issues, are not properly investigating the truth by carefully examining and weighing scientific evidence while engaging in intellectually honest logic. I’m worried that you are using the same kinds of scare tactics and fallacious logic that biased advocacy groups have used to scare people away from using vaccines or convince people to ignore climate change.\n\n\nPlease keep in mind that with great power comes great responsibility. As your credibility becomes more established among the public, I urge you to take the time to learn how to properly uncover the truth about nature and reality using scientific inquiry and rational logic. You are not quite there yet.\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n---\n\nReferences\n\n1.\thttp://www.frugalphotographer.com/info-formulary-coffeedeveloper.htm\n\n2.\thttp://web.archive.org/web/20071012160442/http://reliableplant.com/article.asp?pagetitle=Vitamin+C,+water+have+benefits+for+plastic+manufacturing&articleid=3133\n\n3.\thttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2245922/\n\n4.\thttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/book/10.1002/14356007\n\n5.\thttp://www.euro-inox.org/pdf/map/Passivating_Pickling_EN.pdf\n\n6.\thttp://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/701385/CITRIC_ACID/\n\n7.\thttp://www.raestobacco.com/Guide%20Section/Repair.html\n\n8.\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascorbic_acid\n\n9.\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid\n\n10.\thttps://web.archive.org/web/20130531062959/http://www.ohsrep.org.au/index.cfm?section=10&Category=69&viewmode=content&contentid=62\n\n11.\thttp://www.nblawgroup.com/citric-acid-spilled-onto-highway-152/\n\n12.\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E440\n\n13.\t http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature\n\n14.\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_377A_of_the_Penal_Code_%28Singapore%29\n\n15.\thttp://www.who.int/ipcs/publications/cicad/en/cicad16.pdf\n\n16.\thttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21786817\n",

    "body": "I'm a huge fan of the \"skin care made simple\" video that has been posted a few times here. Whenever it's posted, people note that it doesn't cover topical vitamin C, hyaluronic acid or niacinamide - are they helpful? Are they worth it? Welp, here's the short answer for you:\n\n1.  vitamin C: most commercial topical forms are ineffective\n\n2. hyaluronic acid: not as a topical [for volume / reducing lines+wrinkles. Other users have pointed out that topical HA is useful in moisturizers, as distinct to the \"plumping\" effect I'm rubbishing here ;)]\n\n3. niacinamide: yes :)\n\n\nHere's the longer version:\n\n\n\n**Vit C**\n\nVitamin C is an antioxidant, which when manufactured into a stable topical formulation, is proven to be effective in protecting against photoaging of the skin. Topical vitamin C has shown to protect the skin from UV damage caused by prolonged sun exposure by reducing the amount of free radical formation and/or sunburn cells. Exposure to UV light has also shown to decrease the naturally occurring vitamin C levels in the skin, thus topical application of vitamin C restores these photoprotectant levels. Other studies also suggest that vitamin C may play a part in the collagen biosynthetic pathway by activating collagen metabolism and dermal synthesis of elastic fibres. \n\nUnfortunately, a correctly formulated topical vitamin C preparation is a difficult and costly process. Many formulations on the market are manufactured cheaply and are basically ineffective. There are many topical vitamin C preparations available that claim to benefit photoaged skin. However, almost all of these claims have no rigorous scientific testing to back them.  The problems lies in the fact that vitamin C is most commonly found in the form L-ascorbic acid. This is highly unstable when exposed to oxygen, making it become useless. In addition, many of the currently available topical vitamin C preparations do not penetrate the skin sufficiently to make any difference. Research is currently underway to optimize a stable and effective topical vitamin C formulation. \n\n\n\n**Hyaluronic Acid**\n\nNot effective as a topical agent, but is considered a safe and effective dermal filler.  Tiny quantities of hyaluronic acid are injected through very fine needles, boosting the skin's own hyaluronic acid. The effects can be maintained by small ‘top-up’ treatments as required, generally about twice a year. \n\n[Add-on: I refer here to the use of HA to \"plump\" the skin and reduce lines, not to possible applications in moisturizers - I expand on this in my reply to u/aelfaerie]\n\n\n**Niacinamide**\n\nFinally some good news ;)\n\n*Acne*\n\nNicotinamide, available in topical cream, gel and oral forms (e.g. trade name Nicomide), has been shown to be effective in clearing acne. In a controlled clinical trial, 4% nicotinamide gel was found to be as effective as the topical antibiotic 1% clindamycin gel in the treatment of acne vulgaris in 76 patients with moderate acne. The study concluded that the anti-inflammatory properties of nicotinamide may have contributed towards its success in acne. \nNicotinamide also reduces facial sebum production. Sebum is responsible for facial shine and contributes to noninflamed comedones and inflammatory acne lesions. Results of a well-controlled clinical trial in Caucasian and Japanese women have shown that application of 2% nicotinamide moisturiser to the face for 4-6 weeks reduces sebum production with significant differences in facial shine and oiliness.\n\n\n*Anti-aging*\n\nIn multiple clinical studies, topical nicotinamide improved fine lines and wrinkles, hyperpigmented spots, red blotchiness, and skin sallowness (yellowing) as well as elasticity. One study showed nicotinamide to increase the skin's production of ceramides, which are natural emollients and skin protectants, thus improving skin hydration. \nA double-blind, placebo-controlled, split-face, left-right, randomised 12-week study in 50 women evaluated the effects of 5% topical nicotinamide on various signs of skin aging. The researchers reported topical nicotinamide resulted in significant improvement in fine lines/wrinkles, pigmentation, texture and red blotchiness. The study was sponsored by Proctor and Gamble. \nAnother study of 30 healthy Japanese females reported improvement of eyelid wrinkles after 8 weeks of application of a cosmetic containing 4% nicotinamide. \nNicotinamide is well tolerated and often can be used by those who cannot tolerate topical retinoids or fruit acids. \n\n\nSource: www.dermnetnz.org (a fantastic clinical resource on all things dermatological). This is essentially a hodge-podge of copy+pasted excerpts to attempt to convey the information. Hopefully this clears things up for some people :)\n\n\nEDIT: added some clarification to my brief blurb on HA. It's great that there is some boisterous discussion coming from my humble post, so thanks everyone!",

Many formulations on the market are manufactured cheaply and are basically ineffective\n\nOkay, but it would be good to know what you've found from your research constitutes a \"correctly formulated\" LAA preparation. Would it happen to be one at a low enough pH (such 3, for example), stabilized, and in a dark or opaque bottle and stored in a cool dark dry place to slow the oxidation process? Because there are a few serums that hit those requirements, and a shoutout to those would be good.\n\n>Not effective as a topical agent, but is considered a safe and effective dermal filler\n\nEffective for what? For semi-permanently plumping up wrinkles or boosting HA production within the skin? Or for hydrating and temporarily plumping skin and helping to alleviate dryness and dehydration? Because if it's the latter, then I'd argue that many, many people are going to point out that it has done just those things for them. And that that is what most people expect out of HA, not semi-permanent wrinkle filling or HA production stimulation.\n\nAlso, as another commenter pointed out, you do talk about nicotinamide exclusively in your niacinamide section--can you clarify why that is in the original post?\n\nSorry if this comes across as aggressive, but as it reads, your post seems like it's clearly discouraging the use of two ingredients that many people (including me) have found very effective for what we expect--and I think most of us know what to expect from these ingredients and have an idea of what to look for re:formulation and other considerations.",

    "body": "After starting [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/510zfo/should_we_be_using_low_ph_shampoo/) yesterday, I decided to put together a list featuring ABers' suggestions (from that post) and the results of my own research. Perhaps in due time we can have another spreadsheet as ppl begin pH testing their own products... but here's what I have for  now! (and ofc I'm happy to update this list w/ any comments that come into this post << I have not done this yet for this post, will update at end of day or so!!)      \n\nI'm lumping shampoos & body washes together b/c IMO surfactants are surfactants are surfactants so any body wash can be used on the hair and vice versa (and face, honestly, if the ingreds are gentle enough - but as it so happens, few of these are)   \n\n- don't laugh yall, but one of the lowest pH & lowest cost options out here is ~intimates~ body wash. our lady gardens have a low pH and so do the washes designed for that area.    \nSummer's Eve is quite inexpensive, you can get 45oz (15oz x3) for only $13 on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=summer%27s+eve)! simple ingredients too: *Purified Water, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Decyl Glucoside, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Ammonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Disodium Edta, Fragrance, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Fd&C Blue No. 1*. those who are prone to SD are advised to avoid SLES & SLS, but some can tolerate ALES, so I might try this for shampoo - why not?! my husband might be a little confused but whatevs #killinthegame     \n[and as for exactly what pH it is, website says: *Summer’s Eve’s pH-balanced products are formulated to be in harmony with the areas on which they are used. For topical application to the skin, they are formulated for a slightly acidic pH (about 5-6). For application to the vagina, they are formulated for mildly acidic pH (a pH of about 3.0-3.5).* I'm not certain which category washes fall under lol]\n\n- [Aqua Glycolic](http://www.aquaglycolic.com/product-aqua-glycolic-shampoo-body-cleanser) makes a pH 4.5 shampoo/body wash with 14% glycolic acid, retails ~$16/8 oz      \n\n- [Neutrogena T-Sal](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/t-sal-+therapeutic+shampoo+-+scalp+build-up+control.do?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=PLA+-+Hair+-+SKU&utm_term=&utm_content=|mkwid|sQN6gfQPl_dc|pcrid|121181768720) has long been my go-to during SD flareups, a bit pricy to use regularly though (~$7/4.5 oz). it's 3% salicylic acid and I remember reading somewhere the pH is ~4.5     \n\n- everything from [Sebamed](https://www.sebamedusa.com/facial-cleanser#?offset=0&limit=24) is listed as pH 5.5, with the exception of a feminine care wash that's listed as 3.8 (I've seen it on some etailers but not on their official website, possibly DC'ed?) & a post-menopausal feminine care wash listed as 6.0; their shampoos and body washes aren't cheap tho. Cerave foaming is cheaper per oz <-- not sure how it would fare as a shampoo, but I bet Cerave would be a perfectly fine option for body wash!   \n\n- u/ms_moonlight recommends shampoos from \"*Keracare. It's marketed towards black women, but anyone can use it.*\" this makes sense, as relaxers are often super basic, so acidic shampoos are very important. after researching this brand a bit, I can confirm that all of their shampoos & conditioners list their pH on the front! I've seen anything from [4.5](https://www.amazon.com/AVLON-Keracare-Lather-Shampoo-Ounce/dp/B0054Y1KO2/ref=sr_1_10_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1473012244&sr=8-10&keywords=keracare+shampoo)-6 (and even lower for their conditioners). sells for about $10/8 oz (but you can find cheaper) to under $20/1L, easily available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=keracare+shampoo)!\n\n- Many salon/higher end brands are labeled with pH 4.5-5.5; of these, Joico can often be obtained relatively inexpensively at $20-30 for 1L, but u/oliviart123 cautions: *NEVER buy (american) professional salon brands anywhere OTHER than a licenced salon. It is illegal for someone to sell them on amazon/ebay and at drugstores like target/walgreens/walmart, even costco. Theres a huge black market for counterfeit salon products which is why you \"see\" them everywhere. No salon brand actually sells on amazon and most of the bottles will say its only gaurenteed to be legit IF purchased from a licensed salon.*   \nrelated, I know [Sally Beauty](http://www.sallybeauty.com/shampoo/Hair01,default,sc.html#~EDGE~!sort.axis__default~~!page.size__48~~page.number__1~~!curated.hair_solutions__Color%20Protect!~EDGE~) tends to have a lot of pro-quality stuff at pleb prices, so I'd be interested to see if any of their shampoos list pH's   \nalso, I believe Nexxus Therappe is also in the correct range\n\n- u/julietpae suggests [Malibu C](https://www.malibuc.com/catalog/cn/60/shampoos) shampoos *Malibu products are designed from a Vitamin C/ascorbic acid complex that is proven to stop and prevent oxidizers from effecting your hair. Most of all their products are vegan/gluten/sulfate/paraben and fragrance free* I haven't been able to confirm their pH anywhere, but maybe it's listed on the bottle?    \n\n- lastly, not surfactants, but u/im_twelve_ and u/thee_zohan both recommend the Herbal Essences cleansing conditioners. u/okayzac adds: it's good to use something purifying still once in awhile. Things like cleansing conditioners that do not provide any surfactant cleanse can potentially lead to hair loss (i.e Wen is being sued over this) we can build up the hormone DHT which when we reach too high of levels can lead to hair loss.   \n\n    FYI: any \"no more tears\" baby shampoo probably has pH ~7\n\n\n**Asian/international products**   \n\n- Lador acid shampoo: pH 4.5, $8/150ml from [Memebox](https://us.memebox.com/damage-protector-acid-shampoo?pdref=category)   \n\n- u/noys has pH tested Ryoe damage care shampoo as 5.5, kracie moisturizing shampoo 5.5-6. u/okayzac lists the Ryoe anti-aging shampoo as HG (not pH tested, but hopefully similar!)  \n\n- u/marybanana says the Ka'fen acid shampoo series (marketed towards color protection) from Taiwan lists *shampoo is 5.4, and the conditioner is 4.0. It's been two weeks, and my scalp has shown distinct improvement* but hasn't found a good ordering source yet  \n\n- u/xomandark *Whamisa has a line of shampoo (one for oily scalp, one for dry scalp) and they are both pH 4.5. I used the dry version for quite some time and it was pretty soothing to my easily irritated scalp. They also have a scalp tonic which is THE BEST at calming irritation* ordered from testerkorea   \n\n- breathlessly waiting for the exact brand name from u/neko-miko *Since I started Keratin treatments, I had to stop using shampoo with sulphates and sodium chloride.\nAfter searching for a while (and using the Sebamed shampoo which was fine and also cheaper in Germany), I now use a super cheap low-ph shampoo / shower gel combo made for kids which fulfills all my requirements and costs less than 1€.\nI haven't had any scalp problems since.*   \n\n- Eucerin makes a [pH 5 shampoo](http://int.eucerin.com/products/dermocapillaire/ph5-mild-shampoo) but it doesn't seem very easy to order (or at least, I'm not nearly as savvy with sources for ordering from Europe as from Asia haha)    \n\n\nIf you google around, pplz on the Internet have also done some pH testing, e.g. [here](http://www.thenaturalhavenbloom.com/2012/02/ph-of-shampoo-ultimate-list.html), [here](http://forums.longhaircommunity.com/showthread.php?t=90642), [here](http://acovant.com/shampoo.html)",

I wasn't expecting fireworks, it's just a cleanser, but it does the job very well, no tightness, no irritation. And it just couldn't get any cheaper!

    "body": "**HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT: The Pioneering Work of**\n\n**FREDERICK ROBERT KLENNER, M.D.**\n\n[by Andrew W. Saul](https://web.archive.org/web/20080125013301/http://www.doctoryourself.com/klennerbio.html)\n\nAssistant Editor, Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine\n\nReprinted with permission from *J Orthomolecular Med*, 2007. Vol 22, No 1, p   31-38.\n\n***“Some physicians would stand by and see their patient die rather than use ascorbic acid because in their finite minds it exists only as a vitamin.”*** (F. R. Klenner, MD)\n\nThe sound barrier was broken in 1947. The Korean War began in 1950. In between was the polio epidemic of 1948-9, during which Dr. Frederick Robert Klenner cured every polio case he saw by using vitamin C.\n\n# VITAMIN C AGAINST POLIO\n\nClaus W. Jungeblut (1) had the initial idea; William J. McCormick (2) was an early proponent of frequent gram-sized doses. But it was Frederick Robert Klenner who first gave polio patients tens of thousands of milligrams of vitamin C per day. He had been doing so since before D-Day.\n\n“From 1943 through 1947,” writes Robert Landwehr (3), “Dr. Klenner   reported successful treatment of 41 more cases of viral pneumonia using   massive doses of vitamin C. From these cases he learned what dosage and route of administration - intravenously, intramuscularly, or orally - was best for each patient. Dr. Klenner gave these details in a February 1948 paper   published in the *Journal of Southern Medicine and Surgery* entitled ‘Virus Pneumonia and Its Treatment with Vitamin C.’ (4) This article was the first of Dr. Klenner’s twenty-eight (through 1974) scientific publications.”\n\n***“When I first came across Klenner’s work on polio patients,”*** writes Thomas Levy, **“I was absolutely amazed and even a bit overwhelmed at what I read. . . To know that polio had been easily cured and so many babies, children, and some adults still continued to die or survive to be permanently crippled by this virus was extremely difficult to accept**. . . Even more incredibly, Klenner briefly presented a summarization of his work on polio at the Annual Session of the American Medical Association on June 10, 1949 in Atlantic City, New Jersey:\n\n***‘It might be interesting to learn how poliomyelitis was treated in Reidsville,    N.C., during the 1948 epidemic. In the past seven years, virus infections have been treated and cured in a period of seventy-two hours by the employment of massive frequent injections of ascorbic acid, or vitamin C. I believe that if vitamin C in these massive doses - 6,000 to 20,000 mg in a twenty-four hour period - is given to these patients with poliomyelitis none will be paralyzed and there will be no further maiming or epidemics of poliomyelitis.’*** Levy concludes:  “The four doctors who commented after Klenner did not have anything to say about his assertions.” (5)\n\n“How then,” asks Landwehr, “could a Dr. Fred R. Klenner, a virtually unknown general practitioner specializing in diseases of the chest, from a town no one ever heard of, with no national credentials, no research grants and no experimental laboratory, have the nerve to make his sweeping claim in front of that prestigious body of polio authorities?” Indeed, Klenner was hardly a man to mince words. “When proper amounts are used, it will destroy all virus organisms,” he would say. “Don’t expect control of a virus with 100 to 400 mg of C.” (6)\n\nKlenner administered ascorbate by injection, and, as Lendon H. Smith describes in great detail in the *Clinical Guide to the Use of Vitamin C: The Clinical Experiences of Frederick R. Klenner, M.D*., Klenner found that “the most effective route was intravenous, but the intramuscular route was satisfactory. He gave at least 350 mg per kilogram of body weight.” That quantity per day is a dose of 25,000-30,000 mg or so for an adult. Yet, Smith adds, ***“With 350 mg per kilogram of body weight every two hours, he could stop measles and dry up chicken pox.”***\n\nThis is indeed a large amount of vitamin C. Such use exemplifies the modern orthomolecular physician. Klenner’s doses were enormous, flexible and symptom-driven. The sicker the patient, the higher the dose. Massive ascorbate treatment cured every one of 60 polio cases Klenner saw. He published his report in *Southern Medicine and Surgery* in July of 1949. (7) All patients were well in three days. None had any paralysis.\n\nIn a 1950 letter, Klenner wrote:\n\n“Since my last communication, I have seen four new cases of poliomyelitis. All of these have completely recovered. Three cases were seen in the acute febrile stage and in each instance, using 65 mg per kg body weight (by injection) every two (to) four hours, recovery was spontaneous in 48 hours.” (8)\n\nIn 1951, “In an especially incredible case,” Levy says, “Klenner (9) described a five-year-old girl stricken with polio. This child had already been paralyzed in both her lower legs for over four days! The right leg was completely limp, and the left leg was determined to be 85% flaccid. Pain was noticed especially in the knee and lumbar areas. Four consulting physicians confirmed the diagnosis of polio. Other than massage, vitamin C was the only therapy initiated. After four days of vitamin C injections the child was again moving both legs, but with only very slow and deliberate movement. Klenner also noted that there was a “definite response” after only the first injection of vitamin C. The child was discharged from the hospital after four days, and 1,000 mg of oral vitamin C was continued every two hours with fruit juice for seven days. The child was walking about, although slowly, on the 11th day of treatment. By the 19th day of treatment there was a “complete return of sensory and motor function,” and no long-term impairment ever resulted. Vitamin C not only completely cured this case of polio, it completely reversed what would undoubtedly have been a devastating, crippling result for the remainder of this girl’s life.” (4) **For such elegant results, in the days before widespread use of either antibiotics or vaccination, one may wonder why Klenner was not awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

No real symptoms other than a little discomfort in her left rib and mild fatigue. Things went downhill extremely fast. A week after the news, she had a stroke due to clotting. A week after that, she started spitting and coughing up copious amounts of blood. The main tumor had grown into her bronchus causing the bleeding. She also had pericardial effusion and pleural effusion which she had drained twice. A supply of oxygen was necessary, 15 liters at a time and bipap for a few days. During my time bedside with her, I started doing research and came across fenbendazole and its potential against cancer. 9/19 She started chemo as surgery and radiation were not options. (3 week cycle of Caboplatin / Paclitaxel). 9/22 She started the Joe Tippens Protocol (without the doctor knowing) 3 weeks later, same chemo infusion but added Opdivo and Yervoy. On 10/12, started Ivermectin (again without the doctors knowledge). By Halloween we really started noticing improvement. The middle of November, no more fluid in the lungs and no more oxygen needed. She continued chemo and immunotherapy up until her last PET/CT scan on 12/18. Results were unbelievable compared to the initial scan. Brain was completely clear, lymphnodes in her neck were completely resolved, lyphnodes in both lungs were completely resolved, and the main tumor in the left lung has shrunk to almost nothing! Radiation is now on the table, but we told her doctor that she needs a break. The chemo and immunotherapy has taken a toll on her body. Overall it’s been an amazing turnaround. We went from doctors telling us she needed hospice to her almost back to her old self (a few more lbs. to go lol). I can’t be 100% certain its been because of the fenben and ivermectin, but when all the doctors are scratching their heads at the vast improvement she’s made, it makes me think it played a huge role.

She did some radiation treatments, and 1 round of chemo.  She quit chemo after that first one.

        "body": "My wife and I have personal experience with fenbendazole and ivermectin.\n\nAugust 28, 2024 my wife was diagnosed with what the doc called very aggressive poorly differentiated non small cell lung cancer (Stage 4). No real symptoms other than a little discomfort in her left rib and mild fatigue. Things went downhill extremely fast. A week after the news, she had a stroke due to clotting. A week after that, she started spitting and coughing up copious amounts of blood. The main tumor had grown into her bronchus causing the bleeding. She also had pericardial effusion and pleural effusion which she had drained twice. A supply of oxygen was necessary, 15 liters at a time and bipap for a few days. During my time bedside with her, I started doing research and came across fenbendazole and its potential against cancer. 9/19 She started chemo as surgery and radiation were not options. (3 week cycle of Caboplatin / Paclitaxel). 9/22 She started the Joe Tippens Protocol (without the doctor knowing) 3 weeks later, same chemo infusion but added Opdivo and Yervoy. On 10/12, started Ivermectin (again without the doctors knowledge). By Halloween we really started noticing improvement. The middle of November, no more fluid in the lungs and no more oxygen needed. She continued chemo and immunotherapy up until her last PET/CT scan on 12/18. Results were unbelievable compared to the initial scan. Brain was completely clear, lymphnodes in her neck were completely resolved, lyphnodes in both lungs were completely resolved, and the main tumor in the left lung has shrunk to almost nothing! Radiation is now on the table, but we told her doctor that she needs a break. The chemo and immunotherapy has taken a toll on her body. Overall it’s been an amazing turnaround. We went from doctors telling us she needed hospice to her almost back to her old self (a few more lbs. to go lol). I can’t be 100% certain its been because of the fenben and ivermectin, but when all the doctors are scratching their heads at the vast improvement she’s made, it makes me think it played a huge role. We have truly been blessed and I feel like our and everyone’s story should be heard.",

    "body": "\n\n1824: Metal workers had suffered for centuries from a paralysis similar to polio caused by the lead and arsenic in the metals they were working with. English scientist John Cooke observed: 'The fumes from these metals, or the receptance of them in solution into the stomach, often causes paralysis.'\n\n1890: Lead arsenate pesticide started to be sprayed in the US up to 12 times every summer to kill codling moth on apple crops.\n\n1892: Polio outbreaks began to occur in Vermont, an apple growing region. In his report the Government Inspector Dr. Charles Caverly noted that parents reported that some children fell ill after eating fruit. He stated that 'infantile paralysis usually occurred in families with more than one child, and as no efforts were made at isolation it was very certain it was non-contagious' (with only one child in the family having been struck).\n\n1907: Calcium arsenate comes into use primarily on cotton crops.\n\n1908: In a Massachusetts town with three cotton mills and apple orchards, 69 children suddenly fell ill with infantile paralysis.\n\n1909: The UK bans apple imports from the States because of heavy lead arsenate residues.\n\n1921: Franklin D. Roosevelt develops polio after swimming in Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick. Toxicity of water may have been due to pollution run-off.\n\n1943: DDT is introduced, a neurotoxic pesticide. Over the next several years it comes into widespread use in American households. For example, wall paper impregnated with DDT was placed in children's bedrooms.\n\n1943: A polio epidemic in the UK town of Broadstairs, Kent is linked to a local dairy where cows were washed down with DDT.\n\n1944: Albert Sabin reports that a major cause of sickness and death of American troops based in the Philippines was poliomyelitis. US military camps there were sprayed daily with DDT to kill mosquitoes. Neighboring Philippine settlements were not affected.\n\n1944: NIH reports that DDT damages the same anterior horn cells that are damaged in infantile paralysis.\n\n1946: Gebhaedt shows polio seasonality correlates with fruit harvest.\n\n1949: Endocrinologist Dr Morton Biskind, a practitioner and medical researcher, found that DDT causes 'lesions in the spinal cord similar to human polio.'\n\n1950: US Public Health Industrial Hygiene Medical Director, J.G. Townsend, notes the similarity between parathion poisoning and polio and believes that some polio might be caused by eating fruits or vegetables with parathion residues.\n\n1951: Dr. Biskind treats his polio patients as poisoning victims, removing toxins from food and environment, especially DDT contaminated milk and butter. Dr. Biskind writes: 'Although young animals are more susceptible to the effects of DDT than adults, so far as the available literature is concerned, it does not appear that the effects of such concentrations on infants and children have even been considered.'\n\n1949-1951: Other doctors report they are having success treating polio with anti toxins used to treat poisoning, dimercaprol and ascorbic acid. Example: Dr. F. R. Klenner reported: 'In the poliomyelitis epidemic in North Carolina in 1948 60 cases of this disease came under our care... The treatment was massive doses of vitamin C every two to four hours. Children up to four years received vitamin C injection intramuscularly... All patients were clinically well after 72 hours.'\n\n1950: Dr. Biskind presents evidence to the US Congress that pesticides were the major cause of polio epidemics. He is joined by Dr. Ralph Scobey who reported he found clear evidence of poisoning when analyzing chemical traces in the blood of polio victims.\n\nComment: This was a no no. The viral causation theory was not something to be questioned. The careers of prominent virologists and health authorities were threatened. Biskind and Scobey's ideas were subjected to ridicule.\n\n1953: Clothes are moth-proofed by washing them in EQ-53, a formula containing DDT.\n\n1953: Dr. Biskind writes: 'It was known by 1945 that DDT was stored in the body fat of mammals and appears in their milk... yet far from admitting a causal relationship between DDT and polio that is so obvious, which in any other field of biology would be instantly accepted, virtually the entire apparatus of communication, lay and scientific alike, has been devoted to denying, concealing, suppressing, distorting and attempts to convert into its opposite this overwhelming evidence. Libel, slander, and economic boycott have not been overlooked in this campaign.'\n\n1954: Legislation recognizing the dangers of persistent pesticides is enacted, and a phase out of DDT in the US accelerates along with a shift of sales of DDT to third world countries.\n\n(Note that DDT is phased out at the same time as widespread polio vaccinations begin. Saying that, polio cases sky rocket only in communities that accept the polio vaccine, as the polio vaccine is laced with heavy metals and other toxins, so the paralysis narrative starts all over again. As the polio vaccines cause huge spikes in polio, the misinformed public demand more polio vaccine and the cycle spirals skyward exponentially)\n\n1956: the American Medical Association mandated that all licensed medical doctors could no longer classify polio as polio. All polio diagnosis would be rejected in favor of Guillian-Barre Syndrome, AFP (acute flaccid paralysis), Bell's Palsy, Cerebral Palsy, ALS, (Lou-Gehrig's Disease), MS, MD etc etc. This sleight of hand was fabricated with the sole intent of giving the public the impression that the polio vaccine was successful at decreasing polio or eradicating polio. The public bought this hook, line and sinker and to this very day, many pro vaccine arguments are ignited by the manufactured lie regarding the polio vaccine eradicating polio.\n\n1962: Rachel Carson's Silent Spring is published.\n\n1968: DDT registration cancelled for the US.\n\n2008: Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) is still a raging in many parts of the world where pesticide use is high, and DDT is still used. AFP. MS, MD, Bell's Palsy, cerebral palsy, ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease), Guillian-Barre are all catch basket diagnosis, all similar in symtpoms, tied to heavy metal poisoning and high toxic load. \n\n2008: WHO states on its website: 'There is no cure for polio. Its effects are irreversible.'\n\nConclusion: Modern belief that polio is caused by a virus is an ongoing tragedy for the children of the world. Public funds are wasted on useless and dangerous vaccines when the children could be treated with antitoxins. A call into failing vaccine mythology is warranted, as is a complete investigation of the real agenda being executed against humanity involving science, chemicals, vaccines, the medical field in general, and the government.\n\n\nNow can we stop saying polio vaccines saved lives because they didn’t and don’t. It’s a pointless vaccine(s) that could possibly injure you,doesn’t give you immunity from the toxicity.\nIt can give you the symptoms of paralysis like lusted above. \nYou cannot create a vaccine for a toxicity problem. You cleanse your body and live a healthier lifestyle. \nWhy is it still on the CDC schedule? \nMakes a lot sense *eyeroll*\n\nBig pharmaceutical and all their buddy companies and funders and fundees whatever, they don’t have our best interests at heart. \nBill Gates, WHO, CDC, Anyone who thinks there should be a mandatory worldwide vaccine is full of shit and they are doing it for the money and agenda in play.",

We know what the RNA of Poliovirus looks like, how it replicates, pretty much everything about it. Claiming that  Acute Flaccid Paralysis  is Polio in disguise shows you don't know what you are even talking about. Acute Flaccid Paralysis  is a SYMPTOM of Polio, but also a symptom of many other things, such as Guillain-Barre. If you have Acute Flaccid Paralysis, but do not have Poliovirus, you do not have Polio.\n\nIsn't it weird that the number of cases of Polio just so happened to dramatically decrease at the exact same time the vaccine became widely available? What a coincidence that is.\n\nHas the vaccine been known to cause Polio in very rare cases? Yes. Is Polio now so rare of a disease that pretty much the only cases of it worldwide are CAUSED by the vaccine? Yup.\n\nDoes that mean the vaccine did nothing and Polio was never eradicated? Nope.\n\nThis is one of the problems with the Conspiracy sub. There are 3 types of people. The first type is literal shills who intentionally spread misinformation to cover something else up and make Conspiracy Theorists look bad/crazy. I don't think you're that. The second type of people are the genuine Conspiracy Theorists who want to learn, are able to analyze evidence properly, and can weigh fact from fiction via the scientific method. I don't think you're that. The third type of people are the genuine Conspiracy Theorists who DON'T have this skill. Flat earthers, for example. They THINK they have the skill in spades, and that only they are onto the \"true\" knowledge that everybody else doesn't have and they desperately want you to know it! Meanwhile what they are saying is complete nonsense with zero evidence. That's you, I think.\n\nDDT wasn't phased out until YEARS after Polio went away.

    "body": "**24, F**\n\n**Skin type**: Dry, sensitive\n\n**Climate**: Hot, humid SG\n\nI was first introduced to the world of AB earlier this year around Feb-Mar, and Innisfree's Green Tea Seed Serum was my gateway drug though I've since scrapped that out of my routine. I've always known that my skin was dry and sensitive but I did not realise that beyond just being dry, I was also awfully dehydrated, which contributed to my skin sensitivity. At its worst, I had plenty of closed comedones on my forehead along my hairline, dry and flaky skin between my brows and under my eyes (with already bad hereditary dark circles + eye bags), and I would also randomly break into itchy hive-like patches on my face every now and then. \n\nMy first priority was to fix my damaged moisture barrier and the improvements were exponential once I got the hang of things. I haven't seen my skin flake once since I introduced a proper skincare routine, and in fact, my skin seems to have normalised to the extent of getting a little oily at the end of a long day. The hives I get on my face now are also few and far between, and are actual reactions to products that my skin doesn't agree with instead of just ... the air? \n\nMoving on, I've recently started introducing actives like Vit C, AHA and BHAs into my routine to address skin tone and textural issues. My skin is definitely far from perfect yet and I'm still struggling with some CCs and hormonal acne on my forehead and cheeks. Apart from attaining that healthy, 'glass skin' glowy look, my goal is to eventually rid my skin of these unsightly bumps, and also lighten the PIEs and PIHs I have from acne that have since healed. \n\nThe following are reviews of products I've tried over the past half year or so!\n\n**Legend:**\n\nHG - Holy Grail, products that I cannot do without and will repurchase to death\n\nRP - Repurchase(d), items that I enjoy but can live without\n\nMRP - May repurchase, products that I'm still in the midst of using and undecided if I like or dislike them\n\nWNRP - Will not repurchase, items that were a waste of my money\n\n~~Strikethroughs~~ \\- Products that I've emptied or sold off\n\n# Oil Cleansers:\n\n**~~Innisfree Olive Cleansing Oil~~** **(PM, WNRP)** \\-   This and the olive cleansing foam has a very similar citrusy scent that I found quite refreshing.  It has a pretty thick texture and isn't quite as slippy as I'd like in an oil cleanser. This was something I never realised, being my first oil cleanser, till I moved on to the Hada Labo one and realised how much softer and more comfortable that was in comparison. Unfortunately, this contains a couple of essential oils, which may be the culprit behind why I was left with red, sensitive spots numerous times after rubbing this into my face a tad longer than I usually do, or when I use this for Fiddy's grit method, hence WNRP.\n\n**Hada Labo Super Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Cleansing Oil‎ (PM, MRP)** \\-   I really enjoy how 'soft' and slippy this feels on my skin, which makes application really pleasant. It has no detectable scent. It removes my makeup/ sunscreen sufficiently well and leaves minimal oily residue behind, which makes this a pretty decent oil cleanser which I will repurchase unless I find something I like better. \n\n# 2nd Cleansers:\n\n**~~Innisfree Olive Cleansing Foam~~** **(AM/PM, WNRP)**  \\-   For a foaming cleanser, this was relatively gentle for my dry and sensitive skin, in comparison with the sample of Innisfree's Green Tea Cleansing Foam I tried which left me really tight and stripped. Nonetheless, this still leaves a bit of a squeaky clean feeling after washing, and I will not repurchase as the pH turned out to be on the high side.\n\n**Hada Labo Gokujyun Foaming Face Wash (RP)**  \\-   This is a very gentle cleanser which leaves behind a slightly slippery film that took some getting used to, especially after my experience with the Innisfree Olive Cleansing Foam. On the flip side, I never realised how stripping the latter was until I tried this. I love how the bottle dispenses the product in such a soft, luxurious foam, and its low pH is also a plus. I already have a refill of this on standby, and will most likely RP till I find something better.\n\n# Clay Masks:\n\n**Innisfree Volcanic Clay Mousse Mask (Occasional use in the PM, MRP)**  \\-   I like how gentle this is, as long as I don't leave this on beyond the recommended application timing (15-20min). Although I don't notice any significant gunk-clearing effects with this, there have been multiple occasions where my face was originally red and blotchy, but calmed down after application of this. I also quite enjoy the walnut shell powder bits in this which means some physical exfoliation when I wash this off. However, I would usually need to rush and slap on a toner/FTE immediately after this or my dry face would start feeling too tight for comfort. MRP unless I find a better clay mask alternative. \n\n**Mamonde Petal Purifying Bubble Mask (Occasional use in the PM, WNRP)**  \\-   Confession: This was an impulse buy which I regretted. I guess I'm still keeping this around for the skintertainment factor, as this was my first bubble mask experience which can be a fun treat every once in a while. However this leaves too much of a squeaky clean feeling despite only one minute of application, and I will not RP especially given its price, and the fact that it does less than the Innisfree Clay Mask which I reviewed above.  \n\n# Actives :\n\n**Klairs Freshly Juiced Vitamin Drop (AM, MRP)** \\-   This was an interesting product - it's as thin as a serum with texture like a dry oil, and feels warm upon application. I use this in the AM after my FTE and toner, before my essences. I like that this gives me a nice healthy glow under my makeup, although I've noticed that it does make me slightly oilier at the end of the day. I haven't been using this long enough to tell if it's lightening my hyperpigmentation and I probably need to use this in the long term to judge, but it certainly does have an immediate brightening effect and evens out my skintone ever so subtly. Like many others, my main issue with this is the clear bottle it comes in, which makes it a lot more prone to yellowing. I'm undecided if I will repurchase this once I'm through, or moving on to a stronger Vit C product, depending on how effective I find this to be. \n\n**Cosrx AHA Whitehead Power Liquid (PM, WNRP)** \\-  After reading many rave reviews, I had high hopes for this product to resolve my textural issues, but I was left disappointed. Being my introductory product into actives, this initially stung my face and left me flushed, but it eventually wore off and I got used to it. When it stings these days, its more of an indication that my skin is sensitised or my moisture barrier is broken. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to do anything for my CCs and patchy forehead so I WNRP after finishing this bottle. I'm also using this on my arms for my KP but progress is slow. Perhaps glycolic acid just isn't for me! \n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA (PM, MRP)**  \\-   This feels more gentle than the Cosrx AHA yet more effective in smoothing my skin out. It absorbs really quickly into my skin with almost zero tingling, so I end up layering this a couple of times whenever it drys, which means I use this up pretty quickly. This has a unique, candy scent to it which I don't really mind. I may either repurchase this or even try the 10% version next. \n\n**Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid (PM, MRP)**  \\-   This has a slightly thicker consistency than water, and I used to think that it did absolutely nothing for me, if not even irritating my skin when I used this all over my face in the first step of my routine. However, this is slowly winning me over after I attempted using this as a spot treatment in the last step of my routine, where I use a dry qtip to wipe off product residue on my targeted spots, then go in with the other end of the qtip soaked in the BHA. I find that using it this way either helps draw CCs to a head for extraction or flattens them, and even noticeably diminished a milia spot that's been under my eye for months. I'm currently using a decant from my sister's bottle, and am still undecided if I will be purchasing the full size or switching over to try something stronger like TO's Salicylic Acid 2% or Paula's Choice 2% BHA after I've used this up. \n\n# First essences:\n\n**~~Mamonde First Energy Essence~~** **(AM/PM, WNRP)** \\-   I tried a 30ml miniature sample of this and quite enjoyed this. This has a thin, liquidy consistency which is absorbed really quickly once patted in, and has a faint floral smell. I can't quite put a finger on what FTEs do for me, but I definitely notice a difference in the resilience of my skin when I have FTEs in my routine, and without. However, I did not repurchase this after using this up as I was trying to cut alcohol and fragrance out of my routine in case they were compromising my dry, sensitive skin, and this product has both ingredients.\n\n**Secret Key Starting Treatment Essence Rose (AM/PM, HG)**  \\-   This has a pleasant, yeasty smell to it and is absorbed fairly quickly by my skin. I've noticed my skin looking slightly more refined ever since this was introduced to my routine, but the game-changer for me was applying multiple, thin layers of this before my hada labo premium. This product gave me the first glimpse of what 'the glow' looks like, which also made me realise that:\n\n1. I've been mistaking oiliness for glowiness.\n2. My skin *loves* ferments!\n\nThe moment of realisation came after I washed my face one morning and noticed my bare skin looking bright, clear and just almost translucent-ish, something I've never perceived before. The packaging too - solid, frosted glass body with a rose gold cap - is also another factor to earn this a permanent spot in my skincare wardrobe! At the rate I'm going through this, I'm really glad that its priced so affordably. I might want to try the regular version of this next out of curiosity, which has a slightly longer ingredient list and also includes arbutin which is currently lacking in my  routine. Fingers crossed it works just as good, if not better! \n\n# Toners:\n\n**Mamonde Floral Hydro Ampoule Toner (AM/PM, WNRP)**  \\-   This has an interesting texture - when first dispensed from the pump bottle, it comes out in a clear, aqueous, almost gel-like blob but subsequently turns more watery and disappears as its patted into the skin. It's pleasant enough to use, but I will not repurchase after finishing this bottle (which seems to last forever) after realising that this has both alcohol(third in the ingredient list) and fragrance as well. I'm looking out for a gentle and hydrating toner I can use multiple skins of, so I won't be repurchasing after I use up this bottle. \n\n**Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Lotion (PM, MRP)**  \\-   Being so highly raved about on this sub, I had pretty high expectations for this product and I'll admit that I was left slightly underwhelmed. It does leave my my skin plumper and more hydrated, but it's also a little too heavy for my liking and it takes a while to be absorbed fully, hence I only use this in the PM. Nevertheless, I still find this to be a nice carrier to mix with other products like TO's Niacinamide, or when I need an extra boost underneath a sheet mask. I'm still undecided if I will repurchase this or try out the original Gokujyun Lotion once I've run out, but I'm really liking this no-frills brand so far.\n\n# Sheet Masks:\n\n**Calming:**\n\n* [Innisfree Skin Clinic Mask: Madecassoside](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8rkyx4/review_entire_range_of_innisfree_skin_clinic_masks/) (HG)\n* Benton Snail Bee Masks - These would've been HG for me as well if not for the fact that it's a little hard to get hold of where I am, plus it's on the pricier side.\n* Leaders' Insolution AC Dressing -   These are great for soothing and healing as well, but I haven't had the chance to test it out proper during a full-blown reaction(not that I want to) so I can't bestow the title of HG on it just yet. \n\n**Brightening**\n\n* Papa Recipe Honey Bombee Masks: [Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8z9e8m/review_papa_recipe_honey_bombee_mask/), Rose Gold (both HG) -   Performance wise I see almost no difference in these two, so I'd just get whichever's cheaper and more available to me. \n* [My Beauty Diary: Black Pearl, Natto](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/95k7nm/review_my_beauty_diary_bestseller_masks/)\n\n**Others**\n\n* Innisfree My Real Squeeze Mask: [Bamboo, Broccoli](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8wuhze/review_innisfree_my_real_squeeze_mask_pt3/), [Fig, Pomegranate, Honey](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8vtrbl/review_innisfree_my_real_squeeze_mask_pt2/), [Oatmeal, Coconut](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8upq33/review_innisfree_my_real_squeeze_mask_pt1_cream/) \\-   These are just nice to keep around in my rotation for occasional use in between since they're quite affordable especially when Innisfree has promotions, though they're pretty basic.  \n* [My Beauty Diary: Hyaluronic Acid](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/95k7nm/review_my_beauty_diary_bestseller_masks/) \\- Good for basic hydration when my skin is in need\n\n# Essences/ Serums/ Ampoules :\n\n**~~Innisfree Green Tea Seed Serum~~** **(AM/PM, WNRP)**  \\-   This was my first introductory product that got me into AB in the first place. It has a special place in my heart, though honestly on hindsight, I probably fell in love with this only because I was so excited to have found a 'mass market' skincare product that didn't irritate my sensitive skin. I know some people can't stand the scent of this, but I personally didn't mind it. Nevertheless, I wasn't quite comfortable with ethanol being so high in the ingredient list, and also later on realised that for its price, this was quite a basic product that provided nothing much more than hydration. I did not repurchase this after finishing up the bottle, and do not plan to especially after discovering so many superior alternatives.\n\n**~~Cosrx Advanced Snail Mucin 96 Power Essence~~** **(AM/PM, WNRP)**  \\-   I really wanted to like this product, especially knowing how it's another cult fave around here. Unfortunately, I was getting a bit more CCs than usual while testing this, and even broke out in hives a couple of times after application, and wasn't sure if this was the culprit. Given its short ingredient list, I really have no idea which ingredient I was sensitive to. It's not snail either, since I've tried and loved and Holy Moly Snail Mask (discontinued, whyyy??), and the next product in this list which is my HG, also contains snail. I sold this off after making it about 20% through. Perhaps I was also put off by the idea applying snail secretion on my face, and the gloopy, stringy texture of this did not help at all. That said, I've found this to be great for soothing itchy mosquito bites! \n\n**Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence (AM/PM, HG)**  \\-   It took me abit of courage biting the bullet and trying this after my experience with the Cosrx Snail, but boy am I glad I did. Unlike the goopy, stringy texture of the Cosrx, this has more of an aqueous gel consistency that is refreshingly lightweight and is absorbed quickly by my skin after patting it in. It also noticeably calms my skin down whenever it’s red and irritated. I only wish that I managed to try the old formulation especially after hearing that many preferred that over this new one. That said, this has definitely taken an irreplaceable spot in my routine unless I find something just as great. I am currently starting on my second bottle of this!\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% (PM, WNRP)**  \\-   I've read about how this product helped many in resolving blemishes and oil production and thought this would be a good addition to my routine. I mix a few drops of this into my Hada Labo Premium which somehow helps it to absorb better, but I really don't see what this is doing for my my skin despite using this regularly for 2 months now. I'm also not a fan of how it tends to foam up when patting into my skin. I'm currently putting this on hiatus and will decide again if I'm selling off my used bottle or continuing to finish this through. Definitely won't repurchase, since on hindsight, a number of items in my routine already has niacinamide anyway. \n\n**~~Scinic Honey AIO Ampoule~~** **(PM, WNRP)**  \\-   This was yet another cult favourite I had high hopes for but got disappointed with. I read that some people really like the scent and I was expecting a fresh, sweet honey fragrance but this smelled a little more spicy and cloying than I expected, which took a little getting used to. The amount in the jar was generous but also really a chore to dispense, and I had to transfer to an airless pump bottle for convenience. It comes in the form of a slightly viscous, golden gel that is easy to spread (a little goes a long way) but leaves a sticky finish on the skin that takes some time to disappear. It's certainly hydrating and I can see why some people like it, but I wasn't sure what it was doing for me. I also stupidly introduced this into my routine with a few other new products simultaneously which gave me a bunch of CCs, so I had to pare down my routine, put this on pause, and with the huge bottle + need to decant this into a pump bottle, I eventually lost patience and just sold my remaining jar off. I never found out if this contributed to my CCs but to be on the safe side, I won't repurchase. I also recently tried a sample of the Skinfood's Propolis Enrich Essence and I much prefer its simpler formula, hydrating properties and luxurious packaging. \n\n# Lotions/ Emulsions :\n\n**Mamonde Floral Hydro Emulsion (AM/PM, MRP)**  \\-  This is a really lovely light and hydrating lotion to use in the AM, which is really saying something given that I live in hot and humid SG. I use this in the last step of my AM routine, or mixed with one pump of Stratia Liquid Gold before my moisturiser in the PM if my skin is desperately dry. This has a thin and non-oily consistency that spreads really easily and drys down to a satin finish, and plays nice with my sunscreen and makeup after. Close to HG status for me, my only qualm is that this contains fragrance and alcohol, both of which I'm trying to avoid in my routine. I'll most likely try other lightweight moisturisers before I make the call about repurchasing this when I'm through. Nevertheless, this is worth trying out if you're not sensitive to fragrance and alcohol! \n\n**Stratia Liquid Gold (PM, MRP)**  \\-   I recall being sold on this product after seeing this one heck of a sexy ingredient list. It's definitely a lifesaver for one of those times when your skin is rebelling, going through a drought or overexfoliated. This has worked well on dry patches on my face. On it's own, it's a little hard to spread but can quickly get too much if you pump just a bit more, so I found that this has the perfect slippage when mixed into my Mamonde Floral Hydro Emulsion. I only use this in the PM when I need it, since it leaves a slightly oily sheen on my face.\n\n# Creams:\n\n**~~A'Pieu Madecassoside Cream~~** **(AM/PM, WNRP)**  \\-   At this point I'm certain that my skin just enjoys being a *difficult little bitch* and protesting whenever I try this sub's favourites on it. I previously ranted about this product [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/91jt0f/discussion_what_products_will_you_never_touch/e2zhsjk) Basically it did the opposite of calming my skin down and made me realise I was sensitive to high amounts of essential oils, plus the urea and lactic acid probably irritated my skin further. Also, it pills awfully under my makeup. I sold the entire tube off after trying it only a couple of times. \n\n**Mamonde Moisture Ceramide Light Cream (PM, MRP)**  \\-   This product was a godsend for me dry, flaky skin when I first started on AB, and also introduced me to the wonderful world of ceramides. Having tried both this and a sample of the 'Intense' version in the same line, I much prefer this for its smooth, creamy texture that is sufficiently moisturising without being overly greasy or heavy. I usually scoop a small dollop of this and it absorbs well into my skin after patting it in, leaving my skin soft and silky the next morning. I just wish that this doesn't contain alcohol and fragrance, and like the Floral Hydro Emulsion, I will most likely try other fragrance and alcohol-free alternatives before deciding if I'm repurchasing this again.\n\n# Oils:\n\n**The Ordinary Rosehip Oil (PM, WNRP)**  \\-  This is another product I wanted to like, but I really don't see what it's doing for me. The smell is also rather unappealing to me. I've been mixing a few drops of this as well into my body moisturiser to use up the bottle more quickly. Perhaps I've been misinformed about the benefits of this oil and have been looking out for the wrong effects or using this wrong, and would appreciate if fans of this could talk me back into liking this!\n\n**The Ordinary Marula Oil (PM, MRP)**  \\-   It was tough finding reviews for this one on this sub, since its more popular counterparts like rosehip or squalene often outshine it. I decided to try this on Gothamista's recommendation and ended up fancying it more than rosehip oil. This is definitely more luxurious and 'oily' so a little goes a long way, and it leaves my skin plump and well-moisturised the next day. When I'm through with this, I might either repurchase or try TO's Squalene Oil instead just to see what the hype is about. \n\n# Eye Products:\n\n**Petitfee Black Pearl & Gold Hydrogel Eye Patch (AM, RP)** \\-   I've reviewed [this before](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8i7449/review_petitfee_black_pearl_gold_hydrogel_eye/), and ended up repurchasing my second tub of this after trying another product (SNP Bird's Nest Aqua Eye Patch reviewed below) and didn't like it. This is not so much of a must-have product for me, but nice to slap on for a quick, albeit temporary pick-me-up on those dreary mornings after a bad night's sleep. \n\n**~~SNP Bird's Nest Aqua Eye Patch~~** **(AM, WNRP)**  \\-   These were similar to the Petitfee ones, except that the essence in this was much more viscous and gooey. However, the main problem with this for me is that because of its consistency, it takes a lot longer for the essence to dry down before I can apply my concealer on my undereyes, and even when its dry, it PILLS. I resorted to having to wipe the extra essence off my face before I could proceed with my makeup which kinda defeats their purpose. I concede that these feel a tad more hydrating and brightening than the Petitfee ones, but unfortunately I don't have the luxury of time every morning to wait for these to dry and take effect. Finished and did not repurchase.\n\n**IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Under Eye Cream (AM/PM, MRP)** \\-   I'll admit, I was sold on this product purely by just looking at its sexyass ingredient list. I mean, an eye cream with *niacinamide, peptides, caffeine, vit C, vit E, ceramide and retinol, etc etc*?? Gimme!! It comes in a little blue tub and the cream is tinged blue as well, though I'd say it's just for cosmetic purposes and doesn't perform any colour-correcting functions. The cream is on the denser side and a little goes a long way, but even when I accidentally go a little heavy handed, this cream still spreads and absorbs really well without leaving a greasy layer. A plus is that it works well in the AM underneath my concealer without pilling too. That said, this is indeed on the slightly pricier side and given the price tag plus ingredient list, I haven't seen any miracles being performed on my awful dark circles yet. I've barey made a dent in the tub though, so perhaps i can only make a fair judgement after I've used this up. \n\n**Laneige Eye Sleeping Mask (PM, WNRP)**  \\-   This was an impulse buy, and while I wouldn't say that I regret this, I can definitely do without it. It comes in a white, viscous emulsion that takes a while to dry down into a slightly tacky film. It does nicely hydrate the skin around my eyes but doesn't do anything for dark eye circles, nor did it claim to do so. I like that this is one of the few eye products that comes with an applicator, but in this case I always cringe a little at how unsanitary it feels to dip the ceramic ball wand back into the bottle after application. The bottle seems to last forever though!\n\n# Sleeping Mask :\n\n**~~Mamonde Calming Hydro Sleeping Mask~~** **(PM, WNRP)**  \\-   Yet another impulse buy, this is what I dub as 'regret in a tub'. I actually enjoyed how lightweight this felt initially, with a texture and consistency similar to that of the Cosrx Overnight Honey Mask. Until one day I was applying this underneath my nose, and caught a whiff of what smelt like straight-up rubbing alcohol. Yeaa ignorant days when I didnt realise ethanol was 2nd in the ingredient list. I couldn't bring myself to use this on my face after that but couldn't sell it off either, so I ended up repurposing this as a subpar body moisturiser just to use it up. Pity about the alcohol, otherwise it feels like this would've been a nicely soothing and lightweight AM moisturiser. \n\n# Sunscreen :\n\n**Skin Aqua UV Watery Gel (AM, MRP)**  \\-   This is the first sunscreen I'm using on my face, on a daily basis, in my 24 years of living. *\\*Cue gasp\\** I guess better late than never, right? Thank goodness I was lucky enough to chance upon this product that my picky skin seems to like, especially after trying some samples of Innisfree's sunscreens, all of which stung and sensitized my skin for some reason. I have a suspicion its either the zinc/titanium/iron oxides that I'm sensitive to, so I'm steering clear of all physical sunscreens to be safe. This comes in a white gel that applies pretty smoothly and leaves no white cast nor sticky residue. It does leave my skin slightly dewy looking but never oily, and plays well underneath my makeup. This is definitely my first (sunscreen) love, but I might wanna check out other sunscreens in the market before deciding if I wanna return and bestow the title of HG to this baby.  Any recommendations are welcome!\n\n# Others :\n\n**Innisfree Bija Trouble Spot Essence (Am/PM as needed, WNRP)**  \\-  I find that most AB products tend to be a little vague when it comes to 'spot treatment' in terms of what should be used when, since 'spots' could refer to a huge range of skin issues. As far as I've tried, I'm not sure if I'm using this wrong but this does naught for whiteheads/ blackheads/ SFs/ clogged pores/ cystic acne or any other type of acne it seems. In fact, I discovered that this works the most effectively in calming down itchy spots or hives when my skin freaks out, or post-extraction to soothe broken skin. I'll probably replace this with the Cosrx Centella Blemish Cream once I've run out. \n\n**Cosrx Acne Patches (PM, HG)**  \\-   This used to do nothing for me until I realised that it works best when applied on zits that have already popped. It's now my go-to everytime I extract a spot, and this helps to draw the remaining gunk to the surface so that I can clear it proper the next day, or just help to flatten swollen spots within a couple of days. In comparison to other brands of hydrocolloid patches I've tried so far, this works the best in terms of adhesivity. \n\n**Mario Badescu Buffering Lotion (PM, MRP)**   \\-   I wouldn't call this a miracle worker, but it does help to either bring those deep, painful cystic acne to a head, or shrink them to a smaller, more tolerable size after several days of use. I just wish that the application of this was more friendly though.  I might wanna try the Alivelab Centella Dressing Powder after I've used this up.\n\n# Wishlist :\n\n* The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% / Paula's Choice 2% BHA / Stridex\n* Klairs Supple Preparation Toner (Unscented)\n* The Ordinary Squalane Oil\n* The Ordinary Ascorbic Acid 8% + Alpha Arbutin 2%\n* Melano CC Spot Treatment Essence\n* Skinfood's Royal Honey Propolis Enrich Essence/ LJH Vita Propolis Ampoule\n* Cosrx Centella Blemish Cream\n* Benton Aloe Propolis Gel / SoonJung Moist Relief All In One Gel\n* Mizon All In One Snail Repair Cream (Black/ Original)\n\nTo add on, I'm not sure if this will be helpful to anyone since they seem quite no-brainer, but these are tips that I wished someone shared with me earlier:\n\n* Do not, I repeat, DO NOT touch your skin even if it feels itchy, because that almost always guarantees problems worse than what you started off with\n* Double cleanse to remove your sunscreen and makeup if you wear any! I can't believe I only discovered oil cleansing this year. \n* Clean your makeup brushes well and frequently\n* Use only clean towels for your face, and also always wash your hands before application of skincare products\n* Change your pillowcase as frequently as possible!\n\nHope this review helps!",

It leaves behind a velet matte finish that could be mistaken for primer. It comes out as a white watery liquid, very runny, so it is perfect for summer. No stickiness at all. I am about No 21 - 23 in Korean foundation skintones and I personally experience no white cast. And on YesStyle it is 9 dollars! I'm going to be buying a bunch soon (to hit the free shipping hehe).",

    "body": "Brilliant article describing four super safe, highly effective treatments to kill cancer including Ivermectin, Fenbendazole, Sodium Bicarbonate, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C):\n\nhttps://veryvirology.substack.com/p/curing-the-incurable-cancer \n\n\"Fenbendazole and its synthetic analog interfere with HeLa cells’ proliferation and energy metabolism via inducing oxidative stress and modulating MEK3/6-p38-MAPK pathway\" https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35569513/\n\n#Testimonies of success\n\n\"My wife and I have personal experience with fenbendazole and ivermectin.\n\nAugust 28, 2024 my wife was diagnosed with what the doc called very aggressive poorly differentiated non small cell lung cancer (Stage 4). No real symptoms other than a little discomfort in her left rib and mild fatigue. Things went downhill extremely fast. A week after the news, she had a stroke due to clotting. A week after that, she started spitting and coughing up copious amounts of blood. The main tumor had grown into her bronchus causing the bleeding. She also had pericardial effusion and pleural effusion which she had drained twice. A supply of oxygen was necessary, 15 liters at a time and bipap for a few days. During my time bedside with her, I started doing research and came across fenbendazole and its potential against cancer. 9/19 She started chemo as surgery and radiation were not options. (3 week cycle of Caboplatin / Paclitaxel). 9/22 She started the Joe Tippens Protocol (without the doctor knowing) 3 weeks later, same chemo infusion but added Opdivo and Yervoy. On 10/12, started Ivermectin (again without the doctors knowledge). By Halloween we really started noticing improvement. The middle of November, no more fluid in the lungs and no more oxygen needed. She continued chemo and immunotherapy up until her last PET/CT scan on 12/18. Results were unbelievable compared to the initial scan. Brain was completely clear, lymphnodes in her neck were completely resolved, lyphnodes in both lungs were completely resolved, and the main tumor in the left lung has shrunk to almost nothing! Radiation is now on the table, but we told her doctor that she needs a break. The chemo and immunotherapy has taken a toll on her body. Overall it’s been an amazing turnaround. We went from doctors telling us she needed hospice to her almost back to her old self (a few more lbs. to go lol). I can’t be 100% certain its been because of the fenben and ivermectin, but when all the doctors are scratching their heads at the vast improvement she’s made, it makes me think it played a huge role. We have truly been blessed and I feel like our and everyone’s story should be heard.\" https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy_commons/s/zc9FSLrPWx\n\n\n\"My wife had a clear cell renal cell carcinoma diagnosis. She did some radiation treatments, and 1 round of chemo.  She quit chemo after that first one.

It was always thick and full, and sometimes the envy of my brothers and friends.\n\nI started shedding heavily over 1.5 yrs ago and after the first 3 months of heavy shedding and serious concern, I did like everyone does and started seeing a dermatologist.\n\nThey gave me minoxidil and of course I saw an increase in the volume of shedded hair, but they reassured me that it would lighten and stop.\n\nAfter 6 months of continued heavy hair loss I told the dermatologist that the minoxidil wasn't working, and the dermatologist said give it a full year of treatment, hang in there and let's see what happens. I reluctantly did so.\n\nAt about 9 months into the minoxidil treatment, I was jaded. I had also used ghk-cu peptide topically and sub-Q injections, micro-needled my scalp, was considering laser light therapy etc. and then decided to go back to the drawing board.\n\nI knew that DHT and sebum build-up was a known cause of follicle miniaturization. Likewise, I also researched to find out the natural pH of the scalp and the pH of a scalp that was oily.\n\nNaturally our scalp is in the acidic side while oily scalps are on the alkaline side of the pH scale.\n\nI decided that I was going to buy a pH meter, and add an acidic substance to my shampoo and remove the sebum/DHT and hopefully give my hair follicles what they needed to breathe, expand and regrow.\n\nI settled on using vitamin C since I knew that it was a safe substance. I later realized that this is also used in beauty treatment products.\n\nI measured out about 1/2 tsp of vitamin C and added it to a large bottle of tresseme shampoo. I got the PH to around 3.5 and decided to try the shampoo.\n\nI applied it to my scalp and left it on for about 5 minutes and scrubbed my scalp thoroughly.\n\nI did 3 treatments, continued doing my scalp microneedling for 1 week, hoping to loosen and clear my scalp of the sebum and DHT.\n\nBy the 3rd treatment, my hair loss had diminished from the size of a large, thick, dense half dollar hair wad down to the size of a pinto bean when rolled up.\n\nIt's been about 2 months and my hair is growing back like crazy.\n\nI later played with the formula a bit because I wanted my wife to try it too. But the problem was that a 3.5pH overly tightens the cuticle of the hair shaft and makes it super frizzy, almost damaged looking.\n\nSo I raised the pH in the new shampoo mixture to just under 5.0 pH.\n\nShe had been shedding heavily for the past 2 years, and I was eager to help her. She reluctantly tried it and although the results weren't as impressive as mine immediately, she did eventually see significant reduction in hair loss over the next 2.5 weeks to the point where she sees anywhere from 20 strands or none at all on her comb after a shower.\n\nWe are both relieved and thrilled about the reversal.\n\nMy wife does not take minoxidil, nor was she microneedling her scalp during her treatments. She treated herself twice.\n\nI went to my dermatology appointment basically for a minoxidil refill, and she asked how my hair shedding was going.\n\nI told her that it had stopped completely. And she said, \"really?\" in a surprised tone. She then said, what did you do?\n\nThis was sort of telling for me in that she wasn't expecting the minoxidil to reverse my hair loss.\n\nSo I told her that I was using a \"new shampoo.\"\n\nBoy did the lights turn on in her head! She got visibly excited and asked, \"what is the name of the shampoo?\"\n\nSo I eased her into what was appearing to turn out to be the shock of her life and explained to her that I bought some shampoo and bought a pH meter and carefully measured out a safe level of vitamin C and added it to the shampoo and used it to see if I could remove the sebum/DHT build-up to regrow my hair.\n\nThis doctor lurched back like she was hit by lightning. Her eyes nearly exploded out of her head with a surprised look on her face as if someone had completely annihilated her philosophical paradigm.\n\nBased on her reaction, I had some idea that I might have stumbled onto something.\n\nI'm writing this in the hopes that someone else might benefit from this cheap treatment.\n\nI'll post the links to the vitamin C, pH meter used to properly measure a safe dose for your scalp, along with the Tresemme shampoo. I got everything but the shampoo from Amazon.\n\nFurthermore, I still don't know if the vitamin C's alteration of the scalps chemistry or the acidic washing of the scalp or both combined is what stopped my hair loss.\n\nMy wife and I also started supplementing iron around this time too, which may help with hair loss recovery since low iron can cause hair loss. We had our Iron tested and since she is anemic, hers is still very low but improving.\n\nYou'll want a high grade conditioner to balance the overtightening in the cuticles caused by the acidic, vitamin C shampoo wash.\n\nI dabbled with the vitamin C strength, so I can say definitively if a 1/4 tsp or 1/2 tsp is safe and effective.\n\nSHAMPOO TREATING SCALP:\n\nWhen applying the shampoo to your scalp, use hot water and massage the shampoo aggressively into the scalp for 3 to 5 minutes. Allow it to sit for another 2 to 3 minutes then rinse, apply conditioner.\n\nFor added benefit I micro-needled my scalp with a .5 mm to 1.0 mm micro-needle to increase angiogenic signalling response in the scalp and promote vascular growth mandatory for follicle enlargement and healthy, thick, hair regrowth. You can do this once per week and up to 3 times per week for aggressive therapeutic use.\n\nAgain, a pH of 3.5 to 5.0 was effective for us. Hopefully it works for you too, if you try it, good luck!\n\n(Hopefully Ive made it clear enough that you can buy these items just about anywhere you want to, I personally like to use Amazon, Walmart, Target etc. I have no interest in promoting any brand or particular store, as someone alluded to.

Following OP directions.The mixture was a bit strong the first use. left my scalp with a feeling that resembled sunburn. Especially after applying the Happy head finoxidil that I started 3 weeks ago. I’ve always had dandruff problems, but the past three years have noticed a lot more , so I wash my hair more often, leaving my hair and scalp dry and ready for fresh flaky buildup.  I have mild crown diffuse thinning and a receding hairline. This post inspired to me to look at factors that could be accelerating hair loss within my entire community. The water in my house is atrocious. The moment I put a sprite filter shower head and used this formulation of vitamin c shampo changed my attitude toward my situation. I am taking it into my own hands after being inspired to look into the contents of this post and the research provided in the comments.\n\nI live on the outskirts of LA in a not so good area with plenty of old houses that probably have the same hard water situation as we do. When I visit the grocery store and see men and women that have thinning similar to my own it justifies my belief. I go to an area above the foothills where they have superior quality of water and notice that men and women have healthier hair. It probably doesn’t hurt that they eat pasture raised organic chicken if you know what I mean. Diet is certainly a factor to consider when looking at ways to mitigate the loss of hair due hard water/MPB/alopecia. \n\nAfter applying the shampoo and conditioner I let my hair dry and rubbed essential oils all over my scalp and hair. 8 hours later my scalp and hair was fresher than EVER. No dandruff for 4 days. Scalp is free of sebum buildup. I can feel my follicles breathing. Washed my hair once in between with regular shampoo. And today have repeated the process all before starting my day.\n\nI decided to go out on a limb and try the vitamin c mixed with a foaming cleanser on my face. My pores were instantly cleared, little bumps are reduced and my face isn’t as oily as usual. \n\nIt’s the water guys. \nIt’s the routine we are stuck in working 9-5’s ,5 days a week. If I wasn’t on vacation right now I probably wouldn’t have the time and energy to do experiment with this. \n\nFilter your water , rid your scalp of metals and crap that builds up from hard water, don’t let your scalp dry out and watch your hair grow like a lawn after a week of rain\n\nAt 3 months on topical fin (happy head) I will post before and afters.

    "body": "For the purposes of this review of multiple products, I’ll be *categorizing items by routine placement* rather than when it was introduced.  These items are very much YMMV but I thought it may be helpful for some who are newer to AB (seen with the large influx of newbie questions I’ve seen in the DHT) or even those wondering about products generally.  Also **this isn’t a particular look at my routine(s)** or how my routine has transformed as I’ve learned more about my skin; rather, this review is of products used to target particular concerns.  This mega-review really came about after a response comment from /u/theCuriousAmerican (whom I thank for keeping me and much of the board in the loop regarding newer products/ lesser known brands in Korea).  I am over 30 but I haven’t started picking out my coffin lining just yet (rose gold silk, plz) so be aware this isn’t really an anti-aging post as I don’t consider myself having “mature” skin (whatever that means).  As I go through reviews, I’ll also include my rational as to why I purchased a product if it wasn’t impulse and link any relevant posts from the sub that informed my purchase. \n\nI've decided to break up this review and present categories like a series.  This post will be centered around 1st cleansers, hydrating toners, and serums.  The second post will be centered around oils, moisturizers/occlusives, and masks. *Also, I will only discuss AB/ sub-related products*. While I went through a smattering of samples, they will not be discussed. All products discussed were used for at least 2-3 months, if not longer. \n\nAbout my skin prior to developing a skincare routine: \n\n- extremely oily\n\n- flaky under makeup (my makeup would separate in hours and have dry patches)\n\n- riddled with closed comedones (whiteheads)\n\n- bumpy skin texture (under the skin pimples)\n\n- uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation (PIH)\n\n- icepick scars\n\n\n**1st Cleanser**:\n\n\n*Heimish All Clean Balm*\n\n- Ingredients: [Posted from CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2186231803.html) so take with a grain of salt as anyone can add or delete ingredients. \n\n\nI've been using this balm since February. My initial impression was satisfaction. It melted well (not as well as Clinique's Take The Day Off), a slight herbal/citrus smell which didn't bother me, and a lower price point than TTDO. The price is really the main positive of this product. I don't find it cleans as well as TTDO so I have to use more product to make sure everything is eliminated. Nowadays I don't even wear a full face or any makeup at all really except Heroine waterproof mascara and Beauty People Lip Tattoo. I usually let this balm sit on my face for a minute or two before going at it and it does remove most of these products. Into May, I'm still satisfied with this product. Sometimes I only use this cleanser at night if I wasn't wearing anything but sunscreen since it does the job and I've worn a full face and it does remove base makeup well enough (even though I need to use more of it). It'll also last a bit longer, I'm thinking 2-3 more months, so at least 6 months of use for me. I also like that this comes in travel size (I got a few from a Ohlolly.com promo).\n\n\nRepurchase? I'd likely repurchase TTDO if choosing between the two, yes TTDO is more expensive but I liked that it removed makeup easier, it melted better as well. \n\n\nFor my next 1st cleanser, I'll likely repurchase TTDO or make my own cleanser as a way to dupe Tatcha's oil cleanser (beautiful cleanser, only had a sample but loved the feeling). \n\n\n**Hydrating Toners**\n\n\n*Kikusamusane High Moist Lotion* (30 mL decant)\n\n- Ingredients: [From CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_5173202878.html)\n\n\nRemember mid-2016 when kikumasamune was on everyone's lips? I purchased a decant of this hydrator partially on the [buzz](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3tgula/a_letter_to_kikumasamune_high_moist_lotion/?st=j2jobol7&sh=17239e4e) created by the sub and other blogs.  This product seemed like a good way to target PIH and increase hydration for my dehydrated skin.  It took me about 2 months to get through my decant. I'm not gonna go through my use of this product because it's been discussed by this sub so much (do a google search). \n\n\nRather, I'll discuss why I ended up not purchasing a full size of this product. I ended up not purchasing a full size because by then I felt my skin didn't need what the Kiku was offering. I didn't get any significant lightening of PIH, brightening yes but I felt I could get brightening from other products. I could get hydration from other products as well.  And I suppose I just wasn't *impressed* enough to want to purchase it. This was also when I realized I get bored of products and the thought of purchasing a 500 ml product seemed so daunting to finish. LOL. \n\n\n*Hada Labo Albutin Lotion Moist*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Arbutin, Disodium Succinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Methylparaben, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose Ether, Sodium Hyaluronate, Styrene/VP Copolymer, Succinic Acid, Tremella Fuciformis Polysaccharide (from hadalabousa)\n\n\nI recently finished this product (mid-April) and I'm so happy I never have to use this product again. LOL. I purchased this product in December on ABX. I primarily purchased it because of its ingredient list and was interested in using a product with MAP and Arbutin to see if it could attack my PIH in anyway. Also, I felt it would be another good addition for my skin that leans perma-dehydrated. Little to no smell, watery texture, and economical. \n\n**Performance**: Overall, I was significantly disappointed by this product and the longer my time away from this product the more I'm able to realize why I'm disappointed.  It just didn't do anything. It felt like I was throwing cloudy water on my face most of the time. Cloudy water that wasn't even showing a difference in my skin. I would take days off from using this product and saw no difference in brightness to my face. I also saw no lightening of PIH. I expect my toners to hydrate *at least* and it seemingly failed on this front as well. I added another toner to back up this one but I don't like wasting product so I finished it. I found it as a good way to give myself lotion masks and to hydrate my legs. Essentially, this may be the most boring product I've ever tried. \n\n\n*Meishoku Extra Moisturizing Lotion Moist* \n\n- Ingredients: [From cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f35b176780.html)\n\n\nI purchased this toner around December from the r/abx with the Hada Labo moist.  I didn’t know what to expect purchasing this product but I did based on the ingredients. I was searching for a product that had ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. I should also add that I was searching for a product that had the 3-1-1 ratio because my face does best with a pretty constant use of acids and I needed something that would deliver on the moisture front. \n\n\n**Performance**: I can't actually say much about this product which I don't know if that's good or bad. It's slightly thicker than the HL moist, it's more moisturizing than HL and I feel like it does more than HL ever did. I still enjoy using it after all this time and I may even repurchase. It absorbs quickly, has no discernible smell, and is pretty economical for the amount you receive vs how long it lasts. If the product ingredient listing is correct and I understand how each ingredient fits, this product may have the 3-1-1 ratio (plz, correct me if I'm wrong as I'd love to know for sure!).\n\n\n*PyunKyang Yul Essence Toner*\n\n- Ingredients: Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\nMy newest toner purchase.  I’ve been using this toner for about 3 weeks so I can only give a first impression.  My main interest in this toner was sparked by [Gothamista’s YT review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9_mJoK4gr4) of this product when she covered the 7 skin layer method.  I was interested in finding another hydrating toner to try out the method as I felt that HL was too thin and really felt more like I was patting ‘cloudy water’ on my face every day. \n\n\nAbout the PKY line: The PKY line was developed by the Pyunkang Oriental Medicine Clinic (info provided by Ohlolly.com).  It boasts a list of ingredients commonly found in these types of products but I was especially interested in milk vecht root extract, which is an extract that I haven’t come across much in products. (NOTE: I've been searching high and low for any clue of what this ingredient does topically, can't find anything.) I’m a bit of a lover for simpler aesthetics.  I like it when bottles are plainly labeled and look like they belong in an apothecary.  In this sense, PKY hits all my wants; sleek and simplistic design, electric blue bottle (hard plastic), and **no** dropper. \n\n\n**Performance**: What I expected from this product was hydration and I can say this toner delivered.  The liquid is slightly thicker than HL lotion moist but not too much.  I live in a high humidity area and we’re going into summer but I don’t expect to rotate this toner out of my routine.  I tend to only need 2-3 layers for the skin method when I’m using this toner. I’ve tried doing up to 7 but my skin calls it quits in absorption around layer 5. But I'm also wondering if this product just isn't as easily absorbed as meishoku. I think this product would be a great skin soother, since it comes across as so ...mild and inoffensive (if that makes sense). \n\n\nHave I seen a discernible difference in my skin using this product?  I don’t think so. I would notice more if my skin didn’t get the proper hydration it needed from this product but I haven’t seen that. \n\n\nMISC: There is no discernible smell but I’m not sensitive to smells.  The bottle is 6.7 oz which is a lot of product and likely this bottle will last me at least 8 months, making the price ($19) very economical. \n\n\nIf I didn’t think I’d have another toner waiting to be purchased, I’d say I’d repurchase this but I already have my sights set on toners by kyotosilk and swanicoco.  \n\n\n**Serums**\n\n\n*OST20*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Ascorbic Acid, Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Butylene Glycol, Glucose, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Xanthan Gum, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Flower Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Glycerin, Zinc PCA, Panthenol, Niacinamide, t-Butyl Alcohol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ubiquinone, Diisopropyl Adipate (from Wishtrend)\n\n\nI'm going to be honest, I won't say much about this product because this sub seems to have a love+hate relationship with it. But I feel like a complete *sucker* for using this product when Timeless's Vit C formula exists. Reviews by [Holysnails](http://www.holysnails.com/2015/03/a-rant-on-osts-c20-and-c215-serums-and.html) and [Fiddy](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2017/01/04/vitamin-c-serum-101-timeless-vitamin-c-serum-review/) and [sub reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4edywb/timeless_vitamin_c_e_ferulic_serum_review_with/?st=j2joba2v&sh=f554f12e) should have had me clicking to Timeless's site. \n\n\nBut no, I tried OST20 first (at least I don't have to wonder) came away disappointed (easily oxidized, serum-like feeling, faint smell, and a bit tacky on the skin). If I regretted purchases this would likely be the ONE I regret most, especially after using Timeless (water-like feel to the skin, subtle scent, stabilized with vit E and ferulic acid, great pricing). NOTE: Please purchase from Timeless's site, while offered on Amazon I can't say for sure that is Timeless's vendor. \n\n\n*Stratia Rewind*\n\n- Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, 2-Dimethylamino Ethanol (DMAE), Panthenol, Hydrolized Rice Protein, N-Acetyl Glucosamine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Tamarindus Indica (Tamarind) Seed Extract, Hydrocotyl (Centella Asiatica) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA\n\n\nAgain, this is another product that is known enough in the sub that I don't really feel like I need to say much. I purchased this product based on the ingredients. I wanted something with niacinamide + nag and licorice. Also, I wanted to support an independent maker who I know was knowledgeable about skincare. I was really interested to see what this product would do for my skin. NOTE: I purchased before stratia dropped the use of biokelp ferment so I've never tried the newest formulation. \n\n\nFor skin feel, this product was slightly oily but sank in well enough. I found it slightly hydrating/moisturizing but not heavy. It really did help with providing a boost of moisture to my skin while being soothing. \n\n\n**Performance**: Overall, I didn't see any significant change in my skin except for moisture/hydration. My PIH was not lightened and I didn't see significant brightening and really that's what I wanted. \n\n\n*Hungarian Water Essence*/*Mizon Hyaluronic 100 Serum*\n\n- Ingredients (BELIF): Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Officinalis(Sage) Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Peucedanum Graveolens (Dill) Extract, Alchemilla Vulgaris Extract, Rose Extract, Poncirus Trifoliata Fruit Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, *Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, *Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, *Nepeta Cataria Extract, *Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Leaf Extract, *Baptisia Tinctoria Root Extract, *Stellaria Media (Chickweed) Extract, +Alchemilla Vulgaris Leaf Extract, **Equisetum Arvense Leaf Extract, **Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Leaf Extract, **Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Triethylhexanoin, Tromethamine, Sclerotium Gum, Ammonium Acryloyldimethltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Trisodium EDTA, ***Fragrance, Citronnellol, Limonene. *Napiers Original Formula. **Napiers Aqua Formula. ***Fragrances of Natural Origin.\n\n- Ingredients (MIZON): Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Copper Tripeptide-1, Butylene Glycol, Sclerotium Gum, 1,2-octanediol, Ethylhexyl-glycerin, Tropolone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Carppyl/capric Triglyceride,Hydrogenated Lecithin, Stearic Acid, C12-c20alkyl Glucoside, C13-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholesteryl Hydroxystearate, Cholesterol, Ceramid 3, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Betula Platpyhlla Japonica Juice, Portaluca Oleracea Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, Amica Montana Flower Extract, Artemisia Absinthium Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Gentiana Lutea Root Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Rasberry) Fruit Extract, Beta-Glucan, Adenosine, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA\n\n\n**Performance**: I'm putting these two together because I felt like they acted as similar products. Very inoffensive serums with little to no scent. I couldn't pinpoint to their overall effect but I will say that when I started mixing them together before application I saw a def increase in the ...bouncy-ness of my skin. I can't explain it and I'm little miffed that separately they didn't perform but together I loved the effect. I refuse to purchase extract water as I got a deluxe sample size from Sephora (Belif got me on the moisturizer train already) and Mizon did very little for my skin alone so both were a dud in my opinion. \n\n\n******\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nI suppose I should discuss my skin now. Overall, I'm pretty happy with where my skin is although I think I'm gonna need laser work for some PIH or start on tret. I don't get flakes even in the face of all the actives I through at my skin. I barely purge (except for retinol) and I don't break out really. When I do breakout, it's usually from products/ environmental, not hormonal. I guess I have a semi-glow, although IRL I just look semi-sweaty or really shiny with makeup on. I'm not as oily and I usually don't get oily until about 4PM now and my makeup no longer separates. \n\n\nI think what's made the largest difference is introducing a hydrating toner. Before this I cleansed and moisturized but hydration was a key element that I wasn't getting. Adding hydration was such a wonderful step towards aiding my skin and I really think that in those who are new to AB, learning the importance of hydration is critical in understanding your skin. ",

    "body": "I live in an area with super soft water. It has been such a pain to remove the chlorine and keep the ph around 6 to 7, and control the algae. Part of the reason is I was trying to make a low maintenance tank and avoid adding air to tank. Not going to the weeds, I have been suggested to use Seachem neutral regulator. Apparently, it is a phosphate buffer! Big no no for the beginner to use especially for soft water. \nAfter some research last night, I found out ascorbic acid is a newer method for neutralizing chlorine without any toxic byproducts. Ascorbic acid is Vitamin C for someone who may not know.\nI did couple simple/not rigorous testing with my food supplemental vitamin C and house bleach. It worked like a charm!! Ordered ascorbic acid powder on Amazon right away!! \nIf you share same frustration and simple want to try a different dechlorinator. Please have a try!\n\nThe water samples from left to right is water+bleach, water+bleach, tap water. The forth spot from top is the result of Cl. Yellow means no Cl,  green means 0.8 mg/l to 3.0 mg/l. I presume dark purple means it is way beyond of test strip range.\nFor each one, I started with 10mg. For the tap water, with 10mg of the not pure vitamin c dissolved. The test strip is showing no Cl.\n\nFor a more detail information and reliable testing, I suggest looking at this article.\n\nhttps://www.fs.usda.gov/t-d/pubs/html/05231301/05231301.html#:~:text=Approximately%202.5%20parts%20of%20ascorbic,slightly%20in%20low%20alkaline%20waters.&text=Sodium%20ascorbate%20will%20also%20neutralize,pH%20of%20the%20treated%20water.\n\nPS, I think adding a small amount of vitamin in the tap water to remove chlorine, probably also good for maintaining the beneficial bacteria in digestive system.",

    "body": "I have been using Nameraka Honpo for over a year, and it's one of my favorite J-beauty brands due to its amazing price point and simple yet effective product lines. \n\nA little about the brand and its lines: most of their products are formulated with soy milk isoflavones. Nameraka Honpo offers several lines, including Moisturizing, Whitening, Aging Care, and Firm & Shiny. Each line includes a complete range of products: cleansing, serum, toner, emulsion, cream, and an all-in-one moisturizer. \n\nAll products contain active ingredients designed to address various skin concerns, such as improving skin texture, reducing fine lines, and evening out skin tone.\n\nEye Creams:\nI've purchased a few eye creams to help with my under-eye bags and circles. I have three different creams from all lines, except Whitening, and haven’t noticed much difference between them. Each one helps with puffiness and brightens my eyes.\nSometimes, when I return to using these creams after a break, I notice that my eye circles are reduced.\n\nFace Moisturizers:\nI have two all-in-one creams from Moisturizing line. These moisturizers are designed to replace the whole skincare routine, excluding cleansing.\nSoy Milk All-in-One Gel Thicker: This is a thicker version of a standard all-in-one cream, suitable for dry or normal to combination skin. I use a smaller amount than I would with the lighter version. The finish is more dewy but takes a little longer to dry. It gives the skin a plump and glass-like look.\n  \n- Soy Milk All-in-One Gel (Lighter Version): This lighter version transforms into a watery texture when massaged. I love the feeling when I apply it, like a splash of cold water. I've used it for over a year but needed a hyaluronic serum for additional hydration around my eyes. It also provides a slight brightening effect. I combined both creams with glutathione serums.\n\nSoy Milk Micro-Foam Facial Wash: This gem cleans my skin perfectly, leaving it feeling squeaky clean. I like that it is a foam from the bottle, and it is very rich and not watery, allowing me to massage it properly. I feel refreshed without any dryness, and I have been using it day and night for a year. I already used 2 bottles\n\nVitamin C Lotion from Whitening line:\nThis lightweight, hydrating lotion is made with L-ascorbic acid 2-glucoside, the stable form of vitamin C. It has effectively improved my pores and rough skin. Some of my family members have used it for several months, and it has significantly improved their skin texture, especially when combined with Hadalabo premium lotion.\nI'm not sure if I should rebuy this. I should probably switch to the serum version, as it can be too much for my skin. \nMedicated Wrinkle Toner from Whitening line:\nIt includes retinol and niacinamide. This toner is lighter than the lotion and has a texture similar to hyaluronic serum. It can be combined with other creams, and it helps reduce freckles and sun pigmentation.\nCover UV Milk\nThis is the last addition to my collection. It includes three types of ceramides and retinol. It is pretty popular in Japan, even though it doesn't provide the best sun protection.\nI wasn't expecting much. But I need to say that this became one of my favorite SPFs. It is also all in one, replacing the whole skincare routine. The finish is dewy and shiny, like a highlighting makeup base. It's not whitening and improves skin tone. I wait 5 minutes before applying makeup. I do this with every SPF except Biore \n\n\n",

Still ascorbic acid.\n\nThankfully, I am retired now and get my vitamin C from whole foods, but meanwhile still thinking about those out there on watch with bad diets and wondering WHAT IS UP with Clif Bar. Are they trying to save a buck or are we running out of Vitamin C? Maybe it messes with taste?

When we formulate we follow a degradation curve and do a test to ensure the label claims at expiration match, the manufacturer could very well be placing the same amount of vitamin C at manufacturing but had to update their claim to meet what actually survives by the end of expiration. \n2. Ascorbic Acid is volatile and could be affecting the quality of the product overtime, often yellowing or drying the product, causing customer complaints.\n3. Yes, they could have reduced the amount to save money but doubtful this made much of an impact. \n\nAs a side note, when people talk about “deficiency” like in these comments, I think they truly dont understand how the RDA is determined or what it means, in short, the RDA is the bare minimum to function. What about what is optimum? That is far more than the RDA recommends and is totally dependent on your total calories, genetics etc",

If you guys are unfamiliar, [AB University has some insight into the scientific world of skincare](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/vitaminc). TL;DR: we should be vigilant for the derivative of Vitamin C our potential serum claims to contain. Not all forms are alike, actually, L-AA is the clear winner. As of yet I have yet to try this sure-to-be HG, but my personal anecdote is MAP reduced the discoloration under my eyes and left a silky finish on my skin. Considering I am not capable of providing the same raw data as a seasoned professional, I should conclude that MAP is a ‘non-clinically proven’ runner-up to L-AA.\n\nI looked for bottles that were amber or blue, labeled their Vitamin C derivative, and listed L-AA as one of the first 5 ingredients. All vials will vary in price, though most will be within $10-$20 range. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Claire-ity Vitamin C Serum](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OKY87OS/ref=ox_sc_act_title_12?smid=AJEX40L1EE1DV&psc=1)\n\nAscorbic Acid (L-AA)—25% Vitamin C\n\n27 ingredients, Vitamin C is listed number 6 and 7. Considering the large number of ingredients, the potency of each of the beginning products listed could potentially be small enough that the 6th and 7th ingredients combined could actually be 25%. (Q&A says 20% Ascorbic Acid and 5% L-Ascorbic Acid)\n\nMultiple actives: Vitamin C, Vitamin A, Hyaluronic Acid\n\nConsidering the claims of the 7th ingredient being 5%, Vitamin A and Hyaluronic Acid must be a very low percentage considering their order in the ingredient list. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n[New York Biology Super Vitamin C](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073X4KPBM/ref=ox_sc_act_title_11?smid=A3K94VWQ8DVMOE&psc=1)\n\nAscorbic Acid (L-AA) & Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (MAP)—+20% Vitamin C\n\n19 ingredients, Vitamin C listed as ingredient 3 and 6. Considering where Vitamin C was listed I would say the percentage is very high. The Q&A couldn’t answer the actual percentage and it was not listed on the provided pictures. \n\nDoes contain alcohol\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Asterwood Naturals Vitamin C Serum](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GVUZODA/ref=ox_sc_act_title_10?smid=A1BEZROHVME686&psc=1)\n\nMagnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (MAP)—20% Vitamin C\n\n6 ingredients, Vitamin C is 2nd and 3rd is Hyaluronic Acid. The following ingredient accounts for less than 2%, so this serum is mostly water. (This is the serum I have tried and I do think it works. I don’t have much else to compare it, but it did reduce some darkness under the eye as well as leave a silky finish on skin. )\n\nMultiple Actives: Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid \n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Majestic Pure Vitamin C Serum](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M5CLQ0A/ref=ox_sc_act_title_9?smid=AEWXAV3T5UC41&th=1)\n\nL-Ascorbic Acid (L-AA), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (MAP), Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate—+10% Vitamin C\n\n19 ingredients, Vitamin C is listed 3rd, 6th and 7th.

I can’t imagine some of the results I could have missed because I didn’t have the patience to investigate over 100 results (ok, it was 102). If hidden gems could be kept in plain sight on the second page of results, I wonder what more I could be missing out on because I simply don’t know any better. \nGood skin is obtainable without the huge price tag as long as you know what and where to look. While searching for ingredients, I spent some time reading the Q&A section. Some people knew what to ask and got indirect or misleading answers, some people seemed to straight up not know what they were answering. Education is the key to our eternal youth, with patience to inspect our potential products, we can all be wise and beautiful glowing gods and goddess!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPM me if you would like to make any amendments.

The 3rd year class would be the first class to graduate with a degree in Human Studies as humans are quite new to the galactic fold. They sit more quietly in the top arch as they exchange notes on the midterm. \n\nHumans.. Or boogymans as they have become jokingly known as. From the death planet: gravity 4x the galactic standard, tolerance and sometimes love for eating bio weapons. Most notably: dihydroxite, a rocket fuel, capsaicin, a class one chemical weapon and finally ascorbic acid, that they put on their fucking candy. The same ascorbic acid that would burn a hole right through a full grown Gorlack. Heat and cold tolerance beyond most species and intelegent, becoming the Apex predators on a planet where they aren't even close to the biggest. \n\nWell, or so they claimed in the books apparently. Some students only took this new coarse out of sheer curiosity and others just wanted the break from the serious subjects. A goofy degree they would always say. \n\nThe doors open at the teaching area. Two officers from the Galactic peace force enter with rifles and then 4 small, covered barrels were wheeled in by a man totally clothed in a biosuit. It was Proffesor Juran. \n\n\"Class\", he started, \"we jave a special guest today.\" The class settling down to a murmur as some student were still settling in their seats. Then the class fell silent. If you ask one of those who were there that day, about the silence that fell that day, they would say \"only the dead of space can come close\". \nA creature walked in from behind the soldiers. \n\n\"Good morning,\" the creature said through a translator on his chest, \"my name is Daniel, and I, am a human.\"",

At least 7 seconds because that was the count most aggreed on they saw it last, having gone through the window of the classroom dissappearing over the great inland Jungle.\n\n\"Probably should have tied that down first..\" Daniel breaking the stunned silence in the room while helping a lightly scorched profesor Ida to her feet. \"Don't worry class, I'll open a window to let the smoke out\", Daniel's second attempt at a joke also falling flat in the stunned audience. \"Tough crowd..\" Daniel smirked as he pulled out a small mineral packed out of his pocket and mixes it in with the water.\n\nThe students now buzzing about what they just witnessed, barely paying attention to the humans concoction. \"Students!\", Daniel waves the almost full glass container of water in the air to try and get this demonstration back on track, \"anyone thirsty..?\". Daniel downs the entire container of water.\n\nSilence again falls on the classroom like a blanket.\n\nOnly interrupted by the whumps of 7 more ships exiting hyperspace above one of the 3 small university planets.\n\n(Thank you for all the kind comments, I am really enjoying writing this story.

    "body": "🙇🏻‍♀️ **Skin background:**\n\n\nDry, sensitive skin. Acne, fungal acne and eczema prone. Easily congested.\nI have PIE and redness, but I don't have much dark spots or discoloration (aside from what's left behind after eczema flared ups) \n\nAlso I live in a dry, hot climate where the sun is really harsh.\n\n\n📈 **About the charts (slide 2 and 3)**:\n\n\n0 means least of the \"title\" and 5 means most of the \"title\"; like \"thickness\" is rated 1 means it's not a thick toner, and is really watery.\n\n\n🧴 **Coming to the product:**\n\n\n- Name: Skin1004 madagascar centella tone brightening boosting toner.\n\n- Period of usage: 1 month\n\n\n- I use it in the morning in this routine:\nCleanse (Benzoyl peroxide cleanser) > Toner 1 (isntree green tea fresh toner) > Toner 2 (this skin1004 toner) > Moisturise > Sunscreen\n\n\n> Ingredients: Centella Asiatica Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Propanediol, Betaine, Allantoin, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Prunus Mume Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Fruit Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Water, Glucose, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n- Fungal acne safe: YES ✅\n\n\n💭 **My thoughts:**\n\n\nWhen I first saw the product the ingredients list looked promising, but i couldn't find much on reddit about it. I use skinsort a lot though (it's an app where you can check whether a product is fungal acne safe or not) and I looked up this product there and the reviews were really good so I ended up ordering it!\n\n\nThis did not disappoint! I think you can get a fair idea of how I feel about the products through the charts that I have attached, but it's really good and it suits my skin well. It's hydrating, soothing, quick absorbing and it works. Also, it mildly exfoliates the skin but it's not too much and in my opinion it's safe for everyday use! \n\n\nI have used skin1004's tone brightening ampoule too, and I like it but I like this toner WAY more than that ampoule, and in my opinion it works better than the ampoule. Plus if you look up the ampoule on reddit many people have said it broke them out, and I suspect the ampoule was breaking me out too, but I didn't have any such issue with this toner.\n\n\nOverall, I would rate it 4.5/5, will keep repurchasing it. Also, i can tell this will last a while because I have been using it almost everyday, and I layer it twice, but I've only used up the amount you see in the picture so 👀\n",

I read AlbMuffin.com for advice, swapped to a high ppd one and have been using Mermaid Skin Gel UV, or Ultraviolette Supreme Screen, and then Heliocare gelcream tinted.\n\nVitamin C:  Timeless C. I love it. High level of ascorbic acid which data shows make the biggest difference to pigment.\n\nGlycolic acid: 10 per cent, 2 or 3 times a week. \n\nRetin A: 0.05 micro. 2 or 3 times a week.\n\n\nIn January I added;\n\nKojic acid and alpha arbutin and other pigment inhibitors. I chose LuxeBeauty, Luxe Serum, Skin Lightener & Brightener. Feels pretty light.\n\nMedication: \n\nTranexamic acid, oral. 500mg day. This was on the advice of my dermatologist. \n\nRemoved hormonal contraception.  I had an implanon removed also on the advice of my dermatologist. My fabulous partner decided to have The Snip (vasectomy) for me and I'm thrilled. \n\nThe melasma has all lifted. The last traces are going very fast and its been only about 8 weeks.

I learned to use natural stuff like aloe vera leave gel be to apply it every single day and it helps fading the patches on my face. Please please try to stay away from Hydroquinone, it only makes your melasma get worse when it comes back because it's very harsh and makes your skin thin and more sensitive to sunlight and UV, even with high SPF sunscreen won't protect your skin 100% unless you keep putting it on your face every 2 hours but who has time for that?. Niacinamide, Alpha Arbutin, Glutathione, Vitamin C could help fading the dark spots but ig it's very stubborn sunspots there's nothing can help unfortunately",

    "body": "so i was just messing around with a pretty simple reaction (to my knowledge) when i noticed that upon the mixture of two solutions, a color change happened as well as an unexpected bubbling and generation of a gas, and i was wondering if anybody has any clue what might be causing it and how to reform the reaction so that the color change can be isolated.\n\nthe reaction happening is as follows: first 1ml of a triiodide solution i made by adding 15ml 3.5M KI to 0.17g I2 is reduced with dropwise 1M ascorbic acid until fully it appears colorless, then 30ml standard 3% H2O2 is added.\nmy assumption was of course that the H2O2 prompts the regeneration of triiodide by oxidizing I- to I2 and then the I2 reacts with more I- to form I3-, and that’s what makes the solution colored again, but i can’t think of why it starts bubbling. im also guessing that the gas is maybe hydrogen because when i stick a lighter up to it, it ignites sort of, as seen in the video. any help would be awesome.",

    "body": "hi guys! it's been a year since the beginning of my skincare journey, so i think it's time to give back to these skincare communities which have taught me so much! here is an extensive list of **AB** (asian beauty) and **non-AB** products i've tried in the past year, ranging mostly from drug-store to mid-range products. i've arranged the list in the order of the **highest to lowest** ratings.\n\n**skin type:** early 20s, sensitive, acne-prone, combination (oily over forehead, dry everywhere else), Fitzpatrick IV/brown\n\n**skin concerns:** inflammatory acne, closed comedones, some PIH/PIE, a few freckles, anti-aging\n\n**skin irritants:** most plant extracts, most essential oils, any form of physical exfoliation\n\ndespite my sensitive skin type, i have gone through a number of products with artificial fragrances/EOs/strange plant extracts, because i didn't know what my skin triggers were back then. hopefully even my negative experiences will be of some help! :)\n\ncaveat: my experiences will likely differ from most of yours, since everyone reacts differently even to the same ingredient :D. do note that i have a rather finicky skin type that sadly disagrees with an overwhelming majority of products!\n\n# 1st-step cleansers\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) bioderma sensibio micellar water** ($14.90 for 16.7oz) is a no-frills micellar water that is extremely suitable for sensitive skin types. it has no fragrance, and also has an extremely short ingredients list which does not contain any comedogenic/irritating ingredients. because of this, it truly stands out from most other brands of micellar water! this has never once caused any breakouts for me. it is good at removing light makeup or non-waterresistant sunscreen. however, with heavier makeup/ water-resistant sunscreen, you'd need a lot more effort to rub (gently) them off. that irritates my skin, unfortunately. therefore, i'm currently only using this to quickly and gently remove non-water resistant sunscreen, and it causes no irritation this way, yay! for those of you with sensitive/dry skin types, using micellar water to remove light makeup/sunscreen may wind up being much gentler and less stripping than oil cleansers, as it is for me. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**muji sensitive cleansing oil** ($19.90 for 13.5oz) is a thick, non-stripping, unscented cleansing oil which is effective at removing sunscreen/makeup. it has no discernible scent to me. this rinses cleanly without leaving an oily film. while this did not cause any dryness, i experienced some irritation (redness, tingling) after a few uses. i am suspecting that something in the ingredients list (eg: ethylhexyl palmitate, which may be slightly irritating) did not agree with my skin. otherwise, the ingredients list is free of any other common skin irritants. i also did not enjoy the thick texture of the oil which was difficult to spread around my face. however, this is affordable and comes in a large pump bottle! i could see this working well for many other skin types. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**shu uemera anti/oxi+ pollutant and dullness clarifying cleansing oil** ($58 for 9.8oz) is also a thick, non-stripping, luxurious, gorgeous cleansing oil that is effective at removing makeup. it is of very similar texture to muji's sensitive cleansing oil. but this contains a number of skin irritants, and is also heavily fragranced; it has an earthy, herbal smell. after about 4-5 uses, my skin began to feel irritated-- unbearable tingling in my cheeks. this was very disappointing given its steep price point :-(. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# 2nd step cleansers\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) paula's choice optimal results hydrating cleanser** ($19 for 6.4 oz) is the only cleanser so far that ticks all my boxes! it is non-irritating, non-stripping, ph-balanced, and does not break me out. i'd gone through at least a dozen cleansers throughout my life, before i found this, my very first ride-or-die cleanser! every other cleanser in the past would either strip my skin too dry OR irritate my skin. i love that it has no artificial fragrance; it only has a mild, inoffensive soapy scent. it also has an ingredients list that's free of irritants. this cleanser has a cream-gel texture that does not foam up at all. if you're used to foaming cleansers like i was, i totally understand your apprehension. however, many of us would benefit from gentler cleansers like this one, and i'd highly recommend this cleanser to any skin type except those with particularly oily skin. this also comes in a pretty, blue bottle with a pump dispenser! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) fresh soy face cleanser** ($69 for 13.5oz) used to be a staple in my skincare routine till i discovered the cleanser above. yes, this contains rose water and other plant extracts, as well as rose oil, which are common skin irritants amongst folks with sensitive skin :(! apart from these irritating additives, however, it was perfect in my eyes. it has a heavenly cucumber scent. despite the alarming ingredients list, it caused no signs of irritation, also probably because i cleanse my face really quickly to minimise contact time with cleansers in general. it was non-stripping, rinsed off very easily and cleanly, and smelled great (like fresh cucumbers) to me. this is still the 2nd best cleanser i've tried to date despite the disappointing additives... and i've tried at least 20 different cleansers so far. go to sephora and take a whiff! if the scent is your cup of tea, and you're not at all sensitive to its ingredients, i'd still recommend this cleanser. **4/5, MRP**\n\n**krave matcha hemp cleanser** ($26 for 4 oz) is a gel cleanser that appeared perfect in every way till i used it. IMO, it was difficult to rinse off, and left an oily film on my face after washing. i know some people are fine with that, but that sensation of *something* left on my skin after cleansing my face unsettles me. it was also much more drying than fresh soy face cleanser, probably because it contains coco-betaine (which is a much harsher surfactant, as compared to the top surfactant in fresh soy face cleanser, coco-glucoside) at the top of its list. it was mildly irritating too if i took my time with it-- i was surprised when it made my skin tingle, since its ingredients list seemed so gentle! i expected this to smell like matcha but instead it smelled like soap... which is reasonable, since it has no artificial fragrance/EOs. i see that this could be a potential HG for many skin types. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**innisfree blueberry cleanser** (\\~$9 for 3.4 oz) is a creamy cleanser that produces a rich lather. it has a pungent citrus smell which i simply couldn't come to terms with. it's also slightly irritating, and definitely too stripping for me. i eventually gave it away to my bf, and it works really well for him! he uses a tiny bit each time, otherwise it'd be too stripping for his normal-dry skin type. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) qv gentle wash** (\\~$24 for 33.8 oz) is a no-frills, unscented, foaming, cream-gel cleanser. this was definitely too stripping to be used on my face, so i use this sparingly on my body instead. this cleanser has a faint soapy smell that's much more pleasant than vanicream's, and it's completely non-irritating. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) sebamed liquid face and body wash** ($13.5 for 6.8oz) is similarly a no-frills, unscented, foaming cleanser. it has a gel consistency and dried out my skin very badly. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) avene soapless foaming gel** is rather similar to the sebamed liquid face and body wash, in that they are both incredibly drying, no-frills sort of gel cleansers. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n**hada labo super hyaluronic acid foaming wash** ($9 for 5.4oz) is an unscented self-foaming cleanser. the foam is very soft and abundant! it also rinses off effortlessly and cleanly. it has a pleasant, mild soapy scent. unfortunately, it caused my skin to burn after a few uses, and i had to discontinue use. it was also definitely too stripping for my skin. i think i think this would make a great basic cleanser for most skin types, but my skin's just... *sighs.* **0.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) vanicream gentle facial cleanser** ($9 for 8 oz) is a no-frills, foaming, cream-gel cleanser. it is unscented and has one of the shortest ingredients lists. it left my skin squeaky clean within 1 wash despite using only a pea-sized amount of the cleanser. my cheeks were also blotchy afterwards, and i still haven't been able to identify what is the irritant within this short and innocuous-looking ingredients list! of all the basic drugstore cleansers, this had the least pleasant chemical scent to it. but i think this would make a great basic cleanser for most skin types. **0/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche-posay toleriane hydrating gentle cleanser/ toleriane caring wash** ($15 for 13.5oz) is a non-foaming, ultra-gentle cream-gel cleanser. this burned both my bf's and my faces on the first wash... achievement unlocked, i guess! but i could feel that this was definitely non-stripping. i still don't know what irritated my skin here, since it works so well for so many other people with sensitive skin. **0/5, WNRP**\n\n# toners\n\n**isntree green tea toner** ($20 for 6.7 oz) is a thin, watery toner with a rather strong herbal scent. this did nothing much for my skin. it wasn't effective at hydrating/soothing my skin, controlling sebum production or calming my breakouts, which some other reviewers seemed to experience with this toner. though this toner does not contain any artificial fragrance/EOs, it has a cloyingly sweet scent that i am not a fan of. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**klairs supple preparation unscented toner** ($22 for 6.1 oz) is a viscous, hydrating toner. this has a mild chemical scent to it which did not bother me at all. it did pack a punch of hydration but also broke me out after a week of use. i've since learnt that butylene glycol, which is 2nd in this ingredients list, is rather comedogenic for me. however, i really appreciated the inclusion of non-irritating and soothing ingredients! it would have been perfect if it didn't contain butylene glycol. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) kiehl's ultra facial toner** ($17 for 8.4 oz) is a milky, viscous, moisturising toner. this broke me out very quickly, possibly due to the squalane and quite a number of other comedogenic ingredients that are further down the ingredients list. this has no EOs/artificial fragrance, and has a neutral, inoffensive scent. i would recommend this only to normal-dry skin types which are not acne-prone. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n# serums\n\n🌟 **purito centella unscented serum** ($20 for 2oz) is my favourite serum thus far! this contains 49% centella asiatica (tiger grass), \\~3% niacinamide, asiaticoside/asiatic acid/madecassic acid, sodium hyaluronate, and peptides. the star ingredient here is the centella! this calms my skin down like no other product ever has. my cheeks are less red and painful. my acne heals a lot quicker while using this too. while this doesn't contain artificial fragrance, it has a light sweet scent that doesn't bother me. it also provides a nice layer of hydration. it is viscuous, takes a short while to absorb, dries down kind of tacky and leaves your skin looking dewier. overall, it's still a cosmetically elegant serum to me. i've repurchased this a few times and i plan to use this for a looooooong time! i'd highly recommend this serum to almost anyone. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) paula's choice 10% niacinamide booster** ($44 for 0.67 oz) is a great niacinamide serum. it's filled to the brim with great ingredients. this contains 10% niacinamide and stabilised derivatives of vitamin c (acetyl glucosamine, ascorbyl glucoside) which work together synergistically alongside niacinamide to effectively brighten your skin. it also has sodium hyaluronate, other soothing ingredients and antioxidants. it's a tiny bottle but it lasts half a year for me, because i mix this booster with purito's serum, so i use only 4 drops per day. it's watery and absorbs extremely quickly without leaving tackiness/shine. this has a light pleasant scent, but does not contain artificial fragrance. i'd highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for a gentle but immensely brightening niacinamide serum with a ton of other great ingredients. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) timeless hyaluronic acid + vitamin c serum** ($21 for 1 oz) is a minimalistic serum containing 5% MAP (magnesium ascorbyl phosphate). MAP is a gentle, stabilised derivative of vitamin c, that can help with skin brightening, and perhaps, prevent aging. my skin cannot tolerate daily use of L-ascorbic acid, hence i use this too. this also has 1% hyaluronic acid and 1.5% of matrixyl 3000. it is non-irritating and provides a nice layer of hydration despite being pretty thin. i definitely notice that my skin's duller and less plump when i go without this. this doesn't have a detectable scent. i love timeless, in general! it has a whole range of simple but effective serums that are suitable for even sensitive and acne-prone skin type. i highly recommend checking out their serums! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) timeless vitamin c + e ferulic acid serum** ($26 for 1oz) is a 20% unscented L-ascorbic acid serum. it has a very low pH of 2.4, so it's pretty irritating and drying :\\\\. this is really the only significant issue that i have with this product. i can only use this a maximum of 2 times per week, and even at this conservative frequency, i experience quite a bit of flaking. this has a bit of a sausage-like/metallic smell but it doesn't disturb me at all, personally. i absolutely loveeeee that this comes in an airless pump now. the ingredients list is as simple as it gets for an L-AA serum. it can easily last 6 months after opening as long as i keep it refrigerated! ensure that you order this from a reputable seller who orders fresh stocks or else your product may oxidise quickly. this is an affordable and effective L-AA serum. **4.5/5, RP**\n\n**purito centella green level buffet serum** ($20 for 2oz) is basically the scented version of purito centella unscented serum. this contains EOs so it has a stronger herbal scent. i've noticed that this is slightly irritating when my skin's very sensitive. i'd recommend the unscented version above if you're interested in this! but if you're a sucker for the scent of lavender oil, i think this would be great too, because i had really great results using this for months as well. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n# moisturisers\n\n🌟 **etude house soonjung 2x barrier intensive cream** ($18 for 2 oz) is a medium-weight, unscented, simple creamy moisturiser. of all the creamy moisturisers that i've come across, this has one of the simplest and least comedogenic ingredients lists. it has a faint shea butter smell. don't be fooled by the name, it's definitely not a thick, suffocating cream! it spreads easily like a dream, and hasn't broken me out at all! this is also very effective at moisturising my skin-- my dry spots improve significantly overnight whenever i slather this on. however, it does leave your skin feeling pretty tacky especially if you layer other hydrating products beneath this. again, tackiness doesn't bother me since i don't (and shouldn't) touch my face much at all. this cream leaves me looking dewy too. even when my skin was at its worst, this caused 0 irritation, and in fact, helped to reduce redness and minimise tingling. i feel a fresh, cooling burst of hydration whenever i slather this on. i'd highly recommend this to almost any skin type. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) avene skin recovery cream** ($35 for 1.7 oz) is one of the simplest, most basic, unscented, no-frills cream moisturisers on the market. it has a slightly heavy, thick texture, but still glides on quite smoothly. the ingredients list only has 11 ingredients! i know that i can always switch back to this moisturiser if somethings goes awry. it is non-irritating but also doesn't soothe my skin. i think it moisturises decently but etude house soon jung barrier cream is a more efficacious moisturiser, IMO. the soonjung one's spreads much more effortlessly too. i'd recommend this to those with extremely sensitive skin types/those who may have accidentally destroyed their skin barrier. **4/5, MRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) rocky mountain oils sacred skin facial moisturizer** ($50 for 1.7 oz) is a highly emollient, medium-weight, luxurious cream that is scented with frankincense EO. i was previously using this for half a year till i discovered a better replacement, aka etude house soonjung barrier cream. i adore the texture of this cream-- it's so emollient and rich, so it does require some warming up in your palms. while this worked beautifully as a moisturiser and caused me no issues such as irritation and breakouts, i wanted to move towards building a fragrance-free routine due to my pretty sensitive skin. perhaps the EO in this was not yet causing me issues, but in due time, it could potentially contribute to significant inflammation, then finally culminating in significant skin irritation. my risk threshold is pretty low now because i've come very close to ruining my skin barrier with products, so i've decided not to continue using this. regardless, i'd recommend this to anyone who'd like a medium-weight cream with an amazing frankincense scent. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n**cosrx oil-free ultra-moisturising lotion** ($24 for 3.4 oz) is a gel-cream moisturiser which features a high amount of birch sap. i used this for a week and it was a decent, unimpressive moisturiser. i experienced a bit of irritation (skin burning) with this, perhaps due to the citrus peel EO in this. it has a distinct sweet, fruity scent. because of its thin gel-cream consistency, and their intention to exclude many emollients/oils, this moisturiser wouldn't be adequate for my combination skin type in the long run. sadly, this contains butylene glycol and dimethicone at the top of the ingredients list, which are known acne triggers for me. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# eye moisturisers\n\n**laneige water bank eye gel** ($39 for 0.8 oz) is fragranced gel moisturiser. it didn't cause any issues for me, but also wasn't impressive in any way. this had a sharp floral scent. again, i could do without this in-your-face sort of fragrance. **2/5, WNRP**\n\n**laneige time freeze eye serum** ($52 for 0.7 oz) is a fragranced, thin, milky eye serum. i soldiered on despite the old-lady fragrance and then got milia after a few weeks of use... that isn't a surprise, in retrospect, because butylene glycol are dimethicone are at the top of the ingredients list. thankfully, i experienced no irritation with this. otherwise, this did moisturise pretty decently... but nothing different from other moisturisers that i've tried. it is expensive for the small amount, and i do think there are many other better eye/face moisturisers out there that contain far better ingredients at the same price point. i wouldn't recommend this to anyone simply because it is unimpressive. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# sunscreens\n\n🌟 **purito centella green level unscented sun spf 50 pa++++** ($18.90 for 2 oz) is an unscented, soothing, chemical sunscreen that is not water-resistant. this doesn't leave a white cast on my brown (Fitzpatrick IV) skin even though i slather on a liberal amount-- about 1/8-1/4 teaspoon each time. many unscented products may smell a little strange but this only really has an extremely light chemical scent that doesn't seem to bother anyone so far! this is very hydrating and moisturising, so it leaves my skin looking dewy. it contains 2% niacinamide, centella asiatica, madecassoside, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and asiatic acid. this pretty much looks and feels like a moisturiser with spf! i suspect that this, alone, would be enough in the AM for pretty dry skin types too. i break out from all sunscreens, and i think this one contributes a little to my acne. however it really is the least comedogenic sunscreen that i've tried/seen! i'd highly recommend this to pretty much anyone without a very oily skin type! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**missha all-around safe block essence sun spf 45 pa +++** ($16 for 1.7 oz) is a fragranced, water-resistant sunscreen. i'm personally fine with its light floral scent. this has caused my no irritation, doesn't leave a white cast, and moisturises well! i could even skip my serums because this is THAT hydrating/moisturising. as a result, it does leave my skin looking quite dewy, but that's fine with me! unfortunately, it may have broken me out a little, but then again, all sunscreens, especially water-resistant ones, tend to have that effect on me. i'd highly recommend this to pretty much anyone without a very oily skin type who's looking for a water-resistant sunscreen! **4/5, RP**\n\n**purito centella green level safe sun spf 50 pa++++** ($18.90 for 2 oz) is a scented version of the sunscreen above. this contains EOs and smells extremely strongly of lavender. the other difference is that this doesn't contain madecassoside, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and asiatic acid. this caused no irritation for my skin type too! while this worked really well for my skin too, i'd recommend the unscented version instead for the reasons stated previously. **4/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) skinceuticals physical fusion uv defense spf 50** ($34 for 1.7oz) is a tinted, physical, water-resistant sunscreen. this left me looking like a very anguished ghost. it is advertised to be suitable for all skin types, but obviously, if you do apply an adequate amount, it leaves an unavoidable violaceous-beige cast on my brown (Fitzpatrick IV) skin... this was super disappointing! immediately upon application, i also experienced tingling on the more irritated areas of my face. i'd only recommend this to normal, fair (Fitzpatrick II-III) skin types... **0/5, WNRP**\n\n# wash-off face masks\n\n**(NON-AB) origins 10 minute drink up hydrating mask with apricot & glacier water** ($26 for 2.5oz) is a fragranced, creamy, ultra-moisturising wash-off mask. this caused closed comedones after 1 use (30min), though it was non-irritating. it smells strongly of fresh oranges. this would be awesome for drier skin types which are NOT at all acne-prone. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) fresh rose face mask** ($62 for 3.3oz) is a gel mask containing bits of rose petals. this was supposed to soothe my skin, but instead, this irritated my skin right away and caused tingling/redness. it also did not seem to hydrate my skin much at all. i wouldn't recommend this (or any products featuring a high concentration of rose) to sensitive skin types. **0.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**raw manuka honey:** i decided to spread a generous amount of pure manuka honey with decent UMF rating. immediately, my face stung and turned pink. moral of the story: always patch test!\n\n# sheet masks\n\n**klairs rich moist soothing tencel sheet mask** ($30 for 10 sheets) is an unscented, ultra-hydrating, simple sheet mask. the essence is quite viscous but doesn't leave my skin feeling too tacky. it has pretty much no scent to it. it contains a list of non-irritating ingredients, and some ultra-calming ingredients such as panthenol and centella. it also has ceramides. all in all, this is a great mask to fix your skin barrier! within one use, all of my dry patches were gone. unrestrained sheet masking (a few times per week, in my case) always breaks me out, as it did when i used this mask too. however a single use is fine. i also love that the material of the mask is pretty thin and soft. i'm deducting 0.5 point just because butylene glycol is a known acne trigger for me, and it's at the top of this ingredients list. **4.5/5, MRP**\n\n**twotsp ggulba mask** ($30 for 5 sheets) is a fragranced, incredibly moisturising sheet mask containing very thick essence. what sets this apart from many other sheet masks is that the essence in this is INCREDIBLY sticky, since it is enriched with honey. there's also niacinamide in here, near the top of the ingredients list. the material of the mask is pretty thin and soft! it has a cloyingly sweet scent which reminds me of a sweet dessert. this is absolutely nourishing. however, it contains a few potential skin irritants, such as a few plant extracts, including rose extract. otherwise, this did not break me out (as long as i realllyyyy space out my sheet masking) or irritate my skin. i won't be repurchasing due to the potentially irritating additives. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**mediheal teatree care solution essential mask** ($3 per sheet) is a fragranced mask featuring centella asiatica and tea tree extract. the essence isn't sticky. there's nothing really outstanding about this. it contains lavender EO. while it didn't break me out or irritate my skin, it also didn't soothe or hydrate my skin remarkably. i'm nitpicking here... but the material of the sheet mask is pretty thick! **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**papa recipe bombee honey mask** ($20 for 10 sheets) is a fragranced mask that reminds me of a lighter version of the ggulba mask. the essence is pretty sticky here due to its star ingredient, honey. my experience with this is largely similar to my experience with ggulba, except this is less moisturising. both have a similar artificial, cloyingly sweet scent. **2.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**dr jart+ cicapair calming mask** ($23 for 5 sheets) is a mask featuring centella asiatica. it is pretty similar in its scent to the mediheal tea tree mask, but the centella in here seems to be lower in concentration. the mask material is very soft and thin, and seemed to hug my face better. the essence is a pretty thin too. this contains no artificial fragrance/ EOs. however! it irritated my skin slightly-- it caused a bit of tingling. **1.5/5, WNRP**\n\n# lip balms/masks\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar baume ap+** ($20 for 13.5 oz) is a thick, unscented moisturising cream. it has a shea butter scent. it leaves a pretty tacky feeling and shiny appearance. of all the moisturisers that i've tried, this is the most moisturising! i apply a layer of this on my chapped lips, followed by a layer of laneige lip sleeping mask to seal the deal. when i wake up in the morning, my lips are all dandy again! this + laneige lip sleeping mask is my magical duo! **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **laneige lip sleeping mask** ($20 for 0.7 oz) is a fragranced, extremely thick and emollient lip mask. there are a few flavours to choose from, and they all contain strong artificial fragrance. personally, i chose the berry flavour, and it really smells like a strawberry sweet, lol. i could do without the scent. aside from this, this is perfect. compared to other lip masks and balms that i've tried, this is the most hydrating and moisturising mask, by far. it comes with a cute little spatula too. **4.5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**klavuu nourishing care lip sleeping pack** ($15 for 0.7 oz) is a lightly fragranced lip mask. it feels much less oily and thick than laneige's. it also has a faint vanilla scent that's much more tolerable and lighter than the laneige's lip masks. sadly, it did a mediocre job at moisturising my lips. this doesn't come with a spatula :(. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n(**NON-AB) la roche posay cicaplast levres** ($12 for 0.25 oz) is a thick, unscented, simple lip balm. my lips were still very dry despite slathering this on generously. i appreciate the simplicity of this product, but it just didn't work for me. this had a waxy texture. i'd prefer a lighter lip balm than this, personally. **3/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) supergoop! acai fusion lip balm spf 30** ($9.50 for 0.5 oz) is a thick, unscented spf lip balm. it has a waxy, thick texture, and would ball up and flake off my lips so badly. this is not at all cosmetically elegant and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone! **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# actives\n\n🌟 **differin gel** ($15 for 0.5 oz) is a form of acne treatment that contains 0.1% adapalene (a form of retinoid). since incorporating this regularly into my routine, i've noticed a lot less inflammatory acne (giant pimples) and smaller closed comedones too. it doesn't tingle on application but it definitely increases my sensitivity to other products in my routine and causes redness. it's too drying when i use it more than 4-5x per week. however, as long as i use it at a moderate frequency, and pay attention to how my skin's feeling and looking, i experience not many issues with this. i'd highly recommend this to those combating acne, because it's a relatively gentle topical acne treatment. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n# cleansing devices\n\n🌟  **muji unbleached cotton pads** ($3.9 for 80 pieces)are the softest cotton pads ever! it's so gentle on my face, so there's no chafing at all! i find that it's just the right amount of thickness. i never experience issues with loose fibers. i use this to gentlyyy remove my sunscreen with micellar water. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n🌟 **klairs toner mate 2-in-1 cotton pad** ($6.50 for 120 pieces) are extremely thin, compact cotton pads. they're pricey for cotton pads but they absorb very little product, so it'd be economical to use this for expensive products (toners/essences). i find that this is rougher than the muji unbleached cotton pads, so i personally use this on my bacne instead, since my back's not sensitive like my face is. i think this serves really niche purposes, i.e. to reduce wastage of pricier products, and to lightly physically exfoliate. **5/5, RP (HG)**\n\n**(NON-AB) normal foreo luna 2** ($169) is a cleansing device that gently vibrates to exfoliate your skin. it was too abrasive and irritating for my sensitive skin type. i experienced tingling and redness even after one use. i kept at it (i couldn't believe that even this would irritate my skin) and those symptoms only got worse! interestingly, this works very well at reducing breakouts for my sister (does not have sensitive skin)  without causing irritation. compared to other cleansing devices on the market, foreo is probably one of the gentlest around. it's still a form of physical exfoliation, so it'd be safer to use it with some caution, aka space out your use when you first begin. **1/5, WNRP**\n\n# body care\n\n🌟 **(NON-AB) physiogel ai lotion** ($25 for 3.4) is a lightweight, unscented, simple moisturiser. what sets this apart from most other body lotions is that it is so lightweight. it's almost like a milky emulsion! and it surprisingly does a great job at moisturising my dry skin despite its lightweight consistency. i love that it absorbs very quickly without leaving much tackiness or shine. it is also pretty non-comedogenic compared to other body moisturisers, which is a big deal to me, because i actually am acne-prone all over my body. :( it has a light shea butter scent. i'd recommend this to anyone who's looking for a light, no-frills body moisturiser! **5/5, WRP**\n\n🌟 **cos de baha niacin toner** ($17.50 for 6.76 oz) is an unscented toner packed with brightening ingredients. this contains 5% niacinamide, 1% panthenol, hyaluronic acid and licorice root extract. i use this on the areas of my body (back, neck, upper arms) which are suffering from acne and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation/erythema. so far, it's caused no issues such as breakouts or irritation. i primarily chose this for the high concentration of niacinamide, to brighten my acne marks. it's pretty affordable too, so i can slather it on generously on my body. this would also make a good facial toner, but do note that it contains eucalyptus, which is a potential irritant. **5/5, WRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar fluide** is a lightweight, gel-cream moisturiser. it absorbs fully within minutes and leaves no tackiness/shine at all! this also contains 4% niacinamide. in general, LRP products contain no skin irritants in its products. if you're looking for a light body moisturiser, this is it! this make work very well as a facial moisturiser too. i personally prefer creamier moisturisers that are richer in emollients, so i may not repurchase. **4.5/5, MRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) the ordinary 7% glycolic acid toner** ($8.70 for 8oz) is a potent AHA toner. it has no artificial fragrance, but it has quite a number of plant extracts. whenever i slather it on my back, i feel as though i'm in a bed of roses. this is rather potent, or perhaps the rose water in this is irritating me, because i do experience some tingling occasionally. i would never use this on my face because this is definitely too irritating/strong. this makes a great body AHA since it's affordable compared to most other exfoliants. **4/5, WRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) sukin natural botanical body wash** ($17 for 33.8 oz) is a fragranced, non-stripping gel wash that is filled with plant extracts. it contains a number of EOs and artificial fragrances so its botanical scent is really strong. it's non-irritating to my skin, however. it doesn't dry out my skin unlike most body washes i've tried. a non-irritating version of this would be sukin's daily gentle face and body wash, if you're interested! **3.5/5, WNRP**\n\n**(NON-AB) la roche posay lipikar baume ap+** ($20 for 13.5 oz) has been described above under the lip section! while this is intensely moisturising and leaves my skin feeling the softest, it also causes body acne for me, because it contains a high amount of shea butter and dimethicone, which are acne triggers for me. this would be best for pretty dry skin types/extremely dry patches/winter! if you're not acne-prone and have very dry skin, you can also apply this on your face too :). **2/5, WNRP**\n\n# summary: my holy grails\n\n1. bioderma sensibio micellar water\n2. paula's choice optimal results hydrating cleanser\n3. purito centella unscented serum\n4. paula's choice 10% niacinamide booster\n5. timeless hyaluronic acid + vitamin c serum\n6. etude house soonjung 2x barrier intensive cream\n7. purito centella green level unscented sun spf 50 pa++++\n8. la roche posay lipikar baume ap+\n9. laneige lip sleeping mask\n10. differin gel\n11. muji unbleached cotton pads\n12. klairs toner mate 2-in-1 cotton pad\n13. physiogel ai lotion\n14. cos de baha niacin toner\n\nwhew, that was a real mouthful. i'll be back in a year's time, with a hopefully shorter list :). my fingers are crossed! i'll also leave my current routine in the comments below, for those who may be interested. i hope this was of some help to y'all :-), and that all of you would have good health during this period!",

    "body": "*I know I spelt Hyperpigmentation wrong, give grace, it was 1AM and a lot of formatting issues.* \n\nTreating dark spots and hyperpigmentation requires a tailored approach due to the higher melanin content of our skin. Here’s a skincare guide focused on evening skin tone while maintaining the health of melanated skin.\n\n⚠️*As with any skincare product, please patch test, place in the least visible area and wait a full day. If no reaction occurs proceed.*\n\n#Gentle Cleansing\n- **Frequency**: Sometimes twice daily or just in the evening, over cleansing can strip your skin. \n\n- **Key Ingredients**: Look for cleansers containing soothing agents like **aloe vera**, **green tea extract**, or **glycerin**. \n\n- **Recommended Product Types**: Gentle low to no foaming or hydrating cleansers. Pick according to your skin type.\n\n##Recommended products include:\n*(no actives, will make a different post regarding active cleansers)*\n\n\n1. **Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser, creamy version**\n2. **Cervae Hydrating Facial Cleanser**\n3. **Geek and Gorgeous Jelly Joker (doesn’t foam)**\n4. **La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Facial Wash**\n5. **La Roche-Posay Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser**\n\n6. **La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP + Gentle Foaming Moisturizing Wash**\n7. **Good Molecules Hydrating Facial Cleansing Gel**  \n\n\n\n\n#Exfoliation with Actives\n   **Frequency**: *1–2 times per week or more (Retinol has potential for  daily, if skin has been acclimatized.)*\n\n- Use chemical exfoliants with **AHAs** (like glycolic or lactic, mandelic acid) or  **Retinol**, **Mandelic acid** is especially beneficial for darker skin tones as it’s less likely to cause irritation due to it penetrating slower.\n\n- **Physical Exfoliants**: Avoid rough physical exfoliants as they may cause micro-tears and worsen hyperpigmentation. \n\n\n\n#Targeted Ingredients for Hyperpigmentation\n\n- **Application**: Use these in serums, masks, or spot treatments after cleansing and before moisturizing. Rinse off products can be an option too (sensitive skin) but the more face time the better, so opt for leave on products (with the exception of high percentage masks)\n\n   - **Ingredients to Look For:**\n\n- **Vitamin C:** A brightening antioxidant that helps fade dark spots and evens skin tone, sensitive to the active form, L-Ascorbic Acid? Try the best form of the dervative called Tetrahexyldecyl Asorbate or THD. Don't want to use vitamin c period? Try Resveratrol and Ferulic Acid!\n\n- **Niacinamide:** Reduces inflammation, barrier improvement, helps with sebum production and helps with hyperpigmentation by inhibiting melanin transfer. It is common to find in 10% (very high, can be irritating) or even 20% (insane), best range is 3-5% you have to actively look for this though.\n\n\n- **Kojic Acid:** A natural skin lightener that reduces melanin production. Be careful purchasing in soap form from random sellers on Amazon and TikTok. \n\n - **Alpha Arbutin:** Targets dark spots and is gentler for Black skin.  \n\n - **Azelaic Acid:** A tyrosine (an amino acid that helps produce melanin) inhibitor which reduces pigmentation and helps with comedonal and  inflammatory acne.\n\n  - **Licorice Root Extract:** Inhibits the production of an enzyme needed to produce melanin and helps remove excess.\n\n   - **Tranexamic Acid:** Effective for post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), often caused by acne.\n\n  - **Retinoids**: Stimulate cell turnover and reduce hyperpigmentation, but be cautious with overuse in melanated skin to avoid irritation. Start at lower percentage, do not use daily when just starting. And omit other actives to minimize irritation when starting. \n\n\n\n\n⚠️**DO NOT USE AS MANY OF THESE AS YOU CAN**⚠️ \n*Please note you can’t combine everything here. Don’t mix retinol with anything below unless you know what you are doing*\n\n##Recommended products include:\n\n1. **The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA** (a 10% is available also, please only use if you have a tolerance already for the lower percentage and do not follow with other products on this list unless you are a skincare pro)\n2. **The Ordinary Mandelic Acid 10% + HA** (bonus:  Mandelic Acid is also good for treating acne like cystic and inflamed)\n\n\n3. **Wishtrend Mandelic Acid 5%**\n\n\n4. **Paulas Choice Skin Perfecting 6% Mandelic Acid + 2% Lactic Acid Liquid Exfoliant** \n5. **Paulas Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant Toner**(Do not follow with other products on this list unless you are a skincare pro)\n6. **Urban Skin RX Even Tone Cleansing Bar 3 in 1 Treatment** (Do not follow with other products on this list unless you are a skincare pro)\n7. **The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner** (Don’t recommend for sensitive skin, you can try using with a damp cotton round to dilute if too strong)\n8. **Topicals Faded Cream** (Strong,do not follow with other products on this list unless you are a skincare pro)\n9. **Dr. Idriss Major Fade Flash Mask** (very strong, not for sensitive or inexperienced skin, do not follow with other products on this list unless you are a skincare pro)\n10. **CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum**\n\n11. **Good Molecules Gentle Retinol Cream**\n\n12. **Cocokind Beginner Retinol Gel 0.1%** (please note this contains 3 different type of retinols)\n\n13. **Naturium Retinol Complex Cream**\n\n14. **Paulas Choice 0.3% Retinol + 2% Bakuchiol Treatment**\n\n*Retinol would be used 1-2 a week at night, building slowly to everyday if possible. Add one night every 3-4 weeks as tolerated.*\n\n*Try to avoid usage with any cleanser that contains strong acids when you’re using it, hyaluronic acid/ niacinamide fine. And definitely DO NOT EXFOLIATE AND THEN USE RETINOL. A gentle cleanser preferably one that doesn’t foam. If you’d like to use an active cleanser, try in another routine.*\n\n*To help ease the possibility of irritation you’d apply Vaseline to the corners of your nose, mouth and eyes. Apply your moisturizer (basic and unscented is best) let that dry then pea size (however, you can use more but try to use as little as possible to get coverage) dot it all on your face, rub in and follow up with moisturizer. That’s called the sandwich method. Make sure you apply on dry skin not damp, or you’ll increase penetration.*\n\n*And stay on top of SPF usage during the day.*\n#Moisturization\n   - **Frequency**: Twice daily after applying serums.\n\n   - **Key Ingredients**: **Glycerin**, **ceramides**, and **shea butter** are ideal for keeping the skin barrier healthy and preventing further irritation or dryness.\n\n   - **Non-comedogenic options**: Choose lightweight formulas that won’t clog pores.\n\n\n##Recommended products include:\n\n1. **CeraVe Ultra-Light Moisturizing Gel Moisturizer**\n2. **CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizer**\n\n3. **Good Molecules Lightweight Daily Moisturizer**\n\n4. **Aveeno Calm + Restore Oat Gel Moisturizer**\n5. **Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Gel Moisturizer**\n6. **Vanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer**\n\n7. **Vanicream Moisturizing Cream**\n8. **Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily Facial Moisturizer**\n9. **Naturium Multi-Peptide Moisturizer**\n\n\n#Sunscreen (Critical for All Skin Tones)\n\n   - **SPF 30 or higher:** Daily use is essential as is reapplication, even indoors or on cloudy days, as UV exposure worsens hyperpigmentation and hurts your progress.\n\n   - **Tinted Sunscreens:** These often contain iron oxides, which provide additional protection against visible light that can exacerbate hyperpigmentation.\n\n- *When picking a sunscreen go for a cream/lotion for the main application and a spray or stick for reapplication. I prefer chemical over mineral for reasons I won’t get into in this particular post. Depending on your skin type and climate, you could get away with using sunscreen alone, it is technically a moisturizer. Some though are more hydrating than others. Use 2 or 3 fingers or roughly a 1/4 tsp for face and neck, a shot glass amount for body.*\n\n##Recommended products include:\n\n1. **Neutrogena Clear Face SPF 30 or 50** this one has a little bit of a white cast, nothing crazy, hydrating, consistency like lotion.\n\n2. **Kiehl’s Better Screen UV Serum** has zero white cast, but it isn’t water resistant. Hydrating but not heavy, combo or dry. She expensive🫰🏾\n\n\n3. **Neutrogena Invisible Daily Defense** no white cast, hydrating, some might not like the bit of shine from it but I fix that with powder. Thin consistency.\n\n4. **Elta MD UV Clear Face Sunscreen SPF 46** Very lightweight, no white cast. She expensive🫰🏾\n\n\n5. **Supergoop Mineral Matte**, thick and white cast heavy but good for under makeup. No water resistance.\n\n6. **Supergoop Unseen**, no white cast, feels like silicone makeup primer, wanted to love this but it made me so greasy and clogged. Water resistant. Thick.\n\n7. **Supergoop Every. Single. Face Watery Lotion**, some shine but nothing crazy that powder didn’t fix. Water resistant. Thin consistency.\n\n8. **Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun: Rice + Probiotics**, no water resistance, feels like a moisturizer. Thin-ish consistency.\n\n9. **Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun Aqua-Fresh Rice + B5** Seems to be more favorable \ntowards oily skin than the original version. \n\n\n10. **Innisfree Daily UV Defense** no water resistance, can double as moisturizer in some cases Probably best for dry skin.\n\n#Avoid Triggers:\n\n   - **Sun Exposure:** UV rays can worsen hyperpigmentation, making daily sunscreen a must.\n\n   - **Harsh Products:** try to avoid using products with **heavy fragrance**, **drying alcohols**, **essential oils** or **strong astringents (witch hazel)** as they can irritate and inflame skin, leading to more discoloration.\n\n   - **Over-exfoliation:** Too much exfoliation can lead to a compromised skin barrier, damage and worsen hyperpigmentation.\n\n\n\n#Professional Treatments\n [Find a Black Dermatologist here](https://www.blackdermdirectory.com)\n\n   - **Chemical Peels:** Performed by a licensed professional or a board certified Dermatologist can be very effective in treating hyperpigmentation. Avoid unprotected sun exposure, especially during after care.\n\n\n   - **Microneedling:** Encourages collagen production and can be combined with serums like vitamin C to improve the appearance of dark spots.\n\n\n   - **Laser Treatments:** Certain lasers, like **Nd:YAG** lasers, are safer for darker skin tones but should only be performed by dermatologists experienced in treating melanated skin.\n\n\n#Patience\n   - Hyperpigmentation can take months to fully fade, depending on the type, be consistent with treatments and always protect your skin from the sun to prevent further discoloration.\n\nThis regimen, combined with professional advice if needed, should help you gradually achieve a more even skin tone.\n\n\n**Up next…**  nothing for now, because I need a break from this and some of y’all  UGAP 😩\n\n\n#Update \n2/25/2025 Tuesday\n\nNew serum to consider  *Eucerin Radiant Tone Dual Serum*, can be used every day and night, and even mixed into most treatments like retinol. No actives and no irritation, note it does contain fragrance. \n",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

    "body": "Hi lovely SCA! \n\nI am an (almost 20 year old) uni student. I have access to multiple databases and ever since being introduced to this sub, I've started reading papers on skincare. \n\n\nThis sub is sometimes accused of being circlejerky (especially when it comes to PC, but my order comes Monday so I have withheld judgement). I read through this paper and found every claim to be one that is deeply embedded into this sub's rules and recommendations.\n\n\nSome notable points:\n\n\n* Approximately 80% of facial ageing is attributed to UV exposure\n\n\n* Photoaged skin shows more mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mitochondria is the energy supplier of cells. The POWERHOUSE! Unff Unff). The most common mutation in the mitochondrial DNA is directly related to chronic UVA exposure. (remember, UVA causes the Aging, UVB causes the Burning).\n\n\n* UV exposure involves considerably decreased collagen production.\n\n\n* Epidermis of photodamaged skin shows significantly lower levels of antioxidant enzymes than photoprotected skin. (And we all know how important antioxidants are... hell.. they're in most anti-aging products. Properly protecting your skin means you're helping cells keep their antioxidant enzymes).\n\n\n* Don't believe that antioxidants are important? Quantity of dermal oxidized proteins correlates with the severity of clinical features of photoaging.\n\n\n* Because of the distinct extension of cell cycles, the epidermis is renewed much slower in elderly people. The epidermal turnover rate is up to 50% lower in the eighth decade of life. (This highlights the importance of chemical exfoliation which helps increase cell turnover)\n\n\nAll of this discusses photoaging, but what about other causes? Well... \"Further relevant exogenous factors are exposure to tobacco smoke, airborne particulate matter, infrared radiation, ozone and malnutrition.\"  (eat your fruits and veggies) \n\n\n* Tobacco: studies have indicated that cigarette smoking furthers wrinkle formation.\n\n\n* Infrared radiation (IR) can also accelerate aging and decreases the production of pro-collagen 1. \n\n\n\n**What Do?**\n\n\n1. Sunscreen! Physical sunscreens absorb/scatter/reflect the UV rays. They do not have skin irritating or sensitizing properties and do not penetrate below stratum corneum. Chemical sunscreens absorb the rays and excited (why you need to reapply).\n\n\n2. Antioxidants! This includes ascorbic acid, CoQ 10, Vitamin E, niacimide, Beta-carotene (supplement or dietary). (all of which this lovely sub recommends). You can read up on how each of these works in the paper itself!\n\n\n3. Polyphenols! They are antioxidant and anti inflammatory. Green tea from camellia sinensis plant has these polyphenols and *may* help reduce photodamage. The tests done were animal models with supplements of the polyphenols present in green tea. (So drinking green tea might not actually help, depends on amount i guess)\n\n4. EPA: eicosapentaeonic acid applied topically has shown to thicken the epidermis and inhibit UV-induced reduction in collagen production.\n\n5. Retinoids: (significant results at 0.02% or higher). Improvement is observed in clinical studies up to 10-12 months of use. These effects are reversible with cessation of retinoid use.\n\n\n6. Hormone replacement therapy: shown to be effective in those with those with hormone deficiency\n\n\n\nIs it too late? No, 75% of a lifetime of UV dosage occurs after the age of 18. \n\nMost of the treatments help reverse photoaging and effects of UV-damage. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Sunscreen isn't 100%. Every little bit counts. Don't use any SPF? Try a moisturizer with SPF. Take the next step and get a dedicated sunscreen. Done with that? Hats are awesome and can accentuate your beautiful/handsome features. \n\n\n\nLink to paper: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21261751\nCitation:\n\nKohl, E., Steinbauer, J., Landthaler, M., Szeimies R.M. 2011.

    "body": "This post will cover topical use of vitamin c and it's derivatives.\n\n[Link to the previous post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/j5jq2i/series_part_1_vitamin_c_for_skin_health/)\n\nTopical Use of vitamin C has been proven to be beneficial in many many studies. I am quoting all the studies I could find, and listing all the benefits as well.\n\nTopical use of Vitamin C (L-Ascorbic Acid/Ascorbic Acid) has been proven to:\n\n1. *Help with the biosynthesis of collagen. -* Anti - Ageing benefit.\n2. *Help in the repair of damaged skin/ skin wounds with anti-inflammatory properties -* Restore skin health.\n3. *Increase the proliferation rate of fibroblasts. -* Anti - Ageing benefit.\n4. *Provide greater photoprotection against UV induced photoaging, immunosuppression, and even skin cancer. -* Anti - Ageing benefit, - Anti - skin cancer.\n5. *Inhibit the action of tyrosinase in melanocytes thus helps to make skin even-toned.-* Helps with pigmentation.\n6. *Restore structural and functional losses in the skin architecture associated with ageing.* - Anti - Ageing benefit.\n7. *Help to strengthen the lipid barrier (possibly, proven in vitro)*. - Restore skin health.\n\n***There have been A LOT of studies on topical vitamin C.*** *I have extracted and link a few I found relevant that support it benefits at THE END of this post.*\n\n***There is enough evidence to believe that topically applied L-ascorbic acid is beneficial.***\n\n*While most people treat Vitamin C like an acid, it's mechanism isn't exactly similar to AHA's. L-ascorbic acid is a form of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) that is recognisable as vitamin C in the skin.* ***Topical use adds to the existing concentration of Vitamin C in the skin.***\n\n*Thus, once it penetrates into the skin, it* ***cannot be washed off/neutralised***. However, some actives applied together/at the same time can change its performance/form.\n\n*L-ascorbic acid is a hydrophilic charged molecule so it doesn't easily penetrate our lipid (hydrophobic) barrier. For optimal penetration of the epidermal barrier, aqueous formulations of ascorbic acid must be at a pH which is below the pKa (4.2) of ascorbic acid itself. Thus, L-ascorbic acid must be formulated below the PH of AT LEAST 4 for it to penetrate in our skin.*\n\n*Although ideally around* ***3-3.5 increased penetration*** *without excessively compromising the skin barrier.*\n\n*The prime concentration depends on the formulation and associated delivery method. It is a general agreement that concentration needs to be more than 8% to be bio-available and effective. According to* [*this study*](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227542100_Topical_L-Ascorbic_Acid_Percutaneous_Absorption_Studies)*, varying concentrations from 5% to 30% were applied to pig skin(similar integumentary system approach).*\n\n*It was observed that vitamin C concentration was maximum at 20% and anything above 20% surprisingly caused depletion in tissue concentration levels.* ***Thus anything below 8% and above 20% is usually seen to be sparse or superfluous.***\n\n*There are many stability issues with L-ascorbic acid solutions. An L-ascorbic acid solution is highly unstable and is prove to oxidation to dehydroascorbic acid(DHAA) and degradation to 2,3-diketogulonate in high temperature, light, heat, high ph, presence of oxygen and catalytic amounts of metal ions. This makes the solution progressively* ***turn*** *in colour* *from clear to* ***yellow, to deeper shades of orange as it continues to degrade.***\n\n* ***Now the question comes: is dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA) bad for our skin?***\n\n***The answer is No and Yes.***\n\nAscorbic acid or ascorbate in its ionised form is called L-ascorbic acid. Our skin recognises L-ascorbic as ascorbic acid. Our body (and skin) also contains an oxidised form of ascorbic acid which is Dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA). A high amount of vitamin C found in normal skin is in the form of dehydroascorbic Acid. [This](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225274699_Topical_Dehydroascorbic_Acid_Oxidized_Vitamin_C_Permeates_Stratum_Corneum_More_Rapidly_Than_Ascorbic_Acid) study shows that DHAA penetrated faster than L-ascorbic acid even. DHAA may not necessarily be bad and can be converted back to ascorbic acid in the presence of glutathione & thiol-containing reducing agents such as cysteine, homocysteine, 2-mercaptoethanol, and DTT, already present in our body. However, in the presence of water DHAA may be irreversibly hydrolysed to 2,3-diketogulonate and further degrade to Erythrulose. Erythrulose is a chemical used in fake tanning.\n\nBut **“Aap Chronology Samajhiye**” with this representation -\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ipk7xxd87ar51.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=b353acd40e51fbe1a80e72d94f3e4e2a8c771cd7\n\nL-AA is first oxidised to DHAA (which can be reversed in our skin). Oxidation means a reaction with the free form of oxygen molecules. Remember we learnt this in the last post. So oxidation can happen if L-AA is exposed to UV/oxygen in the environment at high temperature. However, DHAA can be reversed to AA in our skin because the presence of network antioxidants like glutathione that's already present in your skin. Check out [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/figure/nutrients-09-00866-f004/) diagram to understand how that works. However, when DHAA comes in contact with water it hydrolyses to 2,3-diketogulonate. Which cannot be turned back into AA due to the 5 hydrogen ring rupture. L-AA will not directly convert to 2,3-diketogulonate. It has to first oxidize then hydrolyse.2,3-diketogulonate may be further converted to other byproducts by other processes.\n\n[Lab muffin](https://labmuffin.com/vitamin-c-can-stain-skin-avoid/) made a post on this.\n\nIt is possible that DHAA may not convert to Erythrulose in our skin.\n\n***In conclusion, there is a lot of ambiguity around oxidised L-ascorbic acid and further processed byproducts.***\n\n***No studies have evaluated the benefits and side effects of these oxidised and degraded compounds.***\n\n***Although, the presence of antioxidants like ferulic acid, glutathione, vitamin e, etc. has been shown to increase the stability and efficiency of L-ascorbic acid serums. These are called network antioxidants because of this reason. Again check out the diagram linked above to understand more.***\n\nTo improve stability, the delivery mechanism also plays an important role. The right delivery mechanism can help prevent oxidation and conversion to other forms. Novel delivery mechanisms may also improve penetration along with stability. New delivery mechanisms to deliver L-AA without oxidizing are bein developed. [This study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4687614/) advocates using liposomal technology patented by Sesdema to deliver sodium ascorbate deeper into the skin. Many skincare companies are developing new anhydrous bases to disperse L-AA to prevent oxidation. Here is [another study](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/dd22/feb6b83ba354a50547c05552e70908f24460.pdf) of a new delivery mechanism.\n\n***However, an independent comparative study comparing different forms and delivery mechanisms of topical ascorbic acid has not been conducted.***\n\n*So in conclusion:*\n\n* *For L-ascorbic acid formulations in an aqueous:*\n   * *Must be formulated to be below PH 3.5 or below.*\n   * *Must be formulated using oxygen-impermeable packaging and stored at low temperature.*\n   * *Must be at a concentration above 5-8% and below 20%.*\n   * *Addition of other antioxidants can help improve the stability of the formulation.*\n   * *Must be stored in a dark/light-proof packaging at a stable temperature of  25 celsius or below.*\n   * *Must be used up quickly once exposed to air/light.*\n   * *Addition of penetration enhancers may help improve results.*\n* *For L-Ascorbic acid in a Non-aqueous solution:*\n   * *Must be formulated using oxygen-impermeable packaging and stored at low temperature.*\n   * *Addition of other antioxidants can help improve the stability of the formulation.*\n   * *Must be stored in a dark/light-proof packaging.*\n   * *Performance varies with the efficiency of delivery mechanisms.*\n\n***Owing to these stability, penetration and delivery issues with L-Ascorbic acid formulas, new derivatives of Ascorbic acid were developed.***\n\nNow my field of experience is not even remotely linked to bio-chemistry so I am not going to go in detail about the biochemical pathways that are hypothesised for their efficiency. I will, however, try to compare popular derivates and their performance/properties in brief based on information available on the internet.\n\n[A comparative analysis of various Vitamin C Derivatives](https://preview.redd.it/e99su3ae7ar51.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=14189617e8871c7968728ad2b907b4a0f7ff99b3)\n\n*Let's be honest picking one among the sea of options is intimidating. It comes down to personal preference and availability.*\n\nWhile choosing though there are certain things you should keep in mind. Only L-ascorbic acid has been studied for over 40 years now and has consistently proven to be advantageous topically.\n\nDue to its highly unstable nature,\n\n* *It is best to keep all your water-based L-AA carefully protected*. \n* *Ideally, they should be stored in a place with a stable temperature (in the fridge) and away from light. The smaller the quantity size the better.*\n* *Once oxygen touches the formula it starts to become unstable and turn yellow, making it very important to screw the lid tightly. The more product you use; the more the leftover product oxidises.* *Some people recommend transferring them in smaller bottles. I, apart, found that it gets tiresome to clear, sanitize bottles and dry old bottles ever. Any remains of LAA will oxidize and adding fresh batch in oxidised bottled can spoil the new batch.*\n\n***Using waterbased L-AA requires some commitment and care.*** *I love the effects though. Personally, I will walk the mile for those benefits.*\n\n***Anhydrous variants are another great option.*** *There are some limitations with anhydrous versions as well though*\\*\\*\\*.\\*\\*\\* ***Since AA is acidic and gritty in itself, these formulas can sting and sensitize your skin.*** *Many people break out while using high-concentration L-AA for the first time.  Its highly acidic nature can compromise the skin barrier. It's best to start with a lower concentration and gradually make your skin acquainted with L-AA. This can also be achieved by using L-AA a few times a week at the start and adding barrier-healing skincare products to your regime.*\n\n*Most people experience a slight stinging when they use L-AA-based products. There is a difference between stinging and burning although.* ***If your skin feels like it's burning, it's best to step back, stop use and choose a diluted version/low-concentration formula.***\n\n* ***The question comes: How to differentiate between stinging and burning?***\n\n*Stinging is a sharp, short-term, tingling sensation associated with low ph. It can last anywhere from a few seconds to a minute. Skin doesn't itch, turn red or feel sensitive to touch post that duration. This sensation may be experienced every time you apply L-AA but the intensity may reduce over the period.*\n\n*Burning is a strong irritation that feels different from tingling. It is a strong discomfort which may be coupled with redness, itching and touch sensitivity. It feels like your skin is on fire. Please immediately wash your face with water to wipe off any remains of the product. Apply some soothing, gentle products containing restorative ingredients like aloe, snail mucin, ceramides etc.*\n\n*It is best to patch test L-AA based products before applying it all over the face to understanding the way it reacts with your skin. Our mod* u/avaale *has made an amazingly detailed guide about* [patch testing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/iyxdqe/guide_how_to_patch_test/) *Please check it out to understand more about patch testing.*\n\nIn conclusion, L-AA may not be the best option for everyone due to its stability and skin sensitizing issues. If that is the case, you can still get some benefits by incorporating vitamin c derivatives. There is a catch though. ***Not all derivates are equal and not enough comparative studies have been conducted to conclude which one is the most superior form.***\n\n*However, by understanding the nature of the ingredient coupled with the anecdotal evidence we can understand a few things:*\n\n* Some derivates are lipophilic/ amphiphilic so they dissolve better in lipid formulations. These formulations may include oils, butter and silicones.\n* While each formulation differs from another due to the ***choice of base ingredients***. Some base lipids may be balanced to reduce the likeliness of comedogenicity and therefore may be less likely to cause breakouts in acne-prone skin type. Others may not suit your skin type.\n* *The* ***concentration*** *of active ingredient plays equally an important role.*\n* ***Pick a formula that works with your skin type, condition and goal.***\n   * Concentrations at which **Ascorbyl palmitate ( AA-PAL)** is used are extremely low. While vitamin C has shown some effects at concentrations as low as 1% but at the benefits of that concentration aren't hugely significant. When using derivatives in those concentrations, keep in mind that the derivative needs to convert to Vitamin C in your skin and some strength may be lost in the conversion. Coupling that with its stability issues, Ascorbyl palmitate doesn't catch my interest.\n   * **Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (SAP)** & **Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (MAP)** are more stable than AA-PAL but face the same roadblocks when it comes to formulating restrictions on concentration. Poor penetration and unreliable conversion don't benefit their case point. However, if acne is a pre-existing condition that you are dealing with, SAP may be an option to consider since there are some studies that support its anti-acne benefits. MAP is generally considered a better option in the industry than SAP from the overall vitamin C benefit perspective.\n   * **Ascorbyl Glucoside** is a better option than the ones I discussed above. It is stable at a variety of pH. Thus, it can comfortably be used by with sensitive skin. It can be incorporated in a liquid water/serum-based or formulated in a cream/gel base. It has been proven to convert into vitamin C in the skin and has been proven to have some anti-ageing benefits. However, potency is still questionable due to concentration restrictions. If you prefer easy of use and elegant- textured cosmetic products, this derivative may be considered.\n   * **Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate** is a newer derivative. It has not been independently researched much. There is this one study in a formula that also contained AA, which advocates it's benefits. In general, this derivative is unique due to its chemical structure and properties. Manufacturer claims suggest that it seeps in deeper into the skin than L-AA and stays in the skin 40-80% longer than L-AA. ( I am not sure if I can link/upload manufacturer documents I found through some sources and digging so if you are curious, watch out for my Instagram stories). Overall this ingredient is popular in Japan for its whitening properties and its lipid solubility puts it in an advantageous position to penetrate through the stratum corneum into the epidermis and the dermis. There is some anecdotal evidence that supports the claim that it may be one of the best derivatives out there. I also found some very expensive luxury skincare brands using this ingredient (will be sharing those insights on Instagram as well; May make a separate post if I am not being lazy).\n   * Last, but not least is **3-O-Ethyl Ascorbate.** It is one of the newest kid in the lot. Experts think it's structurally the closest to AA. It is an Ethylated form of AA so it's both water and lipid-soluble.   Stability tests have shown it's a very stable derivative at a PH of 5. Thus, the shelf life of EAC formulated products should be longer than others. Manufacturers and cosmetic companies claim that it provides similar benefits of L-AA is not better, without the stability issues. None of these claims has been verified although. It has shown to provide some de-pigmenting and antioxidant benefits by manufacturers in vitro trials. It can be formulated using high concentrations thus, it's another derivative to watch out for.\n\n**So, which one is perfect for you?  YOU decide that.**\n\nThis chart may help you come to some conclusion:\n\n[A graphical representation to make your decision easier.](https://preview.redd.it/3vmyn9yh7ar51.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bb6b780c72938114bf4e5d219cc2624e197d54c)\n\n***Another important detail:*** Almost all vitamin C formulations stay in your skin for up to 72 hours. Metals like iron and copper are known to destabilize and cause unwanted biochemical reactions with AA. *Thus is it best not to use copper peptide formulation with vitamin C to maximize their benefit.* By not using Copper peptide, I mean not just applying them together at the same time but also not using them in the same duration. So if you wish to use copper peptide you can rotate by using it for the first 3 months of the year and next three months using vitamin C and so on.\n\n***Some Extracts with Links to Clinical Studies/Research Journals I found relevant that support the benefit of topical application of L-AA:***\n\n23.8% L-ascorbic acid and a chemical penetration enhancer consisting of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and dimethyl isosorbide with iontophoresis to maximize amounts of L– ascorbic acid delivered were applied once daily, in a split-face study on twenty females (Fitzpatrick type III & IV to study the effect of Vitamin C on photoaged skin.

At the end of 8 weeks, MASI, PGA and PtGA showed improvement with both tranexamic acid and vitamin C.)) **The improvement was more with tranexamic acid than with vitamin C, although not statistically significant.Both TXA and Vitamin C are effective and safe treatments for melasma. -**[Link](http://www.idoj.in/downloadpdf.asp?issn=2229-5178;year=2020;volume=11;issue=1;spage=41;epage=45;aulast=Menon;type=2)[ Link](http://www.idoj.in/temp/IndianDermatolOnlineJ11141-2858161_075621.pdf)\n\n`Note:` SORRY FOR THE LONG POST ONCE AGAIN!!\n\nDuring my research, I found some really interesting `Insights & Dupes for popular vitamin C` formulas and products from manufacturer documents. I also cost/formula analysed Most Popular Vitamin C products. I even looked up all possible options for vitamin C in Indian markets.\n\n`I will try to share these insights on my Instagram soon and maybe make a post about my finding and whatever is left out in a follow-up post if I am not being lazy. There is still a lot to explore about Vitamin C. Look out for my upcoming Instagram stories if you are curious.`\n\n*^(Note: I do not consent to anyone sharing screenshots of my posts without my approval on any social platform.)*\n\n--Fun Fact--\n\nThe founder of SkinCeuticals ***Dr Sheldon R. Pinnell*** conducted turnkey research in the field on Vitamin C as a topical antioxidant. His first study published on topical application of vitamin C goes back to 1991. He filed [his patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US7179841B2/en) for ***Skinceutical CE ferulic in 2005.*** I guess that's why it remains the most coveted formulation and has been used by other researchers in various studies. It also justifies its price I guess. The good thing is that the patent is expiring in 2025! :P Till then we can only hope and pray someone invests time and research on developing more stable formulations and makes it available to consumers!\n\n^(Murray, J.; Darr, D.; Reich, J.; Pinnell, S.

    "body": "Hi all -- I have been  a pretty religious ABer for about 15 months now. I have always been very helped by this sub as well as the Snailcast ladies (SnowWhiteandtheAsianPear, Holy Snails, Fiddy Snails, and Fanservicedb). I wanted to leave some hopefully helpful reviews for people.\n\nMy skin used to be combination, closed comedones on forehead, some of cheeks, hormonal acne on chin every month, redness on cheeks, redness and hyperpigmentation after breakouts, sensitivity to many products. I live in Austin, TX. I'm 28. I'm white/Jewish. I have neutral toned skin.\n\nNow: skin is on the drier side (thank to all my actives) if I don't moisturize properly, no more acne ever, no more redness, learned I am sensitive to silicones! (so almost all problems have gone away)\n\n**First Cleansers**:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBanila Co. Clean It Zero Purity: what is there new to say? It's really good, it's great for sensitive skin. It's nice that it's a balm so you can let it sit on your face for a little while to dissolve makeup or grease or sunscreen. It's kind of hard to use in the shower; it's better to apply it on dry skin with dry hands (I think it's significantly more effective that way). I went through three tubs, but will not be repurchasing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Rituals Namasté Cleansing Oi](https://www.rituals.com/en-us/the-ritual-of-namaste-cleansing-oil-1101155.html)l (not AB): This is a really nice AB-inspired product. It's my first oil cleanser, and it has a nice, relatively weak smell. It's definitely a lot easier to use in the shower, but less comfortable than a balm to let sit on the face. It contains Lotus and Avocado and a number of oils (olive, sesame, sunflower, avocado, moringa, sunflower, macadamia). I have never had an issues with sensitivity to it, but it might be a problem for those who can't use anything with fragrance at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Second Cleansers:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHada Labo Rohto Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Cleansing Foam: for me, it's the best. again, not a lot to add to the conversation, but it's definitely the least drying of everything I've tried. Super basic, does the job. Nice foam, no smell, good price (HG)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHeimish All Clean Green Foam Cleanser (pH 5.5): ick. this is awful! SO DRYING. broke me out. I hate it. One of the only things I've straight up thrown away without finishing or giving to someone else. WNRP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCosRX Low pH Good Morning Cleanser: I...thought I liked this until I tried other things. It's just too drying for me and left my face tight. It now lives in the second bathroom for guests. Probably more appropriate for people with oily skin, but I honestly think it's just too drying for most people to use daily. WNRP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Exfoliating/Misc Cleansers:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water (not AB): for me this is perfect for the morning. I use it on a cotton pad every single morning and it's perfect to take off anything from the night without being remotely drying. I highly recommend it and will repurchase forever (HG).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSon & Park Beauty Water: I actually really like this. I know many people think it's stupid, but I like to use it after my micellar water if I am putting on actives (it's pH balancing), and it just makes my face feel good. It's also really good at removing stubborn makeup. It smells nice. I'm not sure it does anything important but it makes me happy and maybe that's enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTosowoong Enzyme Powder Wash: I bought this as a cheaper alternative to the AmorePacific one. It's.....fine? The granules are pretty big and it doesn't feel very appropriate for sensitive, acneic, or similar types of skin. I usually try to start the foaming process on my hands first so that I don't rub the hard granules directly into my face which helps. Not sure I'd recommend to most people, but it is cheap (\\~$7).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmorePacific Treatment Enzyme Peel: This is honestly really lovely for an enzyme wash (which I wanted to try), but it is also $60 at Sephora, which is just unreasonable to me. I have have it for almost a year to be fair, but I just don't use it all that often since I prefer actives rather than scrubs. If you have the money though, this is great! The granules are small and gentle, and it creates a really nice foam and leaves my face insanely soft. It isn't too drying, although I would avoid using it with a lot of other actives in your routine. If you need just a weekly enzyme treatment, it's a really good option, and it will last you for a LONG time this way. It also dispenses one \"dose\" at a time, which is nice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Masks:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOle Henriksen Hygge HydraClay Detox Mask (not AB): an ok clay mask. It's pretty moisturizing if you need that in a clay mask. I actually like it a lot, but now that I've discovered AB alternatives that are cheaper, I will stick with those. It is really great for dry skin though. Soothing texture, medium thick, won't pull out all the moisture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInnisfree Super Volcanic Pore Clay Mask: my preferred AB alternative due to price. It goes on super thin and dries quickly which is convenient so a tub lasts awhile. It's not too drying. The texture alone though makes it a great buy. I use it for the Fiddy Snails \"pore reducing\" method. RP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSkinfood Black Sugar Strawberry Mask Wash Off: It's nice. It smells good. It's definitely not a great option for very sensitive skin due to the granules, but it leaves your skin SO SOFT. I probably use it once a month (again, I'm super into actives). It's not an HG for me, but I imagine it's nice for people who like smelly things, cute things, or have oilier skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSkinfood Rice Mask Wash Off: Ahh so lovely. It's just soothing and it feels great on  your face. A much better plan for sensitive skin, due to texture and smell. I'll probably repurchase, but it's not an HG or anything like that. Nice for when you want to do something self-care-y, or you want to gently remove dry skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMalin + Goetz Detox Face Mask (not AB): a foaming mask à la Elizavecca. it's nice. It's fine. It's way too expensive. Fun if you have $$ to spend. Leaves skin a little drier than I would prefer, but it's a \"high end\" product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Actives (yay!):**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRohto Melano CC: I wanted to like it so bad. It broke me out so bad. I am sad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDear, Klairs Freshly Juiced Vitamin C Serum: It's just boring and not really effective so I passed it on to my boyfriend (hah). It did not break me out, but nor did it really do anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Ordinary Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate 10% (not AB): This is the first Vitamin C I used that made a HUGE difference (currently testing some stronger stuff). It almost completely eradicated my freckles (which was weird to be honest), but daily usage got rid of tons of brown spots, evened out skin tone. I honestly think this is a great, unsung product! High recommendations! (I used it daily -- AM)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Make Up Artist's Choice BellEvolve Lac-Luronic Serum](https://www.makeupartistschoice.com/BellEvolve-Lac-Luronic-Serum_p_291.html) (not AB): amaaaaaaaazing AHA. HG for sure. I can use it daily (After a little skin training) due to its inclusion of hydrating ingredients. It's an absolutely wonderful strong alternative to Sunday Riley and much cheaper. GO GET IT. seriously. This plus CosRX completely eradicated all my closed comedones. I literally did not believe that could happen. It's beautiful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCosRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid: HG for me. I also use it daily with no issue (again, after a little training). It's just wonderful, not too drying as long as you properly moisturize. I adore it. Also one that has been written about a lot so not going to say much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion (not AB): well...I wanted to try a retinoid and so there was this. It definitely works. I'm hoping it will help with my fine forehead lines and smile lines. It's definitely drying so you need to add a lot of moisture but obviously it's no tret. I use it at night a few days a week. I still love it and will rebuy. Maybe will try something stronger one day, but I'm a little scared.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSunday Riley Good Genes All-in-One Lactic Acid Treatment (not AB): it's honestly an HG magic potion but it's expensive AF so I turned to the above choice which does almost as well. I still will love this forever. My skin was like a radiant sun the morning after. Wish it was cheaper.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution: This is terrifying looking but nice! I use it once a month, and it's hard  to tell how amazing it given that I already have a lot of actives in my routine, but I think it's a good option for people who want an acid punch every so often and their skin can tolerate it. Skin is left suuuuuuper smooth and plump after. WRP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurology (zinc pyrithione 0.25%, niacinamide 4%, azelaic acid 4%): I think Curology is super cool. I like my cream a lot. I kind of want to replace it with other products, but I use it when I want an alternative to my cabinet of actives. My formula is definitely not super strong, but if I am lazy and just slab some on before bed, my skin always looks great in the morning. It's also nice for traveling to bring fewer products along.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCosRX Natural BHA Skin Returning Emulsion: I bought it before I knew what I was doing. Worthless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FTEs**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMissha Time Revolution First Treatment Essence Intensive Moist: I thought it was great until I tried other stuff, but it was a nice place to start. Definitely helped products absorb better and had some brightening affects. Meh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecret Key Rose Starting Treatment Essence: same as above, it was fine. Helpful, but not overly so. Meh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNaruko La Creme Face Renewal Miracle Essence: THE BEST. HG. I loove this FTE. It makes everything soak in incredibly. It is SO brightening for me and makes me feel radiant. I pat it on with my hands and one bottle lasts forever. It's also on sale a lot on the Naruko US site, but I have bought it from eBay too. Truly a wonderful product. Not good for those with fungal acne I believe since it has ferments. But seriously, check this out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Hydrating Toners**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDear, Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner:  It's distinctly fine. It hydrates. It does an ok job. It did not break me out. I find it deeply boring and not especially great, but also not harmful. Meh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIsntree Hyaluronic Acid Toner: A little bit of an improvement over Klairs. I sometimes put two layers on and I like the viscous texture. It's also not magical but it does the job of hydrating fine. I will not repurchase. I know some people really like it so if you like trying out new hydrating toners, this is worth trying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHada Labo Gokujyun Premium Lotion (Hyaluronic Acid): HG. I know I know everyone and their mother loves it, but it is perfect. I only do one layer but it just works SO well. A lot has been said about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Essences/Serums**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Ordinary Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA (not AB): I think this is a good product. I wanted a brightener, I bought this since it was a good price and it did fine. I liked until I discovered ---->\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNaruko Raw Jobs Tears Supercritical CO2 Pore Minimizing & Brightening Essence: this one! Omg, it is absolutely amazing. HG forever. It is seriously magical and makes me glow. I adore this essence and I kind of hoard it. It has a nice slightly viscous texture and soaks in well. I wish the glass bottle was larger because it doesn't last as long as I would prefer, but it is a GREAT product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCosRX Advanced Snail Mucin 96 Power Essence: also HG for me. It really soothes my redness and is a great thing whenever I am feeling dry at all. A lot has been said about it. I like it very much\n\n&#x200B;\n\nScinic Honey All-In-One Ampoule: another HG for me. I'm not sure if it's being discontinued though because I can't seem to find it most places and just ordered a new bottle off eBay. It is SO hydrating and delicious. It smells good, it feels great, and leaves my skin deeply hydrated and plump. Really a wonderful product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHoly Snail Shark Sauce: broke me out A TON. nope.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Moisturizers/Occlusives**:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFresh Lotus Youth Preserve Face Cream with Super 7 Complex (not AB): so this was my HG for many years before I got int AB. It does have silicone low down on the ingredient list and it never bothered me. I still think it's my favorite non-AB moisturizer, but it's a bit $$.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDr. Jart +: Cicapair Tiger Grass Cream: This honestly is a greasy mess but it's wonderful if you have difficult angry red skin. It saved me during allergy season last year and it's great for repairing. I would not wear it outside though due to grease factor. Great for red people!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRosette Ceramide Gel: it broke me out and I'm sad. Will probably retest in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBenton Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel: Also broke me out and I'm not sure why.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDear, Klairs Rich Moist Soothing Cream: I really like this stuff. It has a great texture, it dries down well. I like to try new creams, but I think this is very solid product and I have repurchased. I would highly recommend giving it a try if you're silicone-sensitive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInnisfree Green Tea Fresh Cream: Oh dear. So this is a tub of gel. It smells. It's shiny...but at least it doesn't break me out! So there's that. Definitely never again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInnisfree Jeju Sparkling Moisture Cream: Also broke me out and I'm not sure why. I wanted to like it. It smells nice. It feels nice. Too bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEtude House Soon Jun 2x Barrier Intensive Cream: This is just thick and goopy. It doesn't feel good and if I use it too much it starts making closed comedones. Not a fan. WNRP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEtude House Soon Jung 5-Panthensoside Cica Balm: Another one that is just WAY too thick, does not absorb and starts creating CCs. Nope.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA'Pieu Sea Buckthorn Cream: this is such a solid product. I'm not sure it's magical but it's a really lovely cream without silicones that dries well and is cheap. That's a lot going for it.

Thanks for the reviews :)\n\nI feel like it's hard for me to tell when or if I break out from a product since I would sometimes get a random breakout that isn't confined to a specific part of my facr anyway. I've also read that it can take up to a few weeks to see results from a product – be it an amazing glow or crazy bumps or horrible breakouts, which again adds to the whole dilemma of like, how do I know if this is just the regular breakout, or if it's from that product, or if it's maybe from that cake I ate or sth :/ \n\nI actually have been using the same products for almost a year now because of this. Like I would try adding new stuff but I would get a breakout, usually not straight away, and I would get paranoid about it being from that new product and cut that out again.\n\nAll is to say.. *how* are you able to use so many products and tell if one is breaking you out??

        "body": "Very helpful! Thanks for the list! I am restocking a lot of my routine and your skin seems pretty similar to mine so I am going to try a number of the products that you said worked for you.\n\nI agree that balm style cleansers are hard to use in the shower for sure! I usually don't shower at the same time I oil cleanse (I only oil cleanse 1x day, at night) but when I do, what I do is turn on the shower, then standing at the sink with dry hands I rub my balm cleanser on my face first & massage my eyes a little to release waterproof mascara. Then I blindly step into the now-warmed-up shower to rinse it off & wash my face with 2nd cleanser. I haven't fallen and hurt myself yet!!\n\nAnyways .... since you found balms a little less convenient, it might be that liquid oil cleansers just fit your habits better-- but if you ever want to re-try balms I'd make 2 more recommendations for you: either Aromatica Orange Sherbert or Farmacy Green Clean.\n\nAromatica is a #1 amazing product, the 180 mL jar is humongous and aggressively priced (even w/the Banila \"large\" 180mL, or \\~20% cheaper).  I find it gets mascara off 100x better than Banila and rinses more easily. I like Farmacy Green Clean even better -- small jars are available for $$$ at Sephora so it's quite easy to try/access -- but I haven't decided whether it's really worth 2-3x the price.... sigh.\n\nAs for Curology, I love mine too!! It's well priced imo and nice to get all the stuff they will put in there for you. I personally started on the formulation you have! I always recommend it to my family. Getting on their cream subscription solved like a 2 yrs straight acne breakout issue for me.\n\nThanks for listing all the sheet masks you've tried rq in such an organized format!!!! As a person who rarely sheet masks, whenever I try a new one, I always feel like I'm picking at random because so many exist and it's so hard to find opinions.  Great post :)\n\n&#x200B;",

I know this topic has been discussed many times before, but my problem showed up after a YEAR of constant use, it wasn't an immediate reaction. The Hada Labo products were my HGs! I used the Premium, Moist and Light lotions depending on the climate and my skin needs. I also used the Premium and Moist Milks and the Perfect Gel. I loved all of the products as they were giving me the best skin I ever had! One day, out of the blue I started breaking out in small pimples all over, which is the reaction other users have reported as well. Tried cutting out other products from my routine, but the breakout didn't stop until I cut out the Hada Labo products. I waited a week for my skin to calm down to reintroduce the lotions and got the same breakout, this time an immediate reaction overnight! The breakout was all over my face, eyes, neck, chest area, everywhere the product has been applied to. Tried introducing the products a third time with the same outcome and gave up. I am now trying to use them up on my legs as this is the only area of my body that doesn't break out from them. To this day I cannot pinpoint what caused this delayed reaction. Some say it's the alcohol, but it can't be as I use other lotions containing it and don't get that reaction, plus I would expect for my skin to react to it straight away, not wait a year! Also, the Light lotion doesn't contain alcohol and I still breakout from it. Some say it's the hyaluronic acid, but again, I use other products containing it without issues. Now, I am trying to find a lotion that comes even close to the Hada Labo's effect, but no luck so far.",

    "body": "A lot of other topics have been covered very well here on SCA, but I was asked where I thought there might be gaps in knowledge.\n\nRecently, there’s been a lot of interest in inorganic (mineral) sunscreens. As a result, I often see questions like:\n\n“Sunscreen A uses 20% zinc oxide but only has an SPF of 30, while Sunscreen B uses only 5% zinc oxide and 6% titanium dioxide, yet has an SPF of 50. Why?” \n\nAnswering this involves discussing different sunscreen technologies. I’ll try to be succinct, but bear with me.\n\n**TL;DR** \\- Mineral filters can vary in particle size, which will change the relationship between % used and resulting SPF. Companies are often somewhat deceptive about their use of nano-sized mineral particles. There are a number of SPF-boosting technologies that can be employed that generally work by dispersing sunscreen filters, absorbing UV themselves, making sunscreen filters more efficient, helping to create an even/protective film on skin, or providing antioxidant protection, or reducing redness.\n\n**Inorganic Sunscreen Filters - Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide**\n\nIn the past few years, there’s been a lot of interest in these two filters because of a number of reasons. Some users find that these filters are less likely to produce irritation or other negative effects than sunscreens with organic (“chemical”) filters. Others are concerned about the safety of organic filters. Yet others believe that these filters are better for the environment and coral reefs (not necessarily true). Whatever the reason, more people seem to be considering using mineral sunscreens, which has resulted in a number of questions. One of the main ones is, “why do percentages of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide not always seem to correlate with higher SPF and PPD/PA ratings?” To answer that question, we have to look at a few things.\n\n**Particle sizes**\n\nZinc oxide and titanium dioxide are a naturally white solid, and need to be micronized (ground up) into fine particles in order to be suspended in sunscreen products to ensure even coverage on the skin without excessive whiteness. Naturally, that means that you can micronize it to be coarser or finer, resulting in larger or smaller particle sizes. Changing the particle size of these filters seems to slightly change the spectra of UV radiation they are able to (mostly) absorb and (to a lesser degree) scatter. Generally, the smaller the particle size, the more efficient the UVB absorption becomes, but at the expense of UVA absorption. So this is the first variable that can affect final SPF and PPD/PA ratings. Hypothetically, two sunscreens could both have 10% zinc oxide, for example, but use different average particle sizes, with one resulting in SPF 8 and the other with SPF 15. Further complicating things is that a sunscreen can use two blends of the same mineral filter with different average particle sizes in order to balance out the UV absorption curves. \n\n**Deception around nano-particles**\n\nOne of the more dubious things that I see in the industry, particularly in the US, is companies saying that they do not use “nano particles”. There is no standard definition of “nano” in the US as there is in the EU or Australia, so many companies feel free to simply say “no, we don’t use nano particles” without mentioning the fact that by EU or Australian standards, they may well be. \n\nCompanies also sometimes justify saying they do not use “nano particles” because the particles are coated in a secondary ingredient (often to provide better performance by preventing clumping of particles or protecting skin from the free radicals that are released when UV radiation hits these particles). Although the average primary particle size (just the mineral) is less than 100 nm, the average *total* particle size, including the coating, is often larger than that, so they use this reasoning to tell consumers they are not using “nano particles”. \n\nBecause the EU is stricter about this, you’ll sometimes see US companies telling a US customer that their sunscreen is “non-nano” when the same product, when sold in the EU, is clearly labeled as “nano” in the ingredients list. It could possibly be the case that they are using a different average particle size for the two products, but there are definitely cases of straightforward deception as well.\n\nA secondary point, which is perhaps even more interesting, is that when you grind up zinc oxide and titanium dioxide into fine dust in order to micronize it, you are creating particles of VARIOUS sizes, with some portion of it almost always being less than 100 nm, aka “nano”. This is why “average” particle size is given, since the particles are of many different sizes. \n\nIn fact, because of this, the EU’s standard for labeling a sunscreen filter as “nano” or “non-nano” is relative, not absolute - less than 50% of the particles must have a diameter 100 nm or less. (Australia’s standard is more stringent, requiring either less than 10% of the particles have  diameter of 100nm or less, OR less than 10% of the particles “exhibiting unique properties”.) \n\nWhat this means it that even “non-nano”-labeled sunscreens in the EU (and Australia) likely contain particles that are less than 100nm. So good luck to consumers looking for mineral sunscreens but who want to completely avoid “nano particles”!\n\nI understand that companies feel pressured by consumer fears of “nano particles” and therefore resort to somewhat deceptive tactics, but that creates a vicious cycle of fear-mongering, paranoia, and misinformation that ends up helping no one. (By the way, I use sunscreens with micronized zinc, likely with particles less than 100 nm in diameter, and I do not have any intention of stopping. That is what works for my skin and I haven’t seen any research that strikes fear into my heart of “nano” zinc oxide, while I am quite concerned about the effects of unmitigated UV exposure. But this is my personal stance, not a prescription.)\n\n**SPF-Boosting Technologies**\n\nThere are a number of ways to boost the SPF of mineral sunscreen formulations. The first is to use ingredients that help further disperse the sunscreen filter particles. Ingredients such as butyloctyl salicylate, ethylhexyl methoxycrylene, undecylcrylene dimethicone, amongst others fall into this category. Depending on which ingredient is used at what concentration, SPF can be reportedly increased by 50% or more. \n\nMore rarely, there are SPF-boosters that actually have UV-absorbing ability of their own, though they’re not classified as sunscreen agents. Amongst these are methoxycinnamidopropyl hydroxysultaine and methoxycinnamidopropyl laurdimonium tosylate. (There is sometimes some overlap between this category and the one above - for example, some believe that butyloctyl salicylate may actually have some weak UV-absorption properties of its own, though this is not usually advertised by the manufacturers). Some other minerals, such as talc and iron oxides also absorb UV radiation to a degree, though they are not officially recognized as sunscreen agents.\n\nThe next is ingredients that interact with or affect the film of sunscreen that is left after application and drying of the product. Sunspheres, for example, are hollow spheres of styrene/acrylates copolymer. These spheres are distributed throughout the film of dried sunscreen on skin (along with the sunscreen filters). By refracting light, they increase the chances of UV radiation coming into contact with the filters in the sunscreen film, thereby increasing the efficiency of the sunscreen without increasing the % of sunscreen filters. It’s not a new technology, but it really is quite brilliant. Sunspheres can reportedly increase SPF 50% or more depending on the concentration used and in what formulation. Other film-forming agents, such as silicone resins (often used in rub-proof foundations), silicone acrylates, and various other polymers, help sunscreen set into an even, tenacious layer on skin, and can, depending on the material used and at what %, can increase SPF by 20% or more.\n\nIt’s useful to note that silicone-dominant emulsions, depending on how they are formulated, can also be quite effective at forming an even, tenacious layer of sunscreen on the skin upon drying that doesn’t slip around and cause streaky protection. These formulations are often helped by the use of ethanol (alcohol) to help the formula adhere to skin. This is in part why you see so many Asian milk-type sunscreens that heavily use cyclopentasiloxane (a volatile silicone oil) also include ethanol. Personally, I’ve noticed that Skin Aqua Super Moisture Milk SPF 50+, which many love because it feels comfortable on skin and does not have ethanol, slips around on my skin much more than some other Japanese milk SS’s that do include ethanol. This is in part what makes the Super Moisture Milk feel so comfortable on skin (like a face lotion, which don’t typically need to form an even, static film), but concerns me when I see zinc oxide particles collecting in folds and creating patchiness after a few hours of wear, since this probably also translates to uneven protection.\n\nThe last category is what I personally label as “miscellaneous” SPF boosters, and are usually antioxidant compounds or extracts that reduce skin redness. In the case of some antioxidants, there is some research that they can somewhat boost SPF through antioxidant ability (ascorbic acid and alpha tocopherol, for example) and/or acting as a weak absorber of UV radiation themselves (ferulic acid). However, some other boosters in this category seem merely to boost SPF ratings by suppressing skin redness, which I find to be a bit ethically dubious, since this theoretically is not actually lessening the free radical damage caused by UV radiation (at least to any meaningful degree).\n\nYou can imagine that, barring patent limitations (and there are many in this space), that a company could combine and employ any number of these strategies in one formula to maximize SPF. An example of that would be Skinceuticals’ Physical Fusion SPF 50, which has a relatively low % of sunscreen filters (about 6% titanium dioxide and 5% zinc oxide), yet a high SPF rating and a reported PPD of 21, due to the use of butyloctyl salicylate, sunspheres, talc, iron oxide and an antioxidant extract.\n\nI hope this useful in your quest to find a sunscreen that you're happy with, and good luck!",

        "body": "Thank you so much for writing this post!!! This has been my exact struggle. My skin can only handle mineral filters, but it’s been so tough trying to find “the one” between all the different components... I.e. a sunscreen might be super cosmetically elegant but have a low percent of zinc making me wonder about its UVA protection vs a sunscreen might have a super high percentage of zinc but be super drying and mattifying on my already dehydrated skin. \n\nSo, to be clear, there’s really no way for me to gauge the level of UVA protection in US sunscreens without seeing if the company will divulge it?? I always thought that you need at least 15-20 percent zinc to get sufficient UVA protection in a physical sunscreen, but it’s been hard as heck to find one with that much zinc that I can stand wearing (and if I understand what you’re saying, the filter percentages don’t really tell you the full story of protection afforded in a sunscreen). But, I can’t really trust the label “broad spectrum” to mean I’m getting superior UVA protection right?\n\nI don’t want to bother you with helping me figure out my sunscreen of choice cause I know you got bombarded with that in the last post, but would love to know if you have any suggestions for figuring out the UVA protection of a sunscreen if a company won’t say. I’ve been worried about my 6 percent zinc, 5 percent titanium dioxide sunscreen, even though it says it offers good broad spectrum protection (that’s so general of a statement!)",

        "body": "Wow, yet again another super informative post. Thank you so much for taking the time to share your knowledge. This is a topic I've been wondering about a bit but haven't really seen anything on it! I'm guessing this is how Australian Gold Botanicals markets their tinted sunscreen as SPF 50 and a somewhat high PA++++ rating, though I didn't recognize any of the boosters you mentioned on the ingredients list. \n\nSomething I've been wondering is that I see a lot of professionals (e.g. derms) claim that Zinc Oxide is an excellent UVA filter. However, previous absorbance spectra plots I've seen of Zinc Oxide always have pretty low absorbance, e.g. <1, though they are broad spectrum in the range of UV wavelength that they cover. I don't know much about sunscreen and UV science, but I would imagine you'd generally want at least 1 for the absorbance spectra for it to be of much use if you end up having prolonged UV exposure. I've certainly seen this for UVB filters.  The only time I've seen a high absorbance spectra for Zinc Oxide is from the Neutrogena data with their Sheer Zinc sunscreen, but it also has a much higher percentage (yes I know now that isn't everything! ;-)) of Zinc Oxide than I've ever seen in another mineral sunscreen. \n\nIn my mind, it doesn't seem that helpful if you have broad spectrum coverage that has low absorption - but maybe I'm way off the mark? \n\nAlso, just curious, but any idea why companies haven't yet formulated a mineral sunscreen like the Neutrogena one that is tinted so it has less of a cast? I feel like this would potentially be a pretty decent gap in the market but so far the main tinted ones I've seen are the Australian Gold Botanicals and the Elta MD Sport. I assume it must be pretty hard to get a tint and adequate UV protection? \n\nIf you have time to answer any of these questions, I'd be super grateful but regardless, you're AWESOME for sharing your knowledge on this stuff with us. I'm sure everyone here really appreciates it, :-).",

In relation to the boosting technologies in sunscreens, you seem to have mostly talked about the boosting of SPF, are there similar ingredients or technologies that manufacturers use to boost the UVAPF?

I keep seeing that for a sunscreen employing only Zinc Oxide to provide decent UVA protection, the concentration must be at least 20%? Do particle size of Zinc Oxide and other ingredients or technologies you mentioned above affect the UVAPF of Zinc Oxide? \n\nFinally are you aware of any brands that use coated Zinc Oxide? As it appears that uncoated zinc oxide may degrade avobenzone and also generate free radicals on the skin?",

I purchased this product a few months ago in the hopes of clearing up my PIH and so far, I find quite efficacious. \n\n**Skin profile**: Type- Oily, sensitive and prone to acne\nTone- medium (I use Maybelline Fit Me 220)\n**Skin concerns**:hyperpigmentation, acne, clogged pores. \n**Climate and season**:Tropical, summer (very hot and humid) \n**Product**: Hada Labo Shirojyun Premium Whitening Lotion (light) \n**Ingredients**: Water, Glycerin, Methylpropaned Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Diglycerin, Glycera Betaine, Trehalose, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose E Alpha-Arbutin, Chlorphenesin, Polysorbate 20. Hydro Lecithin, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Metabisulfite, Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Ascorbic Acid, Resveratrol \n\n*Review*\n\n**Smell**: It is fragrance-free which is great for my sensitive skin. I can't detect any scent otherwise.\n**Texture**: Quite runny. It absorbs readily into the skin but leaves a very slight sticky feel.\n**Application**: I pour some into my palm, then spread it evenly on my skin, both on my face and body. \n**Length of use**: 3 months\n\nMy skin is recovering from acne, so I'm dealing with PIH and uneven texture. I thought this looks like it would help, seeing as it has niacinamide high up in the ingredient list, which has helped a lot with my hyperpigmentation before. I am quite pleased with the results. It definitely helped to fade my PIH. I had a huge pimple on my thigh which left behind a large purplish-brown spot. I applied the product every night on the spot and the discoloration has faded considerably. It's not completely gone but only 1-2 shades darker than my skin. The lotion also made my skin soft and overall brighter and smoother. \n\n Would definitely repurchase!",

Saul](https://web.archive.org/web/20080125013301/http://www.doctoryourself.com/klennerbio.html)\n\nAssistant Editor, Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine\n\nReprinted with permission from *J Orthomolecular Med*, 2007. Vol 22, No 1, p   31-38.\n\n***“Some physicians would stand by and see their patient die rather than use ascorbic acid because in their finite minds it exists only as a vitamin.”*** (F. R. Klenner, MD)\n\nThe sound barrier was broken in 1947. The Korean War began in 1950. In between was the polio epidemic of 1948-9, during which Dr. Frederick Robert Klenner cured every polio case he saw by using vitamin C.\n\n# VITAMIN C AGAINST POLIO\n\nClaus W. Jungeblut (1) had the initial idea; William J. McCormick (2) was an early proponent of frequent gram-sized doses. But it was Frederick Robert Klenner who first gave polio patients tens of thousands of milligrams of vitamin C per day. He had been doing so since before D-Day.\n\n“From 1943 through 1947,” writes Robert Landwehr (3), “Dr. Klenner   reported successful treatment of 41 more cases of viral pneumonia using   massive doses of vitamin C. From these cases he learned what dosage and route of administration - intravenously, intramuscularly, or orally - was best for each patient. Dr. Klenner gave these details in a February 1948 paper   published in the *Journal of Southern Medicine and Surgery* entitled ‘Virus Pneumonia and Its Treatment with Vitamin C.’ (4) This article was the first of Dr. Klenner’s twenty-eight (through 1974) scientific publications.”\n\n***“When I first came across Klenner’s work on polio patients,”*** writes Thomas Levy, **“I was absolutely amazed and even a bit overwhelmed at what I read. . . To know that polio had been easily cured and so many babies, children, and some adults still continued to die or survive to be permanently crippled by this virus was extremely difficult to accept**. . . Even more incredibly, Klenner briefly presented a summarization of his work on polio at the Annual Session of the American Medical Association on June 10, 1949 in Atlantic City, New Jersey:\n\n***‘It might be interesting to learn how poliomyelitis was treated in Reidsville,    N.C., during the 1948 epidemic. In the past seven years, virus infections have been treated and cured in a period of seventy-two hours by the employment of massive frequent injections of ascorbic acid, or vitamin C. I believe that if vitamin C in these massive doses - 6,000 to 20,000 mg in a twenty-four hour period - is given to these patients with poliomyelitis none will be paralyzed and there will be no further maiming or epidemics of poliomyelitis.’*** Levy concludes:  “The four doctors who commented after Klenner did not have anything to say about his assertions.” (5)\n\n“How then,” asks Landwehr, “could a Dr. Fred R. Klenner, a virtually unknown general practitioner specializing in diseases of the chest, from a town no one ever heard of, with no national credentials, no research grants and no experimental laboratory, have the nerve to make his sweeping claim in front of that prestigious body of polio authorities?” Indeed, Klenner was hardly a man to mince words. “When proper amounts are used, it will destroy all virus organisms,” he would say. “Don’t expect control of a virus with 100 to 400 mg of C.” (6)\n\nKlenner administered ascorbate by injection, and, as Lendon H. Smith describes in great detail in the *Clinical Guide to the Use of Vitamin C: The Clinical Experiences of Frederick R. Klenner, M.D*., Klenner found that “the most effective route was intravenous, but the intramuscular route was satisfactory. He gave at least 350 mg per kilogram of body weight.” That quantity per day is a dose of 25,000-30,000 mg or so for an adult. Yet, Smith adds, ***“With 350 mg per kilogram of body weight every two hours, he could stop measles and dry up chicken pox.”***\n\nThis is indeed a large amount of vitamin C. Such use exemplifies the modern orthomolecular physician. Klenner’s doses were enormous, flexible and symptom-driven. The sicker the patient, the higher the dose. Massive ascorbate treatment cured every one of 60 polio cases Klenner saw. He published his report in *Southern Medicine and Surgery* in July of 1949. (7) All patients were well in three days. None had any paralysis.\n\nIn a 1950 letter, Klenner wrote:\n\n“Since my last communication, I have seen four new cases of poliomyelitis. All of these have completely recovered. Three cases were seen in the acute febrile stage and in each instance, using 65 mg per kg body weight (by injection) every two (to) four hours, recovery was spontaneous in 48 hours.” (8)\n\nIn 1951, “In an especially incredible case,” Levy says, “Klenner (9) described a five-year-old girl stricken with polio. This child had already been paralyzed in both her lower legs for over four days! The right leg was completely limp, and the left leg was determined to be 85% flaccid. Pain was noticed especially in the knee and lumbar areas. Four consulting physicians confirmed the diagnosis of polio. Other than massage, vitamin C was the only therapy initiated. After four days of vitamin C injections the child was again moving both legs, but with only very slow and deliberate movement. Klenner also noted that there was a “definite response” after only the first injection of vitamin C. The child was discharged from the hospital after four days, and 1,000 mg of oral vitamin C was continued every two hours with fruit juice for seven days. The child was walking about, although slowly, on the 11th day of treatment. By the 19th day of treatment there was a “complete return of sensory and motor function,” and no long-term impairment ever resulted. Vitamin C not only completely cured this case of polio, it completely reversed what would undoubtedly have been a devastating, crippling result for the remainder of this girl’s life.” (4) **For such elegant results, in the days before widespread use of either antibiotics or vaccination, one may wonder why Klenner was not awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

He was not willing to accept the experimentally proved fact that vitamin C in ordinary doses accelerated the growth rate of squamous cell carcinoma in these mice.\nAt the time, Linus was promoting his claim that \"75% of all cancer can be prevented and cured by vitamin C alone.\" This claim proved to be without experimental foundation and not true. . . . Vitamin C increased the rate of growth of cancer at human equivalents of 1 to 5 grams per day, but suppressed the cancer growth rate at doses on the order of 100 grams per day (near the lethal dose), as do other measures of malnutrition [23].\"\n\nTLDR: They did more research in the 80's that showed that 1-5 grams of Vitamin C per day almost doubled the rate of squamous skin cancer in rats. They also confirmed that after exposure to UV light, every rat with the megadose of vitamin C got cancer. Your write up was really interesting so I took a look, but sadly, even if it could kill viruses (which seems easy enough to test in a petri dish) l wouldn't trade no virus to get skin cancer :/\n\nEdit: formatting and words",

    "body": "Keen to share my thoughts after finishing this serum from Round Lab. I am looking for pregnancy-safe alternatives to address hyperpigmentation and hopefully ward off pregnancy melasma.\n\nThis caught my eye as it has these 4 ingredients that help to address uneven skin tone:\n\n* **Niacinamide (Vitamin B3)**\n* **Tranexamic Acid**\n* **3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid**\n* **Glutathione**\n\nI bought this from Hikoco (NZ Kbeauty Shop) and I think it was on promo at the time so it was a bit of a spur of the moment, \"why not\" purchase. \n\n**Skin Type/Concerns**\n\nOily and prone to surface dehydration. Sunspots on cheekbones and nose bridge, plus some post-acne hyperpigmentation and scars. \n\n**Packaging**\n\nI found the packaging a little annoying, it was hard to see how much serum was left inside and there was something about how it was made that meant the dropper wasn't sucking up enough product sometimes. Would have preferred a pump. \n\n**Texture**\n\nClear, slightly viscous with golden droplets throughout. I didn't see this mentioned anywhere in the marketing so I'm unsure which ingredient this would have been, obviously something oil-based. It absorbed quickly and worked well under the rest of my skincare\n\n**Results**\n\nThis worked better than I thought - for some reason I didn't really think to take progress photos but I saw the biggest difference in a stubborn post-acne spot that just didn't want to go away! \n\n**Would I Rebuy?**\n\nNot really sure! I am currently trying the Numbuzin No.5+ Brightening Serum and I feel like I'm seeing results faster with the Numbuzin product. However, it's possible that the Round Lab provided a good base for the Numbuzin to perform by doing some of the heavy lifting beforehand. \n\nI think the Round Lab product is good enough for the price, especially if you can get it on special! Overall a 4/5 from me.  ",

    "body": "I wanted to share some tips and knowledge in skincare since a lot of the same questions are being asked in most posts here. I am not a doctor. this is all based from experience, knowledge, research, advice from dermatologist and this great sub skincareaddiction. Remember skin care is a personal journey (trust me! i have a lot of trial and errors too).\n\nBasic Routine:\n\nAM\n- cleanse\n- moisturizer\n- Sunscreen\n\nPM\n- cleanse\n- treat\n- moisturizer\n\nFrom this, you can add items to suit your personal skin care needs. For example.\n\nOily Skin\n\nAM\n- Cleanse\n- Anti redness Toner\n- Spot treat with BHA\n- Oil free, gel type moisturizer\n- Non greasy sunscreen\n\nPM\n- double cleanse\n- Calming Toner\n- BHA\n- Niacinimide\n- Moisturizer \n\nFor dry skin, maybe add more (7x if u like lol) toner or a heavier moisturizer, etc.\n\nYou dont need to put a lot, start with the basic routine then add one item at a time so you know what works, what your skin doesn’t like. Everyone’s skin is different. For example, silicones are okay for some, for some it causes irritation and clogged pores. Some are okay with zinc, some aren’t. Always patch test first. Always look for the science  behind it thus its important to research and check reviews. The cosmetic/skincare industry will try to sell you a lot of stuff.\n\nSummary of my other thoughts, generalizations (references down below)\n- Always wear suncreen, indoors, outdoors, cloudy day. As long as there is light (UV index of more than 1), there is UVA, blue light, UVB etc.\n- alcohol is a no-no (alcohol, alcohol denat, SD alcohol)\n- fatty alcohols are good (cetyl, stearyl, cetearyl alcohol\n- perfume causes irritation\n- Natural doesnt always mean no irritation\n- Double cleanse what? 1st cleanser (oil/balm) to remove make up/sunscreen, 2nd cleanser is the gel/foam/liquidy type. Remove dirt, make up, spf. Squeaky clean is not the goal. Do not over cleanse. Strip in the bedroom not your moisture.\n- A broken moisture/skin barrier causes skin problem for all skin types (even oily ones)\n- Hydrating your skin is different from moisturizing. Hyaluronic acid is a popular hydrating ingredient. Although some moisturizers can be hydrating.\n- They talk about toner as being connected to Ph level or whatever, toning is just a hydrating step, dont complicate it.\n- Dont over exfoliate, add one chemical exfoliant at a time (either BHA, AHA, PHA, etc). Once your skin gets acclimated then use all the acids, LoL kidding. Be nice to your skin. 😁\n- Why do they like to exfoliate? Its helps with hyperpigmentation, acne scars and has brightening effect (other notable ingredients vitamin c, niacinimide)\n- Glycolic (AHA) has studies showing help with collagen formation\n- Retinoids fam(Retinol)and vitamin C are tricky yet important ingredients. Vitamin C is unstable. Skin care brands often are misleading about Retinol components. \n- Vitamin C easily oxidizes, once you open the bottle or been sitting on a shelf of a long time, exposed to sun and other elements. Its just *poof* a waste, even if its marketed as stable with Ferulic acid, etc. that’s why the L-Ascorbic Acid powder is popular (although not easy to use) but is the most effective version out there. There are other vit c products (cheap or expensive) that are said to be effective and hyped by many, YMMV.\n- in my opinion, virtually all OTC retinoids/Retinol products are without value. Some can be misleading. Just use retin-A or tretinoin to get the most efficacy if you’re worried about wrinkles.\n- some noteworthy retinol/retinoids products: Dermatica, Curology, Adapalene, Diffirin, Paula’s Choice 1% Retinol, Avene RetrinAI\n- Collagen supplements gets metabolized in your stomach before it reaches (if any left) your skin. So you can’t drink beautiful skin but always drink water not sugar, (for some it may be dairy).\n- Retiniods/Retinol, Niacinimide, Vit C are the only ingredients  that has proven to address ‘mature’ skin, wrinkles. Note i didnt use ‘anti aging’ ‘reverse time’ ‘freeze time’ ‘rejuvenate’ ‘detox’ etc LoL those are marketing cliches.\n- Peptides at most are moisturizing. The only science backed up peptide is the one found in TO Buffet + Copper Peptides and NIOD CAIS2\n- Apply skin care beginning with lightest to heaviest; liquid type to cream, last is oil.\n\nPopular youtube beauty/skincare vloggers:\nHyram, James Welsh, gothamista, Liah Yoo, etc. They all can teach you something or two but they are not doctors/experts/chemist. Sometimes they agree on certain products, sometimes they dont. But they push products (does gothamista really use all of those (tons and tons) products?) I bet she uses NIOD CAIS2 consistently though, just a guess. Liah really looks young though (genes?). They are fun to watch too.\n\nFor example, Krave Beauty Matcha is a holy grail for James Welsh but ‘its okay’ for Hyram. Gothamista likes ‘the face shop oil cleanser’ but I seriously cant get over the perfume. But they all like (not sure about Liah) Klairs Soft Airy UV essence and Purito centella unscented sunscreen.\n\nBeauty related topics in Youtube generates more than 700 million views monthly (this is pre pandemic)\n\nAgain, this is only my opinion. I still have bias, i’m human with skin care stuff on my shelf. 😅\n\nRead up on science:\n- Thebeautybrains.com\n- The beauty brains podcast hosted by a cosmetic chemist\n- Lab muffin - written and vlogged by a chemist\n- Beautypedia ingredient list\n- Cosmetic Cop - Paula Begoun\n\nRead, cross check, find references\n\nFinally, big and expensive clinics will ask their dermatologist / aestheticians to sell products. Be aware. Find a good, honest, within your budget dermatologist. Get to know them, be friends with them. He/She can provide you a lot of insights and help, even free stuff.\n\n*if i missed something, got something wrong and/or additional thoughts, please please do make a comment and let me know.

Buffet contains *multiple* patented peptide complexes, so this point is not only false, even if it were true it wouldn't clarify *which* peptide complex was actually \"proven.\" It also wouldn't be true to say that any of those peptides are exclusive to TO because DECIEM did not discover any of them, they simply combined them in a single formula. \n\nYou also fail to explain that rules like \"lightest to thickest\" are not absolute; that vitamin c is not one thing, and that only certain forms are \"easily oxidized\"; that there are specific reasons *why* certain OTC retinoids are a \"sham\" (and, further, reasons why many are not); that toner's pH adjusting property is not without value, particularly not in the case of individuals like myself who, for example, have very hard water; that \"perfume\" is not one thing, and does not universally irritate. \n\n*Many* of these points need further clarification and/or are inaccurate.

        "body": "A couple of weeks ago I finally did a virtual derm appointment to treat years of hormonal acne and oily skin. The doctor outlined a simple routine for me which roughly follows the one you described, and pointed me toward some minimal skincare products, which I purchased right after the appointment. She also wrote me a prescription for spironolactone (25mg) and tretinoin (0.018%). \n\nWell, the prescriptions just came in the mail this morning and now I'm not even sure I need them because my skin is clearing up so rapidly, just from following a straightforward AM/PM routine with 4 products. I can't believe I put this off for years!! I was wandering in the wilderness for so long, feeling overwhelmed about what to use and how to use it! I wish I'd known it was so easy.

I've only seen it at Costco thus far but they might sell it elsewhere, I haven't looked all that closely.\n\nAnyway, I hope this helps for anybody else who might also be feeling lost in the wilderness about where to start with acne treatment and general skincare. I always knew that you don't need a billion products to keep your skin clear and healthy, and that most of it is a marketing sham to get into your pockets, but I felt so paralyzed in trying to decipher which should be my \"prized few\" products among all of the choices out there that I kept putting off building a routine that would serve my skin in the long run. When in doubt, just make a derm appointment. So worth it.",

    "body": "#TL;DR\n\n------------------------\n\nThere is little evidence in favour of supplementing antioxidants. Some antioxidants (NAC) may temporarily improve endurance (i.e. competition) but may have negative long-term effects on strength, hypertrophy, and recovery. Only athletes that are proven to be deficient in antioxidant vitamins should consider supplementation\n\n#Introduction\n\n------------------------\n\nHello everyone. Welcome back to Research Review. Previous articles are archived at /r/researchreview.\n\nIn this review, we will be discussing how supplemental antioxidants (SA) affect athletic performance, strength, hypertrophy, recovery, as well as other health parameters. In recent years, there's been a lot of discussion about the health benefits of antioxidants. One thing I've come across in my searches is the recommendation that both strength and endurance athletes should supplement antioxidants to improve their performance.\n\nAntioxidants are substances that have the ability to act as electron donors. These substances differ, and not all antioxidants are created equal [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/antioxidants/). This means that an antioxidant such as Vitamin C, can have a completely different effect on the body compared to melatonin, which is also has antioxidant properties. Antioxidants interact with free radicals. There are several types of radicals, but we will mostly concerns ourselves with the most relevant type: Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS).\n\nAccording to Lobo et al [(2010)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3249911/):\n\n> An antioxidant is a molecule stable enough to donate an electron to a rampaging free radical and neutralize it, thus reducing its capacity to damage. These antioxidants delay or inhibit cellular damage mainly through their free radical scavenging property.\n\n\nThe reasoning for supplementing antioxidants is that exercise causes inflammation and oxidation brought on by Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). By taking antioxidants, our bodies should  indirectly benefit from a decrease in acute inflammation.\n\n\nAccording to Gross et al [(2011)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232889980_Antioxidant_supplementation_and_endurance_training_Win_or_loss):\n\n> Typically, free radicals are thought of as perpetrators of cell damage, ageing, even cancer, whereas antioxidants are seen as the defence against these threats. Accordingly, antioxidants are among the most common sports supplements used by amateur and professional athletes.\n\nSo let's put these claims to the test. **We will mainly look at vitamins A, C, E and NAC.**\n\n\n*Note: I have not critiqued the accuracy or quality of individual studies due to time constraints. With that in mind, enjoy*\n\n\n\n\n#Summary\n\n------------------------\n\n- Hormeosis and ROS  drive part of the adaptive process to exercise\n\n- Inhibiting ROS via antioxidant supplementation may blunt beneficial endurance adaptations \n\n- There is insufficient evidence for making claims about hypertrophy and strength. From the evidence we have today, the trend is towards no effect or a negative effect\n\n- Supplemental antioxidants (SA) may delay the recovery process, following exercise\n\n- SA may prevent some of the beneficial effects of regular exercise on insulin sensitivity\n\n- SA likely do not prevent cancer, cardiovascular disease, or DNA damage. In some cases, SA may worsen these conditions (i.e. increase metastasis, the spread of cancer, in smokers)\n\n- Chronic antioxidant supplementation is likely not a good idea.\n\n- Acute antioxidant supplementation of NAC could temporarily preserve submaximal performance during competitions spanning several days. However, it is unclear whether NAC improves supramaximal performance\n\n- It's not yet clear whether SA will exhibit the same effects if taken on rest days. Timing and dosage may matter\n\n\n#Theoretical basis\n\n----------------------\n\nBefore we start discussing hypertrophy, endurance capacity, and strength, we need to briefly establish a theoretical basis for understanding basic physiological functions within the body. \n\n\n\n##Hormeosis\n\nHormeosis is the process whereby the body is exposed to a mild stressor and recovers without taking permanent damage. This mechanism can be described as \"overcompensation\", where the body not only recovers from the exposure, but becomes more resilient to future exposures. The theory of hormeosis is usually talked about in relation to the immune system, which is strenghtened by minor exposures to bacteria, viruses, etc.\n\nSome research suggest that the hormeosis theory be extended to free radicals and the adaptive process of exercise. [Radak et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15834665) reported in 2005 that \"the beneficial effects of regular exercise are partly based on the ROS generating capability of exercise\". In [2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18191751), they suggested the following:\n\n> [...] it is highly possible that the well-known beneficial effects of exercise are due to the capability of exercise to produce increased levels of ROS [...] it seems that the vulnerability of the body to oxidative stress and diseases is significantly enhanced in a sedentary compared to a physically active lifestyle.\n\n##Mitochondrial biogenesis\n\nThe mitochondria are usually refered to as the cell's \"energy factories\". They contain molecules that  perform important tasks in regards to oxidation-reduction (the process which creates ATP). Mitochondria are therefore very important in regards to oxygen-based energy production. This energy pathway is used during endurance exercise (McArdle et al (2011) *Essentials of Exercise Physiology*). The amount of mitochondria in skeletal muscle improves cardiovascular capacity (Lanza et al [(2010)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3070482/), and exercise increases mitochondrial mass in muscle cells (Zamora et al [(1995)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8983917), Hoppeler et al [(2003)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12544642)). The creation of new mitochondria is called mitochondrial biogenesis.\n\nLanza et al [(2010)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3070482/) conclude:\n\n> Numerous physiological stimuli (e.g., temperature, stress, hormones, hypoxia, caloric intake) are known to affect mitochondrial physiology, but **endurance exercise remains one of the most robust, simple, cost-effective, and well-studied stimuli for mitochondrial biogenesis**.\n\nSo, let's assume something were to interfere with the process of mitochondrial biogenesis. A lowered mitochondrial muscle content could decrease endurance capacity, in theory. This is where the newest antioxidant supplementation research becomes relevant.\n\nIn [2008](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5673945_Oral_administration_of_vitamin_C_decreases_muscle_mitochondrial_biogenesis_and_hampers_training-induced_adaptations_in_endurance_performance_Am_J_Clin_Nutr), Gomez-Cabrera et al published a paper called \"Oral administration of vitamin C decreases muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and hampers training-induced adaptations in endurance performance\".:\n\n> [...] **exercise itself is an antioxidant**, because **training increases the expression of 2 antioxidant enzymes** related with longevity— namely, SOD and GPx. We provide evidence that the continuous presence of small stimuli, such as low concentrations of ROS, in fact induces the expression of antioxidant enzymes as a defense mechanism. **Low concentrations of radicals may be considered to be beneficial, because they act as signals to enhance defenses**\n\nThis finding is consistent with the theory of hormeosis as we discussed previously.\n\n\nNow the study had some limitations, like a low participant number. Every study has limitations. However, I won't go into the details.\n\nLooking beyond this study, we have two studies who looked at how antioxidants affected PGC1α, which is a \"a central inducer of mitochondrial biogenesis\" (Austin et al [(2012)](http://jcs.biologists.org/content/125/21/4963)). Both studies found that vitamins C and E hampered cell mitochondrial adaptations following endurance exercise (Ristow et al [(2009)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2680430/), and Paulsen et al [(2014)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260020759_Vitamin_C_and_E_supplementation_hampers_cellular_adaptation_to_endurance_training_in_humans_A_double-blind_randomised_controlled_trial)).\n\nBy the end of [2015](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286219601_Do_antioxidant_supplements_interfere_with_skeletal_muscle_adaptation_to_exercise_training), Merry et al wrote a review about these findings. They concluded that:\n\n> **While there is  no convincing evidence  to support  antioxidant   supplementation  in  regards  to  training  adaptations,  there  is  a  growing  body  of  literature  suggesting it  may  hamper or  prevent  the  signaling  of  important  adaptations  such  as muscle   mitochondrial biogenesis, insulin sensitivity and hypertrophy.** This is  consistent with hormesis   where stressors induce  ROS that act as intracellular signaling molecules to promote adaptations   that equip  the  cell  to  better  tolerate  future  stress ( F igure  3) .  **It  is  theoretically  possible  that   antioxid ants may aid exercise training if the exercise stress was su fficient to chronically elevate  ROS  to  levels  which  impair  function and  cause  damage ,  however  it  is  unlikely  that  such  levels   would  be  achieved  solely  through  exercise  training**\n\nHowever, this view has very recently been criticised by Camera et al [(2016)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/294289267_Skeletal_Muscle_Signaling_Pathways_and_Human_Performance)\n\n>  [...] it   is   clear   that   **exercise  performance   is   a   complex   phenomenon  resulting  from  the  integration  of  multiple  physiological,  biomechanical  and   psychological factors. As such, it is naive to think that any single ‘molecular marker’ can   predict  or  explain  variability  in  exercise  responses  and  subsequent  performance  capacity**.  Indeed,  there  is  often  a mismatch between the changes  in  cellular „mechanistic‟ variables   ( often  reported  as  increases  in  the  phosphorylation  status  of  signaling molecules  and/or   increases  in  the  expression  of  genes  and  proteins  involved  in  mitochondrial  biogenesis or   muscle  protein synthesis ) and whole body functional out comes (changes in training capacity   or  measures  of  performance) [...] there may be no direct relationship between performance and   some  of  the  training-induced  changes  in  selected  cellular  events  that  have  been  measured!   **Just because we can measure a new signaling protein or some of its downstream kinases, does   not mean it has an important role in exercise performance.** While  two signaling proteins, the  AMPK and PGC - 1 play maj or roles in endurance - training adaptation, it should be noted that **normal responses and adaptations to both acute exercise and chronic exercise training can be   seen  when  one  or  more  key  pathways  are  absent,  are  blocked  with  drugs,  or  are otherwise attenuated**\n\nCamera rejects the relationship researchers try to establish between mitochondrial markers and endurance exercise adaptations. He goes on to conclude:\n\n> Connecting  distinct  signaling  cascades  to  defined  metabolic  responses  and  specific   changes  in  gene  expression  in  skeletal  muscle  that  occur  after  exercise  is  likely  to  be  a   complex  and  perhaps,  ultimately  futile  task  because  the  majority  of  these  pathways  are  not   linear,  but,  rather,  they  constitute  a  complex  network,  with  a  high  degree  of  crosstalk,   feedback   regulation,   and   transient   activation.\n\nThis claim seems to have wider implications. Looking at single factors (i.e. muscle protein synthesis) and its response to exercise may be meaningless. Trying to find causative relationships may be also be meaningless since there may be confounding variables that affect the outcome. If these confounding factors are not controlled for (not measured), we may erroneously establish causative relationships where they do not exist. I don't know how accurate Camera et al are in claiming this, given that this review has recently been published. Hopefully, other researchers will respond soon.\n\n\n##Oxidative stress & inflammation\n\nWhen the antioxidant defense system that controls ROS (free radicals) fails or is diminished, we get a homeostatic imbalance. Following this imbalance the body experiences oxidative stress. However,  it has recently been discovered that oxidative stress can be organ-specific, or pathway-specific. This means that some organs can be in homeostatic imbalance even if the overall oxidative balance is different. Oxidative stress has been tied to various health problems, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, metabolic disorders, etc. An antioxidant rich diet has been postulated to prevent these health-related diseases. But, the research has been inconclusive on this issue; some studies have favorable findings, while others have found that some antioxidants could increase mortality risk (Peternelj et al [(2011)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51780659_Antioxidant_Supplementation_during_Exercise_Training_Beneficial_or_Detrimental))\n\nExercise increases ROS in muscle cells and therefore causes oxidative stress. This might sound bad initially, but ROS is very important for a muscle cell's normal functioning. (Peternelj et al [(2011)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51780659_Antioxidant_Supplementation_during_Exercise_Training_Beneficial_or_Detrimental))\n> **With exercise training the body adapts to exercise-induced oxidative stress and becomes more resistant to subsequent oxidative challenges**. This is achieved through a number of different mechanisms, such as upregulation of redox-sensitive gene expression and antioxidant enzymes levels, [90,91] an increase in enzyme activity, [92,93] stimulation of protein turnover, [94] improvement in DNA-repair systems, [95,96] and **increased mitochondrial biogenesis** [97] and muscle content of heat shock proteins (HSPs). [98,99] In addition, adaptation  positively  affects  remodelling  of skeletal muscle after injury and attenuates inflammation and apoptosis. [88,100,101]. **Moderate levels of reactive species appear necessary for various physiological processes**, whereas, an excessive ROS production causes oxidative damage. This may be described by the concept of hormesis, a dose-response relationship in which a low dose of a substance is stimulatory or beneficial and a high dose is inhibitory or toxic\n(Peternelj et al [(2011)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51780659_Antioxidant_Supplementation_during_Exercise_Training_Beneficial_or_Detrimental))\n\nIt is unclear whether supplemental antioxidants protects effectively against oxidative stress. (Peternelj et al [(2011)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51780659_Antioxidant_Supplementation_during_Exercise_Training_Beneficial_or_Detrimental)) conclude:\n\n> antioxidant supplementation could offer some protection from exercise-induced cell damage, [127,177-181] attenuate the inflammatory response to exercise, [147,151,182-186] and reduce muscle force loss [154,156,177,187] and fatigue. [188-191] Other investigations, however, found no significant effect of antioxidants on indices of cell damage, [111,113,161,192-194] muscle soreness [114,195-199   and inflammation. [111,114,127,169,194,200,201] A number of studies suggested that antioxidant supplementation may promote muscle damage and possibly  hinder  recovery. [165,175,197,202]\n\n\n\n\n\n#Training adaptations and athletic performance\n\n----------------------\n\n##Hypertrophy\n\nThere's very little direct evidence (in vivo) on the effects of antioxidants on hypertrophy in human skeletal muscle. In recent years, some Norwegian universities have focused their efforts on understanding these relationships. Paulsen et al [(2014)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267627879_Vitamin_C_and_E_supplementation_alters_protein_signalling_after_a_strength_training_session_but_not_muscle_growth_during_10_weeks_of_training_Strength_training_and_vitamin_C_and_E_supplementation) determined that a vitamin C+E supplement did not affect hypertrophy in 32 recreationally strength trained participants. A year later, Paulsen co-authored a study by Bjørnsen et al, and they found that \"high-dosage vitamin C and E supplementation blunted [hypertrophy following resistance training] in elderly men\" [(2015)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279714994_Vitamin_C_and_E_supplementation_blunts_increases_in_total_lean_body_mass_in_elderly_men_after_strength_training)\n\nFrom a theoretical standpoint, there is reason to believe hypertrophy may be negatively affected by antioxidant supplementation:\n\n> antioxidant supplementation reduces hypertrophy signalling (namely phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK and p70S6 kinase) and strength gains in muscle following resistance exercise (Makanae et al. 2013; Paulsen et al. 2014b).\n\nMerry et al [(2016)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/JP270654/full).\n\nThese findings are contradictory, and more research needs to be done in regards to hypertrophy. There are also some animal studies showing attenuated hypertrophy but I haven't included them.\n\n\n##Recovery and DOMS\n\nStudies have found that antioxidants do not improve muscle recovery times following exercise (Bailey et al [(2010)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47743521_Oxidative_stress_inflammation_and_recovery_of_muscle_function_after_damaging_exercise_Effect_of_6-week_mixed_antioxidant_supplementation)), and some have even suggested that antioxidants may delay recovery (Teixeira et al [(2009)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26719458_Antioxidants_Do_Not_Prevent_Postexercise_Peroxidation_and_May_Delay_Muscle_Recovery), and Close et al [(2006)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7169565_Ascorbic_acid_supplementation_does_not_attenuate_post-exercise_muscle_soreness_following_muscle-damaging_exercise_but_may_delay_the_recovery_process)).\n\nClose et al observe [(2006)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7169565_Ascorbic_acid_supplementation_does_not_attenuate_post-exercise_muscle_soreness_following_muscle-damaging_exercise_but_may_delay_the_recovery_process):\n\n> There was no significant difference in DOMS between the two groups despite ascorbic acid sup- plementation significantly increasing plasma ascorbate concentrations.  **Ascorbic acid supplementation does not attenuate post-exercise muscle soreness following muscle-damaging exercise but may delay the recovery process** [...] suggesting dissociation between ROS and DOMS\n\n> [...] supplementation  with  ascorbic  acid  to  prevent  post-exercise  ROS  production   does   not   attenuate   DOMS   or   preserve   muscle function, but may hinder the recovery process\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##Strength\n\nAs with hypertrophy, very few in vivo studies have been done on human subjects. Recent studies are done by Norwegian universities.\n\nPaulsen et al found in [(2015)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267627879_Vitamin_C_and_E_supplementation_alters_protein_signalling_after_a_strength_training_session_but_not_muscle_growth_during_10_weeks_of_training_Strength_training_and_vitamin_C_and_E_supplementation) that resistance training \"hampered certain strength increases\" in recreationally strength trained men and women.\n\nSome research suggests antioxidants can interfere with strength recovery following muscle injury:\n\n> Another instance of antioxidant supplementation interfering   with   training   is   when   muscle   injury occurs, such as after intense, unaccustomed,  and especially eccentric exercise. **Vitamins C and E have been   shown   to   delay   healing   and   recovery   of strength,  and  increase  oxidative  stress  after  such muscle-damaging exercise**   (Beaton   et   al.,   2002; Childs  et  al.,  2001;  Close  et  al.,  2006;  Teixeira, Valente, Casal, Marques, & Moreira, 2009)\n\nGross et al [(2011)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232889980_Antioxidant_supplementation_and_endurance_training_Win_or_loss)  \n\n\n##Endurance & VO2max\n\nWhen it comes to endurance training, there are more studies to compare.\nAccording to Gomez-Cabrera et al [(2008)] (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5673945_Oral_administration_of_vitamin_C_decreases_muscle_mitochondrial_biogenesis_and_hampers_training-induced_adaptations_in_endurance_performance_Am_J_Clin_Nutr):\n\n\n> [...] **supplementation with vitamin C lowers training efficiency**. Endurance capacity is directly related to the mitochondrial content. This variable is seriously hampered by antioxidant supplementation, whereas V ̇O2 max [...] is not significantly affected.\n\nThis finding is backed by other studies who found that vitamin C and E hampered or could hamper endurance performance (Paulsen et al [(2014)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260020759_Vitamin_C_and_E_supplementation_hampers_cellular_adaptation_to_endurance_training_in_humans_A_double-blind_randomised_controlled_trial), and Gomez-Cabrera et al [(2008)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5673945_Oral_administration_of_vitamin_C_decreases_muscle_mitochondrial_biogenesis_and_hampers_training-induced_adaptations_in_endurance_performance_Am_J_Clin_Nutr), Morrison et al [(2015)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891584915010813?np=y), Braakhuis et al [(2013)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236249637_Effects_of_dietary_antioxidants_on_training_and_performance_in_female_runners)) and VO2max (Skaug et al [(2014)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259826318_An_antioxidant_and_multivitamin_supplement_reduced_improvements_in_VO_2max), and Sveen et al [(2009)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265297392_Administration_of_an_antioxidant_multi_vitaminmineral_supplement_reduced_training_induced_increases_in_VO2max_in_well_trained_subjects))\n\nOthers found no effect on placebo versus treatment groups (Taghiyar et al [(2013)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236959852_The_Effect_of_Vitamins_C_and_E_Supplementation_on_Muscle_Damage_Performance_and_Body_Composition_in_Athlete_Women_A_Clinical_Trial), Yfanti [(2009)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40696919_Antioxidant_Supplementation_Does_Not_Alter_Endurance_Training_Adaptation), Roberts et al [(2011)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279175093_Vitamin_C_Consumption_Does_Not_Impair_Training-Induced_Improvements_in_Exercise_Performance), and Cholewa et al [(2008)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246523037_The_influence_of_vitamin_C_on_blood_oxidative_stress_parameters_in_basketball_players_in_response_to_maximal_exercise))\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any studies discussing the positive effects of vitamin antioxidants on endurance capacity.\n\nA [2011](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232889980_Antioxidant_supplementation_and_endurance_training_Win_or_loss) literature review found the following:\n> [...] **recent consensus reports from the International Society of Sports  Nutrition**  (Kreider  et  al.,  2004)  **and  the American  College  of  Sports  Medicine**  (Rodriguez, Di  Marco,  &  Langley,  2009)  **do  not  support  the belief   that  ordinary  antioxidant  substances  such as  vitamins  A,  C,  and  E  improve  performance  or delay   fatigue   in   adequately   nourished   athletes.** Similarly,  supplementary  vitamin  C  or  E  does  not have   a   protective   effect   against   muscle   damage (Beaton,  Allan,  Tarnopolsky,  Tiidus,  &  Phillips, 2002;   Childs,   Jacobs,   Kaminski,   Halliwell,   & Leeuwenburgh, 2001; Close et al., 2006; Connolly, Lauzon,  Agnew,  Dunn,  &  Reed,  2006;  McGinley, Shafat, & Donnelly, 2009)\n\nSo, there may be a relationship between how saturated a diet is in antioxidants and how well an athlete responds to supplementation.\n\nSome readers may question whether trained athletes respond differently to supplementation compared to untrained athletes. According to Ristow et al [(2009)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2680430/), they do not:\n\n> most negative effects of antioxidant supplements observed in the current study occur irrespective of previous training status. […] the data do not support the assumption that antioxidant supplement intake is less detrimental in previously trained subjects.\n\n\n\n\n#Other health parameters\n\n----------------------\n\n##Insulin sensitivity\n\nRegular physical exercise has been shown to temporarily increase insulin sensitivity following exercise sessions. Furthermore, there will also be long-term improvements in glucose regulation. According to Merry et al [(2016)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/JP270654/full), Peternelj et al [(2011)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22060178), and Ristow et al [(2009)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2680430/), improvements in post-exercise insulin sensitivity may be hampered by antioxidants.\n\n##DNA damage, cardiovascular disease and cancer\n\n> [...] evidence from clinical studies does not support a protective effect of vitamins C and E or β-carotene against DNA damage or cancer (Valko et al. 2004) or against cardiovascular disease (Myung et al. 2013). Further, it should be noted that under certain circumstances, these antioxidants may become pro-oxidative agents. β-carotene, in the presence of increased partial pressure of oxygen, can be converted into a peroxyl radical, and vitamin C can form DNA-damaging genotoxins from lipid hydroperoxides in the presence of transition metal ions (Valko et al. 2004).\nGross et al [(2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK299059/)\n\nOxidative stress has been shown to inhibit metastasis in mice. Thus, there’s reason to believe that antioxidants that counteract this stress may promote metastasis (Piskounova et al [(2015)]( http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v527/n7577/full/nature15726.html))\n\n\n#N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)\n\n----------------------\n\nNAC is one of the most promising compounds for athletic performance. It has many uses in [clinical medicine](http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-1018-n-acetyl%20cysteine.aspx?activeingredientid=1018).\n\n\nSeveral studies have found that NAC supplementation can improve performance by attenuating fatigue (Cobley et al [(2011)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51803903_N-Acetylcysteine's_Attenuation_of_Fatigue_After_Repeated_Bouts_of_Intermittent_Exercise_Practical_Implications_for_Tournament_Situations), Medved et al [(2004)]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15194675)). There is also agreement in the research review literature (Mason et al [(2016)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891584916000733), Braakhuis et al [(2015)]( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273780200_Impact_of_Dietary_Antioxidants_on_Sport_Performance_A_Review), and Hernández et al [(2012)]( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221702348_Antioxidants_and_Skeletal_Muscle_Performance_Common_Knowledge_vs_Experimental_Evidence))\n\n\nMason et al [(2016)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891584916000733) describe how NAC affects submaximal performance:\n\n> **Intravenous supplementation of NAC in humans has been shown to delay fatigue and maintain higher muscle force/power production during sustained fatiguing low frequency contractions and prolonged submaximal exercise followed by a maximal effort bout** [45], [153], [154] and [162]. Orally-administered NAC enhanced knee extensor endurance performance during repetitive sub-maximal contractions in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [163], **delayed fatigue** during repetitive submaximal isometric hand grip exercise in healthy adults [164] and improved the maintenance of respiratory muscle strength during discontinuous sustained high intensity (85% VO2 max) cycling in health males [165]. In contrast to submaximal exercise, **NAC supplementation does not appear to attenuate fatigue at very high/supra-maximal intensities** [45], [46] and [166]. Corn & Barstow [167] found maintenance of power output and time to fatigue during cycling to be improved at 80% peak power output, but not at 90, 100 or 110% peak power outputs in young males.\n\nSome studies have found that NAC could have negative effects. Childs et al did an experiment in [2001](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11791143_Supplementation_with_vitamin_C_and_N-Acetyl-Cysteine_increases_oxidative_stress_in_humans_after_an_acute_muscle_injury_induced_by_eccentric_exercise) where they gave the treatment group NAC and vitamin C, and found an increase in oxidative stress. However, since the treatment included two supplements, it is uncertain whether NAC alone would cause the same increase.\n\nIn [2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21827635), Petersen et al demonstrated that NAC blocked “the exercise-induced increase in JNK phosphorylation, but not ERK1/2, or p38 MAPK”, suggesting that NAC could attenuate “skeletal muscle cell signalling pathways and gene expression involved in adaptations to exercise”\n\nIf we assume that NAC inhibits chronic adaptations, there’s still evidence suggesting it could be useful temporarily during sports competitions\n\n> NAC supplementation [is good] for performance preservation during demanding short-term (≤ 14-day) athletic events where adaptation is inconsequential. In light of the role of ROS in stimulating adaptive responses, chronic NAC supplementation may be ill advised.\n\nCobley et al [(2011)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51803903_N-Acetylcysteine's_Attenuation_of_Fatigue_After_Repeated_Bouts_of_Intermittent_Exercise_Practical_Implications_for_Tournament_Situations)\n\n\n#When can antioxidant supplementation be useful?\n\n-----------------------\n\n\nThere seems to be a lot of evidence pointing towards vitamin (A, C, E) antioxidant supplementation being ineffective for enhancing athletic performance and recovery. Yet, there are some situations where supplementation could be beneficial to the athlete.\n\nGross et al claim that antioxidants can be helpful in some circumstances, such as in high-altitude training, during competitive events, or when the athlete has been diagnosed as deficient in antioxidant vitamins. [(2011)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232889980_Antioxidant_supplementation_and_endurance_training_Win_or_loss). Braakhuis et al [(2015)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273780200_Impact_of_Dietary_Antioxidants_on_Sport_Performance_A_Review) agree with the benefits of high-altitude training, noting that:\n\n> chronic vitamin E  intake  appears  to  enhance  performance  at  altitude  but  potentially  impairs  performance  at  sea  level\n\nIn regards to deficiency, Peternelj et al [(2011)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51780659_Antioxidant_Supplementation_during_Exercise_Training_Beneficial_or_Detrimental) have warned about restrictive diets. They inform that restricting energy intake or eliminating food groups could lead to inadequate diets lacking in micronutrients – including antioxidants. In that case, supplementation would be advised as a temporary solution under medical supervision.\n\nIn agreement with Peternelj et al, Paschalis et al reported in [(2014)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269820239_Low_vitamin_C_values_are_linked_with_decreased_physical_performance_and_increased_oxidative_stress_reversal_by_vitamin_C_supplementation) that deficient athletes should supplement antioxidants. This is because low vitamin C levels were linked to decreased physical performance and increased inflammation.\n\nPeternelj et al [(2011)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51780659_Antioxidant_Supplementation_during_Exercise_Training_Beneficial_or_Detrimental), summarise:\n\n> **there is insufficient evidence to recommend antioxidant supplements for exercising individuals who consume the recommended amounts of dietary antioxidants through food**. Antioxidant supplements generally do not improve physical performance. There is little proof to support their role in prevention of exercise-induced muscle damage and enhancement of recovery.\n\n\n#Conclusions and practical applications\n\n------------------------------------\n\n\nAntioxidant effects on exercise is a huge and complicated subject. There are no simple answers, but the majority of the experimental studies and systematic reviews trend towards vitamin (A, C, E) antioxidant supplementation being ineffective for enhancing athletic performance and recovery. There is insufficient evidence to make strong claims about strength and hypertrophy. However, looking at the theoretical background for how antioxidants affect our biology, there's little reason to recommend supplementation for healthy, well-nourished athletes. However, antioxidants *may* be recommended if the athlete is deficient, in a high-altitude training camp, or during competitive events. In particular, NAC is a promising compound that has shown itself to be beneficial for temporarily reducing fatigue\n\nI will admit that some of these findings caught me off guard. I've been an avid supplementer of various nutrients for years now. Looking at how often researchers have found no effect or a negative effect, I'm starting to rethink my position. I also consider this in light of my two other research reviews [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ResearchReview/comments/3swkbe/research_review_2_do_multivitamins_improve_health/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/ResearchReview/comments/3t82v8/research_review_21_do_athletes_benefit_from/) which examine the ineffectiveness of multivitamins for normal populations as well as athletes. It seems like there's a lot of money to be saved when it comes to vitamin/mineral supplementation. For now, the advice of optimising micronutrient intakes via a carefully planned diet seems to be safest option (with some notable exceptions!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "Nice review, well done. I'll have a read of your other ones soon. Are you involved in research currently? Or do you just have a passion for this kind of thing.\n\nAs one other user wrote, it might be good to discuss polyphenols as antioxidants, especially as they can have extra effects such as modulating fat oxidation (I'm thinking of catechins mainly).\n\nOne thing I gathered from this review is how NAC has some potential to be beneficial for endurance performance. How important do you think NAC might be, considering the varied findings (and the applicability of, e.g. maximal hand grip), to real world exercise? \n\n[edit: this next bit is by no means a criticism. I think you've done a great job. But I just want to hear your thoughts and spark a little discussion :) ]\n\nI imagine there will be people in this sub that would potentially benefit more from polishing up their training schedules (I'm going to ignore people training for hypertrophy, seeing as the weight of the evidence seems to be in endurance), which arguably is *the* most important factor when it comes to success. \n\nAnother place to look would for someone aiming to improve would be to play around with things such as mid exercise feedings and strategies that we know work. Even making sure people do something as simple as having a pre exercise meal. Whilst the evidence for this is nothing new, in my (albeit limited) experience, people are simply not aware of these techniques or do not know how to implement them properly. With athletes especially, there are some who perhaps don't *really* value nutrition as well as they should, and even neglect simple things like hydration.\n\nThus, discussing the efficacy of antioxidants is perhaps a bit confusing. (Although, I guess I am assuming that you are targeting the review at people who exercise, rather than for people who are generally interested, such as myself, which is perhaps incorrect of me.)",

The page I'm linking are reviews from people who recommend the products that they're reviewing, I believe.\n\nPeople always ask what the % is, but Japanese companies typically do not disclose this information. I think I read a while ago that the max that can be used in cosmetics is 2% in Japan, but don't quote me on that. I may have found that info on Ratzillacosme's blog, but I can no longer find it. Taiwan's max is 3% I believe, but don't quote me on that either. :P",

I'd looked at Hada Labo's Shirojyun Premium Lotion, but was concerned that I couldn't find any good estimates of the % in it. (I've also used the Skinlex Alpha Arbutin Serum you listed, but I also assumed the tranexamic acid in it was too low to have much more than an incidental effect so it wasn't the reason I bought the serum. Like I was happy it was in there instead of some other random ingredient, but wasn't expecting much from it.)",

This is the ONLY brightening serum I’ve tried that lightened my acne spots in a matter of 2-3 months rather than 1.5-2 years. I just finished my 3rd bottle last night, lol. Tryyying to go on a no buy for all of May, but if I start breaking out into new zits, I will 100% buy this to take care of the hyperpigmentation.\n\nI went through 1.5 bottles of the Inkey List Tranex Serum and saw zero results. My acne marks showed absolutely no change over the few months that I was using this. Then I went back to the Good Molecules, boom 2 weeks and the spots were basically gone. Also the texture of the Good Molecules is slightly thinner, and doesn’t make my moisturizer pill the way the Inkey List does.\n\nEdit: Another product with TXA is the Murad Replenishing Multi-Acid Peel. It’s a biphase acid toner with tranexamic, salicylic, glycolic, lactic, and malic acids. I don’t believe they disclose the % of any of the acids.\n\nEdit #2: I just saw your reasoning for not including the Murad on the list!",

However the Inkey List one sometimes causes my moisturizer to pill, which is annoying. I only use it at night, so it's less of an issue I guess!\n\nI was wavering between this one and the Good Molecules tranex serum. I'm betting (hoping) the Good Molecules formula has at least 2-3% tranexamic acid and probably 5% niacinamide. I'm also interested in the JJLabs formulas. A youtuber I follow knows the founder/chemist behind the brand and swears by some of his products, so I do think they are legit. I figure it's kind of like going to a compounding pharmacy to get a specific drug combination custom formulated for you, but instead it's skincare. I agree it's unusual.\n\nMy questions about tranexamic acid that I can't seem to find much on are the side effects - I was really worried if this would cause irritation because I'm sensitive to most acids (bha, aha, even ascorbic acid), so I didn't know if this would be something like hyaluronic acid or more like an exfoliating acid.

    "body": "# Chapter 2: How to Introduce Yourself\n\nOdds are, your facility is not on the planet you currently call home. That’s perfectly normal. MultiVer Medical Solutions selects its administrators not only for their medical acumen but for their adaptability, cultural sensitivity, and leadership under pressure. You are not just relocating your office—you are stepping into an ecosystem, a legacy, and sometimes a wound that has never healed.\n\nYou will not be expected merely to adapt to a new hospital. You will be adapting to a new environment, a new culture, and quite often, a new species—often several. Expect language barriers, sensory discomfort, and differing standards of hygiene, punctuality, and definitely eye contact. These are no mere obstacles, these are your training grounds.\n\nWhen I first arrived at the Ipsomath Facility, I was met with suspicion, resistance, and outright hostility. The receptionist told me I had no business being there when we first met. The staff literally threw things at me when I introduced myself. The Magistrate hadn’t ever set foot in the building. No one wanted me there, and few even wanted to be there themselves.\n\nAnd yet, that receptionist wound up my right-hand-woman at the Center. Many of those staff who threw things at me became some of my most efficient employees. The Magistrate would become one of my dearest and closest friends to this day. \n\nNone of this would have been if I didn’t remember this:\n\nYou can’t win hearts on day one. You can’t even assert control on day one.  All you can do is keep a calm, clear head. All else will eventually follow.\n\nThe most important thing to remember in this job is that even though the facility you’re entering was once a Predator Disease institution, and even if its methodologies were flawed, barbaric, or outright moronic, the people who work there have been surviving in an impossible system. They’ve adapted to it. They may even believe in it. But they are not fools.\n\nIgnore their knowledge at your own peril.\n\nYou are an outsider. Many may see you as an intruder. Accept this. Embrace it. You have not been brought in to make friends—you have been brought in to make change. But here’s the paradox: change never happens without trust.\n\nEvery facility is different. This book can only prepare you for so much. What I can recommend—what saved me in Ipsomath—is this: find the staff member who knows the facility like the back of their paw (or hand, or appendage), but who is just disillusioned enough to entertain a different way of doing things.\n\nThey’re your bridge.\n\nThey may not greet you with warmth. They may not even like you. But if they respect you, and you listen to them, they will give you the map you need.\n\nStart by observing. Spend your first days walking the halls. Speak to everyone. Ask questions, not just about processes but about people. Who do the nurses trust? Who do the patients avoid? Who fixes things when they break? Who really runs the place?\n\nAbove all, remember: authority is not a badge you wear. It is a presence you earn, and it is earned hard.\n\nAnd it all starts with how you introduce yourself.\n\n# Ten Years Earlier…\n\n***Ipsomath Center for Physical and Mental Health, Ipsomath, Skalga***\n\n***January 11th, 2138***\n\nLusi stood rigid behind the reception desk, her fur prickling with unease. The human had gone outside to make a call, but the weight of his presence still lingered like a smell that wouldn’t leave. She rubbed her paws together beneath the desk, hoping it would hide the tremble.\n\nShe looked over at the Magister, her sister-in-law, who had taken a seat in one of the cracked lobby chairs as if everything was perfectly normal.\n\n“Shalon,” Lusi said in a low voice, “what’s going on? Why is a human saying he’s in charge of this facility?”\n\nShalon’s ears tilted slightly— not in irritation, but fatigue. “<Guilt> Because we sold it.”\n\nLusi’s tail gave a startled twitch. “<Shock> You what?”\n\n“We stopped getting subsidies when we changed the name,” Shalon said, voice hushed. “No more credits from Dayside, no more outside help, everything was out of the town’s purse. It was draining the town’s budget, and we couldn’t afford to keep it running. I offered to sell it to MultiVer Medical, and they bought it outright. The money from the sale will help stabilize our finances— for now. I just… didn’t expect them to come and manage it themselves.”\n\nLusi shook her head. “You should have just shut it down. When the Governor’s order came through, you could have just complied and saved everyone a lot of headaches.”\n\nShalon looked at her then, truly looked, her eyes heavy with something that wasn’t quite anger or sadness—just weight. “I couldn’t.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“Because Director Kobya threatened to open the gates,” Shalon whispered.\n\nLusi froze. “He what?”\n\n“He said if I tried to shut the place down, he’d release the patients into the town. Especially those with violent histories. He even said he’d let them take ‘souvenirs’ from the armory. And I believed he would.” Shalon’s paws clenched on her knees. “He had control over the whole operation, and no one outside Ipsomath knew or cared enough to intervene.”\n\nLusi felt her mouth go dry.\n\n“And besides,” Shalon went on, “you shut this place down and it’s not just the staff that suffer. Each job here supports at least two others—spouses, pups, parents. You shut this place down suddenly, and who knows how many go hungry. I had no good options. Only with Kobya dead could I finally do something. This… this sale was the best I could do.”\n\nLusi sat back, stunned. She hadn’t known, hadn’t even guessed. How could she? She was never one for politics.\n\nShe glanced toward the front doors, where the human had stepped outside. He stood there now, speaking calmly into a device, silhouetted against the eternal daylight. He looked alien. Unfitting. But now, maybe, not unwelcome.\n\n“…What’s he going to do with this place?” she asked, softly.\n\nShalon exhaled. “That, Lusi, is the question.” \n\nAnd with that, the Magister made her excuses and left.\n\nWhen the human stepped back into the lobby, Lusi didn’t feel like being hostile.\n\nShe looked up from her console where she had been pretending to scrutinize something the human couldn’t see, her ears instinctively angled in caution, but she no longer bristled. The anxiety hadn’t gone, exactly— it had just settled into something quieter, something resigned. Shalon had explained everything, or at least enough. Lusi wasn’t sure how she felt about it, not yet. But it wasn’t this man’s fault.\n\nShe drew a breath. “My apologies, Dr. Broughton,” she said, trying to keep her voice level. “I’m Lusi. Sorry about my earlier behavior.”\n\nThe human tilted his head, no doubt making that terrifying expression humans called a ‘smile’ beneath it. “I understand. It’s nice to meet you, Lucy.”\n\nLusi’s ear twitched <Discomfort> at the mispronunciation, but she let it go. It was unlikely that he could properly pronounce her name, anyway.\n\n“If you’re willing to work with a human,” he added, with a touch of awkward warmth, “I’d be happy to work with you. You must know everything there is to know about this place by now.”\n\nShe gave him a long look, narrowing her eyes slightly—not out of hostility, but curiosity. Testing him. Was he just trying to charm her? Or was he actually going to listen?\n\n“I know flattery when I hear it,” she said flatly. Then, after a pause and a reluctant flick of her tail, “Even if it’s working.”\n\nHe laughed, and she hated that it didn’t grate on her. “Fair enough. How long have you been here?”\n\n“Longer than most of the staff. Long enough to know the bones of this place.” Her voice turned colder for just a moment. “Doesn’t mean I liked how things were run.”\n\nThe human jerked his head in a ‘nod.’ “That’s good to hear,” he said, standing a little straighter. “Because I’m here to make changes. And I’m going to need people who know the system and aren’t afraid to speak honestly.”\n\nLusi studied him again. She didn’t trust him yet—not fully. But there was something in his tone of voice, something quietly determined, that made her want to.\n\nShe nodded, slow and deliberate, and moved around the desk. “Then I guess we’ll see how this goes.”\n\nLusi gestured toward the hallway that led deeper into the facility.. “Come on. I’ll give you the tour. Might as well get it over with before the staff starts making up rumors.”\n\nChuck gave a polite nod and fell into step beside her.\n\nThey walked in silence for a few paces before Lusi glanced sideways at him. The silvery mask he wore covered his face, leaving only his jet-black hair exposed. Dayside might call it polite or even necessary, but to Lusi? It looked evasive.\n\nShe stopped in front of the first hallway junction and crossed her arms.\n\n“Before we go any further,” she said, “you should probably take that thing off.”\n\nChuck blinked. “The mask?”\n\n“Yeah.” Her ears flicked. “We don’t let the staff cover their faces. Part of a policy meant to prevent escape attempts. Staff need to see who they’re dealing with. The patients do, too.”\n\nHe hesitated. She could see it clearly—shoulders tensing, his gaze shifting away for a moment. Maybe it was fear. Maybe it was insecurity. Maybe he was just used to hiding.\n\nLusi lifted a brow. “Look, you want them to take you seriously? You can’t expect them to be transparent if you’re not.”\n\nChuck let out a slow breath, then reached up and peeled the mask down from his face.\n\nLusi couldn’t help it—she nearly whistled. Not because of how he looked—he was oddly symmetrical, with a strong jaw and expressive eyebrows—but because of how completely unprepared the staff were going to be for this.\n\n*Oh, this is going to be great*, she thought, hardly able to control her tail. *I cannot wait to see the look on Laov’s face*.\n\nShe started walking again, tail swaying with just a little more bounce.\n\n“Alright then, Dr. Broughton,” she said with an amused edge to her voice, “let’s go ruin someone’s paw.”\n\nLusi tapped a few commands into her datapad as they moved through the main corridor, her tone casual as she activated the facility-wide intercom. “Staff, please report to Meeting Room A for an urgent administrative briefing. Five minutes.”\n\nThe effect was almost immediate. Medical aides, technicians, and guards exchanged glances, then began peeling off the main floor in orderly, practiced silence. Within moments, the halls were nearly empty, leaving behind only the hum of ventilation and the faint buzz of flickering overhead lights.\n\nChuck’s eyes scanned the corridor as they walked. The walls were sterile metal and faded plastic, stained with years of disinfectant and bureaucracy. Heavy doors lined each hallway, with reinforced viewing slits and locking mechanisms that looked better suited to a prison than a hospital. Cameras blinked quietly from the corners, and everywhere, there was a sense of barely restrained tension—as if the building itself were holding its breath.\n\nHe exhaled softly. “This place is somewhere between a 1950s asylum and Alcatraz.”\n\nLusi gave him a sideways glance. “I’m assuming, based on your tone, that neither of those are compliments.”\n\nChuck shook his head. “No. They’re both places people ended up when the world didn’t know how to help them. Or didn’t care to.”\n\nLusi’s expression didn’t change, but something in her posture shifted. She slowed her pace slightly, her tail lowering just a touch. “Sounds familiar.”\n\nThey turned a corner, passing what looked like a physical therapy room that hadn’t been used in years. Dust clung to the equipment, and the overhead lights flickered dimly as they walked past. Chuck stared through the glass for a moment.\n\n“You said you’ve been here longer than most,” he said. “Have things always been like this?”\n\nLusi gave a dry huff. “Define ‘this.’”\n\nHe glanced at her. “Worn down. Angry. Tired.”\n\nShe didn’t answer right away. Then, with a flick of her ears: “Not sure. But long enough that most people stopped asking when it changed.”\n\nChuck nodded, silent for a moment.\n\nThen he straightened his shoulders. “Well, that’s why I’m here. Not to plaster over what’s broken. To rebuild.”\n\nLusi didn’t respond, but her ears twitched again, not with skepticism— but still with curiosity. Maybe, just maybe, the human meant it.\n\nThey continued down the corridor toward the meeting room.\n\nThe tour was brief, but it felt like a descent.\n\nLusi led Chuck through an empty patient housing unit first. Rows of tiny, cell-like rooms lined each hallway, each with several narrow metal beds bolted to the floor and a threadbare blanket. There were no personal belongings, no decorations. Just walls, vents, and steel.\n\n“These are the residential wings,” she said, gesturing down the corridor. “Most rooms hold two to four patients.”\n\nChuck peered into one of the rooms. “No privacy.”\n\n“No locks either,” she said. “On the inside, anyway.”\n\nHe didn’t comment, but the silence was telling.\n\nNext was the recreation area, though the name felt deeply misleading. A barren room with plastic benches, no books, no games, and a small holoscreen mounted high out of reach. The walls had gouges in them— old ones. Lusi didn’t need to explain what caused them.\n\nFinally, they reached the treatment wing. It was the cleanest part of the facility, but that didn’t help much. The antiseptic taste was sharp, clinging to the air like guilt. Restraint beds, outdated neural monitors, and sedation equipment lined the walls.\n\nChuck finally broke the silence. “I’ve visited Alcatraz, back on Earth. At least their inmates had hot showers and cots.”\n\nLusi glanced at him. “That bad, huh?”\n\nHe didn’t respond, just ran a hand down his face and exhaled. Not surprised. That was worse, somehow.\n\nAs they walked, Lusi continued, “Patients are given meals twice a day. No proteins, no sugars. Mostly foods made from ipsom. Kobya had a theory that sugar causes hyperactivity and violent tendencies, so he stripped it from the diet entirely.”\n\nChuck came to a full stop. “Wait. No fruit? No root vegetables? No leafy greens? Just grains?”\n\nLusi blinked. “Yes, usually boiled and mashed to avoid possible choking. Why?”\n\n“Have you ever had issues with scurvy?” he asked.\n\nShe frowned. “I don’t even know what that is.”\n\nChuck turned toward her. “It’s a condition caused by a prolonged deficiency in Vitamin C. In humans, it leads to fatigue, joint pain, anemia, swelling, bruising, and—most notably—bleeding gums and soft tissue damage. In the final stages, the body just... stops repairing itself.”\n\nLusi stared at him, stunned. “You’re telling me the weakness? The bleeding gums? That was from a lack of nutrition?”\n\n“Yes,” Chuck said sharply. “And you saw those symptoms?”\n\n“Well, yes,” she admitted. “Kobya used to say it was a sign the diet was working. That they were detoxing from a lifetime of sugar addiction. And when a couple of them died… he said it was coincidental.”\n\nChuck’s teeth gritted, his composure slipping just enough for the strain to show. “That’s not just cruel. That’s *stupid.* Malicious stupidity. These people would have been in agony. Dying in pain. And he thought that meant he was right?”\n\nChuck almost missed the sound of his voice echoing in the empty corridor, sharp and angry.\n\nLusi stepped back slightly, not in fear, but in acknowledgment. She hadn’t liked Kobya either—To be honest, no one did– but she hadn’t realized how deep the rot went.\n\n“Is it hard to treat?” she asked, her voice quiet.\n\nChuck let out a stunned laugh—half incredulous, half bitter. “No. Not even a little. In humans, you just give them Vitamin C—citrus, bell peppers, supplements, anything rich in ascorbic acid. Within one to three days, symptoms start improving. Within a month or two, full recovery. That’s it.”\n\nHe looked around, jaw set. “And it all could’ve been prevented with a few bottles of grapefruit juice.”\n\nLusi didn’t know what grapefruits were, but she understood the implication. She’d known this place was bad—but not how deep the damage went. Humans really seemed to have knowledge denied to the Federation. \n\n*And she owed Snuba an apology…*\n\nAnd now this human, this Chuck Broughton, was pacing these halls with fresh eyes and fire in his chest. Maybe he really *was* going to ruin someone’s paw.\n\n*Good.*\n\nThe staff wing was only marginally better than the patient quarters, and Lusi hated that she was used to it. Narrow bunks, shared showers, chipped lockers—it had been Kobya’s philosophy that comfort bred complacency, and so the staff lived just a half-step above those they cared for. Chuck didn’t comment as they walked through it, but she could feel the disapproval radiating off him like heat, though not at the point that he felt the need to vocalize it.\n\nWhen they reached the meeting room, Lusi keyed open the double doors and gestured him through. The auditorium was dim and stuffy, designed more for control than comfort—cheap tiered seats, a battered projector hanging from the ceiling, and that ever-present hum from the faulty ventilation system. Nearly fifty staff members sat scattered throughout the room, murmuring and fidgeting, clearly unsure why they’d been summoned.\n\nChuck paused in the wings and pulled the silvery mask over his face again. Lusi gave him a look but said nothing. She knew he wasn’t hiding out of fear. He was preparing.\n\nHe climbed the steps to the stage and stepped into the overhead lights.\n\n“My name is Dr. Charles Broughton,” he said, clear and calm. “I’m the new administrator of this facility.”\n\nDead silence.\n\nThen, with a flutter and a *thud*, one of the Krakotl nurses dropped like a sack of feathers to the floor. Laov, obviously. A few of his coworkers rushed to help him, but most just stared, eyes wide, ears frozen.\n\nLusi felt her fur stand on end—not because of Chuck, but because of the quiet. She’d never seen the staff this still. This tense. For a moment, she wondered if there would be a stampede.\n\n“I know my presence here is a surprise,” Chuck continued. “Humans on Skalga are still a new sight. But we’ve brought change with us. And I believe that change can happen here, too.”\n\nHe looked out over the crowd, meeting eyes where he couldn’t avoid it.\n\n“I’m not here to take anyone’s job. I’m here to help—to fix what’s broken. For the patients, and for all of you. I know this facility hasn’t had the resources or support it needed, and that the people here have been doing the best they could in a system built to fail. But that changes today.”\n\nLusi blinked, startled by how steady his voice was. She saw ears perk up, a few eyes brighten. For some of the staff, this wasn’t just another speech—it was hope. They didn’t work here to warehouse people. They worked here because they’d wanted to help. And even if they were uneasy, even if they’d given up believing in change, someone saying *we can fix this*? That meant something.\n\nBut others didn’t take it so well.\n\nGrumbles rose. A sneer from the upper rows. Then came the first projectile—a rolled-up intake form that bounced off the lip of the stage.\n\nChuck didn’t flinch.\n\nAnother came. A crushed drink pouch. A pen. A glove. One by one, bits of harmless defiance rained down with all the fury of a brisk gust of wind. Lusi winced but didn’t move to stop it. She knew better. Let them get it out of their system.\n\nChuck raised his voice just slightly. “A team from MultiVer Medical Solutions will be arriving soon. They’ll be helping me evaluate the facility for upgrades and assess which staff members are best suited for retraining. No one’s being thrown out without cause. Only those who are active dangers to patients or staff will be removed.”\n\n*Thwack.*\n\nA roll of medical tape smacked against his mask, sticking there for an absurd moment before dropping to the floor. A lucky hit.\n\nChuck looked down at it, then back at the crowd.\n\n“That wasn’t at all a danger,” he said, dry as sand. “So it doesn’t count.”\n\nLusi couldn’t help it—she whistled.\n\nIt was the first time in a while she’d wanted to laugh.\n\nThe absurd little moment broke something in the room. A few choked noises turned into laughter of various kinds. Not cruel, not mocking. Just… relieved.\n\nLusi caught a Gojid nurse covering her snout with both claws to stifle a chuff. Even Snuba, the sour-faced Farsul janitor who was standing in the back, couldn’t contain his tail. For the first time since the meeting started, the tension began to bleed out of the air.\n\nChuck waited for the noise to settle before continuing. His tone remained steady, but the edge had softened—less like a stranger delivering a verdict, more like a leader sharing a mission.\n\n“I want to be clear about my goals,” he said. “There are three major targets for this facility, and they’ll guide every change we make from this point forward.”\n\nHe held up a finger.\n\n“Target One: Modern treatment. Effective, humane, and science-backed mental healthcare. I will be replacing outdated Federation philosophies with contemporary human psychological and physiology models—based on research and results.”\n\nLusi watched a few of the more rigid staff members shift uncomfortably. But then Chuck added:\n\n“For example—most of you probably don’t know this, but the current patient diet has led to multiple cases of scurvy. In humans, that’s a vitamin deficiency that causes internal bleeding, extreme fatigue, and eventually death. Kobya thought it meant the diet was working.”\n\nThere was a ripple of shock through the room. Gasps. Ears flattening. Feathers puffing. Even the staunchest old-guard staff—those who used to defend Kobya with gritted teeth—looked horrified.\n\n“That’s not treatment,” Chuck said. “That’s cruelty. And stupidity. And it ends now.”\n\nHe let that sit before raising another finger.\n\n“Target Two: Quality of life. For patients and staff. That means upgrades to living quarters, proper food, medical access, training, and mental health support for the people working here. You’ve been surviving. That’s not enough. I want you to live like you matter—because you do.”\n\nThis time, he got no argument. Just quiet nods. Lusi watched the way a few of her colleagues straightened in their seats. Hope was creeping in again.\n\nChuck lifted a third finger.\n\n“Target Three: Public service. This facility may always have long-term residents, but it should also serve the town of Ipsomath. My goal is to eventually open our doors to the public. I want this place to become a real hospital. A place people go when they need help, not a place they’re sent to be forgotten.”\n\nA hush followed that. Not the cold kind, but thoughtful. Almost reverent.\n\nLusi glanced at Chuck and saw the resolve in his posture—the way he stood tall despite being the only human in the room. Despite being pelted with garbage. Despite everything.\n\nShe had to admit it: the speh-head had guts. And maybe—just maybe—he had a chance.\n\nChuck let the quiet stretch for a moment after his final statement. He scanned the crowd slowly, making sure his words had time to settle.\n\n“I understand,” he said, voice softer now, “if any of you are uncomfortable working with—or under—a human. You didn’t ask for this. None of you did. So I’ll make this clear: if you wish to leave, you may do so. No retaliation. No judgment.”\n\nA long pause. Not a single soul moved.\n\nLusi watched the staff with interest. Not even the skeptics in the back had budged a \\[centimeter.\\] She wasn’t sure if it was curiosity, pride, or sheer stubbornness, but something had rooted them all to their seats.\n\nChuck seemed taken aback, clearly surprised for once. “Alright,” he said, clearing his throat. “You’ll have two days to think it over. I’ll accept any resignations between now and then. No rush.”\n\nAs the room began to murmur again, he stepped down from the stage and made his way to the exit with Lusi beside him.\n\nThey made their way through the now-quiet halls to the administrative wing, where Kobya’s old office still sat behind a rusted security door. Lusi keyed them in.\n\nThe room was exactly what she remembered—bare metal walls, a filing cabinet that rattled when you touched it, a desk with sharp corners and no personal touches. Spartan. Lifeless. The kind of place built for someone who wanted to impose control, not leadership.\n\nChuck walked in and gave the place a long look. “He decorated this place like a prison warden.”\n\nLusi whistled with laughter. “Again, doesn’t sound like a compliment.”\n\nChuck unrolled his holocomputer and started setting up at the desk. As he calibrated the interface and took off his mask, he glanced at her. “I’m honestly surprised no one walked out.”\n\nLusi leaned on the doorframe. “You had the mask on. That helped. And…” Her tail flicked. “<Resignation> Anything’s better than Kobya. You could’ve been an Arxur and they might have considered at least *listening*.”\n\nChuck chuckled under his breath, then sat up straighter as his holocomputer chimed with an incoming call.\n\n“Dr. Broughton?” came a smooth, polite voice through the speakers: Priscilla La Blanc, Mr. Veir’s secretary. “Mr. Veir is currently in a meeting, but he wanted me to pass along something we think you’ll want to know.”\n\nChuck’s expression sharpened. “Go ahead.”\n\n“Well,” she continued, “a contact of ours within the exterminator guild confirmed what we’ve suspected. The Ipsomath facility… it has a reputation. It’s where they send ‘problem employees.’”\n\nLusi’s ears perked up. She folded her arms, watching Chuck closely.\n\n“Because of the remote location and the lack of funding,” the voice continued, “it became convenient for higher-ups to transfer staff here—especially those they saw as threats to their own positions. If someone started asking too many questions, or pushing for reforms, or was just annoying, and they couldn’t find anything to fire or diagnose them for, they were quietly reassigned here, with the expectation, of course, that they would either resign, or work far away from those who felt threatened by them.”\n\nChuck let out a soft exhale. “That… actually explains a lot. No wonder some of them seemed ready to hear new ideas. Only the ones who really wanted to help stuck it out.”\n\n“There’s more,” the secretary added. “Kobya, the former administrator? He was transferred here after an incident at his former job with the Melody Town Exterminators’ Guild. Whatever he did, the incident report’s buried in enough red tape to strangle an elephant, so naturally, you’ll have it in your inbox by the end of the paw.”\n\nChuck raised an eyebrow. “How?”\n\n“Imported mangoes and imitation fried chicken,” the secretary said flatly. “Procuring them wasn’t easy… or cheap… but at least our contact is the happiest Krakotl on Skalga.”\n\nChuck laughed once, in disbelief more than amusement. “You’re incredible, Patty.”\n\n“Thank you, Chuck, I try,” the secretary said, cheerfully professional. \n\nThe call ended.\n\nLusi leaned against the edge of the doorframe, arms crossed tighter now. She frowned, not at Chuck, but at the implications of what they'd just heard.\n\n“So we’re working with a staff full of people who got in the way,” she said quietly. “People someone else wanted gone.”\n\nChuck glanced up from his holoscreen, his expression unreadable for a second. Then he smiled—one of those calm, infuriatingly confident smiles she was quickly learning to recognize.\n\n“Then we’ve already got the perfect staff for a revolution. An entire staff made up of people who questioned the Federation or were good enough at their jobs to be a threat? A potter couldn’t ask for finer \\[porous dirt\\].”\n\nLusi blinked. “A what?”\n\n“A potter,” Chuck repeated, still smiling as he tapped through a diagnostic menu. “Someone who makes things out of \\[porous dirt\\]. Cups, bowls, vases. Sometimes sculptures. The better the clay, the better the result.”\n\n“Huh.” She pursed her lips, her tail flicking. “We don’t… make things out of dirt in Ipsomath. Usually if something’s got that texture, you’re not supposed to eat out of it.” \n\nChuck huffed a bit, even as he smiled. “No idea why art is considered something for the elites on other planets. I can hardly comprehend living a life without creating *something*.”\n\nShe leaned a little farther into the room, watching him as he started configuring local records access.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, he added, almost casually, “Do you have any connections I should be aware of? Anything that might come back to bite us later?”\n\nLusi, surprised by the figure of speech despite understanding the meaning, hesitated, then gave a small shrug. “I used to be married to the Magister’s brother. We met at school, we were dating one Night and married the next. We split up a few years back. Amicably. Realized we were better off as friends. He joined the Space Fleet and got stationed off-world. We don’t really talk much now.”\n\nChuck raised his eyebrows slightly. “I thought you seemed pretty friendly with the Magister.”\n\nHer ears flicked up in surprise, then back in quiet embarrassment. “You… heard that?”\n\n“Hard not to,” he said. “I walked back in and you were talking about my predecessor. I just decided not to make my presence known. You two talk like family.”\n\nLusi sighed. “We still are, kind of. Shalon didn’t pick sides when things ended, and she’s really all the family I have left. And I guess… after everything with the facility, she didn’t have anyone else she trusted.”\n\nChuck nodded, then leaned back in the stiff old chair, folding his hands behind his head.\n\n“Well, I like that. Loyalty without pettiness. It’s a rare thing to find.”\n\nLusi didn’t say anything at first, but her gaze softened slightly.\n\nShe hadn’t expected to like him. But here she was, still standing in the Director’s office, and—for the first time since she started working at the facility—not regretting it.\n\n\\-\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1jpb3fy)\\-[Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1kcsdmm/how_to_fix_a_predator_disease_facility_3/)",

    "body": "Yall, I get sad when I see some of these hopeless posts. It’s important to empower ourselves, not beat ourselves down. I really hate my scars (no duh. lol!) but I also begrudgingly accept that they have made me a stronger person. \n\nSome pearls of wisdom I would like to share, most based on my own research & I do hope others contribute to this thread by sharing their own pearls with the community! Sharing is caring \n\n1. If the UV index is above* 0, you should wear a hat: Not only do hats greatly diminish the appearance of your scars but it also protects your hair, scalp and skin. Plus UV exposure is horrible for your hair (tons of research on this)\n\n2. Even if the UV index is 0, you should be using SPF. Tinted SPF has been shown to be more effective versus untinted SPF. I use elta MD spf, their products have so many bomb ingredients  lol.  If you suffer from PIH, not applying SPF can make your PIH worse. \n\n3. Get on a prescription retinol and use it every night. Aklief is the newest generation, so if you have the budget, I’d recommend it. \n\n4. Consume vitamin C daily in your diet & apply vitamin C topically in the AM. Most research studies on oral vitamin c and skin health have used 500-1000mg oral consumption of vitamin c daily (yes this is higher than the RDA). Not only does vit C prevent collagen breakdown (lots of high quality research on this) but topical vitamin C also has been shown in some studies to complement acne scarring treatments like laser. Ideally, you want to be consuming vit c orally and applying vit c topically in the AM. Good sources: citrus, berries, green veggies! Can consider a supplement too. I knew a model with glowing amazing skin, she swore by a very high dose of oral vitamin c daily (higher than the daily upper limit which is 2000mg - do not recommend - but I found that to be interesting)\n\nIf you wish to supplement, consider L-Ascorbic Acid or Ester-C. \n\nL-Ascorbic acid: most active form of vitamin C + super effective in collagen synthesis + antioxidant functions. It’s the most researched form for skin health.\n\nEster-C (Calcium Ascorbate): less acidic, good option if you have digestive sensitivity. It's more bioavailable & stays in the body longer than L-Ascorbic.\n\n5. Boost blood circulation to your face: exercise & facial massage. Exercise, specifically heavy weight lifting, has been shown to stimulate fibroblast cells & collagen production. Facial massage has also been shown to stimulate collagen. \n\n6. Be kind to your mind. Positive self talk is the best way to cope effectively and therefore do something productive about your acne scarring. \n\n7. Practice daily Graditudes. The best thing I did for myself was taking the time to write down the things I’m grateful for everyday. I think it’s so easy to focus on the negative, and it doesn’t really attract more abundance into our lives. Just having access to clean water, not living in chronic pain, these are things that should be celebrated. A TON of research on gratitude and physical health. Practicing daily graditude will make #6 happen a lot more naturally. It won’t happen overnight, but if you do it consistently for a month, you’ll notice a huge difference in the way you see the world. \n\n8. Challenge yourself and do hard things. It will develop your self confidence and also keep your mind off your scarring.\n\n9. Keep processed sugar, alcohol, smoking to a minimum. All have been shown to degrade collagen and accelerate aging. \n\n10. Please do your own research on acne scars and the skin. I’m talking scholarly material.  You will empower yourself with knowledge and providers will be less likely to take advantage of you. \n\n11. Consider consuming hydrolyzed collagen. I was skeptical but there’s enough research that has made me a believer. Though keep in mind collagen supplements should not substitute any other items on this list.  \n\n12. Consider red light therapy. I personally don’t think it  will help with your scars but red light therapy has been shown to increase the production of collagen and improve skin tone \n\n13. Prioritize sleep!! Inefficient or poor sleep is linked to impaired skin quality \n\n14. Also prioritize hydration :)  not drinking enough water will make your skin dehydrated and it will affect how you feel and your overall appearance \n\n15. When you wash your face, spend at least 60 seconds lathering your face with your cleanser. Another game changer for me. I noticed actives (like retinol) absorb so much better when I did this. \n\n16. I only wash my face at night based on following some Derms etc not sure if there’s research on this 😂\n\n17. Do kind things for others. When we focus on others, again, we are focusing less on ourselves and our woes. Plus it just feels good. \n\n18. Also embrace humour. I’ve learned to see things a lot less seriously and it has helped tremendously at times! \n\n19. Consider experimenting with your diet. Over 80% of the world is lactose intolerant (including me, whee!). If you’re European, you’re likely in the 20%. But for the 80% who are lactose intolerant, not only will consuming dairy give you acne/skin troubles, it will also make you just feel crappy because you’re introducing inflammation in your body by consuming something your body literally cannot process. Oh how I wish I stopped consuming dairy when I was dealing with all that cystic acne. I just loved cheese and ice cream too much LOL. Not only is eating inflammatory foods crap for your physiology but I honestly think it will affect mental too with brain fog/feeling ick etc \n\n20. Introduce fermented foods in your daily diet (kimchi, tempeh, kombucha, etc!). Fermented food have been shown to brighten skin tone and contain strands of prebiotic bacteria that prevent collagen breakdown\n\n21. Never buy a package of treatments from a provider, always purchase a single treatment at a time. Providers have a lot less incentive to provide you results if you’re paying upfront for several sessions. Let them earn your hard earned money. ❤️\n\n22. Listen to uplifting music and positive psychology related podcasts. Upbeat music has been shown to positively affect your mood :)  \n\n23. Keep your actives in a fridge (vitamin c, retinol, etc)! Keeping your topical vitamin c in the fridge will keep it stabilized, keeping your retinol in the fridge will maintain potency :) \n\n24. Consider aha/bha masks 1-2x a week (I have started doing this v recently). Aha/bha masks can improve skin texture over time and help reduce signs of skin aging. \n\n25. If you live in USA or Canada (Idk about other continents), the supplement industry is HIGHLY unregulated. I recommend choosing a supplement brand with 3rd party testing for your oral supplements. \n\n26. Consider an omega 3 supplement. Omega 3 has been shown to reduce acne, slow skin aging,  improve skin hydration and even reduce the skins sensitivity to UV radiation \n\nPS I made a telegram group if anyone would like to join, especially those who have been doing treatments (where yall at?). It’s not a space to be negative but a space for camaraderie, hope and sharing knowledge 🌈\n\nPPS some of these won’t be appropriate for some. We are all so different. Again these are pearls I’ve picked up through my journey :) do I do these things religiously? Some  yes, some no. But creating this list has definitely motivated me to try to be more consistent with things like my omegas & vit c. We’re only human 😁\n\nEdit: I edited this post to remove specific brand suggestions because I don’t want to sway anyone any which way.",

Get a bottle of [chewable vitamin C tablets](https://www.costco.com/kirkland-signature-chewable-vitamin-c-500-mg.,-500-tablets.product.100369190.html).\n\n2. Get an empty bottle to carry in your gym bag.  Personally I like the glass bottles that come with [Asian sauces](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0015XMIGU/).\n\nBefore you swim, fill the bottle with ~6 ounces of water and drop in a vitamin C tablet (bite the tablet into pieces to help it dissolve quicker).  After your swim and before you start the shower, pour the solution into your hair and wipe some over over your skin.  Go ahead and start your shower, but rinse your hair last.\n\nThis dramatically lowers the chlorine residue.  If I forget to bring the solution to the gym in the morning, then I can smell the chlorine the instant I step into the shower that evening.\n\nNote that sodium ascorbate has a very short shelf life in water, but vitamin C tablets also contain ascorbic acid which acts as a preservative.  This is [similar to Swimspray](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9301909B2/en), but is more economical and more readily available.  Vitamin C tablets cost 3-cents apiece and are sold everywhere.",

    "body": "Garmi aaa gayi haiiii\\~ dhoop badh hui hai aur heatwaves pardhaar chuke hai 🥵🥵 obviously we need sunscreens! I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae](https://preview.redd.it/04x8cx1jvsy81.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db29ff28ad9fbcd3ff56a158d60e872ed63cb538)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\nand that's all from my side! I know its not much but then again kangaal haalaat mein kharidaari mushkil hai 💀. anyway, here's a list ss that I do want to try once this lot is finished:\n\n* sunscoop sunscreen serum (only if dermaco doesnt work lmao. really intrigued)\n* Face shop sunscreens (itne variants . ek try karne ka mann hai 😖)\n* beauty of joseon rice ss (stock mein aaja bhai 😫)\n* missha sun aqua gel and essence (bas aise hi lol)\n\nI've also tried the neutrogena ultra sheer, episoft , a few banana boat ones but way long ago so I don't clearly remember them to give the verdict on them. just if I haven't repurchased them, consider that they didn't work well for me.\n\nhope this was informational and you guys enjoyed! if you still have any other questions related to the product above, feel free to comment!",

    "body": "\n\n\n\n**This post is going to be long so buckle up. Let's dive into the world of Vitamin C.**\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile I don't want to go in depths behind the molecular science behind the utilisation and processes in the skin anatomy with respect to Vitamin C, it is crucial to superficially understand everything.\n\nVitamin C is an essential vitamin, that human body (and some other mammals) cannot produce by itself, unlike most other animals. Our body cannot make it's own Vitamin C because of the lack of L-gulonolactone oxidase enzyme, although it plays a crucial role in our existence. Vitamin C refers to ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid as both help to treat scurvy, a classical condition caused by the deficiency of Vitamin C.\n\nSome abstracted applications from this [journal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1549963419302011):\n\n1. *Vitamin C is a potent* ***antioxidant*** *capable of neutralizing oxidative stress through an electron donation/transfer process.*\n2. Vitamin *C favours* ***the absorption of iron, calcium and folic acid***, w*hich prevents allergic reactions and a decrease in the intracellular content of Vit C can lead to immunosuppression. Therefore, Vit C supplementation is recommended during infection and stress.*\n3. ***Vit C stimulates the formation of bil*****e** in the gallbladder and ***facilitates the excretion of steroid hormones***.\n4. ***Vitamin C acts directly on collagen biosynthesis*** *and is an enzymatic cofactor for lysyl and prolyl hydroxylases, key enzymes for the stabilization and cross-linking of type I and III collagen fibres. It also plays an i****mportant role in the intracellular signalling cascade that leads to fibroblast proliferation.***\n5. ***Vitamin C could selectively kill cancer cells by inducing H2O2 production.*** However, ***this theory is still controversial in the scientific community.***\n6. ***Vitamin C also appears to exert important brain functions that go well beyond its antioxidant activity.***  *It acts as an enzymatic cofactor in the biosynthesis of collagen, carnitine, tyrosine and peptide hormones. It stimulates myelin production, maturation and differentiation of neurons. Studies show that Vitamin C deficiency is a common factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic sclerosis, as well as psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety and schizophrenia.*\n\n# All along my mother has been accurate. Clearly, vitamin c is essential.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile researching I felt it's important to explore more in-depth about its antioxidant properties. This part will focus on oxidation as a process. If you understand what oxidation means, skip this part.\n\n***Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant. It has been hypothesised to reduce damage caused by ROS by diminishing the oxidative stress.***\n\nOxidation is a chemical reaction caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS), commonly known as free radicals. ROS are produced as a consequence of endogenous (normal metabolic process) and exogenous (smoking, pollution, UV, stress, etc.) factors. Routinely our body is able to control this in a complex process using the antioxidants bank in our body that helps to manage the free radical damage. However, if there is a disproportion between free radicals and the antioxidants in the body, the body is under oxidative stress.\n\n***I found that*** [*this video*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCF6prDSrHE) ***explains the oxidation process and role of antioxidants at the molecular level in detail.*** ***I highly recommend you to check out this video to understand the process & it's implications.***\n\nHere are some medical articles that can help you understand more about oxidation:\n\n1. [Antioxidant and Oxidative Stress: A Mutual Interplay in Age-Related Diseases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6204759/)\n2. [Oxidative stress, ageing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5927356/)[, and diseases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5927356/)\n3. [Oxidative Stress: Harms and Benefits for Human Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5551541/)\n\nA few relevant excerpts from these articles:\n\n>*Free radicals are generated from both endogenous and exogenous sources. Immune cell activation, inflammation, ischemia, infection, cancer, excessive exercise, mental stress, and aging are all responsible for endogenous free radical production. Exogenous free radical production can occur as a result from exposure to environmental pollutants, heavy metals (Cd, Hg, Pb, Fe, and As), certain drugs (cyclosporine, tacrolimus, gentamycin, and bleomycin), chemical solvents, cooking (smoked meat, used oil, and fat), cigarette smoke, alcohol, and radiations \\[*[*15*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5551541/#B15)*–*[*25*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5551541/#B25)*\\]. When these exogenous compounds penetrate the body, they are degraded or metabolized, and free radicals are generated as by-products.*\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n*So in conclusion,* ***Oxidation is a process linked to ageing.*** *Excessive & prolonged oxidative stress can contribute to the development of various conditions & diseases including cancer and premature ageing.*\n\n*There are* ***two ways*** *to* ***mitigate oxidative stress:***\n\n1. ***Better lifestyle choices*** *- Regular & adequate sleep, regular exercise, stress-free environment, a health & balanced diet, protection from UV, less exposure to pollutants, etc.*\n2. ***Adequate intake of antioxidants, one of which is Vitamin C.***\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe skin broadly is made of two layers, the dermis and the epidermis. I discussed the epidermis a little in my post on exfoliation.\n\nThe epidermis is the outer layer, its main function is to provide a barrier from environmental factors, pollutants and pathogens, to protect the body structures beneath.\n\nBeneath the epidermis, lies the dermis. The dermis is connected to blood vessels. The dermis supports connective tissues, specifically collagen and elastin, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, hair follicle, lymph vessels and nerve endings. Fat and muscle lie below the dermis. Dermis plays various roles & functions. With age, collagen and elastin fibres start to break and the layers of the skin start to thin out. This cause wrinkles to form.\n\n[This](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3f2e4893-dc0a-460d-af2e-153f10aaad2f/imm13152-fig-0002-m.jpg) graphical representation can help you understand the above information better.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nNutrition has been known to play a role in skin health. There are various manifestations of scurvy, some of which are skin ailments. [This](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4428712/) article supports the role of micro & macronutrients in the skin.\n\nHere I have quoted findings of [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5539213/#B5)\n\n>***Subjects***: Twenty-seven healthy female volunteers were recruited from community bulletin board of Kyung Hee University from March to April, 2014. Inclusion criteria were non-smoker, no vitamin and mineral supplements, non-pregnancy, non-alcoholism, no known medical illness, and women aged 20–49 years.\n\nHere is another [study](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/93/8/3704.full.pdf)***:***\n\n>***Subjects:*** Seven men ages 20-26 years were selected. Exclusion criteria were cigarette smoking, use of regular medications, history of kidney stones, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, diabetes mellitus, bleeding disorders, or family history of iron overload/hemochromatosis. Patients consumed a vitamin C-restricted diet throughout hospitalization, which contained <5 mg of vitamin C daily and utilized a computerized 14-day-cycle selective menu design. On admission patients began vitamin C depletion to reduce plasma vitamin C concentrations to 5-10 um without scurvy. Plasma vitamin C was measured every 1-4 days.\n\n**In conclusion:** *Supplementation of Vitamin C has been known to increase Vitamin C levels in the blood Plasma but not Vitamin C Concentration in humans that did not have a deficiency. While vitamin C concentration depends also depends on absorption and transmission mechanisms, supplementation of up to 200mg in a single dose can help individuals who have a deficiency of Vitamin C.*\n\n*This simply means if you do not have a deficiency, gulping Celin 500mg will make your urine rich loaded with Vitamin C. Also means, small single dosage of 100-200mg from fruits and vegetables would be better than a single large dosage if you wish to elevate your vitamin c levels.*\n\n[*There is one study*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9448204/) *however that shows that combined oral intake of Vitamin E with Vitamin C helped to be effective against sunburns.*\n\nRecommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Vitamin C based on [this study report](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK225480/).\n\n|Male|Female|Pregnancy|Lactation|Smokers|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|9-13 years|45|45|-|-|-|\n|14-19 years|75|65|80|115|+35|\n|19+|90|75|85|120|+35|\n\n***Vitamin C content of some common fruits and veggies :***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/17czjncj8ar51.png?width=638&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1a136f11f5368d96a45261765bd0202a11490de\n\n**Coming back to the skin -**\n\nTo my surprise, Vitamin C concentration in the skin is higher than the tissues of various other organs. [^(Reference Table)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/table/nutrients-09-00866-t001/)\n\nVitamin C is generally stored in the intracellular fluid (inside the cell) where it brought by the blood vessels. Since the blood vessels are well connected to the dermis, Vitamin c is transported to the dermis by the blood vessels. It is important to note that dermis is where collagen and elastin fibres are present. Also, surprisingly the Vitamin C concentrations are found to be much higher in the epidermis (not connected to the blood vessels but where UV damage first occurs). Thus, researchers believe that the skin stores more Vitamin C to protect itself from the rapid oxidative damage because of UV and other environmental factors in healthy individuals.\n\n\n\n# SO WHAT DID I LEARN FROM ALL OF THE ABOVE??\n\n\n\n* *Vitamin C essential for good health AND GOOD SKIN.*\n* *Our body cannot produce its own Vitamin C.*\n* *Meeting daily RDA is sufficient to keep high concentrations of Vitamin C in the skin, for most individuals.*\n* *Veggies like bell peppers & broccoli and, fruits like papaya have more vitamin C than a lemon/amla.*\n* *Supplementation of Vitamin C is only beneficial if you have a preexisting deficiency.*\n* *Supplementation over 1g in a single dosage will only increase plasma levels but almost all the excess will be excreted in the urine.*\n* *It's better to get your daily dose from fruits and veggies.*\n* Oxidative stress can be reduced by having a good lifestyle. Daily exercise, sound sleep, less stress, sun protection and a balanced diet actually play a MAJOR role in reducing oxidative damage. *Thus, the best way to anti-age is to invest in self-care through mindfulness*. (This is something we all know, but we do not consider it important enough. I need to work on myself. It's been mindblowing to read all the studies that point out these facts.)\n\n\n\n**I am breaking this journey in 2-3 parts. There is a lot of information. The next post will cover topical benefits and derivates.**\n\n[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/j5jsia/series_part_2_all_about_topical_vitamin_c_laa/) to Part 2: **All About TOPICAL VITAMIN C ---- L-AA & Derivatives**",

It is basically the condition of having soft cornea due to less fiber in the eye tissues. This is basically caused due to deficiency of collagen! I also observed that my skin is very sensitive and is prone to marks just with small stress. I guess I really have low collagen and that is why I have so many scars. \n\nSo anyway I got a procedure called collagen cross linking done in my eye for making the cornea less softer before it degrades. In this vitamin b drops were added into my eyes was exposed to UV light so collagen can form and build the fibers. \n\nOkay, now imma go do research on how skin will respond if I similarly apply vitamin b and get exposed to sun. Sounds like it can help. I also observed that my scars/acne generally fade after a holiday in beach destinations aka get exposed to sun. I think I’m onto something, will research more!\n\nSorry, This is very very off topic but I got excited because my research also falls in line for this!",

I have combo oily skin that's acne prone, has some unevenness, and have dryness on the cheeks and below the eyes.](https://preview.redd.it/wjk1a59hwu9a1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2e42445669ae6474aec27e18314faddba3c9ddf)\n\nWill RP: \n\n* **SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic: 5/5** I get compliments routinely if someone sees me within a few hours after application. I gave a bottle to my grandma who said, \"It works after one time. What kind of a thing is that?\" You just glow. This being said, I have thought about Silymarin or Phloretin instead since I have prone to acne but haven't yet. I use every morning.\n* **SkinCeuticals Triple Lipid Restore: 4/5** This is one of the best moisturizers ever, with the only 3 things working against it being: A) it's pretty low on the humectant side of the moisturizing house and pretty high on the emollient side (which is fine but can feel a bit waxy), B) it has some essential oils and linalool or limonene I believe, which make it slightly irritating (which I can handle but others may not), and C) it's expensive ($136). It's restorative and truly repairs the skin barrier in a visible way. Excellent for skin that's dry or irritated (provided you can handle the essential oils).\n* **SkinCeuticals Emollience: 5/5** I prefer this to Triple Lipid (although it has a slightly different function and character: TLR is like an expensive suit and Emollience is like a well made linen outfit. TLR is excellent but extra; Emollience is versatile but timeless). It feels more quenching to the skin than TLR (more humectant properties). I love the algae extract, too. Plus, it's \\~1/2 the price of TLR.\n* **SkinCeuticals LHA Cleanser: 4.5/5** I love the menthol and the feeling it creates (cooling). I think the LHA also works well to clear my pores and sebaceous filaments but hard to tell with a cleanser. If you're sensitive, menthol could be an issue. It's not super expensive (\\~$45). I use this whenever I'm not going to be putting retinoid on my face immediately after.\n* **SkinMedica TNS Advanced + Serum 5/5:** Thought long and hard about this one as it's almost double the price of anything else in the cabinet ($295 -- altho $230 if you subscribe and cancel if needed) and it's really marketed for anti-aging market (I'm 26yo male), but jesus christ this stuff is magic. I noticed a tightening of the skin within less than a day after starting to use it. Noticeably reduced fine lines (yes, I have some). I use this after dermarolling .25mm in the shower (as is recommended online by med spas etc). I use this on recovery night.\n* **LRP Anthelios Melt in Milk: 4/5** I like the physical/chemical mix. It has a nice feeling on the face (cooling) and isn't too thick. It works and feels good. I can get away with no moisturizer under it on warm days.\n* (Not pictured) **LRP Toleriane Cleanser: 5/5** Extremely gentle and hydrating. I use before retinoid or if the skin is irritated. \n* **Curology (.01% tretinoin + 2% azaelic + 4% niacinamide): 4/5**: Easy and I like the compounding for my skin type. I will ask to increase tret % soon.\n* **Neutrogena HydroBoost Water Gel 5/5:** Incredible face feel. Cooling and slick and not at all greasy. If you're on a budget, have combo/oily skin, or want something super sheer for daytime use, this is the HG.\n* **SkinMedica HA5 Rejuvinating Hydrator: 4.5/5** I wouldn't say that the effect is immediate here, but I do notice my skin feeling and looking plumper after using this. It's totally non greasy or tacky (not even the case with the HG above) and has urea, serine, and ferment in addition to the 5 molecular weights of HA. I wish it didn't have algin, which can be comedogenic and irritating. But I haven't found it to be either of those. At $187, the price is the major reason I knocked it down a rung on rating. It's not dramatic enough for that price, IMO, but if you can afford, it's great. There are other supporting incis which are impressive like plankton extract, grape flower cell extract, whey protein, and pullulan (the material that makes Listerine breath strips into their thin film gel). I would definitely say this is a tightening product.\n* **First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair: 4/5** I really do love this cream so far. A lot of people say it didn't agree with their skin but as someone who's acne prone with Fitzpatrick type III, I think I can handle the eucalyptus in this. Plus it's affordable relatively ($38 for 6oz) but does leave a bit of a white cast.  Shea + Squalane + Allatonin + Licorice Extract + Green Tea Extract = yummy hydration and calming. Feels a bit like Burts Bees Lip Balm as in it's cooling and healing but also feels like it's increasing circulation.\n\nMight RP:\n\n* **SkinMedica AHA/BHA Cream: 3/5** I like the formulation and face feel here and the price (\\~$40) but some of the ingredients + the results are a bit 🔎 . For starters, I don't know why they use Ascorbyl Palmitate, which has similarly poor stability to ascorbic acid. I also wish they listed the free acid concentration here. I wish no cetyl alcohol either. It's not bad by any means, but I'm curious about other options (isClinical Active Serum -- pls comment if you have experience!) \n* **SkinCeuticals HA Intensifier: 3/5** The proxylane is great and definitely has a good face feel and plumping effect. But the denatured alcohol + the price point + the relatively one dimension of this product (it's p much just HA as opposed to the ultra multitasking HA5) means it's a bit overpriced for what it is ($106) and risky re irritation. Definitely not a no-go but not a favorite for me.\n* **SK-II Pitera Masques: 2/5** @ $16/masque it's just a lot for a single use. If you want to give SK-II Pitera a try, I would get the essence and get 10x the uses. It works for some, others say it breaks them out. I have enough ferment (that's the real key to Pitera) in other products. Obviously not all ferment is the same. Another one to explore besides HA5 would be Estee Lauder ANR.\n* **SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Gel: 3/5** I really like this serum and tbh my skin drinks it up but it's just more relevant if you have pretty reactive skin that gets irritated. It's very cooling and delicious but not a necessity in my routine at the moment. Plus, if your skin is that irritated, you might need to tone down the actives rather than patching with this. Plus, there are irritants (ironically): linalool, benzyl benzoate, parfum, etc.\n* **SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Masque: 2/5** Same as above but even less needed (maybe if you just had a peel it's worth it) but they have alcohol denat and citronellol in this one too. Why? It is very cooling though.\n* **SkinCeuticals A.G.E. Eye Complex: 2/5** A bit burning and irritating to my undereye if I use too frequently. Does have nice smoothing and optical effects (reduced purple undereye and dark circles). Maybe I just have sensitive skin on the eye 🤷 \n* **The Ordinary 5% Caffeine + EGCG Depuffing Eye Serum: 3/5** Same as above (can be irritating if you use too much or too often i.e., every day) but works about as well as AGE Eye Complex for a fraction of the price (\\~$10 vs. $100).\n* **The Ordinary 30% AHA 2% BHA: 3/5** I use this for an occasional peel on my body. It works fine, I think, but microneedling or something professional would likely work better. It's fine and cheap.\n\nWon't RP:\n\n* **SkinMedica AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser: 2.5/5** I really wish SkinMedica would move away from Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate. It's just harsh on the skin and a bit too stripping as a surfactant. There are plenty of other options, and it's not awful (there are a lot of Neutrogena + L'Oreal products that use it) but not ideal. I also wish there were no essential oils (EOs) in this but there's lavender and citrus. The jojoba beads are kinda nice bc they provide a bit of physical exfoliation but then dissolve and are hydrating. It's not awful by any means but for the price (\\~$50) I'm going to keep looking.\n* **SkinMedica Purifying Foaming Wash: 2/5** Too stripping (b/c of Sodium C14-16 Olefine Sulfonate as above) but also has methylisothiazolinone which is probs going to be banned in Denmark, is sensitizing, only allowed currently in rinse off products, and just why? There are other options.\n* **Vichy Eau Thermal: 2/5** Fine. Nothing special. Just water. Might get a spray bottle instead. At $25 for the full size, it just feels silly \n* **Kiehl's Midnight Recovery Concentrate 1/5:** Chock full of EOs. Can be very irritating with almost no benefit you couldn't get from a different product.",

I think I need to switch too, because it keeps making me break out. \nI had no idea about the Pullulan in Listerine strips! Nobody talks about this ingredient enough. Every time it is in skincare, it makes my forehead so tight it is uncomfortable to me. It definitely seems to have some firming and tightening effects.

It contains complex sugars known as polysaccharides, which makes it a good water-binding agent (i.e. hydration) and antioxidant in skin care products.\nIt is proven to work well as a “carrier” for other skin care actives, effectively delivering the ingredients where they need to go.\nAdditionally, research shows pullulan has the potential to help with strengthening skin’s microbiome. Studies also show it can provide temporary mechanical support for skin’s underlying structures as well as a subtle yet visible lifting effect owing to its non-irritating film-forming properties\nMore recently, pullulan has been utilized in dissolving microneedle patch products where it is believed to enhance transdermal delivery of ingredients. Scientists are also exploring the therapeutic benefits of pullulan-based hydrogel films for various skin conditions.\nAs a texture-enhancing ingredient, characteristics of pullulan include its water solubility and relatively low viscosity compared to other polysaccharides. It possesses good thermal stability and has earned Generally Recognized as Safe (GRaS) status from U.S. FDA.",

    "body": "# [Humans are Weird - Supply and Demand - Audio Narration and Animatic](https://youtu.be/8YcF15klGdI)\n\nThe gleaming green sunlight was just angling down for the afternoon when Flight Subcommander Twenty Clicks discovered that one of the humans had eaten the entire supply of acidic calcium supplements for the base. He had the holo-record right in front of him. He scratched the control screen one more time just to be sure of what he was seeing. It was a fairly simple situation on the fringes of the air mass.\n\nThe human had been on duty in the supply bay. It had been his job to fill all material requests for the base. Humans were exceptionally well-adapted for this duty. Their height alone made working in the warehouses an easy matter for them. Their truly terrifying compressive strength meant that they ignored the lifting machines most of the time in favor of manually filling the orders. They were more likely to send the drones for the smaller packages than for the larger ones. Twenty Clicks had once seen a human lift an entire shelving unit full of prefabricated building cores simply to retrieve a scrap of paper that the human immediately tossed in the recycler.\n\nTwenty Clicks scratched the control again to watch the scene over, trying to understand. The human was what they called middle-aged. Not yet out of his reproductive cycle but past the prime of his breeding age. His hair was beginning to thin on the top of his head in a way that made him look dull and scattered. His uniform was clean but rumpled. He was sprawled across the chair he was nominally sitting in. He had forced two of the supports off of the ground and was bracing the unbalanced position by resting his legs on a nearby storage crate. In one hand he held a datapad, which the helpful AI indicated was displaying one of the popular theoretical social simulations. The other hand was otherwise occupied.\n\nTwenty Clicks watched in fascination as the massive hand, easily as large as one of his wings, lifted from where it rested on the human’s thigh and drifted almost as if not under the control of the massive mammalian brain towards the open bag of calcium citrate supplements that rested beside the human on a crate. The hand, all the time out of range of the human’s binocular vision, drifted over and past the bag till it reached nearly the full range of the human’s flexibility, then drifted back and began to make short passes in the general location of the bag.\n\nThis was clearly Undulate behavior, or perhaps it would be if the Undulate was old and blinded to visible light and was feeling around for something. Yet Twenty Clicks had checked, and the human had spent only a nominal amount of training time with the Undulates. What this actually resembled was the slow groping reach of a vine-type plant for some secure hold. Twenty Clicks wondered if human hands had an autonomous search function. To think of that massive crushing power under the control of plant-like chemical signals was terrifying.\n\nOn the display, the hand brushed over the band and flexed to reach into the interior, moving more confidently now that it had tactile information. The hand closed over what the humans called a “handful” of the supplements. Enough to supply a dozen humans for a month. However the wandering hand slowly lifted them to the human’s mouth and began pushing the mass of supplements into a mouth that opened slackly to admit them. The human chewed approximately half the mass for several moments before swallowing with a massive gulp.\n\nThe hand then pressed in the rest, and even as the mouth chewed, the hand drifted back down to the bag. It groped around with slightly slower motions this time and pulled in another handful of supplements. This process repeated itself a few dozen times until the bag was empty. When the hand finally found no more supplements in the bag, it returned to the slack, rest position on his leg. It rested there for several moments.\n\nHowever the inevitable consequence of ingesting that much calcium and ascorbic acid was quickly taking its toll on even the legendary metabolism of the human. His skin paled as his digestive system pulled blood to his gut to deal with the unexpected meal. The muscles around his eyes tightened and strained for a few moments. Then his mouth contracted in a grimace. The hand busy holding the datapad gave a spasm. The guilty hand rose and clutched at the human’s abdomen over the general location of his primary stomach. He narrowed his eyes and looked down at his abdomen with a perplexed expression.\n\n“What the ever loving?” he muttered.\n\nHe glanced over at the empty bag of supplements, and his face contorted with unease and perhaps guilt; Twenty Clicks was unsure. The human rose to his feet, staggering in place of his usual graceful movements. His guilty hand reached around to clutch his abdomen as he staggered to the comm unit on the wall. He braced one shoulder against the wall and carefully pulled up the supplies manifest. He typed in an order for an emergency refill on the supplies, hesitated when he came to the section in the form that requested a reason, and after a moment typed in ‘accidental destruction.’ The human then staggered back to his seat and collapsed in it with a groan. He stayed there for the rest of his shift, and Twenty Clicks let the recording play until it showed his own wings flitting into the storage area to request a new carry harness.\n\nHe sighed as he turned off the recording. He had of course ordered the recalcitrant human to the medical bay, and the Shatar medic on duty had soon relieved the human’s distress with an orally administered oil flush. It had seemed extreme to the Winged, but the Shatar and the human both agreed it was the safest method to cleanse his digestive tract of the calcium buildup. After the treatment, when Twenty Clicks had pressed for an explanation, the human had only shrugged.\n\n“I didn’t notice what I was doing,” he said. “It was a good book.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# [Humans are Weird - Supply and Demand - Audio Narration and Animatic](https://youtu.be/8YcF15klGdI)\n\n# [Humans are Weird](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk) [​Book Series](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)\n\n# [Amazon (Kindle, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)\n\n# [Barnes & Nobel (Nook, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/%22Humans+are+Weird%22?Ntk=P_Series_Title&Ns=P_Series_Number&Ntx=mode+matchall)\n\n# [Walmart (Paperback)](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Humans-are-Weird-I-Have-the-Data-Paperback-9798588913683/974793262)\n\n# [Kobo by Rakuten (ebook and Audiobook)](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=Humans%20are%20Weird&fcsearchfield=Series&seriesId=a035ce04-e582-5fcc-b327-16c68ca4b418&fcshowpointsprice=no&fcmaxprice=5&fcminprice=0&id=1561e6f7-742f-4c1b-a804-187728814574)\n\n# [Google Play Books (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&gl=US)\n\n# Please Leave Reviews on the Newest Book!\n\n***Hey!

    "body": "This is just kinda a trivia thing, but there doesn't seem to be any previous posts when I search the subreddit, so, writing one up.\n\nSo, Pigmote Isle, everyone's favourite miniature Kingdom and/or Republic on the Zee; the Neath's most adorable nation. Pretty much everything that happens there makes sense and is explained, either from the island itself or from other islands like Visage, but there's one reasonably large plot-point that isn't really directly addressed: the sickness striking down the Cavies at the beginning.\n\nWhen the cavies came to the island for the first time on the *Impossible Lamb*, they suffered a disease described as \"a rotting in our teeth, a weakness in the flesh\", which the Blue Scintilack at the centre of Pigmote cured. Then the rats took it and the cavies started suffering from the disease again. The only way they can cure it, when you arrive, is eating the raw organs (especially livers) of the rats.\n\nNot to bury the lede: the disease is scurvy. Guinea pigs, cavies, are one of the few mammal species besides humans that cannot synthesize ascorbic acid (vitamin C)\\*, and a diet low in vitamin C eventually results in a deficiency disease marked by weakness, easy bruising, sore joints and, famously, bleeding gums and loosening teeth, exactly the symptoms the cavies report. \"On a long sea journey with poor supplies\" is the stereotypical way of getting scurvy, and apparently Pigmote doesn't have fresh fruit or other sources of vitamin C, so the cavies are forced to resort to the livers of the rats (rats being able to synthesize their own ascorbic acid, and the liver being where the highest concentrations are found in the body. Arctic explorers without lemon juice sometimes ate raw seal livers to cure scurvy). Presumably by the time you get them their independence and they hand you the Lady's Eye/Rat Star, the cavies have learned from the player that livers besides the rats' can cure scurvy\\*\\* and can fish for their vitamin C.\n\nSo there you have it, one minor mystery of the Neath cleared up. Give yourself 50 fragments and an Extraordinary Implication.\n\nAs to why that one piece of blue scintilack gives off vitamin C rays, well, stranger things happen at Zee. ¯\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯\n\n\\*This actually was important for the discovery of vitamin C; people knew how to cure it (lemon juice) for centuries before knowing *why* the cure worked, not least because deliberately inducing scurvy in humans to experiment on them is ethically a bit of a no-no. The discovery, in 1907, that guinea pigs could also get scurvy, allowed easier testing and experimentation, but even then it took until 1932 to actually link an absence of a specific chemical (vitamin C) to scurvy.\n\n\\*\\* I originally wrote \"supply vitamin C\" here but of course the player character, starting in the 1880s, probably doesn't know the actual cause of scurvy. \"Cure ptomaine poisoning\" is more likely how a high-Pages captain would phrase it to the cavies.",

    "body": "**This was an Adderall fueled post. I’m about to nerd out big-time here. Scroll down for TL;DR!**\n\n\n**First, why do I care about vitamin c?**\nI recently decided to add a vitamin C serum to my skincare routine because of all the great effects I’ve read about.  Really, it seems as skincare ingredients go, vitamin C is amazeballs, and I’m not talking anectodtal “OMG it made my skin feel so much better” shit, I’m talking legit scientific research showing several skin benefits. It’s a fucking fabulous antioxidant,  it is photoprotective against UVA and UVB stress, it is an *essential ingredient* for collagen synthesis AND upregulates (causes) collagen synthesis, and it is effective at preventing and lightening dark spots through inhibiting the enzyme Tyrosinase, which is *the* rate limiting enzyme for melanine production^1,2 . AND, do you like Vitamin E? Because Vitamin C regenerates oxidized vitamin E molecules so your body can use them all over again^3 !\n\n\nWe’ve known the much of the details of the dermatic glories of Vitamin C for over fifteen years. Clearly, we all want lots of vitamin C. Some of this can be provided in our diets, but gastric absorption of vitamin C is downregulated by the levels of vitamin C already in your body, which means most of that supplement you have been taking just gets peed out (but I’m sure the fish appreciate it). So, in order to elevate the levels of vitamin C in our skin, it needs to be applied topically. Problem is, Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a tricky motherfucker. It’s SO effective *because* it’s so reactive as an antioxidant, which means it’s got major stability issues. It oxidizes REAL quick in solution, and this oxidation rate increases along with temperature, air, and light exposure. My guess is this is why vitamin C only recently surged in popularity as an ingredient in skincare products; manufacturers are certainly getting better at formulating (for instance, adding Ferulic acid to stabilize vitamins C and E^4 ), manufacturing and packaging products in a way that maintains their effective shelf life. The problem is, not every manufacturer is actually going to spend the time and money to ensure quality, and many companies may just ride the Vitamin C bandwagon without considering these things or caring if it is actually effective in their product. \n\n\n**Why am I concerned about pH?**\nProblem number two with vitamin C products is their pH. We’ve heard time and time again that it is important for the pH of skincare products to remain low to ensure efficacy. A quick Google Scholar search brought up an article on the effects of pH on Vitamin C absorption in particular^5 .  The researchers showed that in a solution of a pH 4 or above there was no detectable increase in skin vitamin C levels (it wasn’t absorbed), while [vitamin C levels are elevated at a pH of 3.5 and increase as pH lowers](http://i.imgur.com/seqMDmj.png). This same study also showed that the [best concentration for maximum vitamin C levels is 20%](https://i.imgur.com/LIgBvzl.png) (for some reason there is a decrease in vitamin C at higher percentages) and that even though it is the least stable, [L-ascorbic acid is the best ascorbic acid derivative to use](https://i.imgur.com/jYgAcZg.png).\n\n\n**Choosing a Vitamin C Product**\nGiven all of this fantastic information, I am convinced that pH is a critical factor for an effective vitamin C product. Unfortunately, as a poor graduate student, my choices in skin care products are financially limited. Given that I have science, I decided to also try making my own. I purchased some vitamin C L-ascorbic acid crystals from the Vitamin shoppe and ground them into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle. I then used a digital scale to measure out the powder and, using deionized water and glycerol, made a 20% weight by volume solution of L-ascorbic acid serum.  I actually really like how it turned out. I used this first and saw visible improvement in the redness of my skin after a week or two. \n\n\nStill, I wanted to try something “real.” Much as I’d love to, I can’t usually spring for the expensive, already researched and well reviewed products, and so I searched Amazon for a cheap alternative. I settled on [ArtNaturals Enhanced Vitamin C Serum](http://www.amazon.com/ArtNaturals-Enhanced-Vitamin-Serum-Hyaluronic/dp/B012Q4M3DO/ref=sr_1_5_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1461786401&sr=1-5&keywords=vitamin+C+serum) because it was under $15, claimed to contain 20% Vitamin C, and had many positive reviews (4 out of 5 stars from over 9000 reviews). \n\n\nThe first problem I noticed with this serum was in the ingredients list – it does not contain the L-ascorbic acid form of vitamin C, but instead what is reportedly an aqueously more stable, while less studied form called Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate. I didn’t sweat this too much, because it wasn’t tested in the earlier study^5 I mentioned, and a more recent paper reported good absorption levels^6 .  I wasn’t impressed. It wasn’t bad, but it didn’t seem any better than the serum I made. It was actually a bit sticky, comparatively, and my skin didn’t tingle like it does with my DIY serum. I decided to test the pH of both serums, and WOAH. \n\n\n**Testing the pH – RESULTS!**\nFirst, let me show you how the [pH test strips I used work using vinegar and water as examples/controls](http://i.imgur.com/Aqfxg6L.jpg). The strips are wetted in the solution for 1-2 minutes then compared to the swatch which shows pHs from 0-14 at 0.5 intervals. There are 8 dyes that are affected, and the closest swatch match is used. This example shows, from left to right, vinegar, vegetable glycerin (glycerol), bottled purified water (Dasani), and city tap water. As expected, vinegar was the most acidic, but it fell in at around 1.5-2. That’s actually more acidic than you’d expect from white vinegar  (~2.5 pH). Glycerol and bottled water checked in around 6.0 again, a bit lower than expected, and my tap water was ~7.0. I didn’t have any buffer to check these strips with (I’ll test them tomorrow in my lab), but it looks like might be showing acidity a little low. If so, it looks like it might need about a +1 correction term, but because pH is a logarithmic scale I can’t be sure. Anyway, we can at least move forward and see our pHs relative to vinegar and water!\n\nNext, I tested my homemade 20% L-ascorbic acid serum. It is about 3-4 weeks old, and is stored in a dark glass dropper bottle (an old Korres serum bottle). I was shocked to see it falling in at a [pH of 1.5, right where the vinegar was.]( http://i.imgur.com/wE9uEC3.jpg) If it IS 1.5, that is stupidly acidic, not to mention virtually impossible to achieve. L-Ascorbic Acid is a diprotic acid with pKas of 4.17 for the first proton dissociation, and 11.57 for the second. This means, given the maximum saturation concentration in water of 33%, I’d only get a pH of 1.87, which would look closer to 2. Visually, its similar to the vinegar, so my guess is it’s a pH of 2.5. I’m actually pretty happy with that. I’d almost call it *too* acidic, but my skin is responding well to it, so I’m content. \n\nNow for the shit I bought off of amazon! Are you prepared to be impressed! [Well, sorry to disappoint you, but this shit was basic.](http://i.imgur.com/B7DhUNm.jpg). Okay, not *very* basic, but around or above neutral. Visually, I’d call it 7.5-8. Even if my strips are showing things as a bit lower in pH, it’s more basic than the water I used as a control, and not anywhere CLOSE to the necessary effective pH of <3.5. This stuff is absolute shit. \n\nI will concede that this isn’t the *same type* of vitamin C used to determine pH/absorption profiles. However, the skin has a pH of around 5 and generally a lower pH is considered necessary to maintain effectiveness and to be absorbed into the skin, as shown in studies for other nutrients^7 . I'm probably going to keep making my own serum. I may actually buffer it up to a pH of 3 with some sodium hydroxide once I measure it with a calibrated pH probe in my lab (tomorrow). \n\nMy curiosity also lead me to test a few of other products that I use regularly. \n\n*Alpha Hydrox 12% AHA Soufflé (glycolic acid): pH 4.0-4.5\n\n*CeraVe Renewing Salasylic Acid Cleanser: pH 4.5\n\n*Retin-A Micro 0.08% Pump: pH 4.5\n\n*Dermapeutics Kyaluronic Lift Serum: pH4.0-4.5\n\n\nI hope you found this somewhat interesting. I certainly did, which is why I just spent 2 hours testing and writing about it! It’s probably not a bad idea for everyone to test their products for pH – test strips are relatively cheap, and it’s easy to do at home and important information to have!\n\n\nSOURCES CITED:\n\n1.

In some pharmacies you can get ascorbic acid over the counter, and it is way cheaper. \n\nTake the amount that fits on a tip of a knife, and it will be about 1000 milligrams, which is usually the highest amount you can get per pill. \n\nThis info comes from a European city, but based on a little googling, I determined that it should work in the U.S. also.\n\nEDIT: I think someone should do an LPT about the health benefits of vitamin C (or lack thereof). :)",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F18 (umar badh gayi but dimaag nahi 💀)**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , acne (pustules, fungal and cystic) pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae ](https://preview.redd.it/fnjipguox9ma1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d880ff6b482ade3f03237375ef02cdd64fb4e3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl  Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a  fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\n* **The Derma Co.** **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum** \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredient list** : Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would  get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation. I found this really mediocre.\n\n* **Axis-Y Complete No-Stress Physical Sunscreen \\[SPF 50+ PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1450 for 50ml (bought for Rs.999 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily combo skin types. those with dry skin like mine, might find it a bit more drying. good one for sensitive skins since it has a lot of calming ingredients as well!\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick white cream. fragrance free but has very strong ayurvedic smell. matte finish. physical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Zinc Oxide, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propanediol, Titanium Dioxide, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Caprylyl Methicone, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Disiloxane, Niacinamide, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Water, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Stearic Acid, Aluminum Hydroxide, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Copaifera Officinalis (Balsam Copaiba) Resin, Tocopherol, Squalane, Allantoin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5\n\n**filters** :\n\n* zinc oxide (mineral filter)\n* titanium dioxide (mineral filter)\n\nthis had been on my 'to buy' list for such a long time! and I finally got it during a march beauty barn sale! when I first tried it, I was really skeptical since it gave me a pretty bad whitecast and smelt so weird. I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :(  but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nupdate : this ones a hard no for me. is it calming? yes. but the whitecast is too much. and when i sweat it literally looks like I'm secreting milk from my skin  (~~nipple)😭😭~~\n\n**rating** : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure! in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh. I feel like this one is getting over sooner than others in my ss ki theli 😫 but either way, if you find a good deal on it, blindly add this to your cart and order it. you wont be dissappointed!\n\nrating : 5/5 and WRP on reduced mrp only.\n\n* **Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun : Rice + Probiotics (SPF50+ PA++++)**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1530 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1200 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : dry, sensitive, acne prone and combination\n\n**texture and appearance** : creamy white lotion (ya nasty-). unscented ( ha, ha , aur socho ashleel cheeze 🤡)\n\n**ingredients list :**   Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Water, Glycerin, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Behenyl Alcohol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Sodium Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Water, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/​VP Copolymer, Polyisobutene, Silica, Caprylyl/​Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Bifida Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacillus Ferment,Streptococcus Thermophilus Ferment\n\n**filters :**\n\n* uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nthis deserves all the hype it gets on the net. my current and forever HG sunscreen (unless they change formulation). seriously this ticks all the boxes . no whitecast? check. great filters? check. doesn't make you face look like you rub pan grease on it? check. it absorbs so well and is more moisturizing than some of the moisturizers out there. obviously, wished we would get more quantity for the price paid but itna criticise karne ke baad bhi, brands toh behre hai 😔and on reapplication, doesnt feel like im doing the 100 layers challenge lol. plus , I don't feel regret when applying it these days, cuz no fear of sunscreen melting during winters (#rajailife) . *taareef karu kya uski, jisneee tujhe banayaaaa✨\\~*\n\n**rating :** 5/5 and forever HG\n\n* **Benton Mineral Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 15g (haalat kharab biros). got it at 30% on beauty barn\n\n**For skin types** : normal and sensitive skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : a white stick. that's it. kind of a really thick lotion like texture. unscented and smol. mineral sunstick.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Coco-caprylate/caprate, sunflower seed wax, propylene glycol dicaprylate, H-di/trimethylol hexyllactone cross polymer, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, titanium dioxide, dicaprylyl carbonate, Synthetic fluorphlogopite, vinyl dimethicone, microcrystalline wax, aluminum stearate, polyhydroxystearic acid, purslane extract, centella extract, sodium hyaluronate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, sodium Acetylated hyaluronate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, polyglyceryl-4diisostearate/polyhydroxystearate/sebacate, silica, alumina, pentylene glycol, allantoin, panthenol, Glycerin, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Xylyl Glucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Glucose, Glyceryl Caprylate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Stearic Acid, Tocopherol, Purified Water, 1, 2-hexanediol, ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**filters** :\n\n* titanium dioxide\n\nthis one came around the same time as the tocobo sunstick on beauty barn so being the ✨phisool kharchi wala baccha✨, I bought both of them. unfortunately , this one was a big letdown. how tf can a sunstick leave a whitecast? this one is a great example. first off, it requires a lot of pressing and dragging across the face to dispense , so not fond of that, especially when I have active acne. secondly, it legit looks like someone rubbed fair and lovely mixed with water on my face 💀. its not waterproof, expensive for the quantity you get and gives a disappointing finish and result. I'm not particularly sure about protection against sun on this one but oh well. also piddu si stick hai so kind of cute but lootne wala hai lmao\n\n**rating** : 2/5 and WNRP\n\n* **Tocobo** **Cotton Soft Airy Sun Stick SPF50 Pa++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1550 for 20g (bought at 1100 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily, combination, acne prone skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale blue long cylinderical like stick. has a really pleasant and soft floral fragrance . leaves a matte fininsh and doesnt feel greasy on apllication. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list :**  Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Niacinamide, Tromethamine, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol, Polysilicone-15, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Extract, Sophora Flavescens Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum Root/Stalk Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Oenothera Biennis (evening primrose) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Seed Oil, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* titanium dioxide (physical filter)\n\nprobably the only sun stick that comes even close to the isntree sun stick. this gives such a good matte finish without any greasy feel . plus has cute floral smell to it that doesn't transfer to your skin or anything. and damn what a bang for a buck. probably the closest dupe for the isntree one. the only con is that it kind of pills after the 3rd application and rubs of oily after a while. if you are a person who touches their face every once in a while (like my dumbass), you might find it a bit uncomfortable. that being said, most of the times I just blot the grease away after 3-4hrs of application and apply another layer afterwards. sun protection wise, it does a good job! my forehead is the area that is the most prone to getting tan and it looked quite even toned after 3 weeks of consecutive use. one of my most favorite sticks (😏)\n\n**rating** : 4.5/5 and lets seeee\n\n* **Neutrogena beach defense sun stick water + sun protection SPF 50+**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs 1260 for 42 g (got it at Rs. 900 from amazon)\n\n**for skin types** : honestly, none lmao. I used it as a body stick most of the time with how oily this was. but can be used by anyone ig\n\n**texture and appearance** : whitish yellow stick. has a fruity kind of smell. really oily and greasy on first application that doesn't absorb or goes away after a while.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Polyethylene, Isohexadecane, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Ozokerite, Paraffin, Synthetic Beeswax, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Neopentyl Glycol Diisostearate, Dimethicone, Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Fragrance, BHT\n\n**filters** :\n\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n\noof this was an impulse purchase that I regretted later on. mind you, this is a great sunstick for your body but definitely not for your face . not to mention its waterproof . but the tapti garmi really just melts everything in its way and this is no exception. bhai itna chip chipa lagta hai i dont even feel like putting this on just because of the MoIsT feeling it gives. unless you're going to a pool or beach (as it suggests duh) , if you're okay with feeling like [that peanut butter baby](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.ie%2Flife%2Ffamily%2Fthis-peanut-butter-baby-is-sure-to-brighten-up-your-day-31499579.html&psig=AOvVaw0Qc7SXcD436wP5Ywrn_yJv&ust=1678212392776000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCIDzt77yx_0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) , then you can give it a try. it  does provide a good amount of product for the price and is a solid waterproof one fosho. but nahi jhela jata for some reason 😣😣😫\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\nme after buying and trying all of these to find my HG\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zzjpjrbly9ma1.gif\n\nbut it was fun doing this in a span of a few years and I finally got one that fits all my boxes . the BOJ one is seriously godsent for me ✨✨~~lets just ignore that it makes my wallet cry every time I buy it .~~ But id rather spend more on stuff that works than just hit and trials lmao. also I've gone past my obsession on using sun sticks as a whole since they require quite a lot of pressing while applying and the application just irritates my acne a lot 😫 imma finish the ones I have but I have no intentions on buying anymore from any brands (even though the minimalist and earth rhythm ones look good 🤡)more reviews to come! ill be doing one on stuff my dad will be bringing from the U.S in the next few weeks so do let me know if you'd like a follow up on those too! (~~why do i treat my posts like a sitcom😭).~~  and as always, any other questions, comments are always welcomed and so are dms!\n\nbyeeee 💖💖",

        "body": "also my post exceeded the word limit so here's some more lmao :\n\n   \n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF      50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n   \n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte      Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable      UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB      filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV      filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB      mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change",

    "body": "So there is this misconception that ascorbic acid can decarboxylate benzoic acid to form benzene, showcased by the recent post and comments:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1h34y5b/is\\_this\\_amazon\\_reviewer\\_right/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1h34y5b/is_this_amazon_reviewer_right/)\n\nThere are multiple comments like:\n\n>On MULTI-YEAR TIMESCALES vitamin C will VERY SLOWLY react with benzoate or benzoic acid and reduce/decarboxylate it to benzene.\n\nOr:\n\n>in the presence of certain metallic catalysts, ascorbic acid can decarboxylate sodium benzoate to form sodium ascorbate, carbon dioxide, and benzene\n\nBoth of these notions are very imprecise and misguided.\n\nBenzene decarboxylation is a radical process, and it proceeds in the presence of hydroxyl radical (source: [doi.org/10.1021/jf00029a001](http://doi.org/10.1021/jf00029a001)). Cu2+ and ascorbic acid can catalyze the reduction of atmospheric oxygen and production of hydroxyl radicals. Similarly, Fe3+ can react with H2O2 to form hydroxyl radicals.\n\nTherefore, the following are imprecise/untrue:\n\n>vitamin C will decarboxylate benzoic acid\n\nIt won't. Hydroxyl radicals and low pH will.\n\n>metal catalysts catalyze benzoic acid decarboxylation\n\nThey don't. Some metal ions (Fe3+, Cu2+) can promote hydroxyl radical formation in specific conditions.\n\n>metal ions and ascorbates will decarboxylate benzoic acid\n\nThey won't. H2O2 or O2 and low pH are also needed.\n\n>benzene decarboxylation is a reduction process\n\nIt isn't. It's disproportionation.",

But I also wonder, since ferments aren't really a thing that majority of consumers in the Western market are looking out for (like fragrance, rose water, coconut water, rosehip oil, fruit/veggie extracts that have label/experience appeal, but aren't necessarily good for skin), why would these huge companies bother putting ferments in their expensive skin care if they didn't have evidence that they do SOMETHING?\n\nI especially am curious because AB/Korean beauty are sometimes looked down upon as just being trendy and not using ingredients that are scientifically proven to be truly beneficial for skin.\n\nDo you think ferments are legit?

Fermenting antioxidant rich ingredients such as ginseng, green tea etc. breaks down the antioxidants/complex molecules that are beneficial to our skin into smaller molecules, which allows it to be absorbed into the skin easily. Not only that, yeast/bacteria ferments produce additional metabolites (AHAs, peptides) that provide additional benefits such as whitening, hydration, skin repair, you name it!\n\nEdit: forgot to put my favorite fermented product!! I love the Manyo Factory Galactomyces Niacin Special treatment. :) \n\n2nd Edit: here are the links to some scientific literature articles on fermented cosmetics which were found through PubMed!

I hope you all had a pleasant time celebrating Christmas/the winter Solstice/the rise of the AI singularity/whatever-it-is-you-celebrate! I have recovered enough from the festivities to bring you a new installment of this story. Again, English is not my first language, so feel free to send me corrections. I've never written a story like this, so feel free to give corrections and opinions, especially on things like pacing. Ideas and comments welcome!\n\nAlso, please read the previous part if you haven't, otherwise you're going to be mighty confused!\n\nThe thoughts of the current POV character are indicated in *italics*\nThe aliens use their own system of weights and measures. Additionally, they use octal instead of decimal. All numbers are written in decimal for the convenience of the reader, and conversions are provided in square brackets \\(\\[\\]\\). Only the name of the ship is in octal, 077762. \n\n[Previous][p]|[First][f]|[Next][n]\n\n---\n\n\"Species?\" Asked Counter-Master Rémy Leclerc. \n\n\"Human.\" \n\nAs it spoke, smoke billowed out of the being's mouth, but quickly dispersed. Its voice was quiet as it said the unfamiliar word, and incredibly deep. \n\n*So it is a new species then! I can't even remember the last time one was discovered! Wasn't it like an eighth octannum ago? \\[~635 years\\] Huh. There's probably some relevant paperwork on my pad somewhere. Let's do a search.*\n\nTo everyone in the line, it looked like the Targuien was leisurely tapping away at his personal pad. He'd only asked a single question, and then fallen silent. He worked at it for a whole vig \\[7.5 min\\], before he seemed to find what he was looking for, and started reading.\n\n*Here we are! I can't believe how deep in the menus this damn first contact document is! What's it say I should do here?* \"Looking for new species\", *no, it's a bit late for that*, \"Ascertaining peacefulness of the contacted individual(s)\". *Well, it's waited in line like everyone else, so I guess it's peaceful?* \"Establishing communication\", \"Understanding social structure of contacted polity\", *blah, blah, blah where's the relevant stuff already?* \"Recruitment into merchant marine\", *yes, that's what I need!* \"Should the newly contacted species be able-bodied, as defined in appendix 23a of the present document, **ALL** efforts should be made to recruit a few members of the species in question. Ideally, a single individual should be recruited, though if physiology or psychology forbid it, the smallest group or unit should be selected. To reflect the importance this task has been accorded by Fleet Amirals, a bonus\" *FUCKING WHAT!* \"will be awarded to Hands of rank Counter-Master and higher that directly participate in Recruitment and Orientation of said single individual or group of individuals successfully employed for a full duration of 16 weeks \\[24.4 Earth weeks\\]. The bonus will be awarded at the end of the recruit's probation period if they are still employed, alive, and healthy, as evaluated by the Senior Medical Officer onboard, and if the Hand properly performed their duties, as judged by their Commanding Officer.   \nThe bonus shall be calculated thus: 16 weeks' pay corresponding to the Hand's rank\" *HOLY FUCKING SHIT!* \"divided by the number of individuals recruited, multiplied by the number of unique traits as described in appendix 23b of the present document, multiplied by the number resistances to known poisons as described in the same appendix, multiplied by ...\"\n\nThose that could see Counter-Master were getting quite worried: he was visibly shaking. Most of them knew that when a Targuien Hand was angered, most within sight would not be walking away, as few would even be alive anymore. The last question had been asked nearly three vig ago [22.5 min]. Usually, three or four candidates would have been processed by then. Even those near the back of the line scarcely dared to breathe.\n\nThe Counter-Master then became still for a few moments, as if lost in thought, before furiously working at his pad. He would scroll, read for a bit, look at the creature before him, click his beak, and scroll some more. Every so often, he would type something quickly before continuing his frenetic reading. The crowd before him was getting confused, as they were getting mixed signals. Station-bound as they were, they had only ever seen a Targuien either level-headed, inebriated or angry. Being inebriated while on duty was out of the question, as it was punished by live *void-burial*, so he wasn't *mox-drunk* why hadn't he lashed out yet?\n\nMaster Leclerc started asking questions again, and he sounded almost, eager, excited? The being remained as calm and immobile as ever, though it still emitted that odd fog each time it spoke.\n\n\"You are of a species so far unknown to *Fret Targuien*, I will be asking a series of questions to determine if you are physically suitable to work on a vessel. Do you wish to enlist in the Targuien Merchant Marine?\"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\n\"How many *humans* are looking to enlist on vessel FT077762?\"\n\n\"Only one as far as I know.\"\n\n\"Does *human* physiology and psychology *require* individuals to have any contact with members of their own species to live and remain healthy?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Do you know the Targuien system of weights and measures?\"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\n\"Do you know of the Targuien Classification of Common Chemicals?\"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\n\"Which non-hazardous substances listed in the TCCC are hazardous to your species?\"\n\n\"Ammonia, cyanide salts, carbon monoxide, anything that reacts with water.\"\n\n\"What's water?\"\n\nThere is a slight pause. \"Liquid dihydrogen monoxide.\"\n\n\"Why are you concerned about reactions with dihydrogen monoxide, in liquid form no less? That is usually only found in labs and cooling systems.\"\n\n\"I am made of roughly 70% liquid dihydrogen monoxide.\"\n\nThe Targuien barked, \"Take two steps back!\"\n\nThe *human* did as ordered, but Counter-Master Leclerc was not reassured. *It's made of bloody corrosive poison! That's the smoke it's breathing out! What's it going to say next, that what's not 'water' in its body is bombs, knives and lasers? Wait, it said liquid, not solid. It's made lava. It's made of lava! That means...*\n\n\"What is your internal body temperature?\"\n\n\"165 degrees Dacc \\[37°C\\]\"\n\n*It could be me to a crisp just by touching me... No, no, no, stop thinking about, back to protocol, back to protocol! Get useful information from it, then get it far, far away!*\n\n\"What is your operating temperature range?\"\n\n\"With the equipment currently on my person, I can withstand temperatures as low as -3°D [-80°C], and as high as 200°D \\[60°C\\]. Temperatures outside that range will require additional equipment. Some of the equipment I am wearing will need to be shed as ambient temperature increases within that range. Temperatures in excess of 160°D \\[33°C\\] will my cause my body to excrete water to aid in cooling. Physical work in a hot environment may lead to heat stroke. A hot environment corresponds to temperatures in excess of 160°D\"\n\n*FUCK FUCK FUCK! GET THIS ABOMINATION AWAY FROM ME! WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT ONE OF THOSE ONBOARD! Wait, wait! That means it can go in the engine room with no equipment for extended periods of time! The engineers will pounce on the creature! If it can work properly, they'll be hounding the Upper Officers for more!   \nStop staring at it, you useless lump, and get back to work! The Logistics Officer at the airlock has been waiting for long enough!*\n\n\"What are your atmospheric needs?\" *It looks to be breathing here just fine, so it shouldn't be anything too esoteric*\n\n\"At Targuien standard pressure, I need 10% dioxygen, though I hav...\"\n\n\"Stop. Say that again.\"\n\n\"At Targuien standard pressure, I need to breathe a gas containing 10% dioxygen.\"\n\n\"You mean to tell me you *need* to breathe engine oxidizer, which is deadly at such concentrations to all currently known species.\"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\n\"How are you not dead right now?\"\n\n\"I have equipment on my person that extracts dioxygen from surrounding atmosphere and pumps it at the required concentration and quantity directly into one of my breathing orifices. The tube can be seen right here.\"\n\nThis impossible creature then points at the center of its face. Nearly invisible, under a large fleshy protrusion with two holes was indeed a sort of transparent tube which split into two plugs fitting neatly in the holes.\n\nThe Targuien visibly shuddered, then asked his next question.\n\n\"What are your dietary needs?\"\n\n\"Three quarters of a nutrition bar per cycle, along with 3 clacc \\[2.7L\\] of liquid dihydrogen monoxide. This must be supplemented with 9.75 noctvrys \\[5g\\] of sodium chloride and 1.7 eighth noctvrys of ascorbic acid\\[110mg\\].\"\n\n*It eats almost nothing, sprinkles it with poison and drinks lava. Why am not surprised?*\n\n\"Age?\"\n\n\"13 annum 14 weeks \\[16.5 years]\\\"\n\n\"Life expectancy of your species?\"\n\nThe candidate's right hand twitched. The answer came after a moment or two.  \n\"Between 56 and 73 annum \\[70-90 years\\] depending on the individual and their health. The oldest lived to be 98 annum 32 weeks \\[122 years 164 days\\]\"\n\nThe Targuien paused after writing the answer. *Holy shit. That's three times what I get to live... Wait. Does that mean...?*\n\n\"Are you a child?\"\n\n\"No. I have come of age 17 weeks ago \\[6 months\\].\"\n\nA pause. He looked at the creature, but not in the eye. He'd already made that mistake once.  \n\"Are you fully grown?\"\n\n\"No\"\n\nAnother pause. \"When will you be fully grown, and what will be the differences?\"\n\nThe human's hands had a slight tremor. \"I will grow a bit taller, perhaps one to one and a half nala \\[~10-15cm\\]. I will become stronger. The mind is said to be the last to become fully mature at around 16 annum 39 weeks of age. \\[21 years\\]\"\n\n\"You are already sexually mature.\"\n\nIt didn't really sound like a question, but the creature still answered. \"Yes\"\n\n*Well that's backward from the usual... weird, but still counts as able-bodied I guess?*\n\n\"What is the punishment for attempting procreation onboard?\"\n\n\"All parties involved in procreation are immediately Contemptuously Discharged and sent to the brig. They are dumped out at the next port. Air and other necessities are billed to their accounts, as if they were station-side.\"\n\n\"Good. Keep that in mind when onboard, there are *no* exceptions.  \nYou are report to the Logistics Officer at the end of the docking tube. You will announce yourself to him as not only a Probationary Voider under First Contact Protocols, but also as a chemical and environmental hazard. You will then be taken to a Medical Officer's office for examination. You are to obey them until your case has been evaluated by the Captain. He will decide whether or not you will remain a Hand on his vessel, and what your duties shall be. \nEnter the docking tube now.\"\n\nAs the human started moving, Counter-Master Rémy Leclerc stared at it. Its movements seemed strangely fluid and leisurely, despite the obvious imbalance created by its two legs. How it didn't fall to the side was beyond him.\n\nWhen the creature had disappeared through the airlock to the docking tube, the Targuien turned back to the line before him, and intoned in a voice that tried, and failed, to regain its stoicism.\n\n\"Next!\"\n\n---\n\nAda walked calmly and quietly as she went through the tube. Nothing showed on her face. After a few minutes, when she was sure no one would hear or see her from either end of the long tube, she started slowing down. By the time she had stopped, she was shaking and shivering. Her legs couldn't hold her anymore, and so she slumped against the wall. She hugged herself as she whispered over and over \"I'm in. I'm in. They can't get me now.\"\n\nAfter a while, she mumbled, \"I should get going before the next recruit finds me here.\"  \nShe got up, still hugging herself and shivering. As she neared the ship, it got less and less. By the time she could see the other end of the tube, she had regained her calm façade. She stepped into the airlock, its door closed behind her. As it was cycling, she straightened second overcoat and stood straight. The hatch in front of her opened soundlessly, and she stepped into her new life.\n\n[Previous][p]|[First][f]|[Next][n]",

Don't blindly follow anyone. Always patch test and get the smallest bottle when possible to see how your skin reacts before you invest in the bigger versions. Do not use strong actives without a derma consultation, you might damage your skin terribly. If possible always get a dermat consultation. Always introduce one product to your routine slowly and then increase your frequency - which is what I have done. I have never introduced more than one product at time.**\n\nHope you all have a great day! Feel free to ask me anything related to this post and products. Advance Happy New Year!\n\nLots of love,\n\n🧠\n\n(Unsure about clear skin, but my right hand is gonna shine brighter than the sun and clearer than glass! Also this post has taken an awfully long time over the past few weeks lol I think I'm ready to retire now).\n\nEdit: I have added the previous products I used before the HG products incase you want to know more about those! \n\nThank you for the awards 🥹 y'all always so sweet.

        "body": "**Part 2**\n\n**Tony moly wonder ceramide mochi toner (Got 500ml for Rs. 700)**\n\n*Previous review: Too early to comment, recent incorportation. Was using the cetaphil toner before that and didn't really provide any added benefits.*\n\nCurrent review: I do have a comment or more now, hehe. So this is nice and thick and absorbs well into my skin. My tret skin absolutely loves the ceramides in it. My only wish is that it goes fragrance free, because it is quite strong and is giving me a headache. The fragrance also stings my face although it doesn't cause any other irritation. If this was fragrance free would have been my HG. Will finish the bottle then look out for others.\n\nScent: strong citrus smell, very lemony\n\nSpreadability: slightly thick and runny milky solution that spreads very well on the skin.\n\nIngredients: Water Dipropylene Glycol Glycerin Water Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate Glycereth-26 1,2-Hexanediol Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil Water Phenyl Trimethicone Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer Styrene/VP Copolymer Centella Asiatica Extract Ethylhexylglycerin Glycerin Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer Tromethamine Disodium EDTA Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil Citrus Limon (Lemon) Seed Oil Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride Water Allantoin Hydrogenated Lecithin Phytosteryl/Octyldodecyl Lauroyl Glutamate Panthenol Ceramide NP Sodium Hyaluronate.\n\nPreviously used: Cetaphil Bright Healthy Radiance Brightness Refresh Toner.\n\n**Klairs Fundamental Watery Oil Drop (Got 50ml for Rs. 1100)**\n\nOh my gosh. I absolutely love this. Using this when tret purge started and my skin is just absolutely loving it. I stopped my vitamin c during the purge, cause didn't want to irritate my active acne. Need some antioxidant and this serum is literally an all in one serum. The ingredient list is crazy good and the formulation is done so well. This product shows the power of K beauty according to me. Although the name contains it is not oily at all. My skin just drinks it all up. Super light weight serum that provides the benefits of facial oil plus ceramides plus peptides plus antioxidants - amazing right? Provides hydration, anti-ageing, and skin regeneration. I highly recommend this. It's expensive but worth it if you are looking for just one versatile serum. This worked so well for me so at least for my skin type I highly recommend this. Quite the underrated product.\n\nScent: smells of nothing.\n\nSpreadability: Has a very runny water texture. Few drops is sufficient to cover face and neck beautifully and evenly. Absorbs quickly by the skin without leaving any kind of oily feeling nor residue. Gives a dewy look.\n\nIngredients: Aqua(Water), Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Water, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Bifida Ferment Extract, Betaine, Dipropylene Glycol, Sorbitol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Aspergillus/Rice Ferment Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Arginine, Carbomer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ceramide NP, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Copper Tripeptide-1, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8.Previously used: No product by itself that fits this versatile range.\n\n**TO 100% L-Ascorbic acid powder (Got 15g gifted)**\n\nThis vitamin C was so potent and provided me all the benefits of vitamin C. It is not part of my current routine due to the lack of time in the morning since making the mixture takes time. I would prefer a prior formulated version but nothing has been as effective as this. My current routine utilises Klairs Vitamin C (currently on pause until the purge is done) which is good but nothing compared to this. Definitely won't use on active acne cause this does cause irritation then unless you can formulate in a very low dose way. I used to mix it with hyaluronic acid then followed the recipe from labmuffin's site \\[[https://labmuffin.com/easy-5-minute-diy-vitamin-c-serum-recipe/\\]](https://labmuffin.com/easy-5-minute-diy-vitamin-c-serum-recipe/]). \n\nScent: Nothing. Literally nothing lol or maybe my nose has become numb\n\nSpreadability: Depends on your formulaiton.Ingredients: Ascorbic acid.\n\nPreviously used: TO Ascorbic acid 8% + Alpha arbutin 2%, Garnier Vitamin C Booster Serum\n\n**TO copper peptides 1% + buffet (Got 30ml for Rs. 1500)**\n\n*Previous review: Really nice, helped with premature fine lines and skin bumps which seems to run genetically in my family. I also love its colour hehe.*\n\nCurrent review: Really good serum! Will continue to use. I do use it with tret but my skin can tolerate it, I wouldn't recommend you to. Still love the colour. I wish it was less expensive but it is worth it personally.\n\nScent: Metallic scent but extremely mild and tolerable.\n\nSpreadability: Spreads like a thick gel like consistency (very similar to TO niacinamide serum consistency). Spreads neatly and evenly. Doesn't pill or froth up like the niacinamide. Gives a nice glow to the face post application with matte finish. Does not leave sticky residue.\n\nIngredients: Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Lactococcus Ferment Lysate, Copper Tripeptide-1, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Pentapeptide-18, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-38, Dipeptide Diaminobutyroyl Benzylamide Diacetate, Acetylarginyltryptophyl Diphenylglycine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Glycine, Alanine, Serine, Valine, Isoleucine, Proline, Threonine, Histidine, Phenylalanine, Arginine, Aspartic Acid, Trehalose, Fructose, Glucose, Maltose, Urea, Sodium Pca, Pca, Sodium Lactate, Citric Acid, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Sodium Benzoate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.\n\nPreviously used: De Construct Retinol + Peptides\n\n**Niamax d gel (4% niacinamide) (Got 20g for Rs. 220)**\n\n*Previous review: 4% niacinmaide and does not irritate my skin. Recent addition to my routine so need more time to pass before making further comments. So far so good.*\n\nCurrent review: Still love it, very good niacinamide. Anything above 6% my skin seems to just break out this has been great and providing with niacinamide benefits. Good for a beginner as well. A huge HG for the price. If this costs like beauty brands products price, I would still purchase. It has a thick gel consistency that beautifully is absorbed by the skin. Feels very nice on the skin. Did not sting or cause other uncomfortable sensation. Highly recommend.\n\nScent: Very chemically smell but it does not bother me, when applied on face can barely smell it.\n\nSpreadability: Gel like consistency, doesn't create a mess and can easily be spread on the face without difficulty. Gives an initial dewy look which turns into matte finish later. Does not leave any sticky residue.\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Panthenol, Niacinamide, Glycerine, Carbomer 940, Propylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Zinc Gluconate, Edta Disodium, Triethanolamine.\n\nPreviously used: TO Niacinamide + Zinc, Minimalist 10% Niacinamide, Plum 10% niacinamide with rice water\n\n*To be noted: I have no image with swatches as this product is empty and discarded. I am using another niacinamide product so I have not repurchased this. Once this is over, I will repurchase for sure.To be continued*",

        "body": "**Part 8**\n\n**Isntree airy sun stick (Got 22ml as gift)**\n\n*Previous review: Doesn't really provide enough protection when topping up my sunscreen while I'm outside. I need to swipe many many many times to achieve adequate protection.*\n\nCurrent review: It does provide adequate protection if you swipe about 8+ times on the face but this makes the face feel oily and feels heavy. Although it doesn't look oily but the heaviness is quite difficult to deal with. I am still using it and for hygiene purpose this does seem the best option. I prefer this over using my hands when I'm out unless I have access to wash my hands. If there are dust and other particles on your face this can stick to the sun stick which isn't fun.. However, it doesn't break me out, doesn't irritate my skin, doesn't cause me to sweat, the oily feeling disappears in 15 minutes or so (definitely bearable until then for skin protection, although multiple swipes makes the product finish faster and this is quite expensive). My skin does love it and I have grown towards it now. 8+ swipes on my face does last for over 2 hours which is great. I have once been out in the sun for 6 hours straight and only reapplied once and my face did not tan (body did) so this definitely protects well with appropriate number of swipes - for me 8-10 swipes seems to do the trick. It didn't sting my face or eyes. No irritation. Nice packaging, nice shape, and super super easy application. Slightly made my skin look dull on some days but lately there is no dullness. Also, zero white cast.\n\nScent: Mild chemical fragrance that is not noticeable\n\nSpreadability: Spreads beautifully on the skin without swiping harshly. Very easy application. Easy to apply multiple layers. Doesn't stretch skin or tugs on it hard. Very soft application.\n\nIngredients: Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\nPreviously used: CeraVe Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Spf 50 Stick Invisible Zinc\n\n**Malibu SPF 30 watermelon (Got 5g for Rs. 250)**\n\n*Previous review: feels nice on my lips and has no tint (what I prefer) and so far prevents hyperpigmentation of my lips. I do want to try the minimalist lip balm.*\n\nCurrent review: Do not want to try the minimalist lip balm haha at least not right now. This might not be as moisturising as one would aim from a lip balm. I usually have the vaseline tin on me. My lip routine includes my moisturiser and sunscreen onto my lips. When it feels dry at home, I usually use CeraVe healing ointment or vaseline tin (pain to open that, it is a war every single time). If i'm out this seems to do the trick. Usually lip balm makes my lip look oily and cause me to sweat around my lips which makes the initial balm to slide off and caused small breakouts around my lips as well as hyperpigmentation.\n\nSide-note: MAC fizzy feels lip balm is amazing for moisture but no sun protection and limited edition (as if the price point is okay lol). It sits very well without causing any breakouts or other issue. Nor does it slide off easily or make my lips oily.\n\nBack to the point: Prior to lip sleeping mask from laneige, this solely wouldn't have provided adequate moisture but after the mask this does work very well for me without making my lip oily or the surrounding skin to sweat/breakout. It sits nicely on my lips for a long time and I haven't gotten sun spots or other sun damage since wearing this. I do swipe it around the lips around 4 to 5 times for adequate SPF and it sits comfortably without making my lips looks greasy. It has fragrance but I enjoy it. Quite calming. Wouldn't recommend if you are using this mainly for moisturising benefits. Perhaps sebamed or other pharma products would help better. Still looking for my HG lip balm with SPF as this has quite weak filters.\n\nScent: Artificial watermelon, heh.\n\nSpreadability: Thick and waxy in the case but melts properly on the lips. Doesn't feel heavy, only for the first few seconds. I do apply multiple coats so it does feel heavier than usual lip balms but it doesn't cause me discomfort and I don't sense it after a couple of minutes. Spreads easily on the lips and stays there without sliding off. Nor does it gets quickly absorbed (need that with SPF).\n\nIngredients: Petrolatum and Paraffinum Liquidum (Mineral Oil) and Paraffin Wax, Homosalate, Octocrylene, Carnauba Wax, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl, Salicylate Flavour, Limonene, Lanalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Citral, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol.\n\nPreviously used: Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Lip Moisturizer For Dry Lip With SPF 15, Sebamed Lip Defense SPF 30.\n\n**Laneige lip sleeping mask (Got 20g as gift)**\n\n*Previous review: Expensive but the quantity is insane. A little goes a long way, I do use my moisturiser over my lips, then add this onto that. I do not use this when I've cracked lips - I use cera ve healing ointment (my HG) but I use this for other times. Just feels nice and also prevents my lips to crack during night and keeps it plump in the AM.*\n\nCurrent review: This has reduced the amount of cracked lips I deal with. I used to apply little and didn't really see much benefit but when I applied a thicker version, oh my gosh! Made my lips so soft and plump. I have never woken up and felt my lip this soft. I thought this was such a hyped product and still think so it is overhyped but maaaan, this is good for my lips. It made my lips look brighter possibly because it felt hydrated. Generally brought out my natural lip colour nicely. Even a family member noticed the difference lol and that made me feel validated. I love it. I still do want to try the Cosrx Balancium Ceramide Lip Butter Sleeping Mask because well ceramides but why fix something that is not broken? But currrioooosssiityy. Let's see. This has a long way to go for it to be over so I can mull over this until then.\n\nScent: Pleasant fruity smell that reminds me of strawberry. Mild sweet smell that cannot be noticed upon application.\n\nSpreadability: Thick gel like consistency that spreads easily on the lips. It feels slightly heavy on the lips upon application although that does diminish. I can personally feel something present on my lips for an hour or two but it doesn't cause me discomfort or any irritation.\n\nIngredients: Diisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl/Isostearyl/Cetyl/Stearyl/Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated C6-14 Olefin Polymers, Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax, Shea Butter, Synthetic Wax, Candelilla Wax, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Hydrogenated Butylene/Ethylene/Styrene Copolymer, Ethylene/Propylene/Styrene Copolymer, Mica, Astrocaryum murumuru Seed Butter, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethicone, Aromatics, Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Carnauba Wax, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, CI 15985, CI 15850, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Water, Potassium Alginate, Propanediol, Glycerin, Alcohol, Lycium Fruit Extract, Cranberry Fruit Extract, Strawberry Fruit Extract, Raspberry Fruit Extract, Sapindus mukurossi Fruit Extract, Blueberry Fruit Extract, Rubus chamaemorus Seed Extract, Coffee Extract, Chenopodium quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Ascorbyl Glucoside.\n\nPreviously used: Dot & Key Lip Plumping Sleeping Mask Vitamin C + E Lip Balm 💀",

I have also used the TO and minimalist SA, they're also effective but this does the job in lesser price and feels nicer to apply on the skin! Would prefer it in a pump as it keeps running out of the tube - big amounts flow out even with the smallest squeeze, which can cause product waste when I use it only as spot treatment but for now i apply the rest on arm and back.*\n\nCurrent review: Good spot treatment, used it on face and it caused damage to my skin barrier despite being 1% SA only. As a spot treatment it does very well. Pocket friendly and little goes a long way. HG for spot treatment.\n\nScent: Pleasant fruity smell that is not overpowering. Reminds me of salon facial smells lol Can be noticed but will disappear in a minute or two and doesn't linger or bother me.\n\nSpreadability: Spreads super easily and quite a runny consistency. Spreads evenly and absorbs into the skin quickly. Gives a dewy look for few seconds ends up with matte finish.  Does leave a mild sticky residue. Not an issue during spot treatments.\n\nIngredients: Salicylic Acid, Zinc Gluconate, Magnesium Aspartate, Copper Gluconate, Alpha Bisabolol Natural (Natural), Allantoin, Aloe Vera, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Propylene Glycol, Dccb-3031 Fluid, Fragrance.\n\nPreviously used: TO salicylic serum (anhydrous and the water soluble one), Minimalist salicylic acid.\n\n**Hyalugel (1% hyaluronic acid). (Got 30g for Rs. 100)**\n\nSuch a good hyaluronic acid, I use it the day I do chemical exfoliation (weekend). This and my moisturiser provides all the hydration and nutrients my skin requires on the day of exfoliation. This gives a nice plump and glowing skin. Gives a cool and a refreshing feel to the skin. Do not apply on dry face as you won't get the full benefit and it can leave a sticky residue. Apply on damp face, it is absolutely gorgeous. Definitely apply a moisturiser after. This cannot replace a moisturiser. I also used hyalugel plus and did not find any additional benefit to this (didn't use it for long time but why fix something that is not broken?). Use it on damp skin as hyaluronic acid is a humectant.\n\nScent: Barely smells of anything, faint chemical scent that disappears in the couple of seconds.\n\nSpreadability: Spreads wonderfully on damp/wet skin. If applied on non-damp/wet skin then it has this tightening feeling which isn't enjoyable. On damp skin it spreads evenly and does not leave any sticky residue. Gives cooling sensation upon application.\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer Sodium (and) aqua, Sodium Benzoate, Glycerine.\n\nPreviously used: Earth Rhythm Hyaluronic Acid Serum, TO Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, L'oreal Paris Revitalift Filler Serum with 1.5% Hyaluronic Acid\n\n**Aziderm gel (15% azelaic acid) (Got 15g for Rs. 200)** \n\n*Previous review: Was using AA from TO, didn't like the way it felt but helped with hyperpigmentation. This particular one have been using for two months, and spreads so nicely, no gritty sensation and continues to help with my hyperpigmentation.*\n\nCurrent review: Ditto what said above. Love it. As long as they keep making this formulation, I will continue to use it. Such a good underrated versatile ingredient.\n\nScent: Has a synthetic chemically fragrance that is strong from the tube but minimally noticeable upon application.\n\nSpreadability: Creamy consistency, light-weight. Absorbed into the skin within seconds, gives a matte finish. Does not leave sticky residue or feel heavy. Gives also a cooling effect on application.\n\nIngredients: Azelaic acid 15%\n\nPreviously used: TO Azelaic acid 10%, Paula's choice 10% azelaic acid booster cream\n\n**Inkey list (2% Tranexamic acid) (Got 30ml as a gift)** \n\n*Previous review: Love this for my PIH, has reduced the hyperpigmentation more than AA.*\n\nCurrent review: Yep the same. This applies really well on the skin. It contains 2% acai berry extract and 2% vitamin c which further boosts in making the skin even toned. It really works very well with azelaic acid for old stubborn pigmentation and gives relatively quicker results together. This is a very good formulation.\n\nScent: it has this barbecue scent, not enjoyable but it disappears in a matter of minutes. I usually don't smell it when I apply it on my face because it is layered on the other products. When I put it own its own then its slightly noticeable but I do not have an issue with it.\n\nSpreadability: It is a thick gel that spreads so beautifully. Leaves a matte finish. Does not leave any sticky residue. Absorbs super fast on the skin.\n\nIngredients: Aqua (Water/ Eau), Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Tranexamic Acid, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, 1-Methylhydanto- in-2-Imide, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Phenoxyethanol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Cetearyl Olivate, Benzyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Olivate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Lecithin, Squalane, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Gluconate, Polysorbate 60, Dehydroacetic Acid, Lactobacillus Ferment, Sorbitan Isostearate.\n\nPreviously used: Minimalist 3% Tranexamic Acid",

        "body": "**Part 5**\n\n**Iliyoon ceramide ato concentrate cream (Got 200ml for Rs. 2000)**\n\nLove love love love love! This is such a good ceramide cream, that is thick and amazing for those who have irritated skin or damaged barrier or dry skin or skin being treated with tret. This was the perfect addition on tret nights. I love this. Used to use emolene in the PM but it did not suffice during tret nights. Using this, i have gotten no skin irritation or peeling with tret. This has kept my skin moisturised and healthy throughout the night. Gives a nice plump skin. Love it! Personally too heavy in the AM. Also a little goes a long way. It really is thick. It has encapsulated ceramides (patented ingredient) which allows it to be long lasting and quite potent. I do want to try out aestura atobarrier 365 cream at some point but right now this is working so well for me, so why fix something that's not broken.\n\nScent: No remarkable/noticeable smell.\n\nSpreadability: Thick baume-y creamy texture that spreads easily on the face. A small size is more than sufficient, otherwise it can get too much real quickly and make it difficult for your skin to \"breathe\". Small amount goes a long way and produces a nice glow to the skin. It does not leave a sticky residue and although you can sense it on your face as it is slightly on the heavier side, it does not cause any discomfort. The sensation disappears in a matter of couple minutes.\n\nIngredients: Purified Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Stearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Palmitic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Magnolia Biondii Flower Extract, Perilla Ocymoides Seed Extract, Lactobacillus/​Soybean Ferment Extract, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA (Ceramide Pc-104 6310Ppm), C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohols, Glyceryl Caprylate, Dimethiconol, Mannitol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Alcohol, Acrylates/​Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cholesterol, Polysorbate 20, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Propanediol.\n\nPreviously used: COSRX Balancium Comfort Ceramide Cream, emolene\n\n**Emolene (Got 100g for Rs. 220)**\n\nI think we have all heard lots about this. My dry skin drinks it up. It provides me with good moisturiser throughout night. This is my last step in the night routine and my skin doesn't feel dry when I wake up. Obviously not strong enough during tret nights so I use this on all the other nights and love it. It is going strong. It has not caused me any CCs (closed comedones). I'm aware many people on the sub have gotten CCs because of this. I know oily skin shouldn't really use this because of the CCs but unsure about dry skin peeps. Maybe another dry skin fellow can clarify their experience. Works great for me will continue to use it. Does great for the given price point. It is beautiful and makes my skin plum and beautiful. Gives a lovely glow right after application.\n\nScent: Faint chemical smell that is not noticeable.\n\nSpreadability: Watery cream texture that can be smoothly applied. Gives a nice cooling effect and I enjoy it very much on my skin. It gives me a dewy look at the end. Skin feels instantly hydrated. Easy to apply but squeeze gently otherwise a lot of product can come out and get messy. Quickly absorbed on the skin. Leaves a mild sticky residue that does die in couple of minutes.\n\nIngredients: Lecithin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Carbomer 934, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Capric Acid Triglyceride, Dimethicone, Squalene, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Stearic Acid, Glycol Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Myristyl Myristate, C-10-30 Carboxylic Acid Sterol Ester, Butylated Hydroxy Anisole, Toluene, Water, EDTA.\n\nPreviously used: COSRX Balancium Comfort Ceramide Cream\n\n**TO 100% Organic Cold Pressed Rose Hip Seed Oil (Got 30ml as a gift)** \n\n*Previous review:  Smells like rose plant stems and I love it haha, it is a good occlusive which doesn't break me out. It also has anti-ageing and hyperpigmentation benefits, though I am yet to witness that. Has been a recent addition and non-consistent use until now. Gotta wait and see.*\n\nCurrent review: A very good light oil if you are looking for extra moisture retention during cold winters or tret nights. I use this on non-tret nights as well for the past couple of days. Overall this produces a nice occlusive. I do not massage it into my skin so might no get all the benefits of rose hip oil. It is said to help with hyperpigmentation and ageing skin but I use other products that target this so I cannot comment on that. I have not used this on its own unlike others to know its true benefits. It has always been a supplement to my other skincare products. I do massage this onto my skin during weekends and I wake up with nice glowy soft skin the next day. I massage it into my lips every night and it has made my lips brighter and helps with evening the tone of my lips (still have a two toned lips and I love it that way. I just want the tone on upper lip to be same and the lower lip to be same. So not using this for elimination of two toned lips as that is genetics and it is beautiful). This doesn't make my skin feel oily and I have noticed an extra glow and softness when I use this. Few drops goes a long way. On days where I get time to pamper myself, I do use a jade roller with this oil and my skin looks amazing the next day.\n\nScent: Smells like rose plant stems and I love it haha. The strength of the scent does diminish over time but it is still noticeable. It is mild and barely noticeable when layered on other products. Have not applied on bare skin to know about the scent then. Even if I have noticed the smell (mainly cause I actively try to smell it)l, it only lasts for few seconds.\n\nSpreadability: Spreads like the usual thin runny oil. I pat it on to my face so it does make me look like a glazed donut. This appearance dies down in the next hour. If you massage it in, it leaves a shine on your face that stays for an hour. Doesn't make your skin feel suffocated. Light weight oil that absorbs quite easily depending on application method. Does not make skin sticky or give that classic oily sensation (I usually cannot tolerate oil as it gives me splitting migraines - this and argan oil seems to be magic for me)\n\nIngredients: Rosa Canina Seed Oil\n\nPreviously used: The Moms Co Age Control Face Oil\n\n**CeraVe Healing Ointment (Got 85g for Rs.1500)** \n\n*Previous review: This is basically petroleum jelly with ceramides and nothing has healed my broken skin like this. For me and my family. So good for my cracked lips. A nice occlusive, will not break you out. I just love it. My HG for skin repair.*\n\nCurrent reivew: This like an upgraded version of vaseline (mineral oil). This contains ceramides and I love ceramides in my skin care products. Also has hyaluronic acid. Very good for irritated skin, damaged barrier, cracked lip, cracked feet, dry hands. Very versatile and can be essentially used almost anywhere on the body. Aids in skin healing, chafing, itchyness, and dryness. Good for using as a protective layer on vulnerable skin during tret application or peels. Have used it on chemically burned skin and it really helped. Very soothing for me.\n\nScent: No remarkable/noticeable smell\n\nSpreadability: Spreads like vaseline except better. This melts into oily like consistency but doesn't feel oily on the skin. My skin immediately absorbs it and leaves behind a shiny skin that is extremely soft. My dry skin just takes it all in. It spreads like a cleansing balm, thick while out of the tube and melts onto your skin and with massage absorbs quite quick. Beware, if you are in higher temperature, or your skin is warmer than usual, this can become a runny mess that can slide off your face or gets absorbed too quickly and not provide the occlusive layer you are looking for (can be an issue for using on the lips as constant reapplication will be required). It does not feel too heavy which is a bonus.\n\nIngredients: Petrolatum, Mineral Oil, Paraffin, Ozokerite, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Ceramide 1, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-11, Tocopheryl Acetate, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Panthenol, Water, L-Proline, Xanthan Gum\n\nPreviously used: Vaseline original petroleum jelly",

It has 1% glycolic acid that helps in giving the face a nice glow and also reduces hyperpigmentation from dark spots (post inflammatory hyperpigmentation/PIH). Very similar to AHAglow face wash except it has more beneficial ingredients. Does not dry your face (coming from a dry skin person). Feels nice and soft after washing and skin doesn't feel tight.\n\nScent: It has a fresh clean scent, like a freshly cleaned item\n\nSpreadability: minimally thick, spreads like a dream on a damp face (harder on dry face).

It melts well into the skin, does not leave an oily film nor does it strip my skin. Very good for dehydrated and dry skin. Has a really nice ingredient list.  Emulsifies beautifully upon water contact and does leave an oil film. Removes my mascara and sunscreen (mineral + chemical) completely. Did not cause breakouts. It did not help with my PIH (wasn't expecting it to) nor with my sebaceous filaments (SFs) on the nose. I did notice reduction in SFs while using klairs gentle black deep cleansing oil. Bonus point for packaging. Such a good designed package. It has an upper lid with the small spatula then a lid below with plastic cover which you need to remove to access the balm. The spatula sits on the plastic at other times.\n\nScent: smells of nothing lol maybe mild oil like scent but generally of nothing\n\nSpreadability: beautiful cloudy smooth texture that spreads so easily.

Cleanses my face well without stripping my skin. I love it.*\n\nCurrent review: Yep, obviously my HG. Still love it. The addition of niacinamide also gives me a glow. I was very hesitant to try the new formulated version. But I absolutely love it. Actually this has less irritants than the previous formulated version but the niacinamide might not work for few people. I'm glad I took the risk, I did try it out first with someone who owned it before buying the 500ml. My advise is to try it with a small bottle and see how it goes if you really want to use this. Also it will not remove water resistant sunscreen or stubborn products and make up, need to use an oil cleanser/balm or micellar water as first cleanse in the PM.\n\nScent: Smells barely of anything, unless you bring it very very close to smell a huge pump then faint fevicol smell.\n\nSpreadability: Spreads very well on face and doesn't foam up (unless you use your first cleanse then it foam up from the remnants of that) but cleans skin very gentle and effectively.

Just resolving from the purging stage and I can see quite a clear skin in certain areas. Let's see how it continues to progress.\n\nScent: No remarkable/noticeable smell.\n\nSpreadability: Metallic creamy texture which spreads easily on skin.

It has retinaldehyde which supposedly more potent than usual retinol/retinoids (not more that tret). I would just use this all over my face if the price wasn't too expensive lol. I have eye lid bumps (genetic), this has helped reduce them. I have very few remaining now. Some of the fine lines undereye area has been smoothened out because of this. This did not cause any eye irritation or any troubles. Only love for this product!! Super HG lol. This has very good formulation with peptides (is said to further enhance the anti-ageing effects). It has a higher concentration of ginseng than retinal which makes it quite gentle but effective. Always a bonus for their asthetic packaging. Initial few pumps had issues but after that it has been sailing smoothly. Do not press a full pump, that is too much product.

I got this as a gift the first time many months ago and used it all up and my skin loved it. But I presumed the price of it was because of the brand label and used various gel moisturisers. I need lighter moisturisers during the day or my skin just sweats and itches like crazy. It was honestly quite difficult to be honest to find something that worked for me well in the AM. The closest I got was using Cetaphil Bright Healthy Radiance Night Comfort Cream (for AM yes). This was great until I started back on tret. I needed that extra care for my skin. So I decided to go back to this and this just works like a charm. I love it and I wish it wasn't this expensive but I'm ready to spend on this  for as long as I'm on tret.  I still have 1 new tub of cetaphil which im currently using in between on morning of tret night and it seems to be fine. This has given my hydrated skin, dehydrated skin itself will make it look darker and older. This just plumps up my skin, gives it a healthy look. I also appreciate the forumla, it is has a very good formulation. Plus points for urea, green tea, caffeine, and lactobacillus ferment lysate. It is a great formulation, something I usually see only in K-beauty. This feels really good on my face!\n\nScent: It has a noticeable fruity medicinal smells that disappears quickly. Although noticeable quite strongly during the initial application it fortunately dies down in couple of seconds.\n\nSpreadability: Gel consistency that gives a very nice cooling sensation on the face. It spreads very evenly and nicely. Does not leave any stick residue and gives a beautiful sheen to the face. You can instantly observe the skin looking well hydrated. Beautiful texture and feel.\n\nIngredients: Water/ Aqua/ Eau, Dimethicone, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Trisiloxane, Trehalose, Sucrose, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Silybum Marianum (Lady'S Thistle) Extract, Betula Alba (Birch) Bark Extract, Saccharomyces Lysate Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Caffeine, Sorbitol, Palmitoyl Hexapeptide -12, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth -10, Sodium Polyaspartate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Polysaccharides, Lactobacillus Ferment Lysate, Saccharide Isomerate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/C10 -30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Polymethacrylate, Tromethamine, Peg -8, Hexylene Glycol, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citric Acid, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Citrate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\nPreviously used: I have lost count but right before this was Cetaphil Bright Healthy Radiance Night Comfort Cream.",

It has helped with my hyperpigmentation and hasn't irritated my skin.*Current review: This is a good chemical exfoliation (AHA) for once a week. It is very good for tanned skin and hyper-pigmented skin. Also beneficial for acne scars. If you have too many active acne, better to go for BHA exfoliation as it has antibacterial properties. BHA is better for oily skin as well. Anyway, this is a good exfoliation for dry skin and this particular formulation (mainly because of tasmannia lanceolata fruit extract) doesn't irritate or dry out the skin further. Relatively quick results can be observed with consistent weekly usage. I also use it on my body and it has helped with tan significantly although not for ingrown or keratosis pilaris (KP) - BHA more suitable.Scent: Sour milk - might be too strong for some but for me it is fine. Barely noticeable post application.Spreadability: Spreads like a normal water serum. Very thin and light weight, slightly stings the skin on some occasions but has not caused irritation as yet. Absorbs into the skin very very quickly. Feels like nothing has been applied to the face, extremely light weight. Almost same consistency and feel of applying just water on the face.Ingredients: Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Propanediol, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Isoceteth-20, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.Previously used: TO AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution\n\n**Demalogica Daily Microfoliant (Got 74f for Rs. 3000)**\n\n*Previous review: This is a physical scrub, and if used correctly will not cause micro-tears in skin. Nothing has given an immediate glow like this has. This is expensive, very expensive, you do get a mini version, which is also expensive but will last a long time. But this was an investment I saved up for a long time. I'm so glad I got it. If there is a function or any other occasion this gives me an instant glow and bright skin. Nothing has ever given me the same results!*\n\nCurrent review: I think the above one speaks enough. I do use it whenever I feel my skin could do with some extra brightness and glow. I do not use it on tret days. You don't want to over-exfoliate your skin and damage it. This product is quite amazing and I love it. Reduces dullness, increases firmness and gives soft glowing bright soft skin. This is like a 2 minute instant glow up facial.  It is gentle and did not strip my skin of its natural oils. Did not get that tight sensation post wash. So far has not caused any irritation or skin issues.\n\nScent: Tolerable chemical fragrance\n\nSpreadability: Depends on how well you mix it and your consistency of choice. I get a foam out of it and the foam applies like.. how every foam is applied. Super easy and fun. Not messy and it sits on the face without any discomfort. Spreads easily and washes off easily.\n\nIngredients: Microcrystalline Cellulose, Magnesium Oxide, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Colloidal Oatmeal, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Starch, Hydrogenated Coconut Acid, Allantoin, Papain, Salicylic Acid, Ginkgo Biloba Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, PCA, Populus Tremuloides Bark Extract, Cyclodextrin, Sodium Isethionate, Lauryl Methacrylate/Glycol Dimethacrylate Copolymer, Maltodextrin, Melaleuca, Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Hydrolyzed Corn Starch Hydroxyethyl Ether, Water/Aqua/Eau, Limonene, Citric Acid.\n\nPreviously used: Klairs Gentle Black Sugar Facial Polish\n\nP.S - Can get 13g for Rs. 877\n\n**I’m From Honey Mask (Got 110g for Rs. 1800)**\n\n*Previous review: This is such a nice mask. After chemical exfoliation or peels, I put this. This moisturises my skin so nice. It smells like honey which is a smell I enjoy. It keeps your skin glowing and plum and a mask I highly recommend. Quite pricey though. I did get 4 bottles of mugwort essence 30ml for free though, and I love those. One day might buy the bigger version of it.*\n\nCurrent review: I ensure weekly once I use this. It has such a strong formulation and gives me such soft moisturised skin. The only proper mask that makes me feel hydrated post mask application. Honey is such a good ingredient for the skin and usually DIY using honey is a mess sticky process and won't be utilised by the skin properly. With proper formulation this introduces good moisture to my face. The scent also calms me so applying this is usually quite therapeutic for me. Very good for irritated skin or damaged barrier. Extremely good for dry skin.\n\nScent: Strong honey fragrance that I thoroughly enjoy. Will not recommend this to those that cannot tolerate honey smell. You can smell it on your face and it only disappears once you wash off the mask completely. Very gourmand scent that I may have tasted it (extremely bitter, please do not taste it).\n\nSpreadability: Spreads nothing like honey, honey is a thick sticky messy. This is a beautiful thin creamy mask that spreads so beautifully and amazingly that I have no words to describe it. I was worried about the texture and it being runny. It is not at all runny. It sits beautifully on my face and I continue doing my chores and there have been occasions where I have forgotten about it. It doesn't dry out and tighten your skin. It does not harden. It is too beautiful to be described by words. It spreads beautifully and easily without any mess and can be washed off as easy as application. It can be comfortably worn and is not sticky. Gets removed easily by water and doesn't need harsh rubbing on the skin. Not heavy and spreads easily with fingers or silicone brush.\n\nIngredients: Honey, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Pentylene Glycol, Microcrystalline Wax, Polysorbate 20, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Beeswax, Tocopheryl Acetate, Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract, Corylus Avellana (Hazel) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Water, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Propolis Extract, Beta-Glucan, Bee Venom, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Sophora Angustifolia Root Extract, Eugenia Caryophyllus (Clove) Flower Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Punica Granatum Fruit Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin.\n\nP.S - 30g is available on beauty-barn for Rs. 499.\n\nPreviously used: Bliscent Chocolate & Licorice Face Mask",

        "body": "**Part 9**\n\n**Honorable mentions - mini review**\n\n  \n**TO pycnogenol** \\- such a beautiful antioxidant that smells of pine trees. Love its colour. Easy to apply and gets absorbed quickly. Does not make skin look oily. It is quite a potent antioxidant and truly underrated. Brightened my skin beautifully (back to the original tone not whitened please). My favourite part of this is it can recycle oxidised vitamin c and restore its activity - 👏 just amazing. So it is. brilliant to use with vitamin c but also equally good to use for those who cannot tolerate vitamin c. This is product showed me the quickest result - within a week of consistent usage. I absolutely love it. My mother stole it from me and I haven't re-ordered it yet but right after writing this up I will. Powerful and effective antioxidant. 10/10  \n\n\n**Klairs vitamin C** \\- despite being only 5% ascorbic acid and coming in a f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* transparent bottle, this vitamin c works so well for my skin. Did not irritate me. It has a nice warm sensorial effect on application. Absorbs well into the skin without leaving oily or sticky residue. It brings a lovely glow to my skin and seems to work well even on days I used with active acne (I DO NOT advise this, don't be a fool like me even if it worked). 8/10  \nIsntree hyaluronic water acid sun gel - Feels nice and cooling  and gives a dewy finish. Leaves a mild white cast that can be blended out with extra time. Does not sting or irritate eye and face. Did cause my skin to be dull but that seemed to have been temporary. 9.5/10\n\n  \n**COSRX propolis light ampoule** \\- Beautiful product that makes skin glow and so soft. It was very beneficial for me when I damaged my skin barrier. This has calmed the redness and irritation and helped healing my skin beautifully along side with the Cera ve healing ointment. Super expensive but I feel like its worth the price if you have a damaged barrier or irritated skin. I do want to try the same line's toner because I have heard some great things about it. Maybe that will be my HG toner who knows? If any of you have used it, kindly share your experience please.  10/10\n\n  \n**COSRX advance radiance dual essence** \\- This is such a beautiful 5% niacinamide product with all the benefits of snail mucin. This did so well on my skin but I just couldn't justify the price. I can get the benefits of niacinamide from niamax d gel for so cheap. I do keep an eye out for when it goes on sale because it truly is an amazing product and right now I'm using it and I remembered how much I love it. Let's see, I am not that much in love with snail mucin but maybe when this is over I will remember it in its full glory. 10/10\n\n  \n**De La Cruz sulfur ointment** \\- This is a HG but I just didn't know what category to put it on? Lol. The only thing that helped with my hyperpigmentation around my mouth. It is still present but reduced the intensity. The benefit was only seen with consistent usage over a period of months. Do not expect a miracle. This was also recommended by a dermatologist but once again I repeat it needs months of consistent usage.  8.5/10\n\n  \n**Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream for Dry & Sensitive Skin** \\- Basic moisturiser that is good for body and skin. Whenever I want to take a break from all actives or out on vacation this is my go to moisturiser. I always have a stock of this. I only use this moisturising cream. Days where I exfoliate or chemical peels this is the my go to moisturiser. Doesn't cause me to break out, does not irritate my skin, absorbs beautifully, good basic formulation, good to use during \"no active days\". Provides good moisture. 9/10 (because it is basic at the end of the day, but basic is great for sensitive or beginner or tired or \"normal\" skin)",

        "body": "**Part 7**\n\n**Klairs fundamental eye awakening gel (Got 35ml for Rs. 1400)**\n\n*Previous review: Solely for the cooling sensation and moisture for my under-eye and upper eye. Helps waking me up and reduces burning sensation as that is something I encounter quite often*.\n\nCurrent review: The cooling sensation is important to me, it really helps me mentally as well.. It is a very good formulation, I would even say it is quite superior to the caffeine serum of TO (for me). It has calming, hydrating, moisturising, anti-ageing ingredients and also contains antioxidants. Personally a fan of their ingredients and it was the only eye product I was using for a long time. I have minimal dark circles which did seem to improve post application and reduce my bumpy skin texture. I did take a break from skincare, and that did bring those dark circles and bumpy skin back. When I used consistently I did notice difference in my eye area but I need to go back to the consistent use again as whatever benefits I had seemed to gain had reversed back upon stopping it. Although now I do have another eye product in the PM and use this only in the AM. I usually get burning sensation under my eyes (without applying any product or upon product contact) and applying this prior has helped a lot. Do not press the pump completely, that will be a lot of product. Little goes a long way. Lasting product.\n\nScent: Mild fruity smell that goes unnoticeable.\n\nSpreadability: Gel consistency that spreads very easily. Thin and light-weight. Absorbs into the skin within few seconds. Gives a nice refreshing cooling sensation (main reason for me to use it the morning - helps with headaches).  Feels like nothing has been applied to the skin and leaves a nice fresh looking hydrated skin. No sticky residue. Love it.\n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, 1,2-hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Caffeine, Phaseolus Angularis Seed Extract, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Chaenomeles Sinensis Fruit Extract, Chrysanthellum Indicum Extract, Cinnamomum Cassia Bark Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Perilla Frutescens Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Copper Tripeptide-1, Oligopeptide-29, Oligopeptide-32, Carbomer, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Sorbitan Isostearate, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Sodium PCA, Tromethamine, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\nPreviously used: Klairs Fundamental Nourishing Eye Butter, The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG.\n\n**Qurez spf 30 mineral sunscreen (Got 50ml for Rs. 315)**\n\nFor indoors this is a great sunscreen. I actually meant to get the tinted version as I mentioned in my sunscreen posts few weeks ago but got this because of the ingredient list and I'm glad I did. I prefer mineral sunscreen over chemical but to find a good one that sits nicely on your face is quite hard. This has been nothing but amazing for me. It also has zinc oxide in higher concentration than titanium dioxide, just like the way I prefer so that gets extra points. No fragrance which seems to be quite hard to find in good budget sunscreen. I love the fact that it has aloe extract and vitamin e, which is a great antioxidant synergistically with vitamin c in the AM. Does not leave a white residue, feels good on the skin, didn't break me out, didn't make me a greasy baby, did not make my skin oily or dry. All in all seems perfect for indoors and honestly impressed with this sunscreen at this price point for what all it offers. Does not sting the face nor the eyes. Does not cause my face to sweat immediately post application.\n\nScent: Mild fruity plus chemical smell that goes unnoticeable.\n\nSpreadability: Creamy consistency. Spreads like how a creamy thin moisturiser would spread. Leaves no white cast (surprising for a mineral sunscreen). Doesn't need harsh massaging to be blended, gets blended super easily and quickly. Does not leave sticky residue and leaves a beautiful matte finish. Skin feels soft post application.\n\nIngredients: DM water, Clear Zinc oxide, Aloe Vera extract, Organic Sunflower oil, Vitamin E, Sea buckthorn fruit extract, Micronized Titanium dioxide, Vegetable glycerine, Stearic acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetyl alcohol, Sorbitan Olivate, Matcha green tea, Allantoin, Coco-caprylate/Caprate, Glyceryl stearate, Sodium gluconate, Nipaguard SCE.\n\nPreviously used: Earth Rhythm Daily Defence Hybrid Sun Fluid SPF 30, RE' EQUIL Ultra Matte Dry Touch Sunscreen Gel.\n\n**Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun Cream SPF 50 (Got 50ml for Rs. 1100)**\n\nThis is such a beautiful sunscreen with some of the newer UV filters. It has a strong ingredient list. Does not leave white cast. Easy to blend. Doesn't sting my eyes. A good lightweight creamy sunscreen that does not leave any sticky residue. It has not broken me out nor irritated my skin. Did not make my skin sweat post application. Sunscreens generally tends to dull my skin out but this one hasn't (prolly because of the brightening ingredient). Gives a nice sheen to your skin and leaves a dewy finish that doesn't look oily. It also feels moisturising and doesn't pill. I would recommend dry skin and combination skin to try this but not oily skin as this isn't sweat-proof nor water resistant but reapplication is easy with this. It is a great daily sunscreen. For longer duration of intense sun exposure I would always recommend a physical sunscreen or at least combination of physical and chemical sunscreen.  Nevertheless this is a 10/10 sunscreen for me, even if a sunscreen is water-resistant and sweat-resistant please do reapply it when you are being exposed to UV rays. I easily sweat post sunscreen application with most sunscreens so I'm so glad this hasn't been the case here. Also one of the few sunscreens that I can apply on my lips and it doesn't cause it to dry out. When a sunscreen with these ingredients plus physical filters is made, I will find my HG.\n\nScent: Unpleasant chemically scent that isn't noticeable unless you go look for it actively.\n\nSpreadability: Thin cream that blends super quickly and easily. Gives a dewy finish. Slightly runny but does not create a mess. Skin feels hydrated post application and looks healthy. Spreads evenly and easy to smother a lot of it all over your face (deeper brown tones, it might leave a slight white cast, although none for me).\n\nIngredients: Water, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract (30%), Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Niacinamide, Methylene Bis-benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Coco-caprylate/Caprate, Caprylyl Methicone, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Germ Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Lactobacillus/Pumpkin Ferment Extract, Bacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Macrocystis Pyrifera (Kelp) Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Monascus/Rice Ferment, Pentylene Glycol, Behenyl Alcohol, Poly C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Decyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, 1,2-Hexanediol,Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Tocopherol, Lactobacillus/Rice Ferment, Aspergillus Ferment, Saccharomyces/Rice Ferment Filtrate.\n\nPreviously used: RE' EQUIL Ultra Matte Dry Touch Sunscreen Gel, UV Doux Gold Sunscreen, UV Doux Sunscreen Gel, Re'equil Sheer Zinc Tinted Mineral Sunscreen, Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel, Neutrogena Ultra sheer Sunscreen, Neutrogena Sheer Zinc Drytouch Mineral Face Sunscreen, Earth Rhythm Ultra Defence Hybrid Sun Fluid - SPF 50, La Shield Fisico Matte Sunscreen Gel.

If I start out on my phone it’s game over and I have a hard time peeling myself away from it for the rest of the day.\n\nI’m a writer and would like to get back to writing in the mornings (I used to self medicate with a sativa and coffee, whoops, but I could get 2-3 hours of hyper focused writing done before work), but my Inattentive brain moves very slowly in the morning and doesn’t spark much creativity until I give it coffee/weed/meds and I’m struuugling in that initial hour of the morning to do anything but stare at my phone. \n\n***ETA: Based on the amount of people in this thread saying they take their meds with coffee it’s entirely possible this is some misinformation I’ve absorbed 😅 or it’s possible that not everyone metabolizes coffee and meds the same way.\n\nI do know that not taking them with ascorbic acid and/or Vitamin C is research backed and taking them together prevents the meds from being absorbed, but now I’m not so sure about coffee. Either way, I know we are supposed to limit caffeine due to the effects on the heart and blood pressure, and I have lowered my intake considerably since starting this journey to an amount that has been approved by my doctor. \n\nThank you so much to everybody for your responses, you have given me some really great tips to start implementing! One of the biggest ones is I need to get back to is some form of exercise or getting outside (during the months that it’s not -30). My morning walks with my dog always put me in a good headspace and I haven’t found the motivation to do that consistently since he passed, but now I’m going to try again so thank you! ",

It gets me moving but still really low pressure. On a really good day I do yoga or a light work out but that’s pretty rare. \n\nI totally agree that sitting on my phone is the worst way to start my day so my only goal in the morning is to avoid that, literally any other activity is a win",

I like guided yoga practices on youtube or insight timer, as it gives me a \"script\" for slowly booting up my brain and body together. \n\nIf meditation/yoga feel a little too woo-woo for you, try music. I have those sonos ikea lamp speakers in my room, as well as headphones, and putting on music to help me move my body as I go about my morning routines helps me feel like I'm synchronizing my mind and body (which after years, decades really, of being chronically online feel completely distinct from one another). And that I'm doing it in a way that is enjoyable instead of feeling like punishment or work (like going for a morning run, not my style).\n\nIn other words: you're putting an awful lot of expectation on your brain to start at max capacity first thing. And I didn't read much about what you're doing for your meatsuit itself during that time. So instead of opening your phone first thing to jump right into the firehose of information via news or social media (which just spike cortisol and are frankly designed to be as attention-sucking and addictive as possible) or expecting to crank out some great writing first thing in the morning, all of which are asking quite a lot of a brain just transitioning from sleep, approach what you want from a more leisurely, pleasurable, somatic angle. \n\nAfter all, our brains may control our meatsuit, but the brain is meat itself.",

Drink a giant glass of water before bed. **(guaranteed to start the day hydrated, and a full bladder is the ONLY alarm I cannot ignore.)**\n\n2. After my early morning pee, stumble tiredly back to the bedroom, but turn on the reading lamp and take my meds before crawling back under the covers. *Lamp forces my brain & body to start understanding that it’s starting to be day now, even if I go back to sleep for a couple minutes.*\n\n3. DO NOT. UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. OPEN A TIMESUCK APP AT THIS POINT. *I have a million bajillion restrictions and parental controls and screen time reminders and scheduled blocks in place, and I’ve deleted the worst offenders completely… but it still requires intention and willpower to not hit “ignore” and get lost on social media anyway.*\n\n3a. Step 3 is more easily achieved by: \n\n- giving myself scheduled time later in the day for unrestricted scrolling *(but with a hard, fast time limit! I set a timer in a different room so I have to get up to shut it off, giving myself a few seconds longer to muster up willpower to move on, or just straight up distracting  my ADHD ass with something I see on the way.)* \n\n- USING A REPLACEMENT APP / ACTIVITY which has limits built in. \n\nSuch as— \n\ninstead of scrolling your reddit home feed, set up a bot that sends you daily summaries of the top posts from your favorite subs. read only the posts from the summary. \n\ninstead of endless clicky mobile games, download games that allow 1 daily play (NYT games is great for this, there are several free for nonsubscribers and many libraries offer free passes to the full subscription. YMMV). \n\ninstead of opening main-page facebook/IG/snapchat/tiktok, try starting up a little meme or news or gossip chat with your friends, family, online pals, whatever. \n\nOR only allow yourself to open the main apps, with a clear defined intention *(“i’m going to visit XYZ group to harvest from their meme monday post, and then i’m going to close the app.” “i’m going to post s birthday message on my friends wall, and then i’m going to close the app.”)* say it out loud if you can. \n\n4. (shit, this is long and horribly formatted, sorry) \n\nDO NOT CHARGE YOUR PHONE OVERNIGHT. DO NOT KEEP YOUR CHARGER BY THE COUCH/BED. If the other things don’t force you to stop doomscrolling, a dead phone will. There are many mornings that my little hacks don’t work… but in the 3 minutes it takes my phone to reboot once I plug it into the charger at my desk, I usually find something productive to propel myself into. and then, it’s like the phone never even existed. \n\n\nok that’s enough, because I am literally avoiding work by typing out this insanely long comment about how to not get distracted by your phone. i’m the worst. 😂😂😂 good luck, hopefully some of this is  helpful to you",

Personally, I feel like it's been a bit underrated compared to some other ingredients, along with urea. But I think it's starting to make some headway. :\\^)\n\n**Panthenol** is a derivative of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It's readily absorbed by our skin and converted to vitamin b5 since it is naturally produced by our bodies. It's approved by the FDA at 2% and higher for wound healing and anti-itching. It also acts as a humectant, drawing water to the skin. (It's great for hair as well!) So it's really effective for strengthening our skin barrier at 2-5%. It's also a penetration enhancer.\n\nHowever, the studies were all done on products with only little amounts of water in them, so for watery products, you may need it at a higher percentage for it to work better ([Swift Crafty Monkey blog](https://www.swiftcraftymonkey.blog/humectants-panthenol-a-closer-look/)), like at **5-10%.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease check out the Western Beauty version of this list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/fz2l58/list_of_panthenol_products_western_version/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Key**\n\nEO = Essential Oil\n\n$ -

No more bone broth , No more \"cheating\"...no more flavored water. Just water , black coffee, or straight tea.\n\nCheck the ingredients on any non-sweetener label. even ascorbic acid will spike your glucose and start hunger cravings.\n\nAnything you think is harmless could spike your glucose  will start hunger all day.\n\n  \nI had reached a plateau where I was only losing a half a pound a week ( I have 25 to go after losing 20 initially ) or none at all until I read a book on Clean Fasting. Since then the pounds are coming off easily with ease. No hunger at all in my fasting windows. In fact sometimes I go over the 16-18 hours without even trying.

No real symptoms other than a little discomfort in her left rib and mild fatigue. Things went downhill extremely fast. A week after the news, she had a stroke due to clotting. A week after that, she started spitting and coughing up copious amounts of blood. The main tumor had grown into her bronchus causing the bleeding. She also had pericardial effusion and pleural effusion which she had drained twice. A supply of oxygen was necessary, 15 liters at a time and bipap for a few days. During my time bedside with her, I started doing research and came across fenbendazole and its potential against cancer. 9/19 She started chemo as surgery and radiation were not options. (3 week cycle of Caboplatin / Paclitaxel). 9/22 She started the Joe Tippens Protocol (without the doctor knowing) 3 weeks later, same chemo infusion but added Opdivo and Yervoy. On 10/12, started Ivermectin (again without the doctors knowledge). By Halloween we really started noticing improvement. The middle of November, no more fluid in the lungs and no more oxygen needed. She continued chemo and immunotherapy up until her last PET/CT scan on 12/18. Results were unbelievable compared to the initial scan. Brain was completely clear, lymphnodes in her neck were completely resolved, lyphnodes in both lungs were completely resolved, and the main tumor in the left lung has shrunk to almost nothing! Radiation is now on the table, but we told her doctor that she needs a break. The chemo and immunotherapy has taken a toll on her body. Overall it’s been an amazing turnaround. We went from doctors telling us she needed hospice to her almost back to her old self (a few more lbs. to go lol). I can’t be 100% certain its been because of the fenben and ivermectin, but when all the doctors are scratching their heads at the vast improvement she’s made, it makes me think it played a huge role.

She did some radiation treatments, and 1 round of chemo.  She quit chemo after that first one.

The infundibulum within the **hair** follicle (400-600 μm deep \\[.4 mm to .6 mm\\]) is lined with a particularly dense network of dendridic cells making it the most immunologically active region, therefore this was specifically targeted for delivery. As they had previously demonstrated that particles of different sizes penetrate **follicles** to different depths, the vaccine carriers were of **1 mm** diameter to target the infundibulum. They showed that their **1 mm** silicon dioxide microparticles efficiently penetrated the **hair** **follicles** to deliver vaccine constituents to dendridic cells in the infundibulum within 1 hour of topical application. They also showed that particles remained as a depot within the **follicle** for up to 10 days contrasting with particles on the stratum corneum \\[most outward layer of skin\\] that were rapidly removed after about 1 day. Follicular delivery of vaccine carried on microparticles provides another potential approach to target the body’s largest immune organ.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6637104/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6637104/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used a .5 mm **dermaroller** for over a year.

A significant increase in level of **collagen** type I, III, and VII, newly synthesized **collagen** and tropoelastin from baseline was observed after 6 **microneedling** sessions at 2-week intervals. This percutaneous **collagen** induction leads to an overall youthful appearance of the skin by reducing fine lines and wrinkles, reducing pore size, more suppleness, and elasticity.\n\nThe needles also breakdown the old hardened scar strands and allow it to revascularize. Neovascularization and neo**collagen**esis is initiated by migration and proliferation of fibroblasts and laying down of intercellular matrix. A fibronectin matrix forms after 5 days of injury that determines the deposition of **collagen** resulting in skin tightening persisting for 5–7 years in the form of **collagen** III. The depth of neo**collagen**esis has been found to be 5–600 µm \\[.5–.6 mm\\] with a **1.5 mm** length needle. Histological examination of the skin treated with 4 **microneedling** sessions 1 month apart shows upto 400% increase in **collagen** and elastin deposition at 6 months postoperatively, with a thickened stratum spinosum and normal rete ridges at 1 year postoperatively. **Collagen** fibre bundles appear to have a normal lattice pattern rather than parallel bundles as in scar tissue.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4976400/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4976400/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Low-Level Laser Therapy [LLLT]\n\n2013: **LLLT** was discovered serendipitously in the 1960s when mice irradiated with a low fluence red laser grew **hair**. Animal and human data have slowly accumulated supporting **LLLT** for **hair** growth. **LLLT** appears to improve a variety of non-scarring alopecias—AGA \\[Androgenetic Alopecia\\], AA \\[Alopecia Areata\\], and chemotherapy-induced alopecia. Based on the studies demonstrating **LLLT**'s effects on promoting graft survival, it may be further suggested to have a potential to be used during the immediate period of post-**hair** transplant surgery to facilitate the healing process and enhance viability and earlier growth of the grafts. While mechanisms are still emerging, **LLLT** may increase **anagen hairs** through release of NO \\[Nitric Oxide\\] from CCO \\[cytochrome c oxidase\\] by photodissociation and **LLLT** may reduce inflammation in AA. Most studies investigating effects of **LLLT** on **hair** growth have used wavelengths that range from **635 nm** to **650 nm**, but as of today no study has compared the effect of near-infrared wavelengths such as **810 nm**, which have deeper penetrating capacities, to red light.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3944668/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3944668/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2013: **LLLT** aids skin rejuvenation through increasing **collagen** production and decreasing **collagen** degradation. LED which is a novel light source for non-thermal, non-ablative skin rejuvenation has been shown to be effective for improving wrinkles and skin laxity. It is not a new phenomenon since the first reports of **LLLT** effects on increased **collagen** go back to 1987. Studies by Abergel et al. and Yu et al. reported an increase in production of pro-**collagen**, **collagen**, basic fibroblast **growth factors** (bFGF) and proliferation of fibroblasts after exposure to low-energy laser irradiation in vitro and in vivo animal models. Furthermore, **LLLT** was already known to increase microcirculation, vascular perfusion in the skin, alter platelet-derived **growth factor** (PDGF), transforming **growth factor** (TGF-β1) and inhibit apoptosis.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4126803/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4126803/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LLLT Use**\n\nMy LLLT wand/stick is to be used once every two days.

Treatment of such photodamaged skin with all-trans **retinoic acid** increases type I pro**collagen** expression. The mechanism of this increase is not known, however, it may involve increased expression or activation of TGF-β. In addition, treatment of skin with all-trans **retinoic acid** before UV exposure inhibits **collagen** breakdown by matrix metalloproteinases and protects against UV-induced reduction of pro**collagen** expression, as demonstrated in this study. Therefore, all-trans **retinoic acid** and its metabolic precursor all-trans **retinol** (**vitamin A**) should have the capacity to both repair existing photodamage and retard accumulation of new photodamage.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC381286/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC381286/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tretinoin Prescription**\n\nTo get **tretinoin** you need to have a doctor’s prescription–in USA. A way to do this is to say that it is for Actinic Keratosis.\n\n2011: Actinic keratosis is the third most common skin complaint treated by dermatologists in the US and, according to the American Academy of Dermatology, 60% of predisposed individuals over the age of 40 years have at least one lesion. They occur most frequently on sun-exposed skin of the face, scalp, arms, and hands. Important risk factors include fair skin, cumulative sun exposure, and immunosuppression, including further ultraviolet light exposure. Actinic keratosis is now considered to be the beginning of a biologic continuum that leads to invasive squamous cell carcinoma, thus treatment is medically necessary.\n\nSource:[ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3132090/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3132090/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nActinic keratoses describes lesions caused by too much exposure to the ultraviolet rays of sunlight. They are the beginnings of skin cancer, most often appearing after age 40. In some areas where climate is mild year-round, these lesions appear in much younger people. People with fair skin, blond or red hair, and blue or green eyes are most at risk of developing these rough, scaly patches, or keratoses.\n\nSource: [https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-actinic-keratosis-basics](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-actinic-keratosis-basics)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tretinoin Use**\n\nI am supposed to use my **tretinoin** every evening–so I assume all are to be used daily–but the study used **.01%**, I was given **.1%**. The skin cell cycle is 28 days, if I don't use my **tretinoin** for even half that, 2 days after the first application I am peeling all over; it looks terrible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Retinoids**\n\nTopical **retinoids** are still considered the gold standard for clinically effective topical antiaging products . **Retinoids** are a family of compounds composed of **vitamin A**, its derivatives, and synthetic molecules acting through the same pathway. Besides all-trans **retinoic acid** (**RA**), the major bioactive form, the term “**retinoids**” includes retinaldehyde, retinol, and various retinyl esters. They act through **retinoic acid** receptors (RARs) and **retinoid** X receptors (RXRs), increasing the amount of type I procollagens and decreasing the amount of MMPs. **RA** increases the amount of type I, III, and VII **collagens** in the **dermis**, and can reorganize the dermal **collagen** into new woven bundles. In addition, **RA** stimulates normalization of the elastic tissue organization and GAG deposition in the **dermis**. In clinical trials, topical **retinoids** are clinically effective for the treatment of dermal aging, including wrinkles, roughness, and laxity. However, they can be irritating to a significant percentage of the population, and further development of ways to reduce their irritation potential is needed. Retinol, which metabolizes to retinaldehyde and **retinoic acid**, has been found to be less irritating than **retinoic acid** and is widely used as an ingredient for antiaging cosmeceuticals.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6540032/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6540032/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Vitamin C\n\nNote: **Vitamin C**’s purest form is  **L-ascorbic acid**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2017: The following information is available as a result of research into the role of **vitamin C** in skin health:\n\n* Skin fibroblasts have an absolute dependence on **vitamin C** for the synthesis of **collagen**, and for the regulation of the **collagen**/elastin balance in the dermis. There is ample in vitro data with cultured cells demonstrating this dependency. In addition, **vitamin C** supplementation of animals has shown improved **collagen** synthesis in vivo.\n* Skin keratinocytes have the capacity to accumulate high concentrations of **vitamin C**, and this in association with vitamin E affords protection against UV irradiation. This information is available from in vitro studies with cultured cells, with supportive information from animal and human studies.\n* Analysis of keratinocytes in culture has shown that **vitamin C** influences gene expression of antioxidant enzymes, the organisation and accumulation of phospholipids, and promotes the formation of the stratum corneum \\[most outward layer of skin\\] and the differentiation of the epithelium in general.\n* Signs of aging in human skin can be ameliorated through the provision of **vitamin C**. A number of studies support this, although measurement of skin changes is difficult. Some studies include objective measures of **collagen** deposition and wrinkle depth.\n* The provision of **vitamin C** to the skin greatly assists wound healing and minimises raised scar formation. This has been demonstrated in numerous clinical studies in humans and animals.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2012: **L-ascorbic acid** can be used orally and topically for skin benefits. **Vitamin C** is a cofactor for lysyl and prolyl hydroxylase, which stabilize the triple helical structure of **collagen**. It also plays a role in cholesterol synthesis, iron absorption and increases the bioavailability of selenium. The most commonly described cutaneous manifestations accompanying **vitamin C** deficiency are attributed to the impaired **collagen** synthesis.\n\nFurthermore, oral administration of an antioxidant mixture containing **vitamin C**, vitamin E, pycnogenol and evening primrose oil significantly inhibited wrinkle formation caused by chronic UVB irradiation through significant inhibition of UVB-induced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity accompanied by enhancement of **collagen** synthesis on hairless mouse skin.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583891/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583891/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Vitamin C Use**\n\n2001: L-ascorbic acid must be formulated at pH levels less than 3.5 to enter the skin. Maximal concentration for optimal percutaneous absorption was 20%. Tissue levels were saturated after three daily applications; the half-life of tissue disappearance was about 4 days. Derivatives of ascorbic acid including magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, ascorbyl-6-palmitate, and dehydroascorbic acid did not increase skin levels of L-ascorbic acid.\n\nSource: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11207686/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11207686/)\n\nThe above says that **vitamin C**’s low pH may irritate your skin. So only use it a few days before a **dermarolling** session, it only takes 3 daily applications of 20% **vitamin C** to saturate the skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Hyaluronic Acid [HA]\n\nNotes: **HA** can be bought as a lotion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFindings \\[from 1999\\] indicated that suppression of transcriptional activity of type VI **collagen** is associated with the reduction of cartilage matrix tissue, and that **HA** is associated with the suppression of the effect of IL-1β.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6603175/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6603175/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat sentence is hard to understand. It says that **HA** suppresses the effect of IL-1β, which is good because IL-1β suppresses transcriptional activity of type VI **collagen**, which in effect reduces the cartilage matrix tissue.\n\n2011: A major component of the extracellular matrix is \\[**HA**\\] or **hyaluronan**. **HA** is a naturally occurring anionic **polysaccharide** most abundantly present in mammalian skin where it is localized not only in the **dermis** (≈0.5mg/g wet tissue), but also in the **epidermis** (≈0.1mg/g wet tissue). Due to its considerable capacity to bind water, **HA has greater skin hydration properties than other** **polysaccharides**. Topical application of **HA** increases hydration of the \\[stratum corneum⁠—most outward layer of skin\\] largely through a humectant effect.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3050617/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3050617/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2018: \\[**HA**\\] is a naturally occurring biopolymer in bacteria and vertebras. **HA** is a highly hydrophilic molecule with the ability to bind water up to a 1000 times its own weight.\n\nThe turnover rate of **HA** in vivo depends on where the **HA** is located. The half time of **HA** in the circulation system is approximaty 2-5 minutes while the half time in more rigid tissue, such as cartilage, is 1-3 weeks. Almost half of all **HA** is located in the skin, where the half time of **HA** in the **epidermis** layer is 1-2 days.\n\nSource:[ https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1303721/FULLTEXT01.pdf](https://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1303721/FULLTEXT01.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2017: Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown the beneficial actions of **HA** treatment, with anti-inflammatory, wound healing, chondroprotective, antiangiogenic, anti-ageing and immunosuppressive effects, among others.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6403654/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6403654/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2014: The wound healing process can be organized into three main events, and each event involves **HA**:\n\n* (1) a matrix rich in **HA** is laid down in a cell-poor space,\n* (2) mesenchymal cell migration is stimulated and the **HA** matrix is infiltrated by cells migrating from the adjacent tissues, and\n* (3) cells within the **HA** matrix secrete both hyaluronidase, which degrades the **HA**, and sulfated GAGs \\[glycosaminoglycan\\] and **collagen**, which \\[simultaneously\\] replaces the **HA** and the matrix is remodeled.\n\nSource: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6603175/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6603175/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAggrecan, biglycan, fibronectin, and **HA** significantly stimulated cell proliferation in DP \\[dermal papilla\\] cell monolayer culture without any effect on DP \\[dermal papilla\\] cell identity.

Our data suggest that **KE** is a novel agent that enhances **hair** growth and that biomedical application of discarded human **hair** keratin could be used to promote **hair** **follicle** regeneration.\n\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrated that **KE** has potential for **hair** growth promotion by inducing the **anagen** phase in **telogenic** mice. **\\[KE**\\] demonstrated high bio-compatibility for promoting cellular regeneration. In **KE** treated mice, we observed an increase in the number, shaft of the **follicle**, and deep subcutis area,which served as evidence of induction of **anagen** phase.

Testosterone converts to **DHT**. A **DHT** blocker inhibits the conversion of testosterone to **DHT**. As such, **DHT** blockers are bad for **beard** **hair.** Topical **DHT** blockers are not nearly as potent as oral (prescription) blockers and pose less risk of some **beard hair** thinning.

    "body": "**Part I – Introduction**\n---------------------\n\n**Scroll down to the summary section if you want an overview of the findings**\n\nThis follow-up review is done on request by /u/elchasqui who wrote the following comment in the [MV review thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/3swjhq/research_review_2_do_multivitamins_improve_health/):\n\n> I personally don't take MV's to reduce my risk of [cancer, CV disease, etc.]. I take MV's to enhance my athletic performance, and make sure I'm getting enough vitamins/minerals that as an athlete I sweat out and use much more of.\n\nIn this review I will expand the topic of multivitamins (MVs) to encompass athletes and their specific needs.\n\n-------------------------\n\n**Why do athletes need extra supplementation beyond the average population?**\n---------------------\n\n**Fluid loss + mineral/electrolyte loss**\n\nDuring exercise, athletes experience [fluid loss via sweating](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/72/2/564s.full). This leads to a decrease in the ion levels (i.e. sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium) of the intracellular and extracellular fluids. The loss of water as well as minerals leads to an acute reduction in performance \n[1](http://www.humankinetics.com/excerpts/excerpts/dehydration-and-its-effects-on-performance)\n[2](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/40908930_Impact_of_dehydration_on_a_full_body_resistance_exercise_protocol) [3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1895359)\n\nThe athlete may experience a greater need for electrolytes in the long-term to counteract these frequent exercise-induced depletions. It is therefore important for athletes to get enough minerals via their diet or supplements.\n\n**B-vitamin excretion**\n\nSeveral studies have shown that more [B-vitamins are excreted via urine](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4317479/ ) after exercise and lost via sweat[2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1859644/pdf/brjsmed00265-0011.pdf?origin=publication_detail ) during exercise because they are water soluble. [meta-analysis](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/6561858_B-vitamins_and_exercise_Does_exercise_alter_requirements). \n\nSimilar to minerals, the athlete may need more B-vitamins to counteract these losses.\n\n**Caloric Restriction (CR)**\n\nSome athletes (i.e. bodybuilders, fighters) routinely go through caloric restriction to compete in their sport. These athletes are at particular risk for the aforementioned problems of mineral and vitamin depletions, because CR means the athlete consumes less food, and less food = less micronutrients.\n\n---------------------\n\n**Theoretical basis for why multivitamins (MVs) may not work**\n---------------------\n\n**Antagonism and synergy**\n\nAs I wrote in the [multivitamin review](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/3swjhq/research_review_2_do_multivitamins_improve_health/), micronutrient antagonism is the phenomenon where micros compete for absorption in the intenstines. Some vitamins and minerals inhibit each other's absorption. For example, calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc share a transporter and will compete for uptake. Calcium usually wins. This begs the question, why are MVs stacked with minerals when antagonism leads to low uptake (if you want research references – see my original MV article)? Antagonism does not occur if mineral supplementation is divided between meals. For example, calcium in the morning, magnesium in the evening. Might as well take vitamin D with the cal because vitamin D acts synergistically with cal. If you take iron, use vitamin C as a synergist, etc.\n\n**Poor forms** \n\nMicronutrients have different forms. For example, compare vitamin D2 and D3 where the latter has [better bioavailability](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256423512_Bioavailability_of_Vitamin_D-2_and_D-3_in_Healthy_Volunteers_a_Randomized_Placebo-Controlled_Trial). Other examples of mineral forms with poor uptake are [magnesium oxide](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/20747875_Magnesium_bioavailability_from_magnesium_citrate_and_magnesium_oxide), and calcium carbonate [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10579145?dopt=Abstract) [2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11329115), the two most common forms found in MVs.\n\n**Anti-nutrients**\n\nThese are substances that [inhibit the uptake](http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/313/3/1217.full) of micros. For example, phytic acid, found in large amounts in nuts, seeds, grains, and legumes will severely hinder mineral uptake, because the acid binds to the minerals, creating indigestible phytate. Furthermore, some researchers argue that sugar is an antinutrient that leads to [chromium losses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3713513)\n\nPractical applications: if you take your MV with your breakfast cereal filled with milk, grains and seeds, then the anti-nutrients will inhibit the minerals in your MV from absorbing. Furthermore, the calcium in the milk will compete for uptake and drastically lower the uptake of iron, magnesium, and zinc. And lastly, the minerals in your MV already antagonise each other. \n\n---------------------\n\n**Antioxidants – beneficial or harmful for athletes?**\n---------------------\n\nTypical antioxidants found in MVs are vitamin C, A, and E.\nThe research findings on antioxidants have been, as usual, mixed.\n\n[A massive meta-analysis conducted in 2013](http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.f10) found that antioxidants have no effect on preventing cardiovascular disease. [Another meta-analysis from 2007](https://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=205797) found that \"Treatment with beta carotene, vitamin A, and vitamin E may increase mortality.\"\nAuthors from the Harvard School of Health state that: \n\n> [\"The studies so far are inconclusive, but generally don’t provide strong evidence that antioxidant supplements have a substantial impact on disease. But keep in mind that most of the trials conducted up to now have had fundamental limitations due to their relatively short duration and having been conducted in persons with existing disease.\"](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/antioxidants/)\n\nHowever, in this review, we are primarily interested in the effect of antioxidants on athletic performance. A meta-analysis published in 2015 entitled: [\"Impact of Dietary Antioxidants on Sport Performance\"](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/273780200_Impact_of_Dietary_Antioxidants_on_Sport_Performance_A_Review), concluded the following:\n\n> In summary of this review, chronic vitamin E intake appears to enhance performance at altitude but potentially impairs performance at sea level. Quercetin has a small benefit on endurance performance but only in untrained subjects. Resveratrol appears to benefit performance in fit, healthy rats but is potentially detrimental to inactive rodents and humans. **Beetroot juice also improves cycling performance in untrained individuals via its content of nitrate, but it has an unclear, potentially harmful effect in athletes**. Effects of other polyphenols range from potentially harmful (green tea extract and cranberry–grapeseed powder) to promisingly beneficial (grape extract and cocoa epicatechins), acknowledging the variation in the polyphenol types. The popularity of spirulina with some athletes appears to be justified on the basis of the handful of studies to date, but a recommendation for its use awaits more research.\n\n> With regard to the optimal timing of antioxidant consumption, **much of the evidence is pointing towards an acute performance benefit but performance impairment when taken chronically.** However, **it is also reasonably clear that not all antioxidants have the same physiological effects.** Results from the animal studies are pointing to a performance benefit when chronic supplementation with epicatechin or resveratrol is combined with training. Fur- ther research is warranted to clarify the effects of different antioxidants and optimal timing regimes.\n\nThe Irish Sports council released [the following statement](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53296b1be4b0f59c2976d2c8/t/554b6bbae4b0149371f14456/1431006138813/Antioxidants+Technical+Document+2013.pdf) in 2012:\n\n> Taking  into  consideration  all  currently  available  literature,  particularly  from  review  articles,  **there  is  not  sufficient  evidence  for  the  general  recommendation  of  antioxidant  supplementation  in  athletes.  There  appears to be a greater slant towards advising athletes against antioxidant supplementation**, if after nutritional  assessment their  reported  food  intake  is  rich  in antioxidant foods. **Supplementation  should  there- fore be recommended only if a blood test identifies a specific nutrient deficiency**\n\nBeyond these findings, some antioxidants have been found to [reduce increases in VO2max](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/259826318_An_antioxidant_and_multivitamin_supplement_reduced_improvements_in_VO_2max), [hamper cellular COX4 endurance adaptations](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260020759_Vitamin_C_and_E_supplementation_hampers_cellular_adaptation_to_endurance_training_in_humans_A_double-blind_randomised_controlled_trial) and [skeletal muscle  biogenesis](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/47812359_Antioxidant_Supplementation_Reduces_Skeletal_Muscle_Mitochondrial_Biogenesis). \n\n*Update 2016:* [A new study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293807283_Ribosome_biogenesis_may_augment_resistance_training-induced_myofiber_hypertrophy_and_is_required_for_myotube_growth_in_vitro) links ribosome biogenesis to skeletal muscle hypertrophy\n\nHowever, there are [contradictory findings](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236959852_The_Effect_of_Vitamins_C_and_E_Supplementation_on_Muscle_Damage_Performance_and_Body_Composition_in_Athlete_Women_A_Clinical_Trial), and more research needs to be done in this field. The theory is that antioxidants inhibit the body's adaptive response to exercise by [limiting exercise-induced oxidative stress](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273767312_The_Effect_of_A_Four-Week_Acute_Vitamin_C_Supplementation_on_The_Markers_of_Oxidative_Stress_and_Inflammation_Following_Eccentric_Exercise_in_Active_Men).\n\n-------------------------\n\n**Targeted supplementation – Does it work?**\n---------------------\n\nTargeted, or isolated supplementation means you identify a deficiency and target it via using a specific supplement. \n\n> If there's only one supplement you're taking for your health and your diet is decent, it should probably be Vitamin D. I highly recommend taking Vitamin D instead of a multivitamin most of the time. \n\n[- Herman gill, Examine.com](http://examine.com/supplements/Vitamin+D/)\n\nThe benefits of targeted supplementation is that you can completely avoid negative micronutrient interactions. For example, if you want to take magnesium and calcium, you can separate them and take calcium in the morning and magnesium in the evening. Take iron with vitamin C, but separate from dairy products and calcium. This way **you can create the synergy you want while avoiding antagonism**.\n\nNow the question is, does targeted supplementation increase serums levels of micronutrients?\n \n- [Vitamin C](http://examine.com/supplements/Vitamin+C/)\n\n> For the purpose of increasing plasma Vitamin C concentrations, orally supplemented \nVitamin C appears to be the best decision (second only to intravenous vitamin C). \n\n- [Magnesium](http://examine.com/supplements/Magnesium/)\n\n> Has the capacity to increase serum magnesium stores, but this is somewhat unreliable and may be dependent on the person being deficient in magnesium prior to supplementation \n\nNote: it also depends on the **form of magnesium**\n\n- [Vitamin D](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3731379/)\n\n> Vitamin D supplements, with or without calcium supplementation, raised plasma 25(OH)D concentrations, on average, 25 - 26 nmol/L. Half of study participants were classified as having sufficient 25(OH)D status after six months of 800 IU vitamin D3 daily. \n\n> [Vitamin D3 increases the total 25(OH)D concentration more than vitamin D2.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256423512_Bioavailability_of_Vitamin_D-2_and_D-3_in_Healthy_Volunteers_a_Randomized_Placebo-Controlled_Trial) \n\n-------------------------\n\n**Dangers of supplementation**\n---------------------\n\nThere are many nutrient-to-nutrient interactions that go on \"behind the scenes\" that can lead to diseases: Calcium supplements  can cause hypercalcaemia, zinc can deplete copper stores, etc.\n\nIt's no secret that excessive or haphazard supplementation can be [detrimental to health](https://labdoor.com/article/can-you-overdose-on-multivitamins). Some examples:\n\n\n**Vitamin E:**\n\n> [the meta-analysis showed a statistically significant relationship between vitamin E dosage and all-cause mortality, with increased risk at dosages greater than 150 IU/day.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0021939/)\n\n--------------------\n\n> [We found no reduction in the incidence of lung cancer among male smokers after five to eight years of dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol or beta carotene. In fact, **this trial raises the possibility that these supplements may actually have harmful as well as beneficial effects**.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8127329?dopt=Abstract)\n\n---------------------\n\n> [Dietary supplementation with vitamin E significantly increased the risk of prostate cancer among healthy men.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21990298?dopt=Abstract)\n\n---------------------\n\nHowever, some studies find that high-dose vitamin E supplementation can be safe \"short-term\"\n\n> [The experience from 2 large clinical trials involving the oral intake of 2000 IU vitamin E/d suggests that vitamin E is relatively safe at this dosage for periods <2 y.](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/70/5/793.full) \n\n\n**Vitamin C:**\n\n>  [our results indicate that high-dose ascorbic acid supplements—one of the most commonly used vitamin preparations—are associated with a dose-dependent 2-fold increased risk of kidney stone formation among men.](https://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1568519)\n\n\n**Antioxidants:**\n\n> [Treatment with beta carotene, vitamin A, and vitamin E may increase mortality](https://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=205797)\n\nAntioxidants may quicken the process of cancer cell formation by promoting metastasis; the spreading of cancer between tissues and organs. Pro-oxidation, which is normally considered to be harmful to an organism, can be helpful in inhibiting metastasis. [Source](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v527/n7577/full/nature15726.html#oxidative-stress-limits-distant-metastasis)\n\nOxidative stress is also thought to be an important factor in the muscular adaption process where muscle tissue responds to exercise by generating ROS, aka pro-oxidants. \n\n> [...] the idea is that muscle adapts to being put under stress, antioxidants remove that stress and so the muscle doesn't adapt. \n\n[Thanks to /u/the_wiser_one ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/36evr0/antioxidant_supplements_reduce_increases_in/crdnpsn)\n\nThis leads me to an important point about MVs: They don't simply fill in the holes and then excrete whatever excess the body does not need. If MVs aren't absorbed by the body, as I've previously indicated is likely, then they are a waste of money. However, if they *are* absorbed, then you have no say in the matter of what is absorbed. If you have only have 1 deficiency (i.e. vitamin D) then taking a multi will provide you with an excess of fat soluble vitamins and minerals that are hard to get rid of (i.e. iron), etc. In that case, MVs are overkill, akin to fishing with a bazooka.\n\n> [A multivitamin supplement could push your daily intake into dangerous territory if you are already consuming adequate amounts of vitamins through diet](https://labdoor.com/article/can-you-overdose-on-multivitamins)\n\n\n**Takeaways:** \n\n- Before you take multivitamins or antioxidants, think through the consequences and be aware that antioxidation isn't purely a positive thing, as described by popular media – the reality is more complicated\n\n- Fat soluble vitamins/antioxidants are a risk factor if taken in excess\n\n- Avoid megadoses – Always read bottle contents\n\n- Never supplement haphazardly – get a blood test at the doctor, or at the very least be in a population that is known for having certain deficits (vegetarians: b12, women: iron, dark skinned: vitamin D, everyone: vitamin D)\n\n-------------------------\n\n\n**Summary of Part I**\n---------------------\n\n- Athletes excrete greater amounts of minerals and B-vitamins compared to the average population\n\n- Athletes have greater daily requirements of mineral and B-vitamins, especially in caloric restriction\n\n- Deficiencies lead to acute and chronic performance drops\n\n- Antagonistic micronutrient interactions are likely to prevent optimal uptake of vitamins and minerals from Mvs.\n\n- Anti-nutrients found in nuts, seeds, grains, legumes, and sugar inhibit mineral uptakes. If supplements are taken with meals that contain anti-nutrients, absorption levels will fall\n\n- Antioxidants, such as vitamin C, E, and A are likely not beneficial for athletes with a good diet, and **may even hinder training adaptations**.\n\n- Antioxidants may increase the rate of cancer spread (metastasis)\n\n- Athletes should consider antioxidant supplementation if they are found to be deficient after a blood test\n\n- Targeted supplementation is a good alternative to MVs, because the user can avoid micro antagonism while strategically using micronutrient synergism to maximise uptake of supplements\n\n- Haphazard supplementation can be dangerous (especially of fat soluble vitamins such as A and E, or minerals such as iron)\n\n-------------------------\n\n\n**Summary of Part II** (scroll down for the research articles)\n---------------------\n\n- A great majority of reviewed studies find no beneficial effects of MV supplementation for athletes\n\n- **There is no guarantee that MVs will increase blood levels of micronutrients**. Especially mineral levels show no change\n\n- Vitamins C and E may hinder exercise induced adaptations via blocking ROS and miochondrial biogenesis\n\n-------------------------\n\n\n**Final thoughts**\n---------------------\n\n**Given the evidence presented in sports nutrition literature, MV supplementation will probably not enhance athletic abilities.** **Studies found no change in any of the blood mineral concentrations following MV supplementation.** This may be due to the antagonism that I mentioned previously. Antioxidants found in MVs may even decrease the body's adaptive oxidative response to exercise, and increase the rate of metastasis (cancer spread). Athletes risk overdosing on micronutrients if their diets are already sufficient. They should get blood tests periodically and do targeted supplementation with a focus on combining synergistic supplements at correct timings to avoid nutrient-to-nutrient antagonism, and anti-nutrients.\n\n-------------------------\n\n\n**Part II – Studies**\n-------------------------\n\nI had problems finding studies supporting MV supplementation for athletes. Please comment if you are aware of such studies so that I may add them to this review. I've tried to be as neutral and fair as possible when looking for studies. The information presented below is not a case of cherry picking what fits the narrative I've presented in part I of the review.\n\n------------------------\n\n**Studies with findings favouring MV supplementation for athletes (1)**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**[Vitamins and sport](http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/12/2/74.full.pdf+html)**\n\n**Facts**\n\n- Published: 1978\n\n- Duration: 21 days\n\n- Participants: 40 men and women fencers\n\n- Age: Median age: 18.3-18.9\n\n**Subjects**\n\n> Seven women and 33 men fencers took part in this investigation, all belonging to the German national team or the best of their respective age classes.

The women fencers were aged 18.3 ± 3.0 years, the men aged 18.9\n\n**Supplementation**\n\n> 10g granulate twice daily for 21 days\n\n**Findings**\n\n> Although \"Beneroc\", the preparation we used, is a multi-vitamin electrolyte granulate, the improvement in our specific neuromuscular tests can be attributed mainly to the effect of the vitamins because of their role in the metabolism. The minor rise in the reaction time of the treated groups after the training may be seen, surely, as a result of the effect of thiamine on nervous conduction velocity and glycolysis. The more favourable re- action of the irritability of the phasic muscle fibres, may be due to B1 and B2. Haralambie assumes that B2 influences positively not only the oxidative processes, but also glycolysis, by control of free thiol groups by glutathione reductase \n\n**Limitations**\n\nShort duration, main focus on B-vitamins, few details.\n\n------------------------\n\n**Studies with findings that do not favour MV supplementation for athletes (7)**\n------------------------\n\n**[Vitamin and mineral supplementation: Effect on the running performance of trained athletes](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/19815562_Vitamin_and_mineral_supplementation_Effect_on_the_running_performance_of_trained_athletes)**\n\n**Facts**\n\n- Published: 1988\n- Duration: 9 months total – 3 months with MVs\n- Participants: 30 competitive male athletes\n- Age: 20-45\n\n**Subjects**\n\n> Thirty well-trained male volunteers aged 20-45 y who had been running competitively for at least 3y and had trained at 70 km/wk were recruited from local running clubs as subjects for the study.

These findings have led to the belief that physical activity increases vitamin and mineral requirements, and this may be an important reason why a majority of athletes ingest large doses of vitamin and mineral supplements (7)\n\n> **There was no significant change in any of the blood mineral concentrations at any stage during the study**. All levels remained in the high-normal range throughout the study (Table 2). **Supplementation caused a significant rise only in the blood concentrations ofriboflavin and pyridoxine**\n\n> **We conclude that multivitamin and mineral supplementation was without any measurable ergogenic effect and that such supplementation is unnecessary in athletes ingesting a normal diet.**\n\n**Limitations**\n\n\n------------------------\n\n**[Chronic multivitamin-mineral supplementation does not enhance physical performance](http://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=1992&issue=06000&article=00017&type=abstract )**\n\n**Facts**\n\n- Published: 1992\n\n- Duration: 90 days\n\n- Participants: 22 men\n\n- Age: ?\n\n**Subjects**\n\n> Twenty-two healthy, physically active men who exercised regularly and said they would be able to run for at least 90 min were recruited for the study.

For example, many of the B-complex vitamins are involved in processing carbohydrate and fats for energy production, an important consideration during exercise of varying intensity. Several B vitamins are also essential to help form hemoglobin in red blood cells, a major determinant of oxygen delivery to the muscles during aerobic endurance exercise. Additionally, vitamins C and E function as antioxidants, important for preventing oxidative damage to cellular and subcellular structure and function during exercise training, theoretically optimizing preparation for competition. \n\n> In general, health professionals indicate that vitamin supplements are not necessary for the individual on a well-balanced diet, but they may be recommended for certain individuals, such as the elderly, vegans, and women of childbearing age. \n\n> Others note that the prudent use of antioxidant supplementation can provide insurance against a suboptimal diet and/or the elevated demands of intense physical activity, and thus may be recommended to limit the effects of oxidative stress in individuals performing regular, heavy exercise. \n\n**Limitations**\n\n**Does not strictly discuss MVs, but specific supplements**\n\n------------------------\n\n**[The effects of 7–8 months of vitamin/mineral supplementation on the vitamin and mineral status of athletes](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21855192_The_effects_of_78_months_of_vitaminmineral_supplementation_on_the_vitamin_and_mineral_status_of_athletes)**\n\n\n**Facts**\n\n- Published: 1992\n\n- Duration: 7-8 months\n\n- Participants: 86 athletes\n\n- Age: -\n\n**This study seems to use the same athletes as one of the studies mentioned above, but they measured blood levels of vitamins and minerals instead of athletic performance.**\n\n----------------\n\n**NOTE: ONLY ABSTRACT AVAILABLE**\n\n----------------------\n\n**Findings**\n\n> Following the supplementation period, **blood biochemical indicators of B1, B6, B12, and folate status all increased but there were no significant effects of supplementation on B2, C, E, and A, or on the blood levels of any of the minerals.** The supplementation had no effect on red or white cell counts or on hemoglobin levels.

        "body": "A little note about Vitamin E supplementation that may cause the overall increase in mortality....\n\nVitamin E is an antioxidant set of 4 tocopherols and 4 tocotrienols. Scientific research has only been focused on d-alpha-tocopherol and d-gamma-tocopherol (this one just recently), and most cheap multivitamins use a 50:50 mixture of d/l-alpha-tocopherol-acetate. \n\nThe antioxidant benefits of alpha and gamma tocopherol are vastly different and there are some studies investigating how the composition of the vitamin E you are using affects health.\n\nThe RDA for Vitamin E is in alpha-tocopherol equivalents. The USDA SR28 database states that bioavailability from foods is slightly higher. In addition they are only now starting to analytically test for the tocotrienols. \n\nThe simplist source of vitamin E comes from oil based foods. Almond and Brazil nuts are high in alpha, pine nuts high in gamma. While pecans are a balance of both. Wheat germ oil is very high in E (and only the alpha form) so be careful of your intake.\n\nAs for the tocotrienols there is less research on what foods they are found in but i believe coconut meat has a small variety and is also a good source of Medium Chain Triglycerides (primarily 12:0).\n\nIf anyone is on a paleo diet I'd be interested to hear what variety of nuts you are taking. \n\nSince vitamin E is fat soluble (just is A/zeaxanthin/retinol, D3 (cholecalciferol), K1 and K2 you will be best off consuming them with a fatty meal for better absorption.\n\nTL;DR You most likely won't need to supplement if you go with a diverse fat-rich diet. Alternate with pecans, pine, almond and have a glass of coconut milk to wash them down. If you are going to supplement, stay away from the cheap d/l-alphatocopherol-acetate form (except for skin health as it's cheaper) which is a synthetic racemic mixture that can cause more harm than good. Use the d-alpha-tocopherol (usually made from biofermentation) and consider gamma-tocopherol sources from nuts as well.",

    "body": "For the past few years, I have suffered with reoccurring trigger finger in both middle fingers.\n\nWhen it first happened, I made several visits to an Osteopath who was helping me with some back problems at the time. He did some LED light therapy and massage, which helped. However, after a few months, the problem returned.\n\nNext, I decided to visit a First Contact Physio therapist through my GP surgery. As I sat and explained my issues to her, the physio interrupted me and said - \"*don't worry about your hands. The more you use them, the nicer they'll feel*\". Surprisingly, her words did nothing to alleviate my symptoms.\n\nThough I was eating well and exercising regularly, I decided to eat even better and move even more. I hoped that if my hands were strong and limber enough, I'd be able to rid myself of the trigger finger. However, after 8 months of consistent effort, I was still symptomatic. In fact, at this point, I had been suffering with trigger finger for a few months, which was the longest flare up I'd ever had. About a year ago, I had decided to track my symptoms in a spreadsheet. Up until then, the longest documented flare up I had ever had only lasted a week. As you can imagine, things were now getting desperate. I had to figure this out quick, if I was to get back to doing the things I loved.\n\nAt the beginning of this year, I decided to pay to see a Physiotherapist privately. During my first session, and without even looking at my hands, the physio sent me away for blood tests because he was certain I had Rheumatoid Arthritis. When I told him that I had never had nodules, swelling, or any family history of it, he said - \"*there's always a first for everything*\". I was devastated. On the bus ride home, I sobbed like a baby. I kept imagining how in the future, I'd never get to play guitar or Rocket League again.\n\nAt this point in time, I had sort of become friends with the aforementioned Osteopath. For some reason, I messaged him to tell him what the physio had said. His reply was - \"*Rheumatoid Arthritis?! The guy's been sniffing glue!*\". I cannot tell you how relieved I was to hear him say this. He'd worked on my hands many times and I trusted him. I decide to forgo the blood tests and proceed under the assumption I did not have RA.\n\nSo, if it wasn't Rheumatoid Arthritis, what was it?\n\nFor the past few years, running concurrently with my hand issues, I had been suffering from digestive problems. I would get nausea, gas, bloating, diarrhoea, and acid reflux. I underwent blood tests, stool tests, an Endoscopy, and a Fluoroscopy/Barium Swallow. Eventually, I would be diagnosed with Gastritis and treated with PPIs. For those of you that may not know, Gastritis is inflammation of the stomach lining (this will be important later). Though the PPIs seemed to help at first, my symptoms would eventually return.\n\nWhenever I spoke to a GP or a Gastroenterologist about my stomach issues, I would always ask the same question - \"Could my stomach problem be related to my hand problem?\". Though most would usually give me a condescending smile and tell me it's not likely, one Gastroenterologist said that it could be. He suggested that if I have a food intolerance, it could cause joint pain.\n\nAHA! That was it! All I needed to do was eradicate all known allergens from my diet, and I will have solved all my problems! Whilst removing allergens did indeed solve my stomach issue, it did not solve my hand issue. In fact, the eradication of allergens saw the start of the longest period of Trigger Finger I had ever had.\n\nI was so confused. What the hell was going on!? I'm eating better and moving more than I ever have in my life! Why do I still have trigger finger and why is it so much worse now?!\n\nThrough sheer dumb luck, I just happened to be watching a YouTube video on nutrition, when I found my first clue. In the video, a Harvard professor hypothesized that Trigger Finger was the first sign of Metabolic Syndrome. Hearing this really gave me a dolly-zoom moment. Though I didn't think I had Metabolic Syndrome, I was now even more convinced that my problems were either diet or digestion related.\n\nAs Trigger Finger involves tendons, I decided to start learning more about tendon health and tendon repair, and how to achieve it through nutrition. I discovered many things. First, I learned that Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) regulates collagen synthesis. Then, I discovered that Hyaluronic Acid not only helps tendons glide, but is a large component of synovial fluid, which is what lubricates the joints.\n\nBefore long, I had amassed a cabinet full of supplements that contributed to the health and repair of tendons and joints. On a daily basis, I would take Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, Hyaluronic Acid, Zinc, DHA Omega-3 (from Algae), Magnesium Taurate, Bromelain and Creatine. However, whilst all these did likely improve the health of my tendons and joints, I still had mild trigger finger.\n\n**BUT THEN...**\n\nI discovered 3 things.\n\n1. Inflammation (e.g. Gastritis!) can lead to the depletion of Vitamin B6.\n2. Vitamin B6 is vital to collagen formation and cartilage health.\n3. Vitamin B6 deficiency has been linked to Rheumatoid Arthritis, Diabetes, Autism, Down's Syndrome, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Epilepsy, Schizophrenia, Cancer, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Trigger Finger!\n\n**EUREKA!** Had I just found the solution to my problem?!\n\nI decided to purchase Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate, which is the active form of Vitamin B6. I chose this instead of Vitamin B6 because B6 can cause toxicity in large doses.\n\nI also discovered the work of Dr John Ellis, who figuratively and literally wrote the book on Vitamin B6. He advised taking 20-50mg three times a day for Trigger Finger, which I did (50mg).\n\nI kid you not, within one week, I no longer have trigger finger in either middle fingers, after months of consistent problems. Honestly, I am in shock. When I first read about B6, I was so sceptical. However, when the evidence seemed to stack up in it's favour, I knew I had to try it. I am so glad I did! If you too are desperate, I'd say it's definitely worth a try!\n\nIf anyone decides to try Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate to treat their triggering fingers, please remember that it can take up to 3-6 months before you see any results. That said, you could be one of the lucky ones, like myself.\n\nIf I could advise anyone seeking to get rid of their Trigger Finger, I would suggest the following -\n\n1. Consider taking a Bromelain supplement on an empty stomach, first thing in the morning. This will help lower inflammation and assist in the repair of your tendon.\n2. Consider taking Magnesium Taurate. This has long be known to helpful for tendons and ligaments.\n3. Take 20-50mg of Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate, with meals, 3 times a day.\n4. Resist cracking the knuckles of the fingers that are triggering!\n5. Eat as clean as you possibly can! If you can't completely resist ultra processed foods, at the very least, try to eliminate sugar and saturated fat.\n6. Perform the following Trigger Finger exercises between 2-3 times a day - DIP & PIP Flexion Stretch, FDP Isometric Exercise, DIP Blocking, Pencil Flexion Exercise. There is an excellent YouTuber who does great videos on Trigger Finger, but I don't think I'm allowed to advertise or promote here?\n\nAnyway, I wish you good luck in your journey! I truly hope this helps someone!\n\nIf you have any questions, please let me know! :)\n\n  \n\n\n**UPDATE:** Hey everyone. So I just wanted to give a quick update, as there have been some developments since I wrote this.\n\nAbout 4 weeks after ridding myself of the worst of my trigger finger with the above regime, my issue slowly began to linger again. As you can imagine, this was quite frustrating. If I'm honest, I didn't keep to the above regime as strictly as I should have and I think that came back to bite me. At the time, I wasn't really in a position to spend the kind of money I had on the supplements mentioned above, and so I decided to try something else and explored other options.\n\nI had read somewhere that trigger finger can be caused by degradation of the tendons in the hand and wrist. I had also read that degradation can occur when blood flow to the tendon is limited. I also had read that a good way to increase blood flow to the tendon was through isometric exercise.\n\nFor two weeks, three times a day, I did ten finger tip push-ups against a wall. I figured that it couldn't harm to try and, if it didn't help, I could just go back to my old regime. Within one week, I noticed a significant change in my hand pain and stiffness. Within two weeks, the triggering had stopped and I had only minor morning stiffness in my knuckle. Within a month, my trigger finger and hand pain had completely gone. I have now been symptom free for 2 months. Every time I feel even the mildest of aches or stiffness in my hands, I just do the wall push-ups and they seem to take care of everything.\n\nIf you are struggling with hand problems, I strongly suggest you do at least 3x10 finger push-ups against a wall, every day, for at least one week. If that doesn't help in any way, then I would definitely recommend pairing the push-ups with the regime described in the above post.\n\nI wish you all good hand health and hope you may also find some relief :)\n\nPlease let me know if this has helped any of you. I truly hope it has.\n\nBig love x",

        "body": "Thanks for your detailed post! This is so relevant to me. \n\nI want to give a brief description on my journey in the hope it helps others having the similar difficulties. \n\nAbout 8 months ago I got sick with fevers for a few days which led to chronic fatigue and extreme inflammation throughout my whole body. I am an active person who regularly goes to the gym but during early days of my sickness I was struggling to wake up at a normal time and without Voltaren 25 rapid I can barely walk. I have 200+ health supplements which all seem useless during this health crisis in the early period.\n\nFast forward to now and I am still having the occasional inflammation flare up in my hands and my middle finger which is painfully triggering. Most of my flare ups are food related now. I am ultra sensitive to a lot of foods now which has forced me to live super clean. \n\nI started taking B6 over the past 6 weeks, it has helped as a general because I am naturally deficient in B6. My trigger finger is still present and the reason I am here is because I have been researching trigger finger remedies and B6 come up on google, which brought me to Reddit. Interesting that B6 is starting to be considered a factor. I will try to increase my B6 multiple times throughout each day with food and provide an update. \n\nVoltaren 25 rapid has been the best help but obviously it's terrible for you and I am trying to stay off now.\n\nThings that have helped my trigger finger/inflammation is starting my day with a smoothie of blueberries, MCT oil, protein and kefir and not eating until lunch.\n\nAll the supplements in the original post are good for me as well. High dose fish oil (take 4 capsules morning and night) and high quality magnesium. Drink a lot of water and make sure you have regular bowel movements. I notice if I don't do my morning dump then I am going to get worse quickly, I just take extra magnesium,kefir and fibre when this happens to counter the flare up. \n\nI believe the heavy use of Voltaren has probably created a sensitive gut which is my focus moving forward and I'll jump back on soon with an update for others chasing some advice.✌️",

Mornings are the worst but much better so far. \n\nMy suggestion is as soon as you wake up, before making a fist, stretch your fingers back for 10-15 seconds a few times. The finger push ups that were suggested also help, using your other hand to stretch back and massage the finger and surrounding area also helps. But this needs to be consistent. \n\nI intend on doing this for a few more weeks and will continue if it gets better.

        "body": "OP, thank you for writing this post. I too developed trigger thumb from overuse. (My dad was right, it really is those damn phones).\nI tried stretching, and it would fluctuate in intensity or duration, but would never go away for more than a week. After seeing several doctors I was referred to the head hand surgeon of the hospital, which is a major regional hospital.\nHe was puzzled to see that I had trigger thumb but with no locking, just pain and loss of mobility, it had never locked once. He said, “if it looks like a duck and walks like a duck, we are going to treat it like a duck”. We tried two steroid injections and the first one worked amazingly for a couple of months. The second was worthless.\nHe then recommended that I do the trigger thumb release surgery. I got the surgery and I have to say it was certainly worth it, but I still am suffering from some issues. I would say that the surgery gave me 85%+ relief for 80% of the time.\nHowever, for that roughly 20% of the time that it hurts it hurts at least 80% as badly as it did before the surgery. Using my phone too much still aggravates the issue as it was the cause in the first place. But in today’s digital world and as much as I am out and about, it really is hard to reduce that use. Pinching type grips for more than a couple of minutes like handwriting, holding a paintbrush, or threading a nut onto a bolt is still extremely painful. Particularly if there is weight to it like using a 3-in paintbrush loaded with paint, that is still absolutely excruciating.\nThankfully, I can do things like open jars, use a full-sized gaming controller, or hold the steering wheel of my racecar with little to no pain.\nRecently due to some home DIY projects, (which is why I mentioned holding a paintbrush), I have been having a lot of pain that lingers for hours after I’m done, and I have been waking up with pain again. I know that had I not had the surgery, I wouldn’t be able to do any of those things whatsoever, but I needed to find another solution to help.\nI dug into research about supplements that could help with my pain and I tried taking tumeric for a bottle’s worth. I believe that it had some effect, but not as much as I was wishing for, so I started researching other supplements.\nI just ordered one of Jocko Willink’s joint health supplement blends as I like that his stuff has clean ingredients, and many of the ingredients that both preliminary research and many people have said helped, It contains 750mg of Glucosamine HCI, 500mg of MSM, 400mg of Tumeric root extract, 150mg of sea cucumber, 150mg of Boswellia Serrata Extract, 100mg of Quercetin Dihydrate and 20mg of Sodium Hyaluronate. Many of the reviews said that they noticed the product worked after several days to weeks, and I figured that it was less costly and less cumbersome than getting many of these ingredients separately. For approximately $30 a month, If it works it’s worth it.\nI was hoping that the supplement would contain Bromelain, but the competitor that did had fewer ingredients, significantly weaker dosage, and was essentially the same price for a month’s worth. So if anything I can just try to drink more pineapple juice.\nAfter ordering this product I came across your post and wow, the similarities are staggering, I felt like someone really understands. I also have suffered from dietary/ stomach issues for at least half of my life that are still not fully determined. (The last doctor I saw about it wanted to do a colonoscopy-type scope to see if they could find something but I didn’t go through with it).\nAfter reading your post I am wondering if I am also deficient in vitamin B6. I plan to also Add a P5P supplement and see if that helps, and if when I run out of the other joint multi supplement if I can continue with just the P5P, or if I should continue using that as well. \nI also am going to start doing the finger pushups with my thumb to see if that helps at all, as I had only been stretching the thumb backward previously.\nGenuinely, thank you for your post, as you know this is an issue that sounds minor but is extremely frustrating, painful, and sometimes debilitating. I hope that your findings and advice helps me and will help anyone else suffering from this condition. Please keep us updated on whether you are able to find extended periods of relief without having to rigorously take supplements or do specific hand exercises.",

As a concert pianist, surgery isn't an ideal option for me due to the potential risks.\n\nAfter revisiting online resources, I discovered this thread and decided to try a more natural approach. About a month ago, I started taking B6 P5P (50mg daily) along with other supplements I already had: a B-complex vitamin, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, and apple cider vinegar. I've also been incorporating finger exercises and nighttime splinting.\n\nI've definitely noticed an improvement, and the triggering is no longer painful. However, I'm still not fully recovered. I'm considering increasing my B6 P5P dosage, but I'm hesitant to exceed the recommended amount. As my friend/doctor mentioned, maintaining normal vitamin levels is important, and excessive intake may not be beneficial.\n\nI'm also curious about adding Bromelain and Magnesium to my regimen. For Bromelain, what's the recommended dosage? And for Magnesium, why is Taurate preferred, and what's the optimal dosage? I've read that Magnesium Glycinate is highly absorbable.\n\nThank you for your valuable advice!",

    "body": "I switched to fermenting in a bottles and I'm never going back.\r\n\r\nI moved on from kegs to bottles as my neipas quickly started looking brown and tasting of cardboard even though i used ascorbic acid and closed transfer. The kegs was also quit a hassle to lift and drink from, but they did become lighter and lighter as the weeks went by. Bottles are much lighter, easier to drink from and the batch oxidize more slowly as the bottles are emptied when opened. They are also way cheaper when sharing beer to friends and family!\r\n\r\nBut how do you ferment in bottles? Trub takes up so much space and dryhopping is really hard to do effectively. Often only about half of the bottle is somewhat clear beer and the rest is trub and hops. I just can't find hopbags small enough. Also go through a lot of caps because of the blowups (and dryhopping in the middle of fermentation). Wanted to share a tip though, before dryhopping you can breath co2 into the bottles to prevent oxidation .\r\n\r\nCan you find spunding valves or a adapter that would make them fit my bottles? Or should i transfer to a bigger serving bottle? As said, I go through a lot of caps and should probably get gross bottles. That will save me money on caps. All the gushers might be because of the yeast.\r\n\r\nAnother problem I have is that its pretty slow to bottle a batch when you have to squat over each bottle first to add the yeast. Thighs are so fucking sore after bottling a 10G batch.\r\nSome of my friends have gotten coldsores from my homebrew, but thats probably because they didnt wash their mouths with a soap BEFORE rinsing with starsan. Cleaning and sanitation is important. As is taking your yeast nutrients and acids before bottling day to secure a healthy yeast and clean fermentation.\r\n\r\nPlease help. I need help.",

        "body": "You're living in Oxidation City, my friend. I used your same methods, and thought I had success, but I was just fooling myself. It's amazing how much O2 seepage you get through the bottle caps. After multiple experiments, I switched to a pure argon atmosphere for all beer-handling and beer drinking activities, and it was like night and day for the improvement in quality. It's a bit complicated, in that I had to install a solid steel chamber with airlock that had the room for all of my beer and brewing equipment, and also re-purpose a breathing apparatus from some diving gear (*and* work out how to vent the O2-ridden stuff I exhaled into an appropriate exhaust port in the steel chamber -- you also need to vent the CO2 from fermentation, because occasional neutrino collisions with CO2 molecules in the headspace of the fermenter can create O2 molecules, and it will ruin a batch of beer surprisingly quickly). It was a bit of a trick to figure out how to drink the beer while wearing a full sealed respirator, but I took a page from NASA and modeled it after the system astronauts use to get water on space walks. I've seen some other folks online do similar things, but I've also noticed a lot of folks are using industrial-grade rather than food-grade argon for the atmosphere in the chamber. If you're not using food-grade argon, you're just wasting your time, because it has enough O2 to kill any benefits you might get otherwise. I once read on an online forum from a guy who translated some German language textbooks that German breweries do this to achieve the ultimate in beer freshness, and I also have a science degree in science, so it's really great to know I'm getting the best beer possible.",

This year's empties are much smaller in comparison to my previous year simply because I did not hoard multiple years of empties for my own sanity's sake.\n\nI will also give myself a shoutout to my [skincare Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/skincarewithmicho/). You can follow me if you want more detailed reviews on products. (im pretty inconsistent on posting tho)\n\nMy skin is acne-prone, oily T-zone with a normal to dry U-zone. I live in a dry climate with brutally cold winters and hot summers. My main concerns are acne, hyperpigmentation, dry, flaky skin during the winters, and oily foreheads during the summer.\n\n**Cleansers**:\n\n* [Be Plain Greenful pH-Balanced Cleansing Foam](https://incidecoder.com/products/be-plain-greenful-ph-balanced-cleansing-foam) \\- this cleanser was recommended by Director Pi for really oily skin. As someone with a very oily t-zone, I had to try it out. I did enjoy this cleanser as it had some mild physical exfoliation properties with the green tea powder, overall it was enjoyable to use, but it's kinda expensive? I remember purchasing this from Jolse for a great price though. Alcohol, essential oil, and fragrance-free.\n* [The Inkey List Salicylic Acid Cleanser](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-inkey-list-salicylic-acid-cleanser) \\- this is alright, it contains 2% salicylic acid to help combat acne. It's just a regular straightforward gel cleanser that has some ingredients to help acne-prone skin. This is quite affordable and widely available. Alcohol, essential oil, and fragrance-free.\n* [Scinic The Simple Pure Cleansing Water](https://incidecoder.com/products/scinic-the-simple-pure-cleansing-water) \\- it's micellar water, that's it, that's my review. As someone who does not wear makeup (maybe bb cream at most) I cannot attest to the cleansing abilities. But if you are someone who doesn't need to double cleanse but still wants to do it, micellar water is a great option as your first cleanse. Alcohol, essential oil, and fragrance-free.\n\n**Toners:**\n\n* [Round Lab 1025 Dokdo Toner](https://incidecoder.com/products/round-lab-1025-dokdo-toner-2) \\- this toner was ranked No. 1 on Hwahae several times. I can't say that I love this toner but it's mildly hydrating, has very slight exfoliating properties, and comes in this huge 500ml jumbo size. So I can't be mad at it. It's great to use as a wiping toner in the morning as someone who does not wash their face in the morning.  Alcohol, essential oil, and fragrance-free.\n* [Keep Cool Soothe Bamboo Toner](https://incidecoder.com/products/keep-cool-soothe-bamboo-toner) \\- ok so I know this brand was cancelledt because of the whole sunscreen thing and how they dealt with it. So I don't know if I'll be cancelledt by association by giving this toner a glowing review, but yeah this toner is pretty great. It's super hydrating but also leaves a somewhat matte finish somehow? I believe it's because bamboo naturally has silica and that's what gives it that matte feeling after the toner settles on your skin. [She's got a point, she's an icon, she's a legend and she is the moment.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7nMPV9rqlg) Alcohol, essential oil, and fragrance-free.\n* [Isntree Green Tea Fresh Toner](https://incidecoder.com/products/isntree-green-tea-fresh-toner-3) \\- this looks and smells like green tea. I bought this because around that time I bought one of those LED red light/infrared light silicon mask thingies. I read that using green tea will help boost the effectiveness of the mask so, of course, I had to try it out.  This toner is not that hydrating, so it would suit someone who has very oily skin since green tea is known to help sebum control. Alcohol, essential oil, and fragrance-free.\n* [Pore-Rest AHA BHA HA Blackhead Wipe](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0418/3018/7169/products/pore-rest-tonerpad-7.jpg?v=1628028746) \\- i actually got this from a stylekorean try me, review me giveaway. Not much thoughts on this other than it's a toner pad, I love the idea of toner pads as it's simple to use, especially in the morning. Not that environmentally friendly though. Alcohol, essential oil, and fragrance-free.\n\n**Serums:**\n\n* [Hyggee Natural Repair Serum](https://incidecoder.com/products/hyggee-natural-repair-serum-2) \\- another jumbo-sized product, what can I say I love my value for money. Unfortunately, I don't think this did much, it was very generic for a lack of better words. I was never really a believer of the whole ginseng as a holy grail ingredient. Alcohol, essential oil, and fragrance-free.\n* [Scinic Cicanoid Ampoule](https://incidecoder.com/products/scinic-cicanoid-ampoule) \\- i wanted to love this product but I felt like it fell kinda flat. It contains Pycnogenol which is a powerful antioxidant but idk, this serum was kinda whatever to me as it didn't really do much for me or my skin. Alcohol and fragrance-free.\n* [Miguhara Ultra Whitening Perfect Ampoule](https://incidecoder.com/products/miguhara-ultra-whitening-perfect-ampoule) \\-  i only got a deluxe sample size of this so I can't speak much about it, but to be honest it's nothing special. Alcohol and fragrance-free.\n\n**Moisturizers:**\n\n* [THE LAB by blanc doux Oligo Hyaluronic Acid Calming+ Cream](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-lab-by-blanc-doux-oligo-hyaluronic-acid-calming-cream) \\- i enjoyed this moisturizer as it didn't feel too heavy nor too light. It was just perfect. It sinks into my skin without leaving any greasy finish and to be honest I would use it all year round. It's not enough for those super cold winter months when I have windchill slapping my face but other than that I wish this was more widely available and more affordable. Alcohol, essential oil, and fragrance-free.\n* [Laneige Radian-C Cream](https://incidecoder.com/products/laneige-radiance-c-cream) \\-  this was another deluxe sample size I received, the original size is 30ml and this was 10ml so I feel like I can give a pretty decent review for this cream. It does use a derivative of Ascorbic Acid but the conversion rate is pretty high compared to other derivatives, I believe it's able to convert 85% to pure AA which is pretty good. If you're just starting with Vitamin C and want a gentle product that also doubles down as a moisturizer, I don't see why not? But for me, it's a miss. Alcohol free.\n* [Etude SoonJung Cenetella Hydro Barrier Cream](https://incidecoder.com/products/etude-house-soonjung-centella-hydro-barrier-cream-2) \\- i think etude thought that making a whole separate or subdivision of their SoonJung line was a good idea since of how popular it is? I don't believe this is much different from the regular hydro barrier cream other than it contains more centella ingredients and extracts. This is just a basic gel-cream moisturizer, it does hydrate more than it does moisturize so this is probably for those with oily skin or those who don't want a cream that weighs their skin down. Alcohol, essential oil, and fragrance-free.\n* [Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Cream](https://incidecoder.com/products/round-lab-birch-juice-moisturizing-cream) \\- this is the best gel-cream moisturizer I've ever used hands down. I probably did review this in last year's review so I won't too much into depth here. But it's great for people with oily skin during the summer but I feel like it'd be fine during the spring/fall season as well. To sum up the user experience; it feels like applying water but in gel-cream form. Alcohol, essential oil, and fragrance-free.\n* [COSRX Centella Blemish Cream](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-centella-blemish-cream) \\- not a cream but I'll review it here anyway. This is for spot treating your acne, I used to love this product but my acne has significantly gotten better, so I'm not sure if I need this anymore. Benzoyl peroxide + tret just hit on a different level. Alcohol and fragrance-free.\n\n**Sunscreens:**\n\n* [Scinic Enjoy Mild Sun Essence EX](https://incidecoder.com/products/scinic-enjoy-mild-sun-essence-ex-spf50-pa) \\- this has been replaced by [Enjoy Super Mild Sun Essence](https://global.oliveyoung.com/product/detail?prdtNo=GA210003127), I'm not sure if it's because it didn't meet the advertised SPF rating? But I did enjoy using this during the summer, the cooling effect was a nice touch. But yeah, just go use the reformulated version as the SPF has been verified for that one. Essential oil and fragrance-free.\n* [Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel](https://incidecoder.com/products/isntree-hyaluronic-acid-watery-sun-gel-spf50-pa) \\-  isn't this everyone's new sunscreen bae? After Purito was dethroned, I was pleasantly surprised when this survived the sunscreen apocalypse. For me, I enjoyed using this but I found it too heavy and too greasy/shiny? For someone who has an oily t-zone and doesn't appreciate the shine, I prefer something with a more matte finish. But I feel like everyone could use this. Alcohol, essential oil, and fragrance-free.\n* [Missha Cicadin Centella Rescue Sun Lotion](https://incidecoder.com/products/missha-cicadin-centella-rescue-sun-lotion) \\- this has also been reformulated, [Cicadin Rescue Mild Sunscreen](https://incidecoder.com/products/missha-cicadin-rescue-mild-sunscreen-spf50-pa) is the new version. To be frank I didn't like the old version and I probably won't like the new version either. Me and physical sunscreens just don't tend to get along. Alcohol and fragrance-free.\n* [Innisfree Daily Mild Sunscreen](https://incidecoder.com/products/innisfree-daily-mild-sunscreen-spf-50-pa) \\- so did anyone else notice that Innisfree removed all of their sunscreens when everyone went down the shithole? This doesn't exist anymore, probably because it doesn't meet the advertised SPF rating. Alcohol and essential oil free.\n* [Hyggee Relief Sun Moisturizer](https://incidecoder.com/products/hyggee-relief-sun-moisturizer) \\- this has been reformulated I believe, the new ingredient list is [here](https://incidecoder.com/products/hyggee-relief-sun-spf50). I did enjoy this sunscreen, but of course, she's a flop. Maybe I'll try the reformulated version one day.  Alcohol, essential oil, and fragrance-free.\n* [Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Sunscreen](https://incidecoder.com/products/round-lab-birch-juice-moisturizing-sun-cream-spf50-pa) \\- this one was a flop but the version I tried was the reformulated version! I think for now this is my daily driver during the months with longer days. It's a tad bit too heavy for me during the hotter months since I do have an oily t-zone. But for now, this is just fine.  Alcohol, essential oil, and fragrance-free.\n\n**Body-ody-ody Care:**\n\n* [Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Lotion](https://incidecoder.com/products/illiyoon-ceramide-ato-lotion-2) \\- this is affordable, widely available and lightweight enough to be used throughout the seasons. I think this is a great option for people who want a fuss-free body moisturizer and to be honest, you probably could use this one on your face if you wanted to. Alcohol, essential oil, and fragrance-free.\n* [Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream](https://incidecoder.com/products/illiyoon-ceramide-ato-concentrate-cream) \\- now I know for sure people use this on their face as a moisturizer. I tried doing that when my skin was going through some things (i was experiencing retinization). This is much thicker than the lotion but honestly, it's great value for money if you're using this on your face. Alcohol, essential oil, and fragrance-free.\n* [Paula's Choice Weightless Body Treatment 2% BHA](https://incidecoder.com/products/paulas-choice-weightless-body-treatment-with-2-bha) \\- i have really bad KP on my arms and unfortunately I don't think this did anything for it. I heard that the 10% AHA body lotion is more for KP so I might try that out some day, but dang PC is expensive. Alcohol, essential oil, and fragrance-free.\n* [First Aid Beauty KP Bump Eraser Body Scrub with 10% AHA](https://incidecoder.com/products/first-aid-beauty-mini-kp-bump-eraser-body-scrub-with-10-aha) \\- i also bought this with the hope of eradicating my KP. But alas, it's still here, it's a bit harsh for a body scrub so be warned that if you have sensitive skin the pumice stone that they use as the physical exfoliant is pretty harsh. I've also heard that their body lotion is better so I might try that sometime as well. Alcohol, essential oil, and fragrance-free.\n* [Chemistry Brand Hyaluronic Concentrate](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-chemistry-brand-hyaluronic-concentrate) \\- it's a naur for me. I think if you wanted to use hyaluronic acid on your body, the Hado Labo lotions would probably be easier to use, and more affordable.  Alcohol, essential oil, and fragrance-free.\n\n**Hair Care:**\n\n* [Drunk Elephant T.L.C. Happi Scalp Scrub](https://incidecoder.com/products/drunk-elephant-t-l-c-happi-scalp-scrub) \\- i was not \"happi\" using this hair scrub. The first issue I have with this is the packaging, to get the product out is difficult, the scrub is pretty thick texturally so a squeeze tube packaging did not make it fun getting the product out. Second issue is that this has to be used on a dry scalp, which is fine, but this contains cellulose which is also found in peeling gels (that thing that you think is dead skin), so it gets messy. Overall, I'm not a big DE fan, so I'm just here to simply roast them and this product.  Alcohol, essential oil, and fragrance-free.\n\nThat's it, that's my 2021 empties post. I left out certain products, like The Ordinary products, some body, and hair care products because everyone has used The Ordinary products before, we don't need another review on it.\n\nI also want to say that I do use prescription strength tretinoin but I don't feel comfortable discussing about my journey on here as it is a prescription drug. So if you have any interest on that, please speak to a dermatologist!\n\nHappy Holidays everyone, and stay safe!",

I know there are some options from Sidmool, Nature Republic, Cosrx and Purito.\n\nAnd now there are two more! 2sol came up with two serums recently with 10&#37; of it:\n\n1. [**2Sol Facial Recovery Booster**](http://www.2sol.co.kr/shop/item.php?gid=1804240003) **10% Niacinamide +  Vitamin C derivative and Panthenol 10% in total.** 30ml drop bottle\n\n\\*Purified water, niacinamide (10&#37;), 2-O-ethyl ascorbic acid, panthenol, butylene glycol, ascorbyl glucoside, dipropylene glycol, 1,2-hexanediol, glycerin, glycereth-26, palmitoyldipeptide-7, palmitoyltripeptide-1, palmitoyltetrapeptide-7, palmitoylhexapeptide-12, , Mictricaria extract, chestnut tree extract, saccharide isomerate, acetylglucosamine, tromethamine, glyceryl acrylate / acrylic acid copolymer, xanthan gum, allantoin, sodium hyaluronate, PVEM / EEE polymer, ethylhexyl glycerin, disodium dipentaerythritol\n\n\\**Unfortunately 2sol states their ingredients as a pic on Korean, so this list I took from one of the ebay sellers*\n\n2. [**2Sol Niacinamide 10% Treatment** ](http://www.2sol.co.kr/shop/item.php?gid=1804240002)**10% Niacinamide + 1% of D-panthenol. 30ml drop bottle**\n\n*I could not find the full ingredient list so far*\n\nAnd as always, these products from 2sol are fairly priced: 8900 won and 5900 won (around $8 and $5). But of course there will be some extra charges.\n\nI'll try to find or translate the full ingredients lists over the next few days.",

I searched the sub for detailed info on this, but did not find it (apologies in advance for the repost if I missed something).  I also searched the forum where the original post was located and found [this article written by the same author] (http://www.essentialdayspa.com/forum/viewthread.php?tid=18491&highlight=) and thought it might be of interest here.\n\nSome highlights:\n\n>**Application order and wait times** \n\n>L-ascorbic acid forms of vitamin C are very pH dependent and affected by skin pH, or pH of other products layered with them. \n\n>All vitamin C products work best if applied to clean skin, before any other product. Though It may be applied after AHA or BHA if the formulas and pH will not affect activity or absorption. \n\n>Vitamin C absorbs faster into the skin than other exfoliate acids (such as BHA and AHA) since it absorbs faster, you can generally limit your wait time to 10 – 15 minutes. Because it does absorb so fast, it is not normally used as an exfoliate, though it does have some exfoliate activity. If used as a “Pro” level exfoliate, strength and timing are adjusted. \n\n>For collagen rebuilding benefits, and other treatment effects, you should always use the wait time, before layering other products. \n\n>To use it for its anti-oxidant activity only, pH is not a concern, so wait time is not an issue. Just be aware, you will not utilize the other Vit C benefits when used in this manner. \n\n>Not all Vitamin C products have a low pH, some forms of Vitamin C or Vitamin C blends often have a higher pH, so less pH issues concerning layers. You do still use the pH issue as a guide, but the pH levels of your C may be higher than your AHA or BHA products. Wait times still apply. \n\n>If using a low pH form of vitamin C, you will need to know the pH of the C product and your other products. You may find you can combine the exfoliates in one step (your BHA or AHA) with your Vit C layers, so creating less wait times. This of course is formula and pH dependent. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "Given the large number of posts regarding Vitamin C, I thought I would share my research into the efficacy of Vitamin C and why, after 12 years, stopped purchasing it this year. I am enclosing in quotes anything I copied from a research paper. I have shared the research links below. Hope this helps. I am open-minded and look forward to be proven wrong. I have a an environmental engineering degree with a focus on air pollution and its effects at the cellular level and so I love chemistry. I wish Skinceuticals and other Vitamin C producers would produce material to convince me otherwise.\n\nMy TakeAways Based On My Overall Research:\n\n1. “A patent grant does not verify that the function described actually works… it is simply an exclusivity to a position claim.”\n2. L-ascorbic acid is the most effective form of Vitamin C to penetrate the skin barrier. But in order to penetrate it must:\n   1. Not oxidize before it gets to the skin layer\n      1. Because it is an anti-oxidant, it binds with oxygen (free radicals) as soon as it is exposed to air, light and water. The problem is that they bind to oxygen in the bottle before you even buy any product claiming to contain antioxidants.\n      2. When plasma levels are low, some vitamin C can be delivered to the epidermal layer by topical application, although the efficacy of this is dependent on the formulation of the cream or serum used on the skin \\[[51](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/#B51-nutrients-09-00866),[52](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/#B52-nutrients-09-00866),[53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/#B53-nutrients-09-00866),[54](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/#B54-nutrients-09-00866),[55](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/#B55-nutrients-09-00866)\\]. Vitamin C, as a water-soluble and charged molecule, is repelled by the physical barrier of the terminally differentiated epidermal cells. It is only when pH levels are below 4 and vitamin C is present as ascorbic acid that some penetration occurs \\[[56](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/#B56-nutrients-09-00866)\\], but whether this results in increased levels in the metabolically compromised stratum corneum is unknown. A great deal of effort has been put into the development of ascorbic acid derivatives for the purpose of topical application. Such derivatives need to ensure stabilization of the molecule from oxidation and also overcome the significant challenge of skin penetration. In addition, they must be converted to ascorbic acid in vivo in order to be effective. Whether there is a single solution to all these challenges is unclear \\[[57](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/#B57-nutrients-09-00866)\\]. The addition of a phosphate group confers greater stability and these derivatives may be converted to ascorbic acid in vivo, albeit at a slow rate \\[[58](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/#B58-nutrients-09-00866)\\], but they are poorly absorbed through the skin \\[[56](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/#B56-nutrients-09-00866),[59](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/#B59-nutrients-09-00866),[60](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/#B60-nutrients-09-00866)\\]. Ascorbyl glucoside also exhibits superior stability and can penetrate, but the rate of its in vivo conversion is not known \\[[57](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/#B57-nutrients-09-00866),[61](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/#B61-nutrients-09-00866),[62](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/#B62-nutrients-09-00866),[63](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/#B63-nutrients-09-00866)\\]. Derivatives containing lipid-soluble moieties such as palmitate are designed to assist with delivery, and although increased uptake has been demonstrated in animals \\[[64](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579659/#B64-nutrients-09-00866)\\], they do not necessarily show improved stability and there is some doubt as to whether these derivatives are efficiently converted in vivo.\n3. Here’s how it has shown to work:\n   1. L-ascorbic acid that is able to penetrate the skin barrier does in fact, provide protective, anti-oxidant benefits to the skin. BUT!!!!!!!!!! IF your skin cells are already saturated with naturally produced Vitamin C from your diet, additional topically-applied Vitamin C will not provide additional protection. It has been shown to provide benefit when the skin is deficient in Vitamin C.\n\nMY QUESTIONS / CONCERNS\n\n1. So… as long as I consume and my body produces enough Vitamin C, it is not necessary to apply Vitamin C?\n2. In every study out there showing an improvement of skin due to application of Vitamin C, were the participates deficient in Vitamin C? How were participants selected?\n3. Since antioxidants bind to free radicals immediately, does my Vitamin C only work for seconds? Let’s say I am outside for 20 minutes. Based on my understanding of how electrons work, am exposed to 19+ minutes of free radicals. Said another way… if the sun and outdoor air produce 300 units of free radicals, does Vitamin C protect me against all 300 units? If not, how many units am I protected against? Why won’t Skinceuticals (now owned by Loreal) document how long their Vitamin C is protective for?\n\nMY SUMMARY\n\n1. So in summary, In order for l-ascorbic acid to successfully penetrate, it must be:\n   1. stable enough to resist oxidation (damage from oxygen) and still overcome challenges of skin penetration (must be in a specific pH). Further, the researchers indicate “if plasma (blood) levels are saturated, then it appears that topical application does not increase vitamin C content.”\n   2. From what I’ve read, Vitamin C has to overcome some incredible challenges to be effective on my skin. Each of these obstacles could be mapped into a crazy yes/no algorithm. In my opinion, the rate of success to overcome each and every potential obstacle is too low to justify its price. :(\n\nI hope this helps. I really really just want the truth. If you have any evidence to contrary, please share. We work too long to spend our hard-earned money on baseless marketing.\n\nRESEARCH LINKS (I also studied some of the reference links mentioned in each paper)\n\n1.

His sister is trying to go on an unsupplemented 80/10/10 vegan diet, and refuses to listen to anyone except T. Colin Campbell, a sorry excuse of a researcher and author of The China Study. So naturally he seeked help to reason with his sister.\n\nI highlighted that Campbell is a vegan who lets his personal beliefs interfere with what little scientific integrity he has. I offered the work of Denise Minger and others in debunking The China Study. I listed some nutrients that veg\\*ans are more likely to be missing. And finally I warned him that diets high in carbohydrates and low in fat are dangerous, and his sister should include healthy oils in her diet.\n\nNaturally, this did not sit well with a nearby Priest of Indoctrionation who took a lifelong oath of abstaining from animal flesh, and treehugging.\n\nHe pointed out that I am uninitiated and do not belong in the Church Of The Indoctrinated. He then accused me of foul necromancy and commanded me to reveal my scrolls and tomes. His priest brothers gathered around us and started to smite me.\n\nI fled to save my undeath, and spent 3 days of my eternal death to collect our most prized scrolls and tomes to unleash upon the foolish priests, and to bring back the sister from death.\n\nSo, my dear lich and undead brethren, I present to you the ~~fruits~~ bacon of my 3-day search for spells against foolish priests, knight templars and evangelists.\n\nIf any of you expert necromancers deem that a scroll or tome should be included in the collection, or should be removed for fear of taint of religious dogma, or the spells should be better organized, please let me know.\n\nI would especially value powerful magics for disspelling the dogmatic texts and practices of high carbohydrate, low fat diets, especially those advocated by Campbell, Ornish, and other ~~elven druids~~ forest trolls.\n\n----\n\nDeficiencies and health complications on veg\\*an diets\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nVitamin B12:\n\n- Level of serum vitamin B12 is \"always low in vegans\".

Laboratory evaluation revealed cobalamin deficiency, due to a vegan diet of the mother.\" [[1]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18293883)\n- Et cetera, there are plenty of irresponsible veg\\*an mothers.\n\nCholine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylserine:\n\n- I could not find any studies comparing choline intake or rates of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease of veg\\*ans and omnivores. However it stands to reason that their average intake is lower due to plants being a poorer source of choline than eggs, fish, liver, and meat in general. People suffering from trimethylaminuria often become vegetarians to decrease their intake of choline. It is possible to get RDA values from plants, but it requires planning.\n- Dietary requirements can vary greatly depending on gender, pregnancy, breastfeeding, and PEMT gene status, specifically on the rs7946 SNP. Substances like trimethylglycine, methylcobalamin, methylfolate, and other methyl donors can partly substitute choline for methylation purposes, but not for phospholipid synthesis. Which brings us to the next point.\n- Choline needs to be attached to fatty acids in the form of Phosphatidylcholine to be incorporated into membranes. Most notably, neural membranes love DHA bound Phosphatidylcholine and Phosphatidylserine, but there are plenty of other fatty acids present in the brain, saturated, monounsaturated, and omega 3 or 6 polyunsaturated alike. [[1]](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1471-4159.1998.71062528.x/pdf)\n- As we have seen previously, vegans lack at least EPA and DHA. Those on very low fat diets might lack other fatty acids as well. I highly doubt de novo lipogenesis produces the same fatty acid profile as a well balanced diet, but I would love to see a study on it. A different fatty acid profile could potentially change brain phospholipid composition. However it is doubtful that we will ever see a study on the differences of veg\\*an and omnivore brain phospholipid composition.\n\nCholesterol:\n\n- Cholesterol is used for numerous important processes in the body: cell membrane integrity and fluidity regulation (again, special emphasis on neural membranes) and synthesis of vitamin D, coenzyme Q10, sexual hormones, mineralocorticoids, and glucocorticoids, all of which have relevance to brain function.\n- I therefore hypothesize that decreased cholesterol production on vegan or low fat diets could at least partly explain the changes in vitamin D, coenzyme Q10, and hormonal status. If this is true, it could imply changes in brain function as well. Parallel this to the side effect profile of statins.\n\nConclusion:\n\nUnsupplemented, unplanned, low fat veg\\*an diets are foolish.\n\n\nProblems with high carb low fat diets\n-------------------------------------\n\n- A diet very close to 80/10/10 markedly decreases brain glucose utilization in rats. \"Even marginal protein dietary deficiency, when coupled with a carbohydrate-rich diet, depresses cerebral glucose utilization to a degree often seen in metabolic encephalopathies.\" [[1]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8848204)\n- Very low fat diets can cause gallstones due to reduced gallbladder emptying, whereas high fat diets are protective [[1]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9665682) [[2]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10903004) [[3]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24321208)\n- High carb low fat diets reduce LDL particle size.

So I don't see any need to fight the vegans - I would say we can find common cause with them.",

    "body": "I have struggled with low ferritin for basically ever. Down to 3 or 4 at the lowest. Once I managed to get it as high as 18, and then it dropped again. What was extra annoying was the docs who would say \"oh that's normal for women\" when I was not getting my period due to being on birth control. People on reddit are always talking about infusions, but my doc told me no. They're only done in hospital here, and as a result, only in emergency situations.\n\nI was on Feramax daily for 2 straight years with no improvement. My ferritin was at 7. Doc told me the usual empty stomach/vitamin c, tested again after doing that for 6 weeks it was down to 6. Had upper & lower GI scope to see if there was a reason I wasn't absorbing. They found nothing.\n\nBut! I am pleased to report that last time I tested, my ferritin was 82!! And I *feel* more full of life!\n\nWhat worked for me:\n\n* 2x Palafer (each capsule contains 300 mg ferrous fumarate, equivalent to 100 mg elemental iron) every *second* day, with vitamin C, 2 hours after last food/drink, 1 hour before consuming anything else (water is ok). I took it around lunchtime, because I couldn't face waiting an hour for morning coffee.\n* Food source of heme iron *every single day*. Beef, liver, oysters, mussels, lamb, black pudding, you name it. Doesn't need to be a huge amount or at every meal, even just 2oz a day is fine. Tried heme supplements but they didn't have the same effect as actual meat.\n* Separately from the iron, supplement in the morning with C, B complex, B12, D, and E. At night I take Magnesium.\n* Also, drink lots of water generally.\n\nBasically, my body just did not absorb as much iron from either food or supplements as it did from both together. It's like eating heme-rich foods got my body primed to accept the supplements or something.\n\nJust wanted to share in case this helps someone else!\n\nETA: One last thing: when you're buying vitamin C to take with iron, make sure it's ascorbic acid, not calcium ascorbate!\n\nETA update March 2025: ferritin is up to 139!!",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

SPF 50 PA++++ sunscreen**  \n\n\n**2. 0.025% Tretinoin**   \n\n\n**3. 15-20% L-ascorbic acid vitamin C serum**   \n\n\n**4. Peptides, particularly 8% matrixyl 3000 and 2% matrixyl synthe'6, and glycolic acid.**  \n\n\nWith this said, even if we never, ever saw the light of day our entire lives, we'd still develop the signs of aging over time due. Aging is divided into intrinsic and extrinsic aging. Intrinsic aging is also known as chronological aging and it's our bodies' natural decline as the years go by.   \n\n\nExtrinsic aging is photoaging, which is aging due to sun exposure, but also includes this process called glycation. Eating sugar at least in the form of glucose and fructose causes aging because these compounds bind to collagen and inhibit the repair and replacement of both collagen and elastin. So avoiding high glycemic index foods is a good idea if you really want to avoid aging at all costs, and perhaps even carbohydrates as a whole.  \n\n\n**Sunscreen:**  \n\n\nMaking sure you're using a sunscreen that's rated PA++++ or discloses its PPD rating as 16 or higher is very important. To put it simply, UVA rays cause tanning, then sunspot hyperpigmentation, and then wrinkles. UVB rays cause sunburn. Both can cause skin cancer. The issue with using a sunscreen that is only rated for SPF is that SPF only tells you how much UVB protection the product has. It doesn't mean jack shit for how much UVA protection the product is giving you. So if you see people complaining they tanned or got freckles despite using SPF 100 or some other nice sounding high number, that's why. SPF is for UVB protection, not UVA.   \n\n\nThis is where the PA system comes in. The PA system rates a product's UVA protection, specifically its PPD. So now you're thinking what's PPD??? And we can explain this pretty easily. Let's say your bare skin starts tanning (the first sign of UVA skin damage) in 10 minutes. Now if you applied a sunscreen with a PPD of 16, your skin would then only start tanning in 160 minutes. PPD is a multiplier for your skin's UVA damage resistance. The highest PA rating is PA++++ which means a product has a PPD of 16 or more. There's no real way to tell the exact PPD in a PA++++ sunscreen, but at worst, it's PPD 16. Some sunscreens disclose their actual PPD, usually European sunscreens. But generally, finding a PA++++ sunscreen and committing to it will go a long way.   \n\n\nIf you're overwhelmed, you can consider looking into the sunscreen I personally use: Rohto Skin Aqua Super Moisture Gel Sunscreen SPF 50+ PA++++. It's stupid cheap at $11 USD for a big 140g bottle that lasts at least three months with liberal daily use. It also has an exciting photostable UV filter called tinosorb S, but even though this UV filter doesn't really degrade in UV light, it's not entirely composed of tinosorb, so don't lull yourself into thinking you can slap this on your skin and you're fine and dandy all day long in the sun. For general daily use though, it'll serve you very well. Do be aware it contains alcohol which has been shown to age the skin pretty badly, though, so you might want to take it upon yourself to research a PA++++ sunscreen without alcohol if you find that problematic.  \n\n\n On the topic of UV filters, PPD doesn't well assess the UVA1 protection of a product, as opposed to its reliability for rating UVA2 protection. Our best bet for protecting ourselves against UVA1 is by looking at the filters in sunscreen. Zinc oxide, tinosorb S, tinosorb M, Mexoryl SX, Uvinul A Plus, and avobenzone all help block UVA1 rays.  \n\n\n**Tretinoin (Retin-A):**  \n\n\nNext we have tretinoin. The mother of wrinkle prevention and reversal of present wrinkles. Tretinoin 0.025% has the same anti aging effect as tretinoin 0.1%. So don't jump the gun and assume you need the highest concentration for best results. Tretinoin does a bunch of things like increase collagen production (in fact, the only retinoid proven to do so), increase skin cell turnover from the inside out, and thicken the dermis. Basically, tretinoin cream is generally easier to use than tretinoin gel. The gel has alcohol and a difficult to spread texture. The cream is more emollient and spreads easier. However, the cream often has a fatty alcohol, stearyl alcohol, and isopropyl myristate, a full 5/5 acne trigger.   \n\n\nSo if you are worried about acne consider using tretinoin microsphere, also known as Retin-A Micro or Supatret by brand name. Microsphere is a gel format with no acne triggers and it's said to be gentler to use since it releases tretinoin into the skin over a period of time. I searched high and low for anti aging research on the microsphere version, but I came up with nothing.  Even though it's the same active ingredient, the vehicle, or inactive ingredient combination, that delivers the active ingredient can still affect results. So if you can use tretinoin cream, great, do that! If not, tretinoin microsphere is a solid option. Microsphere comes in 0.04%, 0.08%, and 0.1% formulations.   \n\n\nWhen using tretinoin, expect a three month transition period which is what we call retinization. Dehydration, dryness, flaking, peeling skin, irritation, even burning are common. This side effects tend to be most common in people who make one or more of the following mistakes: not applying tretinoin 20 minutes after applying moisturizer, not applying petrolatum like Vaseline immediately after applying tretinoin, and/or using tretinoin way too frequently too soon. To be super safe, I recommend for people to use tretinoin once a week for two weeks, twice a week for two weeks, three times a week for two weeks, and so on. If you experience intolerable side effects, go down one step and try again.  \n\n\n**Vitamin C:**  \n\n\nVitamin C serums are great for skin brightening, addressing PIH, but also increasing collagen production over a long period of time. I can only confirm that the latter effect occurs with 15-20% L-ascorbic acid vitamin C. And from here on out, when I talk about vitamin C, I'm talking about L-ascorbic acid.   \n\n\nThe problem is that L-ascorbic acid oxidizes and becomes useless with continued exposure to air and light. I keep my own serum in my fridge. Some people decant their vitamin C serums into multiple bottles so portions of the product are sealed off from the air for weeks or months, extending the longevity of the product. If your vitamin C serum is yellow, orange, or brown, it's time to get a new vitamin C serum. The issue is that vitamin C serums need a pH of 3.5 or lower to be effective. Vitamin C is a pH dependent active so it needs a 20 minute wait time after application before applying any other skincare products. Ideally, the vitamin C serum is formulated with vitamin E and ferulic acid. These two additives both help stabilize the vitamin C and even make it more effective.   \n\n\nVitamin C is an antioxidant and it has photoprotective effects. By no means does it replace sunscreen, but it's a sunscreen booster in a sense. That's why it's generally recommended to apply vitamin C during the day. You might not want to apply vitamin C daily though; vitamin C has a half life of roughly four days in the skin, so applying it daily might be overkill. I still apply it daily for peace of mind though. Oh and I use and recommend Timeless 20% Vitamin C + E and Ferulic Acid Serum, the formulation by all accounts is correct. They even have a permanent $5 off coupon (HF5OFF) and free shipping in the US, no minimum order. The great thing is that their vitamin C is made to order, so you get as fresh of a product as possible.   \n\n\nDon't buy vitamin C from third party retailers. The product you receive already has had its timer ticking for who knows how long on a retailer's warehouse shelf. For vitamin C, order from the manufacturer for best product longevity.  \n\n\n**Peptides:**  \n\n\nThere's so many peptides out there. I'm most knowledgeable about the matrixyl family. Matrixyl 3000 is basically matrixyl but with additives to help prevent glycation aging. Matrixyl syntheis a different peptide known more for collagen production. You're not missing out on anything by not having a product with the original matrixyl since it's already in matrixyl 3000. Peptide research isn't that robust, but the matrixyl studies I've gone over are really promising.   \n\n\nFull disclaimer that those studies have been sponsored by parties with a financial stake in matrixyl, but conflict of interest does not necessarily mean bad science. Anyway, 8% matrixyl Peptides only work if they get to living skin cells in the dermis. I'm personally discouraged by the efficacy of incorporating peptide products in a routine. Microneedling creates channels to the dermis, but that sort of needle length is used infrequently, around a monthly basis. Applying peptide products would be effective after microneedling, peptides on their own do not produce actual results if they only interact with the living skin cells on a monthly basis. Regardless, for people who microneedle, applying peptide products afterwards wouldn't hurt. I again recommend Timeless' matrixyl serums, despite their lack of delivery system technology in their formulation.  \n\n\n**Glycolic Acid:**  \n\n\nAnd now we have glycolic acid. 20% has shown itself to increase collagen production, but higher strength peels have been used and can be found on Makeup Artist's Choice's website.  Don't use chemical peels for at least 72 hours since last applying tretinoin and don't apply tretinoin for at least  72 hours after the chemical peel. Waiting longer is never a bad idea. I'm not sure about the anti aging effects for long term lower glycolic acid use, but I don't use this ingredient personally.   \n\n\n**Skincare Surgeries:**  \n\n\nThere's also dermatologist procedures you can consider like using Botox to prevent dynamic wrinkles, such as crow's feet and forehead lines. Microneedling stimulates collagen production and is also known as collagen induction therapy. Injectables like collagen and Sculptra stimulate the body to produce collagen, but I'm not sure how effective those are. Chemical peels treat fine lines and increase collagen production as well, at least glycolic acid in a concentration of or higher than 20%. I generally recommend against spending so much money on professional treatments, as they are mostly temporary but I'm just including these things to be comprehensive.",

I mean, I could google every single ingredient in the list, but they don't separate out which are the active ingredients, and I don't have time to look each one up. Do you happen to know from prior research? Does it contain any of the more troublesome ingredients like oxybenzone or octinoxate? It's definitely chemical-based...I'm not totally opposed to that, but it entirely depends on which chemicals they are. Also, it appears to contain parabens...just FYI. \n\nStill on the hunt for my HG sunscreen...for face OR body...I know that they really have to have zinc to be protective enough, but it's so hard to not look like Casper if it has zinc. :/",

I loved these as a kid and now that I am older and know more about nutrition and how to reading food labels, I was shocked to see that a single package at only 70 calories contains 5 grams of fiber. No one seems to be mentioning this on the internet about the high amount of fiber in scooby-doo fruit snacks. I mean this is a considerable amount of fiber compared to the calories and I think can be argued as an even better fiber supplement than some fiber one options. What does everyone else think about this? Is the fiber count right on these packages? I am looking at the ingredients and I do not see what in the ingredients counts for this high amount of fiber. Nothing on the internet talks about the high fiber count in these snacks either. Someone, please enlighten me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIngredients listed: Apple Puree, Corn Syrup, Polydextrose, Sugar, Modified Corn Starch.

It seems really unsafe and unreliable, and without an actual chemistry weighing+pH meter setup in your bathroom, I don't understand how you could reliably use these powders and expect good, consistent results with minimal damage to the skin. Labmuffin demonstrated, for example, that in faultily adding even fewer than 10mg more of the L-AA powder than you intended to a small amount of serum, you could drastically lower the pH to an irritating (or worse) level. \n\nLet me know what you think on this, but I honestly think brands like TO take it too far in just bottling up their base materials and selling it for a premium (apparently pure L-AA powder is much more affordable per oz from other vendors).\n\nI think it is great that a stronger awareness of the chemistry and ingredients involved in our products has caught onto the cosmetics community, but it is important that consumers remain humble and realistic, and that brands don't exploit people's hunches at the risk of their skin and their health.",

I feel like I've been trying to tell people that the DIY LAA powder concoctions they are making are either:\n\n1) Dangerous, in other words they can EASILY burn your skin. In this case you are using either too much Ascorbic Acid powder OR too little vehicle.\n\n2) Completely ineffective and useless. In this case, you are not using enough Ascorbic Acid powder OR you are using too much vehicle. The pH is above 3.5 and therefore the Ascorbic Acid will not penetrate. \n\nI owned the Ascorbic Acid powder, and I completely second what Michelle said about inconsistency and variability with a volume (spoon) measurement. Depending on how tightly packed the spoon was, and the particle size of that particular scoop of Ascorbic Acid powder, my scale read anywhere from 0.32 g to 0.41 g. That is a HUGE range.\n\nAlso, when I used \"a small amount\" (The Ordinary's literal instructions, whatever TF that means) with my vehicle, depending on the vehicle used, as well as, again, how tightly packed the powder was in the scoop and the particle size, my pH meter would read anywhere from 2.5 to 3.7. Again, HUGE range.\n\nHonestly, I've lost all respect for The Ordinary. I never in my wildest dreams would have thought that people would be buying repackaged raw ingredients from \"skincare companies\" and making their own \"products.\" The Ordinary is a joke to me. The Niacinamide powder is marked up AT LEAST 300% (depending on where else you buy Niacinamide powder.) And we waited 2 years for this \"release.\" \n\nTo be completely honest, I cannot believe people are falling for this. It's basically a scam. \n\nThe Niacinamide powder is USP grade, in other words it's standardized. You can buy literally the EXACT SAME thing from DIY retailers. (Same goes for Ascorbic Acid powder.) My favorite DIY retailer is Lotioncrafter and they sell 118 g of Niacinamide powder for 9.75 (compare to TO version, 20 g for $5.80.)\n\nhttps://lotioncrafter.com/products/vitamin-b3-niacinamide-fcc?variant=13079676715097\n\nThe thing that makes me upset is, you should see how excited people are about this product in The Ordinary Facebook group. I really feel like The Ordinary is taking advantage of people's naivete. In this sense, they are worse than all of the cash-grabby skincare companies in existence. Once upon a time they were champions of transparency and innovation.\n\nSelling raw ingredients to people who know nothing about formulation and pretending like it's some effortless thing that doesn't require weighing, pH testing/adjusting, or any other consideration for a profit is about as low as it gets in my book.\n\nThe other day, in another sub, someone was seriously asking about how to add his Niacinamide powder to sunscreen.

That's just the plain out truth.\n\n**LAA TO Powder**\n\nIt is just a bad idea to use as recommended as many people noted. You do not know how much you are using by just randomly adding it to other serums. It will degrade other formulas and the PH will probably not work out.\n\nFurther using it as a base for an actual serum would be foolish as it is way overpriced compared to other cosmetic grade LAA powders.\n\n**Niacinamide TO Powder**\n\nI rolled my eyes so hard when I saw this. It has the same problems with concentration, stability, and PH, but it is also completely unnecessary as there are many affordable serums in the market. Such a money grab targeting teenagers.\n\n**My Vitamin C Serum**\n\nI have this Vitmain C routine problem: I usually do my morning routine after my workout, which after Covid, will probably be at the gym locker room. That means it is not feasible for me to buy a Vitmain C Serum that would degrade in the blink of an eye when not refrigerated. I use ever stronger retinoids at night so that is not an option.\n\nI ran into Labmuffin's Vitamin C Serum Recipe with just plain water and that was such a game changer for me. She did mention that there are more complex recipes so I looked them up and there is where I saw the dark side of DIY. So many serums that don't look particularly stable. Among the problems observed:\n\n* Serums using Vitamin E from capsules or other oil serums\n* No emulsifiers\n* No PH testing\n\nThen I ran into Lotion Crafters' Recipe which is very detailed and uses an emulsifier to combine the oil and water components. I essentially invested in a mini chemistry set, bough all base ingredients and I had a lot of success with it. I find it fun to do the chemistry, but I just don't think it is for everyone. There are so many mistakes I made:\n\n* When weighting small amounts that make up <1% of the formula it is so easy to mess them up.\n* I once messed up the emulsion and my serum ended up milky white and the oil and water separated.\n* I messed with the percentages and I ended up with saturated LAA powder at the bottom.\n* Doesn't matter how clean you are, it's imposible to not contaminate the solution outside  a steril environment, so it will have a short shelf life.\n\nAll in all I don't recommend it but I love it for myself. I spent about $100 upfront but this should last me for 2 years or so. I make about 15 ml per batch and use it within 2 weeks then disinfect everything. This means I apply it to the face, neck, collar bone, and chest. PH testing is surprisingly easy and I've gotten better at accurately measuring ingredients.",

    "body": "I've tried quite a few ab vitamin c stuff. I use it to mostly improve overall brightness, fade hyperpigmentation and their antioxidant benefits. Here are some of the ones I tried most recently.\n\n- Melano cc: \n\nA good place to start, took me a month or so to see some fading, but none of it has dissapeared. Did feel some warm tingling the first few times but nothing major. Vitamin c in here is ascorbic acid and ascorbic palmiate which are both not that stable. \n\nThis serum has a light, slightly oilly texture that gave my dry skin a nice glow too. I used it morning and night until it eventually oxidised 7 months after I bought it. But honestly thats fine cause this isn't that expensive and I noticed more results when I used this generously. \n\nAlso might be my bad though cause I took this travelling a lot and didn't refrigerate it. I've heard their packaging is good though since it limits the contact the serum has with air and sunlight. Its pretty hard to squeeze it out of the tube. \n\nHas a citrus smell so it has fragrance. It dosen't irritate or break me out at all. This also has vitamin e which I heard boosts the effects of the vit c.\n\n- Innisfree brightening pore serum: \n\nDelivered the fastest results. The only caveat with this is that the ingredients contain drying alcohol and fragrance pretty high up. My skin does react to those sometimes but was completely fine with this serum. In just 1-2 weeks it literally lightened my entire face. \n\nThis vit c is in the form of ethyl ascorbic acid which is very stable. The brand also mentions that the hallabong extract here is a good source of vitamin c. \n\nI was using it morning and night at first. The texture is like a light hydrating water type serum. More pleasant to layer other products on it. Theres an artificial orange scent but its honestly pretty pleasant and not too strong and dissapears after a while. I decreased use to night time and eventually stopped since I got a good 2 shades lighter. \n\nThis one also contains arbutin, niacinamide, HA and other nice ingredients. I still use the sleeping mask from this line every few days that is less scary whitening and more just brightening. Really noticed no differnce with my pores with this line but pretty good at moisturizing.\n\n- Ti'am my signature red c serum: \n\nCurrently testing this 20% ascorbic acid. Its unstable and reviews generally say this oxidises quickly. Its been in my fridge for a while and no oxidisation for me. \n\nIts honestly not going that great right now. Just straight up using the serum from the bottle breaks me out. Surprisingly no tingling or warm sensation, although my face will look more red the next day. The only way to prevent it from breaking me out is to mix it with moisturizer, but then I don't notice any brightening with that method. I've tried mixing it with other lighter serums too but it always breaks me out the next day. \n\nThis also contains alcohol and essential oils, so my skin could either be reacting to that or the concentration of vit c is too high. Contains other nice ingredients like glutathione, niacinamide, beta-glucan. \n\nThe texture is like a thicker serum with very sticky finish and it always smells like barbeque chips in a bad way. The worst texture and scent in this list. I think we'll have to breakup soon, I don't see this working out.\n\n- Somebymi yuja niacin 30 days blemish care serum: \n\nThe star ingredients are 5% niacinamide and 82% yuja extract but still contains vit c in the form of sodium ascorbyl phosphate, which is reportedly stable since this comes in a transparent yellow bottle. \n\nThe most pleasant one in terms of texture and scent. Really smelled like yuzu (a type of lemon) and had the lightest watery texture that dosen't leave any residue after I rub it in, just a slight touch of hydration. I layer other hydrating essences/serums with this since its hydration is not enough for my dry skin. This contains essential oils but my skin dosen't react to it though. \n\nThis serum brightened my skin overall but I noticed almost no fading, although I still liked the effect it gave me. Just like the name I really liked this for the first 30 days or so, but then it stopped working halfway through the bottle. Like I noticed no more of that brightening effect.\n\nContains other fun ingredients like licorice extract, green tea extract, arbutin and many more. Really would like it if it just didn't stop working. Also marketed for wrinkle care but I can't say how effective that is. I also found out through their youtube that the vit c concentration in this is low enough to use with chemical exfoliants which can be good for people who want to mix actives, but not so much if you want that vitamin c to really shine.\n\nFinal:\n\nOut of all of these I'd probably repurchase melano again since I mostly miss it as a light hydrating oil. The others probably aren't for me. So far vitamin c is good for overall brightening but it dosen't significantly improve hyperpigmentation for me.\n\nFor fast results I'd go for the innisfree but then again this will probably only work if you got tanned or sunburned since it lightens everyting. It also has a blend of different brightening ingredients, so it might not just be because of vit c.\n\nYuja niacin is pretty good for a daily morning serum if you don't have much hyperpigmentation. I really like the light texture when I want to layer more stuff. Then again its really not a \"miracle\" product. Next I might try the klairs serum, but its not a priority. There are other things I want to try more.",

    "body": "***Edit! -*** u/BerdLaw *linked me t**hree* *studies on sake -- one specifically about sake extract.* *I've linked them all in the sources below.*\n\n*One in vitro (meaning in a dish or tube) study showed that rice wine increased  \"the expression of procollagen and laminin-5,\"\\*⁴ which is one of the key components in the intercellular makeup of the layer that holds the epidermis to the dermis. Additionally, \"laminin 5 also accelerates the assembly of basement membranes and may enhance the recovery of damaged skin.\"⁵* *In the same study, experiments were done on hairless mice (in vivo) and showed that topical application protected the mouse from photo-aging.*\n\n*Another study* *show**ed* *that sake extract inhibited tyrosinase, both in vivo (in a living organism) and in vitro, though it is unclear how many subjects were involved based on the abstract alone.⁶*\n\n*More notes: First study comes from Doosan Group R&D, which seems primarily interested in vehicles, construction, electrical, etc., while the second study was paid for by AMOREPACIFIC R&D.*\n\nHiyas!\n\nMany of you love Kiku's High Moist, so I picked it up the last time I went to my local Murakai market in SoCal so I could try it out and figure out what all the hype was about.\n\nThis is a bit of a review slash ingredient breakdown, so I hope you enjoy!\n\n\\---\n\n>*Full Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol ,* ***Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake)****, Glutamic Acid, Arginine, Leucine,* ***Ceramide 3***, ***Ceramide 6***, ***Placental Protein***, ***Arbutin***\\*\\*,\\*\\* \\*\\*\\*Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (Licorice Root Extrac\\*\\*\\*\\*t)\\**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Protein, Maltitol, Methyl Gluceth-10, Peg-6 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Fragrance.*\n\nI've highlighted the ingredients that are worth discussing a bit in detail.\n\n# Ingredient Breakdown\n\nSake is a fermented product made from [rice](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/01/sake-rice-how-sake-is-made-rice-varieties-brewing-sake.html), [water](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/sake-school-the-importance-of-water-in-sake-making-where-does-sake-come-from.html), [koji](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/koji-the-miracle-mold-how-sake-is-made.html), and [yeast](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/sake-yeast-temperature-yeast-strains.html). Ferments have been all the rage recently, with *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (living yeast) extract and *Saccharomyces ferment* being the two I see the most. While I could not find any clinical dermatology studies done on sake as a ferment in skin, we may be able to glean some understanding into the benefits of sake by examining both ferments and koji (kojic acid) itself.\n\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae is a species of yeast used for brewing beer. In one study, saccharomyces cerevisiae extract (SCE) was studied in several formulations. One contained SCE, and/or vitamins A, C, and E, and was patch-tested on the back of volunteers. The subjects were then tested for transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin moisture (SM), skin microrelief (SMR), and free radical protection in 3 hour, 15 days, and 30 day intervals.\n\n>*\"Our results suggest that vitamins and SCE showed effects in \\[skin moisture\\] SM and \\[skin microrelief\\] SMR. Only formulations containing SC had long term effects in the improvement of SMR. Thus, these kinds of evaluations are very important in cosmetics development to evaluate the best risk and benefit correlation.\"¹*\n\nAnother fungi ferment, saccharomyces ferment, has similar benefits. It is obtained through the fermentation of saccharomyces - a genus of fungi that is known as the baker's yeast - in the presence of metal ions. The yeast is credited with promoting good skin condition and is frequently found in products that reduce redness.\n\nThe other half of sake worth discussing, koji (kojic acid) is a skin-lightening agent and antioxidant. It is a tyrosinase (an enzyme that controls the production of melanin) inhibitor, but not as effective as other tyrosinase inhibitors like licorice extract. \"In combination with allantoin and other proper ingredients in sunscreen preparations, the mixture can inhibit UV-caused erythema and accelerate wound healing.\"² Unfortunately, it can also be sensitizing to some skin and create irritation.\n\nFrom this break down, we can assume that sake contains some sort of very mild exfoliating, humectant, and whitening properties, though it is important to keep in mind that there are no studies that I could find into the benefits of sake when applied topically, so this is all assumptions based on the chemical makeup.\n\nThe next ingredients on the list are ceramides 3 and 6. If you've been following my writings, you already know that ceramides are naturally found in the skin and help maintain the skin barrier. In fact, our skin's natural lipids are 35-40&#37; ceramides.\n\nSlightly more exciting is placental protein. Derived from animal placenta ([in this case, horse](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5fgonk/psa_kikumasamune_does_not_use_ingredient_derived/)), it is considered to be a safe ingredient that does not deliver any metabolic or endocrine activity. Again though, there was not much precedent that I could find on the benefits of including this ingredient specifically, however egg whites have been used for centuries on skin to make skin temporarily feel tighter and appear smoother.\n\n*Fun fact: Umbilical extract has precedent for unrestricted use in Japan, except for certain products.³*\n\nFinally, we arrive at the stars of this product: arbutin and licorice root extract. Arbutin, an ingredient primarily used for it's antioxidant properties as well as skin bleaching. It is a natural hydroquinone, derived synthetically or from bearberry plants. Once on the skin, it converts into hydroquinone and acts as a tyrosinase inhibitor. While not as effective as hydroquinone, it lacks the concerns of hydroquinone thus has become more popular in recent years.\n\nLicorice root extract is similarly a tyrosinase inhibitor as well as an anti-irritant - with some studies signalling that it may be able to absorb UVA and UVB rays. It is more effective than kojic acid and some studies put it at 75x more effective than ascorbic acid ([though Dr Dray raises some interesting points regarding the efficacy of L-AA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JxO6sVMJzM)). \"The chief constituent of licorice root is glycyrrhizin, present in concentrations that range from 5 to 24 percent depending on the variety of licorice used.\"²\n\n# My Experience\n\n**My skin type:** Rosacean, acne-prone and extremely irritation-prone\n\nFirstly, the pump on my bottle broke off rather spectacularly when my bottle took a tumble from my tiny bathroom counter top. I'm not sure why this product comes with a pump applicator in the first place, as it frequently would dispense more product than I needed, which I suppose is fine as I was able to spread it down my neck and chest, but it was still was a bit of a shock to get a whole handful of it on the first pump. This experience doesn't seem limited to me, so I really recommend decanting this product into a better dispenser if you can, like a spritz top bottle.\n\nPackaging aside, the first time I used the High Moist lotion, I was pretty nervous. It's a very runny product, sharing a consistency with water, and if you've read my blog at all you know that I am a fairly dry-skinned lady. To my surprise and delight though, it was *uber* moisturizing. I applied it fresh out of the shower, in place of my HadaLabo Premium, and instantly my skin just felt soft and supple. I imagine much of this is due to the placenta protein filling in the gaps of the skin cells and creating a \"smooth\" texture as well as the ceramides, which tend to plump up my skin and make it feel softer.\n\nThe fragrance was also so mild that frankly, the smell of sake overpowered it. Thankfully this smell seemed to dissipate after a few minutes of application, and my rosacea did not flare up from the inclusion of fragrance. Over the next few days, I used the High Moist in place of my HadaLabo, and then began to combine it at night with the HadaLabo Premium on top. It worked well with oils and other moisturizing products on top - no pilling or strange film to report.\n\nIn two weeks, my skin looked brighter and felt smoother, though none of my dark spots had faded. Unfortunately, like most products with ferments, it began to break me out after this time. The good news though is that it doesn't appear to break me out immediately, unlike every other ferment, and the smoothness lasted for a few days after I discontinued use, which means I may try to use it sparingly once my skin heals.\n\n# Sources\n\n1.

    "body": "Hey there!\n\nAnytime I look up any shop with skincare, the first product I ever see is The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% and Zinc 1% or their HA serums or surprisingly even Vitamin C and others. I'm quite curious about the thoughts of people who actually use products from The Ordinary and give me their honest opinion on why they use these sorts of products.\n\n# Niacinamide efficacy exaggerated\n\nLong story short, those products are formulated either with high-strength formulas, such as 10% niacinamide (although the studied norm is 2-5%) SOURCE: [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2921764/) which proves its efficiency at such levels. Even dermatologists do not advise using such serums with high strength. SOURCE (Dr. Dray): [Time: 19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlMzeNNHkss&ab_channel=DrDray) and other dermatologists. The fact is most moisturizers and sunscreens already contain that sort of percentage (usually between 2-5%) and adding up to it will essentially just cause more irritation.\n\nOne argument I hear all the time is that \"it's just causing purging at first, it's okay!\". Well, it cannot cause purging when it is not exfoliating (speeding up cell turnover) which is what Vitamin A derivatives, BHA, AHA, AA, and other actives do. Again, SOURCE: [Dr. Dray YT Video (includes time)](https://youtu.be/0jr9FEd4XCQ?t=101).\n\nAnother argument may be that it is really helpful for some. Well, I'd argue that there are much better ingredients to help with the issues. Anything that niacinamide does, there are things that do it better. This ingredient is basically overrated by certain skinfluencers (Hyram and others). For example, PIE is better to be treated with either Centella Asiatica (active components!!!) or mild exfoliation with AA, they both do it better. Combining them may help, but with the reserve, that PIE may be aggravated by high-strength Niacinamide. It's a very misunderstood ingredient and I see many people around here spread information about it that is based on a ridiculously high amount of niacinamide. The Ordinary just made this hype much worse and pretty much falsely lead that this serum will cure their problems.\n\n# Vitamin C from TO?\n\nAnother thing I find rather strange is their Vitamin C. It does not meet any of the studies that are presented in Vitamin C research. I'm talking mostly about their Ascorbic Acid 8% & Alpha Arbutane 2%. It literally does not meet any of the requirements. Ascorbic Acid requires a certain threshold of percentage, they use 8% which is extremely low. They do not disclose the pH, they do not contain any stabilizers such as Vitamin E and there's nobody to guarantee it won't oxidize nearly immediately. Their Vitamin C derivates are questionable to work, there are no studies whatsoever to prove their efficacy of them compared to Asc. Acid. The other ones are just either too high or still lack any of these things. SOURCE: [Dr. Dray Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AOil4sydzg&t=654s&ab_channel=DrDray)\n\n# Overall thoughts\n\nThe only products I actually find interesting and may be good are Hyaluronic Acid and Azelaic Acid, which still pills anyway and there are much better Azelaic Acid formulations. I also quite like the Squalane Cleanser and the Moisturizer is not so bad either. Their sunscreens are essentially a joke and Retinols have no proof of actually working. Overall, the brand has a few good picks, but I think they just made community disruption by creating the Niacinamide serum, which they made lots of money on. Even I used it in 2020, broke out, and called it purging. **I'm not claiming nor have I ever claimed these products cannot work for some people**, but they're certainly not the best brand out there and even The Inkey List has pretty much better alternatives for an affordable price. The trend of Niacinamide should stop. Other issues are that skinfluencers constantly recommend products they do not understand themselves clearly. People listen to them quite frequently and most of the time they just say \"avoid pore-clogging ingredients\" which literally is another concept made by them. These trends are just awful and I wanted to post this to mainly discuss why TO is such an \"amazing brand\" according to consumers and not skinfluencers and why you (not all, of course) listen to them when they have no education whatsoever. I'm curious to hear your answers and hopefully, I did not hurt anyone writing this post.",

My skin ended up liking their AA + HA serum a lot, and now I know I can look for that ingredient when looking for better products for my face. Meanwhile, I also have a whole separate routine for my body (body acne sucks), and TO products are some of the only products with these kinds of ingredients that I can actually afford to use all over my body. \n\nYou mention that using such high strength Niacinamide isn’t ideal because it’s already found in other products and too much can cause irritation, but I’ve found that pairing TO’s Niacinamide/Zinc serum and the AA + HA serum on my body to treat PIE is really effective. This might be because the skin on my body is tough enough to handle the higher concentrations, and I don’t use other moisturizers/sunscreens generally. I’d love to use something with centella asiatica on my body, but again I have yet to find an affordable enough product with this ingredient to use. \n\nSo ya, I’d agree that TO isn’t the best brand out there, but there’s some good reasons to use it. If I was made of money, though, I’d probably use other more effective products.",

While Dr Dray's opinions are certainly based on a range of scientific arguments, there are also dermatologists who are fans of the Ordinary (the channel doctorly for example), including their retinoids or niacinamide products. So while skincare is science-based, I'd say there is still a lot of subjectivity as to how studies are interpreted and applied to skincare by different medical professionals. \n\nAnd if people say that certain products work for them, I think it's a bit condescending that the OP assumes that would only be placebo just because they've listened to one dermatologist say that they don't like a specific product or because they personally don't like it. I also find it odd to argue about whether a product works for others - OP doesn't know them or their skin. And even if it were just placebo - that's still a medically relevant effect. I would also doubt that it actually is placebo if some products worked for them and others didn't. \n\nSo, OP asked why some people like it, and they have given their answers. And while it's certainly an interesting question to ask, I find it off-putting, that OP seems to try to want to argue people out of using products they like and that work for them.",

I had to test the products adequately before making my mind about them. Other than the products in the picture, I purchased the Milk Protein Shampoo Bar as well. Overall I am very angry at myself for trying these products out.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **0.5% FERULIC ACID, 15% VITAMIN C, 1% VITAMIN E MULTIVITAMIN AGE DEFENSE SERUM**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled Water, L-Ascorbic Acid Vitamin C, Alpha Tocopherol Vitamin E, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, D Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate)\n\n***My experience:***  This is the product I was the most excited about. Vitamin C is a powerhouse of an antioxidant and has many proven skin benefits. L-Ascorbic Acid is the most potent and studied form of Vitamin C, notorious for being highly unstable. I have used a bunch of Vitamin C serums but it can be really hard to find a well-formulated one, especially in India. I so wanted this to work out. Unfortunately, this serum broke my blemish-free skin-so-good spell (or Copper Peptide - will explain later). My skin was perfect right before the ER haul. After trying these products my skin started to break out left right and center. So after being frustrated with my new breakouts, I decided to check the PH of this serum. To my surprise, the PH came out to be PH 6-7. Vitamin C's work best between PH 2-3.5. I contacted the brand to know what they claim for the PH to be. They informed me the PH for the product is \"PH 2.5-3.2\" on their Instagram handle. I took it up further and after a lot of back and forth. [This](https://imgur.com/a/ihKkY6T) is the reply I received from the brand owner.  The preservatives & PH stabilizers that reacted were not mentioned in the ingredients list. I asked her later why they were not mentioned? I was told that the PH stabilizers and preservatives were less than 0.5% and anything less than 0.5% was not required to be mentioned. I, personally cannot understand that L-AA (15% and highly acidic PH 1-2) could turn a PH of 6-7 with just 0.01% of Ph stabilizers (As per what she claimed).\n\n***Texture:*** Thick goopy. I could sort of see/feel the ascorbic acid particles in the serum. It was clear when it arrived but has turned slightly yellow now.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** All in all, the product was unstable and breaking me out (maybe). I will not be repurchasing unless I find out the changed and fixed the formula.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Took a picture of the vitamin C serum. It turned slightly yellow now. It was clear when it arrived.](https://preview.redd.it/a5ikili8bjg51.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd81bcb46e515122c37d2f0c79d1440712e1a2f0)\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **COPPER TRIPEPTIDE + PHYTO CERAMIDE SERUM**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled Water, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Phospholipids (and Sphingolipids, Copper tripeptide-1, Tocopherol, Benzyl Alcohol & Glycerin & Sorbic Acid.))\n\n***My experience:*** I wanted to include copper-peptides in my routine after Gothamista raved about them. I haven't been able to get my hands on the TO/Niod ones. Let's copy-paste everything about my excitement and the sadness in what really happened with Vitamin C, here, as well. Basically, PH came out to be PH 2-3. The brand claimed it to be around PH 6-7. The owner admitted something went wrong. I discontinued usage. I received this product 2-3 days earlier to the Vitamin C serum. I broke out 2 days after introducing the Vitamin C & the Bakuchiol. I thought it was vitamin C that broke me out but in afterthought, it could be this serum as well. Maybe my skin barrier was ducked because of these, maybe it was an ingredient. Who knows? Interestingly this product mentions the preservatives. Not sure if it is because they are in a % above 0.05% or the brand just decided to put these in the ingredients list on the website.\n\n***Texture:*** Watery liquid, blue in color. Did not sting after application, slightly irritated my eyelids.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** All in all, the product was unstable and breaking me out (maybe). I will not be repurchasing unless I find out the changed and fixed the formula.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **SKIN SMOOTHENING SERUM - BAKUCHIOL EXTRACT**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Vitus vinifera \\[Grape seed oil\\], Psoralea corylifolia \\[Bakuchiol Extract7%\\], Vitamin E \\[Tocopheryl Acetate\\], Tanacetum annum \\[Tansy Essential Oil\\])\n\n***My experience:*** I had read a lot about Bakuchiol and wanted to give it a try. Bakuchiol can have anti-acne and anti-aging benefits very comparable to tretinoin as per primary studies. However, Bakuchiol is not the same as Babchi oil. A lot of brands claim to be using Babchi oil and that can actually have some side effects. This [article](https://bakuchiol.net/2019/10/14/babchi-oil-versus-bakuchiol/) explains the difference well. Thus I had contacted ER before purchasing to ensure they were using Bakuchiol and not Babchi extract. They claimed they were indeed using Bakuchiol. On the first experience, it had the typical essential oil smell. The fragrance is toooooo much and it lingers. As per the ingredients list on site, it seems like it could be the Tansy oil, which I have no clue a to why it was added. Essential oils provide no benefit other than fragrance. Since I was breaking out I thought it must be this oil at first. So I just used it once and did not use it again till I found out it could be the products mentioned above. After that, I have tried two attempts to use this product. I tried to use it at night as a face oil. The smell lingers and it can be a good thing or a bad thing(depending on your preference). It is definitely not good for the skin. I didn't experience any breakouts but it did not give me any benefits in the short period I tried to use it. The smell was just too much for me. Thus, I tried to use it as a massage oil, pre-cleansing. It worked well initially. However, I started to notice my face getting red and sensitive after a few days so I stopped. I haven't use the oil ever since. I may give it another attempt but the fragrance is a huge turn-off.\n\n***Texture:*** Lightweight, nonsticky, oily.\n\n***Another issue:*** The ingredients list [on the ](https://imgur.com/a/cQdPBJY)[pack](https://imgur.com/a/cQdPBJY) was different than the one online. I mentioned this issue to the owner as well. She did not respond to this issue. Not sure if this was just another error or if this is the correct one actually.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** Please remove the essential oil from this product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **MILK PROTEIN SHAMPOO BAR**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Cocos Nucifera \\[Coconut Oil\\], Hydrolysed Milk Protein, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, and Cetyl Alcohol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium PEG-7 Olive Oil Carboxylate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Tocopheryl Acetate \\[Vitamin E\\], Benzyl Alcohol & Salicylic Acid & Glycerin & Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My Hair type:*** Low porosity 1c-2a, scalp prone to dermatitis, was experiencing heavy hormonal hair fall during that period.\n\n***My experience:*** I purchased this after hearing a lot of hype around their shampoo bars. This did not increase my hair fall and when it arrived it looked really small but I think a little goes a long way with this one. I think it felt it was really gentle but not suitable for my hair type. It made my hair frizzier and slick at the same time although my scalp and hair both felt clean.\n\n***Status:*** May try another bar better suited for my hair type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **MOIST REPAIR HAIR CONDITIONER**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled water, Glycerine and Water and Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Organic Glycerine, Quaternium-91, and Cetrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetyl Alcohol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Water & Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/Leaf Extract & Saccharum Officinarum \\[Sugar Cane\\] Extract & Citrus Aurantium Dulcis \\[Orange\\] Fruit Extract & Citrus Limon \\[Lemon\\] Fruit Extract & Acer Saccharum \\[Sugar Maple\\] Extract, dl-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, Benzyl Alcohol, and Salicylic Acid and Glycerin and Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My Hair type:*** Low porosity 1c-2a, scalp prone to dermatitis, was experiencing heavy hormonal hairfall during that period.\n\n***My experience:*** On the website, they claim that this can be used on the roots as well. I tried that a few times.  It felt like it left a film on my hair and my hair looked greasy like that, thus I just started applying this on my ends. It does help detangle hair in the shower and it makes hair softer. However once dry, my hair becomes frizzier and tangled after wash. Again, I feel it may not be suited for my hair type. I think people which thick hair might like this.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **DEEP CONDITIONER HAIR BUTTER WITH HIBISCUS, SHIKKAKAI & ARNICA EXTRACT**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Butyrospermum Parkii \\[Shea Butter\\], Theobroma Cacao \\[Cocoa Seed Butter\\], Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Ricinus communist \\[Castor\\] Seed Oil, Cocos Nucifera \\[Coconut\\] Oil, Aloe vera Juice, Arnica Montana \\[Arnica flower\\]extract, Water, Glycerin, Persea Gratissima \\[Avocado\\] Fruit Extract, Acacia Concinna Fruit Extract, Tamarindus Indica Fruit Extract, Hibiscus Rosa-Senensis Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis \\[Rosemary\\] leaf extract, Tocopheryl Acetate \\[Vitamin E\\], Olea Europaea \\[Olive\\] Leaf Extract, Water \\[aqua\\].Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol and Salicylic Acid and Glycerin and Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My experience:*** The website claims that this can be used as a leave-in cream as well but I just used it as a hair mask and washed after 1-2 hrs. It left my hair extremely nourished and soft but really greasy. Even after washing it with a sulfate shampoo by hair were pretty much weighed down. I think this would be good for those with thick hair. I liked it for extra nourishment. I will use this up. I didn't notice my hair falling excessively while using this. The quantity is really little though and I am not sure how many uses you can get if you have very thick voluminous hair.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **ORGANIC LIP** **~~SCRUB~~** **STICK**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Organic Cocos nucifera (Coconut Oil, Ricinus communis (Castor Seed Oil, Beeswax \\[Cera Alba\\], Hydrogenated Olive Oil and Olea Europaea \\[Olive\\] Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii \\[Shea Butter\\] and Organic Brown Sugar)\n\n***My experience:*** This product was a complete dud. Maybe I received a lip balm instead of a scrub. Maybe the sugar particles melted. Maybe my product did not have any sugar particles. I rubbed half the product to ensure that they were not buried deep inside. This was just a hard thick balm, not moisturizing at all. It has no scrub particles. This was a major disappointment. I had to contact ER for several days to get this fixed. I have no clue what went wrong with this product.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***OVERALL BRAND REVIEW:***\n\nI appreciate how candid the owner was in admitting what could have gone wrong. Her responses seemed genuine. After much discussion about the unstable formulation, I had to wait a long while before the refund was processed for the defective items. I left reminder emails for the refund which was just very embarrassing. The owner, however, provided me a complete refund for all my purchases which is kind & generous.\n\n***I hate that they did not announce the issues in their batches on their Instagram/website. A batch can have anywhere around 500-20,000 units(approx). If the whole batch was bad, I feel those customers deserve a refund/new product.***\n\nI think the brand is still in the learning stage. I think their hair products may be nice. I can see them working out for some people. The skin care products were a major no-no.  I had a lot of expectations from the brand as they position themselves to be aware and first movers in the Indian skincare industry. I was gravely disappointed to know that the formulas are not well researched and; even though the brand is big on disclosure, they are not purposely going out of their way to list the complete ingredients list. No dyes, colors, preservatives, and ph stabilizers below 0.5% will be mentioned. Their sunscreen has no PA/PPD ratings.\n\nTheir packaging for both the lip scrub and the glass dropper bottle sucks. The bamboo exterior in the packaging is lined with a plastic interior. It makes the caps and sticks bulkier and thus hard to open and close. The brand heavily advertises and markets itself to be a clean/green brand. The bamboo cap packaging just looks like a gimmick though. It serves no real purpose. I appreciate the glass containers and the aluminum pump bottles although. They feel lux. Also, all products are packaged with a lot of newspaper stuffing, which I prefer over bubble wraps. Points for that.\n\nBy their brand marketing, they are trying to cater to both scientific and natural skincare consumers. The owner in a later email claimed that they aren't running the brand for-profit and are very motivated to reinvent the skincare industry. I can see that they are motivated but I cannot see how the brand is not focused on profits. Their products aren't cheap and they have invested heavily in marketing and influencer codes. I can see ER becoming the next JC. I am just sad that my experience was not nice. I hope the brand does try to take feedback and focuses more on quality and formulation. I think the brand has a lot of potential. They have a good marketing team and are developing products that are needed in the Indian market today. All their products look very interesting. I wish they ace their formulations as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: **The brand owner contacted me that they have been getting a lot of hate since my post. I want to shout it out that it's ok to voice your criticism but any kind of bullying is NOT ok. Everyone is welcome to make purchase decisions based on what they seem fit but all our personal thoughts do not need to be aired.** **We are all human.** **Please don't send any hate to the owner. This does not mean I want to stop you from sharing your views/experiences. Just be careful of your words.**\n\n**She also let me know the steps and changes they have made following the event.** [Here](https://imgur.com/X5vr0sn) **is a screenshot of our conversation.**\n\n&#x200B;",

Also if one batches PH went wrong I hope they weren’t being cheap and informed the other people who purchased from that batch and refunded them.

And the bottle of sunscreen was swapped with a bottle of deep ceramide moisturser .\n\nThey even went on saying that they haven't got any single negative review about copper tripeptide and phyto fuse moisturser and i hence I should continue using those two.\nI agreed...as I trusted them...( Another mistake)\n\nAll this communication started on July 28th.2020\n\nFew days back this post on reddit went viral where the owner admitted to the fact that their copper tripeptide serum was unstable . And they will recall the product. The person who wrote that post got refunded in full...\n\nSo now alarmed ...I again sent them emails...but never got any response.\nFinally I sent them DM s on instagram...\n\nWhere after much contemplation they agreed to refund me only for the copper tripeptide serum and not other two products. \n\nBut they still refused to refund me for sunscreen and phyto fuse moisturser stating some internal policies.\n\nI even asked them to arrange for a pick up of all their products from my place and refund me in full...but the owner cut me short amd asked me bluntly if they could go ahead with the refund of only copper tripeptide serum or not. I agreed for the partial refund fearing even that might get stuck.\n\nI am sad,angry , frustrated and feeling a little agitatedand cheated ..\n\n\nDone with the brand EARTH RHYTHM for ever....\nAnd yes I lost 1100 bucks of my hard earned money in the pursuit..\n\nI might be labelled as a hater or someone trying to bring down the brand.trust me I never wanted to do this on a public platform .\nI sent them dms and emails...but the double standards of that brand left me with no choice..they sold me faulty products very well knowing their own shortcomings and then deny me full refund to which I m entitled for as a customer.",

    "body": "First of all, these are a list of products available in Boots that I've found, so they're non-exhaustive. Apart from some Neutrogena products and No7 Beautiful Skin Blemish Defence Serum, they contain \"alcohol denat.\", which is a dealbreaker for me as I try to avoid drying alcohols as much as I can. \n\nBHAs are few and very far in between, in addition to not being labelled as such and most probably without the percentage of salicylic acid contained or whether it's in the right pH to be effective. \n\nI haven't done a price comparison, and since I found them in Boots I've used the online site's price point. Prices are only as a guide, they may be cheaper/more expensive elsewhere. Ingredients are highlighted to point out the position of salicylic acid, as well as presence of drying alcohols and parfum for those irritated by them. \n\nAdditional suggestions, opinions and reviews are very welcome!\n\n* PRODUCT: Boots Skin Clear Deep Blackhead Cleansing Lotion\n\nPRICE: £2.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua (Water), **Alcohol denat.**, **Salicylic acid**, PPG-1-PEG-9 lauryl glycol ether, Butylene glycol, Potassium hydroxide, Ammonium glycyrrhizate, **Parfum (Fragrance)**, Dipropylene glycol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Deep Cleansing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.29 for 65 exfoliating pads\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat., Salicylic Acid,** Isoceteth-20, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Hydroxide, Triethanolamine, Allantoin, **Parfum**, **Menthol**, Benzyl Salicylate, Disodium EDTA, Limonene, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Pads\n\nPRICE: 5.39 for 65 pads\n\nINGREDIENTS:Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, **Salicylic Acid**, Hydrogen Peroxide, **Parfum**, Sodium Hydroxide, Dextrin, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Superfruits Refreshing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.07\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, Glycerin, **Salicylic Acid**, **Parfum**, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Sodium Hydroxide, Propylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Limonene, Citronellol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Hexyl Cinnamal, Rubus Idaeus Juice, Trideceth-9, Vaccinium Macrocarpon Fruit Juice, Geraniol, Bisabolol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Garnier Pure Active line (various)\n\nPRICE: from £4.99 to £7.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: I can't find an ingredients list anywhere, which is frustrating but as a guide, I remember putting all the Garnier products down because they contain \"Alcohol Denat.\" The packaging lists 2% salicylic acid.

While I could see the improvements, it would feel like my skin was burning. I'm not sure if it's due to the age of the bottle, or just the ingredients, but I discontinued use.\n\nThen I bought *Boots Skin Clear Deep Cleansing Lotion* which is exactly the same as the Blackhead version just with an extra word on the front. It feels just like[ L'Occitaine's Shea Butter Toner](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8adf20777.html) that's alcohol free, but a month in and I don't really feel like it's doing anything.\n\nI used to use Neutrogena a lot and I really liked their grapefruit range, but the *Neutrogena VISIBLY CLEAR Pink Grapefruit Oil-Free Moisturiser* stopped being effective far too quickly. It goes on really light which I like, but after a while my skin either feels dry, or really oily. I felt it was super hit and miss.\n\nWith the Neutrogena Visibly Clear Spot Stress Control Hydrating Spot Treatment, is that just on acne, do you put it on under moisturiser or as a moisturiser?",

    "body": "⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** Since making this post, I've learned some new information that has changed my perception and usage of the term \"fungal-safe\". I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️\n\nThis post doesn't include treatment, which I think has been covered pretty well. r/FungalAcne will teach you everything you need to know! This [beautiful breakdown of the entire skin condition](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/), by the amazing f.c., covers most everything. \n\nAlso of interest might be [my post on how to use anti-fungal or anti-dandruff shampoos effectively.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibxm82/how_to_use_dandruff_fungal_acne_treatments/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) \n\nIf you want to check a particular product yourself, copy the ingredients list and paste it into a dedicated search engine like [Sezia](https://www.sezia.co/) or [Folliculitis Scout](https://folliculitisscout.com/). I use Sezia ☺\n\nThe challenge after treating malassezia is... what else to use? Maybe your active fungal acne is gone, but it comes back if you use your usual products. It's hard to find fungal safe products in India, and this is what I worked out for myself. IN MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, SO YOU CAN'T SUE ME LATER, OKAY? K, thanx 😂❤ These are products I have personally used, that worked for me. \n\nYou don't have to have fungal acne to use them, of course, but they won't contribute to the growth of Malassezia or \"normal\" acne☺ \n\n#Cleansers\n\n+ **Garnier Micellar Cleansing Water** *₹175 for 125 ml* the PINK one, for sensitive skin. I use this to remove makeup or sunscreen, ~~with reusable cotton pads I got off Amazon~~ in a foaming pump bottle, using the foam on dry skin. It works, is fungal safe, and isn't as time consuming as oil cleansing. 5/5\n\n\n+ **Amazon Brand - Solimo Micellar Water** *₹87 for 200 ml* - I had to recheck that price, but nope. That's how much it currently costs on Amazon 😧 I think the price does vary on the website, but it's always cheaper than the Garnier micellar water, and works exactly the same, far as I can see 😆 5/5\n\n\n+ **Clean & Clear Natural Bright Face Wash** *₹60 for 50 ml* . Has glycerin as second ingredient, I think. A very nice, basic gel that doesn't foam much and is fungal safe. 4/5\n\n+ **Re'equil Fruit AHA Face Wash** *₹450 for 200 ml* great as an introduction to chemical exfoliation! I use it at night, less these days because of tretinoin. The ingredients are gentle enough that I can leave it on for ten minutes, as a mild treatment. Pricey, but the bottle lasts me at least six months. 5/5\n\n\n+ **Rejusure 2% Salicylic Acid Face Wash** *₹350 for 100ml* available for less than 300, usually. This has been my nightly cleanser (built up to daily use), and how I use a BHA, because BHA serums don't seem to do anything for me 😂 It's a very nice, non-stripping cleanser that doesn't foam a lot... it's lasted me over *six months* and still isn't over 😦 5/5\n\n\n+ **Johnson's Baby Oil with Vitamin E** *₹190 for 200 ml*. I use this to oil cleanse once a week, or when I feel like my pores are especially clogged. I spend at least fifteen minutes massaging it in till it's warm and melts the sebaceous clogs, then use warm water and a microfiber cloth to remove most of it, massaging in between putting the warm towel on my face, to \"steam\" it. Works great. \n\nWould NOT recommend doing this daily, as the heat and occlusion can worsen fungal acne, and that much massage is way too long and will irritate fungal acne, \"normal\" acne, or sensitive skin. It's a deep cleanse. Followed up with a face wash. \n\nUPDATE: I now oil cleanse using:\n\n+ **Luxura Sciences MCT Oil** *₹399 for 250ml* - switched to using this instead of Baby Oil because it's lighter, fungal-safe, and can be adequately washed off with face wash, which allows me to avoid the potential dehydration and irritation of hot towels ☺ I use this to remove makeup, as well, with minimal massage... I used to use my [DIY emulsifying oil cleanser](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/pq7szk/how_to_make_a_diy_emulsifying_cleansing_oil/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), but the emulsifiers are not fungal-safe, and it recently worsened a malassezia breakout I just had 🙃 I suggest you stick to plain baby oil or MCT if your malassezia is active. \n\n\n#Treatments/actives\n\n\n+ **Aziderm Gel** (AZELAIC ACID) *₹260 for 15 gms* (I have used both the 15% and 20%, pretty interchangeably, because my skin was already irritated from fungal acne, and there was not much difference between the effect of the two. I've used it with success as a treatment for fungal acne, \"normal\" acne, redness, and hyperpigmentation. If you have brown skin with any of these concerns, and want to use an active for the first time, I RECOMMEND AZELAIC ACID. It actually soothes skin, as opposed to irritating it! It does mattify the skin. This is a prescription product. (But apparently products containing 10% are available online, and don't need a prescription.) 5/5\n\n\n+ **Recast Aqua Radiance Deep Cleansing Gel** *₹450 for 200 ml*. This is a Korean-style peeling gel, or \"gommage\" type exfoliant, that also has AHAs in it, so you get a really good chemical exfoliation plus a very gentle physical exfoliation. It does tingle a tiny bit on my skin, but I'm using tretinoin regularly, so it may not do that to you. I use it maybe once every two weeks because of tretinoin, but I'd recommend it as a weekly, or twice weekly chemical exfoliation for most people! 4/5 \n\nUPDATE: I no longer use this... not because there's anything wrong with it, I just find that my cleansers with actives give me enough exfoliation, and I like doing DIY face packs instead of massaging now - my sensitive skin prefers less friction ☺\n\n+ **Minimalist Niacinamide 5% + Hyaluronic Acid 1%** *₹599 for 30ml*. Good for barrier repair and hydration, since malassezia, and the treatments for it, can be dehydrating and cause impaired barrier function. Be sure to use on a damp face, and finish with a moisturiser on top, even if it's only aloe gel. I've used a bottle of this up, and would recommend for anyone with FA wanting simple hydration and support for skin health. Less finicky than making your own mist and stuff 😂 5/5\n\n\n#Capyrlic Triglycerides, or C8 Oil\nis the isolated part of coconut oil that is antifungal! You'll see it in ingredients lists pf creams and moisturizers a lot, listed as \"capric/caprylic triglycerides\", which are C10 and C8 respectively (the number of carbon atoms.. It's chemistry... not important 😂). I have used:\n\n\n+ **NUM NUM Superfoods Pure C8 Oil** *₹400 for 100 ml*. I'm probably going to keep using this indefinitely, even if I don't get fungal cane, because it's light and my skin likes it. 5/5. When I had active fungal acne, I used to use just two drops of this on a wet face and nothing else, before sunscreen in the morning. It is a really effective treatment + \"moisturiser\", but using too much will defeat the purpose, because it will insulate and heat up your skin, which will cause fungal acne to grow. Use sparingly! \n\n#Moisturiser\n\nEDIT: This section is outdated 😂 There's a few moisturisers available now that are fungal-safe, you don't *have* to mix and layer like I did! 😆🙏🏽 Listed at the end of the post. \n\n+ **Rahul Phate's lnnovations : Hydra-smooth Hydrating Gel** *₹555 for 100gms* (contains urea!!!) : [here's the detailed review](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/prsssq/review_of_rahul_phates_hydrasmooth_hydrating_gel/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). This is currently what I would recommend to anyone with FA. It's been perfect for me so far ☺🙏🏽 5/5. Downside is, it's not vegan 😅\n\n+ The safest bet is aloe Gel, but not all are fungal safe! The two I have used and that have done good are the:\n\n1. **Body Cupid 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel** *₹299 for 200 ml* (Really soothing and actually makes a difference to redness or irritation!) 5/5, and \n\n2. **WOW Aloe Vera Multipurpose Beauty Gel** *₹245 for 150ml* (Less effective than the Body Cupid one, but works fine) 4/5. Gels contain XANTHAN GUM, which is a plant-derived thickener and film-forming agent. The film it leaves over your skin is usually enough for oily skin in summer. \n\n+ UREA + LACTIC ACID cream. **Remoiz** or **Moisturex** *₹220 for 100 gms* 5/5, but depends on your using it wisely! It's 10% urea, 10% lactic acid in a paraffin base. When I had fungal acne and wanted more moisture than just aloe gel, I mixed a SMALL dab of this, and three drops C8 oil, into the aloe gel at night, as both a very mild exfoliating moisturizer and a treatment for the fungal acne. You don't have to mix in the oil, because the urea cream's paraffin is occlusive enough, but I liked the resulting texture 😂 Otherwise, I do use this cream straight on my feet, knees, elbows, butt.. Anywhere the skin is thicker. \n\nUsing it neat on the face may break you out - not necessarily because of overexfoliating (as I previously thought), but simply because the paraffin base is quite heavy. Urea is a keratolytic when it's *over* 10%, so in Moisturex it's not exfoliating - the 10% lactic acid is, though! Urea has many benefits to the skin barrier, thickness and resilience, as detailed in [this SimpleSkincareScience blog post. ](https://simpleskincarescience.com/urea-for-skin/) \n\n#Oils/occlusives\n\n+ **Squalane Oil** The price of squalane varies depending on the brand. Whether it's derived from olives or sugarcane [seems to make a difference in whether or not it is fungal safe](https://simpleskincarescience.com/squalene-squalane-oil-review-acne/#Olive_vs_Sugarcane_Squalane_Which_Is_Better_Are_Both_Safe_for_Fungal_Acne), but most people seem to be able to use either, without triggering an FA breakout. I used squalane for a while before realizing I had FA, and enjoyed using it a lot, because of how silky it is, and how well it sinks into the skin. I now prefer C8 oil, because it's like doing an ongoing maintenance treatment on the daily ☺ But if you have an FA safe routine that works for you, squalane can make a nice addition as a soothing face oil... It's a great oil for all skin types! \n\nIf you have DRY sensitive skin, with barrier damage *and* FA, I highly recommend squalane oil. If you want details, check out this amazing post: [Why Squalane Oil Is the Best Oil According to 40 Studies](https://simpleskincarescience.com/squalene-squalane-oil-review-acne/). TLDR, it's very light and non greasy, will not feed the fungus, and is a great emollient and occlusive ☺\n\n+ **Luxura Sciences MCT Oil** *₹399 for 250ml* Purchased this after the C8 oil became unavailable. Works much the same as the C8 oil, but seems a tiny bit heavier (could be imagining it 😂). Doesn't break me out ☺ \n\n+ **Boroline Night Repair Cream** technically, it's a balm, not a cream. No water. (affordable, found at most chemists. Contains lanolin as the second last ingredient, but doesn't trigger my own FA. It's not clear if lanolin is fungal acne safe, some even say it's antifungal. I can only say that, for me, the small amount in Boroline hasn't triggered my FA). Boroline night cream has the same ingredients as plain Boroline, it's just smoother and more cosmetically elegant. I use them interchangeably. \n\nBoroline has been LOVELY to offset tretinoin-induced dryness and irritation, since it also contains soothing zinc oxide, mineral oil, and paraffin wax. May be too occlusive for use in summer, but using a tiny amount at night might work for you. I think it's great that there's an occlusive OPTION for those with FA, because barrier function is really compromised by fungal infections, and using a thin layer of occlusive overnight really helps with healing.. Boroline is way nicer to use than Vaseline, and not AS occlusive/ sweaty. \n\nUpdate: I've been using Boroline in winter as a last step! It's not oily or greasy, and doesn't rub off onto my pillow. You can use a small amount in a very thin layer by by rubbing it between your palms, (so it warms up and spreads better) and patting it onto your skin. \n\n\nSUNSCREEN - After much searching and heartbreak, I have settled on\n\n\n+  **The Blessing Tree Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50 PA+++** *₹249 for 100 ml* (IT'S FUNGAL SAFE. 😭Sobs in gratitude for her sunscreen😭 No white cast. Has fragrance, but it's so mild I had to go smell it to be sure, hehe. Smells kind of like baby lotion... I do get oily midday, but I don't care 😂) 4/5. But I'll never stop using it 😂 UPDATE: The latest formulation is neither greasy nor matte, very natural! - there are concerns about its photostability, FYI. Check reviews in the sub and decide. I now use UVDoux if I'm going outside. \n\n\nSo, here's a sample morning routine:\n\n\nCleanser, Mist/serum, Aloe Gel, Sunscreen. Or skip the mist if it's really humid. \n\n\nAnd for night:\n\n\nMicellar water, Cleanser, Azelaic Acid...wait ten minutes for max effectiveness of azelaic acid, Mist/serum, Aloe Gel + tiny dab of Urea cream, Three drops of C8 Oil. \n\n\n#Technique\n\n\n+ **Firstly**. More important than anything else, even if you're using fungal safe products, you have to prevent your skin from becoming too hot and occluded. If the weather is hot AND humid, **YOU MAY NOT NEED ANY MOISTURIZER** If you \"seal\" it too much, it creates a greenhouse kinda effect, and it won't matter even if your products are safe, the fungal acne grows. Same goes for \"normal\" acne, to some extent.\n\n\n+ **Secondly**, we still want our skin to become healthier and develop resistance, so hydration is important. This is why I recommend the Minimalist 5% niacinamide, 1% hyaluronic acid serum, or something similar. Water, not oil! All creams are a balance of water and oil, and it's the same balance we have to maintain in our skin. Unfortunately, most common emulsifiers will trigger fungal acne, so most creams are out. Hence the layering of water-attracting humectants and emollient, occlusive oil. Same effect, no emulsifying. A lot of oily skinned people are extra oily because their skin is dehydrated - not enough WATER. So I tend to do each step of the routine while the previous step is still DAMP. Very important! That way, the final step seals everything in juuust enough at night. \n\n\n+ **Thirdly**. Don't be afraid to mix to find your \"custom\" moisturizer. If a mist/serum and aloe gel isn't moisturising enough for you, or you just don't want to use mist/serum, add a two drops of C8 oil to the gel and massage that in! The oil will disperse nicely. If it's really humid weather, and you don't want to use oil at night, leave it out! Pay close attention to your own skin. If using urea cream freaks you out, don't use it! 😂❤ Even using two drops of C8 oil on a plain wet face works! As long as your face is WET, otherwise the oil-water balance is too much oil, not enough water.... \n\n\n**A TIP FOR FUNGAL ACNE** (or acne in general) : **TAKE A PROBIOTIC** I used:\n\n\n+ **Dr.Trust Probiotics 25 Billion CFU** *Rs. 899 for 60 capsules* (Follow the instructions. After every course of antibiotics, consider taking a course of probiotics for at least a couple weeks. I wish this was common knowledge. Our gut bacteria is SO IMPORTANT. You may feel gassy with your first dose, but it should subside.) 5/5. Probiotics have improved everything about my health. Even if you don't wanna use this brand or use a supplement long-term, take a probiotic supplement for a while, then take them as needed: after prolonged stress, illness, antibiotic use... Probiotics work only for the time they are being eaten, and yes, daily homemade dahi is a good way to get them ☺\n\nI currently take: \n\n+ **The Blessing Tree Probiotics with Prebiotics** Works fine. \n\nTBH, taking supplements is a matter of good faith. The supplement industry is largely unregulated as to the purity and safety of their products. It's up to customer discretion. So use your own judgement when it comes to whether you wanna take probiotics at all, which brand, for how long, etc. I can only share what I personally do 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\n\n**EDIT** : Some FA safe **MAKEUP** ! Just realized someone might appreciate the info 😂 These are things I have personally used:\n\n+ L'Oreal Infallible Pro-Matte foundation (Shade 108 is close to NC40, I believe) *Rs750 for 30ml* But frequently found online for a bit less. \n\n+ Insight Concealer Foundation (Shade 5 makes for a natural warm-toned concealer-corrector for NC42, Shade 2 is a proper highlighting shade, and Shade 1 I use as eyeshadow primer 😂 These 3 have warm undertones!) *Rs230 for 20ml* \n\n+ Insight 3in 1 Primer *Rs240 for 30ml* but available cheaper sometimes. Literally FOUR ingredients! Gotta love that! \n\n#Other fungal-safe products\n(will continue to link reviews as I try them, or as people on the sub post about them):\n\n\n**CLEANSERS:**\n\n+ Sebamed Clear Face Cleansing Foam\n\n+ Simple Kind to Skin Refreshing Face Wash\n\n+ Kaya Clinic Soothing Cleansing Gel\n\n+ Sebonac face wash (Skin Rejuvenating Gel) - contains 1% glycolic acid\n\n+ Deconstruct Niacinamide Brightening Face Wash - 2% Niacinamide+2% Liquorice Root Extract\n\n+ Deconstruct Salicylic Acid Oil Control Face Wash - 0.5% Salicylic Acid +1% Niacinamide\n\n+ Deconstruct Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Face Wash - 0.5% Amino Acids + 0.1% Hyaluronic Acid\n\n+ Body Cupid Deep Clarifying Face Wash (with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E) \n\n+ Body Cupid Tea Tree and Neem Anti Acne Face Wash (with Tea Tree Oil & Neem Extract) \n\n+ Body Cupid Vitamin C Brightening Face Wash (with Fruit Extract of Kakadu Plums) \n\nAll the Body Cupid face washes appear to be fungal-safe, but the ones I left out have \"menthol crystals\" and \"strawberry microbeads\" in, respectively, so... wouldn't recommend, even in theory 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\n+ Moiz Cleansing Lotion \n\n+ Bliscent Lychee & Sea Buckthorn Face Wash\n\n\n**MOISTURIZERS/HYDRATING SERUMS**\n\n+ Indiabulls Moimax OC Moisturizer Gel ([review here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/skgqi7/moimax_oc_oil_control_moisturiser/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), by u/Lazy_Telephone6759) \n\n\n+ Re'equil Oil Free Mattifying Moisturiser (the one in the pump, [this one](https://www.reequil.com/products/oil-free-mattifying-moisturiser?variant=32318341218436&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&utm_source=google-ads&utm_medium=smart-shopping&utm_campaign=all-products&gclid=Cj0KCQiA15yNBhDTARIsAGnwe0Uf0_BxawOYd7w6F_n6oiW9WNRzrfh3auXV-Dih7Zwbj_ceNa32EGcaAvW4EALw_wcB), NOT the oil-free one in the tube). \n\n+ Chemist at Play 2% Pentavitin + 1% Salicylic Acid + 0.5% Zinc PCA - Face Moisturizer For Oily Skin\n\n+ ETUDE HOUSE Soonjung Moist Relief All In One Gel\n\n+ Laneige Water Sleeping Mask (I used to use this, because someone gave it to me from when they went to Korea.

Meaning moisturizing properly twice a day for the first time in my life 😛.\nAnd something went wrong (probably because its raining a lot, so humidity?). I got horrible flare up in both cheeks, jawline, basically everywhere. It was burning and itching. Read up on the symptoms and it looks and feels like FA only.\nI have stopped everything and just using honey and calamine lotion. These two have always calmed down my skin. And going through whatever 2-3 products I had to see if they are FA safe or not.\nNow, back to my noob question. I was planning on trying some ayurvedic oil or any other facial oil, before shit hit the fan. Like Kumkumadi or jwalini etc. But I don't know if they are FA safe or not. Do you have any idea about this? Or if you have tried?",

        "body": "Commenting here again, after a month to say a big THANK YOU!! 😊😊😊\nFinally today, my face is looking how it used to look. Had been one anxious ride but this post has been soooo helpful.\nI am going to share my experience here:\n\n\nFor first 3 weeks, I only used honey mask for 30mins, aloe gel as moisturizer and sealed it with Squalane oil (both in AM and PM). Honey was an organic one and aloe gel was from my own plant. These two calmed down my skin so much. Honey would help with the itching. And on applying aloe, I could see bumps were getting smaller next day. Crazy! Never saw so much difference with natural items :)\nAlso, I did one more weird thing, I am not sure if anyone has tried thie before for FA. I applied teensy bit of boro plus antiseptic cream on the most itchy parts 😶. I did run its ingredients on sezia.co , nothing was flagged as unsafe, so I went ahead. And it did help out! (But I cannot recommend this for everyone, because as much as I searched on net, I couldn't find anyone else's experience with FA and boro plus).\n\nSo in 3 weeks, I didn't get any more itchy bumps for sure. And existing ones also, somewhat smoothed out. But they weren't completely gone. Just 5 days back, I finally bought selsun shampoo. I have used it thrice now, for 3 minutes. Dang it made everything disappear 😂 Also it makes skin very dry, so I bought sebamed clear face care gel also.\n\n\nSo you ask, why was I not buying any treatment for FA? Because I was scared to experiment anything new (even if proven to be effective). I was hoping, I would get my skin to calm down first and then start the treatment. But in hindsight, yes, I could have started some treatment earlier.\nAlthough this little experiment did prove the power of honey+aloe. Mad respect 🙏🙏\n\nJust one last question, is it possible to develop resistance against sulfur also?",

The sunscreen looks so affordable but Folliculitis Scout says Cetearyl Alcohol isn't safe :( I've used it in a not completely safe product in the winters but I'm scared of using it now, does it cause problems for you at all, what's your take on this? Also, thank you for the Aloe recommendation, I use the Revital Gel and I suspect it's a lot of water! Do you have suggestions for some other probiotic that is also free of dairy and available here :( I drank tons of curd most of my life but I have issues with cold and anything with dairy in probiotics breaks me out (I tried the WOW one).

    "body": "This is weird when has there been much discourse on a jam??????\n\n\n\n\n\n[https://archive.ph/2025.04.22-155952/https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2025/04/22/meghan-markle-as-ever-jam-taste-test/](https://archive.ph/2025.04.22-155952/https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2025/04/22/meghan-markle-as-ever-jam-taste-test/)\n\n  \n[One year](https://archive.ph/o/4cQ0c/https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/of-interest/2024/04/25/meghan-markle-jam-buckingham-palace/) of anticipation, one[ Netflix show](https://archive.ph/o/4cQ0c/https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2025/03/04/meghan-markle-netflix-with-love-meghan/) and a [brand name change](https://archive.ph/o/4cQ0c/https://people.com/meghan-markle-changes-name-lifestyle-brand-american-riviera-orchard-as-ever-8737049) later, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex finally released her new line of [As Ever provisions](https://archive.ph/o/4cQ0c/https://asever.com/collections/shop) on April 2. It [sold out](https://archive.ph/o/4cQ0c/https://www.instagram.com/p/DH8rXhzpddq/?img_index=1) in less than an hour.\n\nAmid the selection of honey, edible flower “sprinkles,” herbal teas and crepe mixes, this writer managed to snag a jar of pricey [raspberry fruit spread](https://archive.ph/o/4cQ0c/https://asever.com/collections/shop/products/raspberry-spread-in-keepsake-packaging). The [Montecito-chic](https://archive.ph/o/4cQ0c/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2021/05/03/meghan-harry-betterup-archewell-podcast-netflix/) packaging — mailed from a nondescript building in Cincinnati — is lovely, down to the gold-embossed “keepsake” box and label written in Meghan’s famously good calligraphy. The whole effect was as if [Stonewall Kitchen](https://archive.ph/o/4cQ0c/https://www.stonewallkitchen.com/our-family-of-brands/stonewall-kitchen/spreads-preserves/) decided to trade L.L. Bean plaids and Maine rustication for toasting the California good life in an off-white raw silk sundress.\n\nBut how does it taste?\n\nRaspberries can make excellent fruit preserves, with a deep reddish-pink hue and sweetness balanced by mild tartness. Not all raspberry jam is created equal, however.“\n\nA good fruit preserve has a depth of flavor that showcases that particular fruit,” says [Rochelle Cooper](https://archive.ph/o/4cQ0c/https://www.instagram.com/shakinbaker219/), pastry chef at the Duck & the Peach and La Collina in D.C. “The texture should be gelled enough to have some body, but not so far that you can cut it or it holds its shape.”The tasting panel, from left: Tiffany MacIsaac, Jill Nguyen and Rochelle Cooper. (Lisa Ruland)To see whether Meghan’s As Ever fruit spread is indeed the very (berry?) best, we set up a blind taste test with three of D.C.’s top bakers and pastry chefs: Cooper; [Tiffany MacIsaac](https://archive.ph/o/4cQ0c/https://www.instagram.com/tiffmacisaac/), former Buttercream Bakeshop owner and James Beard semifinalist; and Jill Nguyen, the baker behind Capitol Hill microbakery and cake workshop [Capitol Jill Baking](https://archive.ph/o/4cQ0c/https://www.capitoljillbaking.com/).\n\nThe blind taste test consisted of an eight-sample array of raspberry preserves on a plate, identified only by number. The As Ever raspberry spread was served with seven other commonly available brands from stores including Giant, Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s. (We included both Trader Joe’s standard raspberry preserves and reduced-sugar spread to compare alongside the store brands and other popular options found at the supermarkets.)\n\nEach brand was judged on factors including color, texture, flavor and overall appeal. Tasters scored each sample on a 1 to 10 scale, with a highest possible total score of 30. The judges sampled the raspberry preserves on warm milk bread and biscuits supplied by Nguyen.\n\nThe brands tested all listed similar ingredients: raspberries, sweetener (usually sugar, but not always), an acid and pectin. Pectin thickens the preserves, while acid, such as citric acid or lemon juice, balances the sweetness and reacts with the pectin. Lemon juice adds tartness, flavor and fragrance to a preserve; citric acid gives more of a one-note pucker.\n\nMeghan, Duchess of Sussex, arrives at the Paley Center for Media gala in Los Angeles in 2024. (Etienne Laurent/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAs Meghan points out in her show, “With Love, Meghan,” fruit spread, jam, jelly, compotes and preserves are technically different products, each subject to categorization based on [factors](https://archive.ph/o/4cQ0c/https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-150/subpart-B/section-150.160) such as ingredients and sugar to fruit ratio. For the purposes of this taste test, we’re using the terms interchangeably.\n\nThe results held surprises. \n\nOne popular, upmarket French brand landed near the bottom, while the judges ranked two inexpensive store-label options among the best. And as for As Ever? We cover the spread below.An assortment of store-bought raspberry jams were tested alongside the As Ever brand. (Lisa Ruland)\n\n# 8. Giant Raspberry Preserves\n\nScore: 8\n\nThis nearly solid, bloodred goo seemed to contain more seeds than jam and earned a collective thumbs down. “This looks like blood sausage,” Nguyen said, sampling a globule. “You can almost cut it,” Cooper said. The texture was a universal turnoff, and the judges also disliked the overly sweet flavor.\n\n*Ingredients: raspberries, high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, citric acid, fruit pectin* *(Price: $3.99/12 ounces at Giant)*More taste tests\n\n# 7. Trader Joe’s Organic Reduced Sugar Raspberry Preserves\n\nScore: 9\n\nBland, meh and surprisingly “too sweet,” the judges said of this organic, reduced-sugar option. The ultra-thick jam “feels like a Jell-O shot,” one taster said. The group also disliked the lack of raspberry flavor, saying it tasted of “generic fruit.”\n\n*Ingredients: organic raspberries, organic sugar, water, pectin, citric acid* *($4.49/15.2 ounces at Trader Joe’s)*\n\n# 6. Bonne Maman Raspberry Preserves                                                                    Score: 13\n\n“Mais non” was the consensus of the judges on this well-loved French brand. While Bonne Maman did have discernible raspberry flavor and good color, it was hard for the tasters to get past the overwhelming sweetness. “All sugar,” noted Cooper. “This is sweeeeeet!” said Nguyen.\n\nIngredients: raspberries, sugar, brown cane sugar, concentrated lemon juice, fruit pectin ($6.79/13 ounces at Whole Foods)\n\n# 5. Smucker’s Red Raspberry Preserves\n\nScore: 14\n\nWith a gelatinous texture and tons of seeds, this ubiquitous American brand landed in the lower-middle. MacIsaac correctly guessed the brand just by its appearance. “It looks like a Smucker’s or a less-expensive brand.” “When corn syrup is listed twice, you know it’s no good,” Nguyen said after seeing the ingredient list post-taste test. Because of the thickness, Cooper suggested using it in [thumbprint cookies](https://archive.ph/o/4cQ0c/https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/whole-wheat-jam-thumbprints/).\n\n*Ingredients: red raspberries, high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, fruit pectin, citric acid* *($5.39/18 ounces at Giant)*The raspberry jams were numbered and tasted blind by the panel. (Lisa Ruland)\n\n# 4. St. Dalfour Red Raspberry Fruit Spread\n\nScore: 18.1\n\nSt. Dalfour’s fruit spread was the jam equivalent of [mid TV](https://archive.ph/o/4cQ0c/https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/27/arts/television/mid-tv.html), an unmemorable snooze you’ll kind of enjoy in the moment but immediately forget once it’s done. This jam was not good, not bad, just fine. “The color is a little dull,” Cooper said of this three-ingredient spread. The judges did like the softer texture and less aggressive seeds.\n\n*Ingredients: red raspberries, fruit juice concentrates (grape and date), fruit pectin* *($5.79/10 ounces at Whole Foods)*\n\n# 3. Nature’s Promise Organic Red Raspberry Fruit Spread\n\nScore: 23\n\nNature’s Promise kept the promise of its label: “a great tasting product.” Though some of the taste testers deemed it thick and less punchy than others, this organic fruit spread scored well overall for its bright natural color and pure raspberry flavor. The judges called the taste “clean,” and thought it would make a good choice as a cake filling or topping.\n\n*Ingredients: organic raspberries, organic cane sugar, pectin solution (water, apple pectin), ascorbic acid (vitamin C), citric acid* *($4.39/15.5 ounces at Giant)*\n\n# 2. Trader Joe’s Fresh Raspberry Preserves\n\nScore: 27.5\n\nProving that Joe’s accomplishments extend beyond cult-status prepared foods and [mini totes](https://archive.ph/o/4cQ0c/https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2024/03/11/trader-joes-tote-bags-mini-trend/), this jar of jam was loved by all three judges. Unlike TJ’s reduced-sugar version, it scored high across the board, with scores of 9, 9 and 9.5 out of 10. “I’m really loving this,” Cooper said. Nguyen added, “This is so good.” In addition to having the “perfect thickness” and “most pleasing texture,” the judges liked its less-aggressive seeds and the versatility of this “fresh tasting” preserve, riffing on how well it would work in cookies, between cake layers and as a spread for bread or biscuits.\n\n*Ingredients: raspberries, liquid sugar (sugar, water), sugar, lemon juice concentrate, fruit pectin* *($4.49/17.5 ounces at Trader Joe’s)*\n\n# 1. As Ever Raspberry Fruit Spread\n\n(Lisa Ruland)Score: 27.7\n\nAs befitting [royalty](https://archive.ph/o/4cQ0c/https://www.royal.uk/sussex), Meghan’s fruit spread was crowned the winner of our blind tasting. But barely.\n\nThe judges loved the balance of sweet and tart, and each detected fragrant floral notes in the raspberry flavor. Two of the ingredients listed were organic, but not the raspberries or pectin. The testers noted the softer pink hue and loose texture, which tiptoes to the edge of watery without quite diving in. But the judges did not find the comparative thinness problematic.\n\n“I was totally ready to hate on this,” MacIsaac said. “But I don’t. That’s a testament to how good it is.” “This tastes like the freshest fruit option,” she said. “If someone told me they made it, I’d believe them.” As it stands, information about the actual cooks in the As Ever kitchen is as opaque as the dull-hued St. Dalfour fruit spread.\n\nThis spread’s victory may help justify the whopping $1.18 per ounce cost — before shipping, which cost an additional $7 for two jars of preserves, plus taxes. Because the As Ever raspberry spread sans special packaging ($9 each) was sold out, my total cost for two $14, 7.6-ounce jars (in “keepsake” packaging), plus tax and shipping, came to $37.10 (Comparatively, second-place Trader Joe’s costs only 26 cents per ounce.)\n\n*Ingredients: raspberries, organic cane sugar, organic lemon juice concentrate, fruit pectin* *($9/7.6 ounces, plus shipping, available online)Lisa Ruland is a Washington-based food writer and editor of the food and cooking website* [*Unpeeled Journal*](https://archive.ph/o/4cQ0c/https://unpeeledjournal.com/)*.*",
