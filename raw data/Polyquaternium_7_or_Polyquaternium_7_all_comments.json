    "body": "I don't even know what this thing is called but obviously it has escaped my attention while cleaning for some time. I saw some Irish Spring and impulsively bought it and used that and it worked great. I just applied some with a cleaning brush and then after my shower (10-15 minutes) I used that brush to brush it off. \n\nBeing impulsive I was like \"hey this says it's shampoo AND conditioner I wonder what would happen if I used it on my hair.\" If you have long hair DO NOT USE THIS LOL, I think it's only a conditioner if you have extremely short hair.\n\nAlso my hair smelled SO MUCH like Irish Spring and felt like I'd washed it with dish soap or something. The roots especially were flat and rough. Never again. \n\nI actually think the thing that makes it unusually good for cleaning might be why I hated it so much on my hair. It has Polyquaternium-7 and Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride which seems to be the \"conditioners\", and both are fairly \"sticky\"/substantive ingredient meaning it does a good job staying on things even if you try to wash it off. Probably helps it stick around while cleaning a bit longer than regular cleaners, but I did not appreciate it sticking to my hair and making me smell like a 20-something year old dude all day. \n\n",

        "body": "Some of the classic bar soaps such as Irish Spring and Dove are really good detergents (soap, but more specifically a compound that can bind to both water soluble and lipid soluble agents), Dawn soap as well. The reason why it sucks on your hair is because hair isn’t something you just want clean and stripped of oil, you want it clean but with a bit of something left behind so that hair can be sleek, shiny, and slip around without friction. Some shampoos do remove all the oils and products (typically clarifying shampoos) but following with conditioner will put back oils or silicones (depending on the formulation) so hair looks shiny, is slick, detangles and is frizz free. Additionally, some formulations use even gentler shampoos that have oils and silicones (usually curly hair formulations). Most have a gentle formula with a little bit of silicones to prevent breakage from friction. Hope that helps!",

So here I have a guide to moisturising/non drying body washes with experience test to see whether it’ll work for you or not.\r\n\r\nSo how do you find one? Its simple as you only have to find some ingredients i.e. Polyquaterniums(also referred as polyquats or PQ) OR  Guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride(GHPC, let it stay on skin for a minute or two). \r\n\r\nThese are film forming agents that will form a protective layer on your skin. They have been around for a long time, intensively researched and can be used on your whole body including skin(including face) and hair. Since the silicone scare happened, their usage have increased exponentially. You’ll find them in your hair masks, shampoo, conditioners and even some face washes.\r\n\r\nSo you need to find one specific polyquat in your body wash i.e polyquaternium-7 (also written as polyquat-7 or PQ-7). This is the gold standard polyquat to help moisturize and soften the skin in body washes. Polyquat-10 will also do but PQ7 is the gold standard.\r\n\r\nSo now I’ll come to the test. This test is based on YOUR experience. So ik due to current pandemic situation you don’t wanna spend on unnecessary things. So I’ve mentioned the list of all body wash I could find with PQ7 and I’m sure that you would have used atleast one from them and if you felt that below mentioned products worked for you in the past and you left them thinking them to be too commercial or it moisturised or at the very least it was non drying to your skin, then Polyquats and GHPC are your gold ingredients to find in a bodywash. I will also mention some common tips that helped me after the products list.\r\n \r\nI went through whole body wash section on nykaa for this list. \r\n\r\nProducts list(including cheapest and expensive):\r\n\r\n1.\tPalmolive (absolute relax, morning tonic, luminous oils, sensual)\r\n\r\n2.\tNivea (Fresh pure, protect n care, energy, cool kick) \r\n\r\n3.\tCamay Paris (lavande, romantique, crème n strawberry, hypnotique, dynamique)\r\n\r\n4.\tBody Cupid (24k gold, beautiful rose)\r\n\r\n5.\tKaya (colloidal oat, tea tree n honey)\r\n\r\n6.\tBoro Plus (neem lavender, almond turmeric)\r\n\r\n7.\tSwiss Tempelle (tulsi&iris)\r\n\r\n8.\tWow (ubtan, rose otto, acv, peach & strawberry, pineapple n coconut, lemon n pine, pine n rose, melon n cucumber, green apple, valencia orange, cherry blossom, lavender n chamomile, tea tree n mint, wild aqua)\r\n\r\n9.\tAll nykaa wanderlust series(PQ7 + silicon oil)\r\n\r\n10.\tSolimo by Amazon (fresh lavender, sweet apricot, lemon n tea tree, cool menthol, antibacterial with SA)\r\n\r\n11.\tMamaearth (all PQ22 based)\r\n\r\n12.\tDettol all variants (PQ10 + BHA)\r\n\r\n13.\tPlum BodyLovin shower CREAMS (All are PQ7 based)\r\n\r\n14.\tSt. Botanica (peach n avocado, strawberry n vit e, argan oil)\r\n\r\n15.\tLove Beauty & Planet all range (cetrimonium chloride & GHPC based)\r\n\r\n16.\tSt. D’vence (ocean drop, pink salt, hemp n aloe, lime n basil, Alphonso mango)\r\n\r\n17.\tMan Arden (Pacific prince, tahitis exotic, lemon n mint, energising, bergamot n cedarwood, arabian oudh)\r\n\r\n18.\tSedure whole range (PQ is unconfirmed)\r\n\r\n19.\tOlay whole range (GHPC based. Needs to stay on skin for some time)\r\n\r\n20.\tSuperdrug (coconut n white peach, fruity coconut)\r\n\r\n21.\tAveeno daily moisture (PQ10 + GHPC), skin relief(GHPC Based)\r\n\r\n22.\tThink skin by big bazaar (neem, total moisture)\r\n\r\n23.\tLocal companies in your city.(usually found in supermarkets like dmart, big bazaar)\r\n\r\n24. Cetaphil restoraderm(GHPC)\r\n\r\n25. NMFe body wash(GHPC derivative)\r\n\r\n26. The skin cottage, whole range (PQ7 based. Some have different PQ)\r\n\r\n27. Moisturex body wash (PQ67 based)\r\n\r\n28. Sirona therapeutic body wash (GHPC)\r\n\n29. Dermadew body wash(PQ10) \r\n\n30. Parasoft moisturizing shower gel(GHPC+SQ8)\r\n\r\nTips: While rinsing out, try not to rub your skin. Use the softest towel you have. If possible only pat dry and avoid rubbing towel rigorously.\r\n\r\nConsidering the nature of polyquats, these products mostly will work the same for you. So that means you have so much fragrance options to choose from.😇 The list may or may not have fragrance free options. I haven't checked for fragrance. \r\n\r\nIf you are new to trying these ingredients, I personally recommend Nivea Fresh Pure for first timers. It has the softest foam ever. Very mild, fresh aquatic fragrance and has been on market for years. \r\n\r\nThere can be an instance where these products are not moisturising enough for you but they’ll be atleast non drying.\r\n\r\nAlways prefer to shop offline as most of nivea and some other brands are always on BOGO(like in dmart and big bazaar). Also be on the lookout for local companies in supermarkets bcz they will be even cheaper. (find PQ7)\r\n\r\nIF YOU HAVE A PRODUCT WITH ABOVE MENTIONED INGREDIENTS (PQ7, PQ10 OR GHPC) AND NOT IN THE LIST ABOVE THEN MENTION THEM BELOW SO THAT EVERYONE CAN HAVE MORE OPTIONS. 😇",

    "body": "(Fair warning; this is a pretty icky subject. Not for those who get icked-out easily.)\n\n(TL;DR: Age 31, healthy, acne and scarring over extremities, unlikely hormonal, tried seemingly everything, \n\nSo here's the thing; at age 16 I got acne. Pretty normal, usual places, etc... the problem I have is that I'm 31 now, and I still have it. I'm pretty depressed about it as you can imagine, it looks ugly, and has scarred my skin over the years. It's not REALLY bad, but I'm very self conscious of it.\n\nWell, here's a photo of the top of my arm to give you an idea: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2669703/IMG_3421.JPG\n\nThey range from teeny-tiny little soft pimples, to odd 'skin pearls' which pop right out, deep wells of white solids, and right up to deep infections of pus and blood, and large red areas (up to 4\" diameter) red warm patches of tissue infection.\n\nI've also built up a fairly deep-seated case of dermatilomania, which is skin picking. You can imagine that 15 years of spot-squeezing kinda becomes an ingrained habit. While it's not too bad, I tend to do it when stressed or thoughtful. If I think about not picking, it do it more without realising. I pick less when ignoring the issue.\n\nSo I'd honestly guess at the spots and skin picking to be 50/50 parts of my problem. I know picking them makes them worse but in experiments, I still get spots when not picking them. If I could only get rid of the spots, then I wouldn't have anything to pick. I'm quite health conscious, I eat a balanced diet, take multivitims and work out at the gym when not rock-climbing.\n\nI'll try and keep it brief; I've seen countless doctors about it, who tend to put me on some kind of anti-biotics. Not helpful, -kinda- helps them, doesn't treat the root cause. I've seen a dermatologist too, but they basically said they didn't know and that I should wash more.\n\nI have tried keeping myself meticulously clean, but that tends to strip my skin and make them bad. I have tried going au natural, and they tend to give me average trouble. I have tried drying my skin out, and again, average trouble. Moisturising makes them a little worse. I have tried coutless traditional acne treatments without much effect.\n\nI've tried washing with soap, but the scum gets in my pores and makes it worse. I have tried washing with shower gel, but that seems to make them bad too (though I'm currently experimenting with avoiding gels with Polyquaternium-7 in them)\n\nThey seem to be worse at my extremities; outsides of arms and thighs, across the top of my back and neck. None really on my chest or tum, nor calves, shins, feet or hands. I figured this may be where my clothes are contacting, but am pretty sure it just more where I can reach to pick. I tried washing my clothes without washing powder (and various types) but no real improvement. \n\nNow... I spent a week in Malta, showering every day with my normal showergel. I know that sun-burning a little improves my skin (but the improvement seems to wear off with continued sun exposure and they flare up again) I went in the sea quite often too. At the end of that week, my acne had damn-near cleared up! No redness, no spots. I was thrilled! \n\nSo, getting sun in the UK is impossible without expensive sun-beds. I tried taking vitimin D in place of real sun, no effect. I tried using sea minerals in the bath, no effect.\n\nMy job is relativly stress-free, and don't have any other worries. I'm so chilled I'm practically horizontal. ¦)\n\nI am completely at a loss as to what to do, and I'm tiring of this battle. Absolutely ANY advice would be welcomed. I'm actually going to make a list of suggestion if I haven't tried them already and work through them.\n\nAgain, this is ADULT acne. Teenage acne is all about the hormones, which would have stabilised in my case at age 31.\n\nAre you a sufferer too? Did you fix your adult acne problem? Do you have any insight on what the problem is?\n\nThanks for listening Reddit. <3\n\n[EDIT: I'm not going to go down the Accutane route. I've done the research, and I am not willing to risk the side-effects.]\n\n[EDITEDIT: Also, I'm a guy. :D]",

At times I went several days to a week without picking at all (my skin improved immensely those first few days) but when I was feeling particularly stressed or depressed I would have a meltdown. I could spend 30 minutes to an hour picking at my skin nonstop at my worst. I knew it was awful while I was doing it but I simply couldn't get myself to stop. I have no rational explanation for it other than I simply lost control.\n\nWithin the past year or two I have more or less gotten it under control. I did essentially what you are attempting to do: \"If I could only get rid of the spots, then I wouldn't have anything to pick\". I was able to get it under control enough so that I didn't have anything to pick at.\n\nThe first part is the hardest. Be mindful of food that can help control inflammation. The antioxidants in green tea are very helpful. I try to drink 2-3 cups a day and apply the teabag directly to the skin on my worst spots (this gets the inflammation under control as well as anything I've found). I also each a small bowl of baby carrots once a day and try to eat pumpkin seeds (zinc) and walnuts (omega 3 fatty acid) as often as I can.\n\nAs my diet was supplying my body with the nutrients to help fight the acne from the inside, I was also using topical products to continue to fight it from the outside. I started using [Amlactin](http://www.amazon.com/AmLactin-Moisturizing-Body-Lotion-14-1-Ounces/dp/B0002KI3XO/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1333653096&sr=8-3) to try to help unclog my pores. I now believe that my main problem was [keratosis pilaris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratosis_pilaris) that was only becoming inflamed acne after I picked at it. This lotion goes deep down to gradually unclog the pore (be patient, it takes some time). However, Amlactin doesn't do a particularly good job of taming active acne so it may be best to use it in tandem with another product ([these work fairly well for me and they really easy to use](http://www.amazon.com/Oxy-Maximum-Daily-Cleansing-Pads/dp/B001G7PJAC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1333653389&sr=8-1)). Amlactin is sticky (I only use it at night for this reason) and makes more skin more sensitive to sunlight so be sure to wear a sunscreen if you go this route.\n\nAlso, I've recently begun using a [derma roller](http://www.amazon.com/Microneedle-System-NEW-SPA-1-50mm/dp/B002F4Z18A/ref=sr_1_3?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1333653501&sr=1-3) to help with the old scars. But I wouldn't suggest that until you have your acne more under control. \n\nLastly, something that is very important to me is to keep my skin feeling comfortable. If it's earlier dry or too greasy I'm prone to start picking. Cocoa butter lotion is my preference. I know some don't like cocoa butter because it is comedogenic but it is very soothing. I had problems with cocoa butter creams clogging my skin, but not the lotions. I usually use [Vaseline Cocoa Butter Lotion](http://www.amazon.com/Vaseline-Butter-Conditioning-Lotion-Vitamin/dp/B003XKPIKQ/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1333653826&sr=8-8) (soothing and moisturizing) or [Queen Helene Cocoa Butter Lotion](http://www.amazon.com/Queen-Helene-Lotion-Cocoa-Butter/dp/B000EGOG46/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1333653893&sr=1-1) (more soothing and absorbs better, but not very moisturizing).\n\nI hope that helps. Again send me a message if you have any questions.",

        "body": "Hi op. I hope you read this (it's not going to be short).\n\nWell, I had a similar problem. While it's not as bad for me it is somewhat similar and we're almost the same age and we are the same sex. We're also both from the UK, so I can help you out with any products you might be interested in. If you read this and fancy some more information, feel free to send me a message.\n\nI was lucky enough to get to work at home for a while. Long story short, after spending time on acne.org, I came across a lot of interesting ideas for acne treatment.\n\nFirstly, we don't even know exactly what it is you have. It seems to me from my time there (acne.org) that there may be all kinds of different things that cause spots, however we can label it acne if you like.\n\nSecondly (I'm not sure why I'm treating this like an ordered list, but I am), I started a spot journal. I took a picture of my face once per day and saved it on my computer with the date as the file name. This is great for assessing your efforts over time. Be sure, however, to take the pictures in the same light levels each day. A bit of shadow can hide some spots very well and you can convince yourself things are better (or worse). In addition to this, I kept a spread sheet in which I kept track of a) everything I ate and b) what I was taking / what I was doing (to fight the spots).\n\nLet me expand on that last part a little. While I read so many different things about different face products, I tried to stick to the notion that this problem cannot be treated with something that is applied externally unless the spots are caused by some infection of the skin or something like that. As a result, I almost only tried internal suggestions. I must admit, I was weak and did try some external things (when you're desperate you're desperate), but none worked. And we're talking all the treatments you're undoubtedly going to hear about like benzoyl peroxide (I used to order a wash from the USA - dried my skin and flaked it like shit - oh, and did nothing really beneficial), facial scrubs, creams (like 'green cream'), rubbing vitamin E on your spots, ibuprofen gel (apparently reduces redness, but just dried out my skin). In fact just about all external products dried out my skin or brought about more spots. Even simple tea tree can bring me out if I use it too much (although I'm talking a tea tree cream here - often neat can be too much for your skin anyway). Still, if you go about your time on websites like acne.org, you will see all this (and, if you feel like trying it and spending your money, knock yourself out. Plenty of people claim it works for them). Also you will come across light treatments which some claim to work (you can buy machines for this, by the way, if this is what you want). In the end, my current methodology regarding face washing is to wash my face with water alone. This also saves me a fortune, by the way. Also, Freederm facial wash is a nightmare. Dries out my face painfully so, yet in my desperation I have gone for it. Oh, also add aloe vera to that list (I have a gel with that).\n\nSo, we came down to internal things. By the way, I did desperately want to find a scientific solution. After all, it's a problem and it must have a solution. Unfortunately, while some people seem to be working on it, it doesn't seem to be a very high priority. So, aside the external things, I tried a whole load of internal treatments. Cider vinegar, coconut oil, green smoothies, vitamins of various types (one I used to have as a powder which I dissolved in water - tasted like shit), kelp, zinc (you'll hear a lot about zinc), cartinine (you'll hear a lot about that one, too). Hell, Holland and Barratt must have had hundreds off me. Oh, and that pau d'arco tea. Oh, and pro biotics and garlic and... well, if I thought it would help, I'd try just about anything. \n\nSo then we move on. As well as doing all these things, I needed to set up a vaguely scientific way of assessing the results, since I also was of the belief that foods were the cause ('we' people have our own section on the acne.org boards). Now would be a good time to mention the one guy who gave up oranges and cut his acne down by 90% with that action. So my diet was, for weeks, porridge with oat milk and honey for breakfast (dairy is considered a common cause for acne), steamed veg and fish for lunch and something similar for the evening meal. I tried to stay off all sweets and sugars, although I did have fruit for snacks. It could have been any of these things too, but I prayed that it wasn't.\n\nThe months went by (I did this diet for about three or four months - lost a lot of weight actually and looked pretty good). I stopped some things (the cinder vinegar didn't seem to do shit) and started others. If I'm honest, I probably only did some of the things for a few months. If I had to talk about the best of those, I would say... the green smoothies (this was a smoothie of spinach, kale, brocolli, orange juice, apple and half a banana with other fruit if I had it around), the coconut oil (comes as solid - I went for the Nutiva organic extra virgin variety - ordered online) and maybe the pau d'arco tea. I wouldn't say they cleared me up really, but they kept me regular as hell, which I saw as a good thing (you may shit green for the first few tries though). This all took dedication, by the way, since I have a huge sweet tooth. What kept me strong was that I looked like shit when my spots were bad, and damned if that didn't motivate me.\n\nDuring all this time, I also tried to look back to pictures I had of myself. I hadn't had acne the entire time, although it seemed worse now. Of course, an explanation for that could have been that I only allowed pictures to be took when my spots weren't so bad. I also had a period after a one day 30 mile walk where I was almost spot free for about a week - much like your experience on holiday. Since I was a bit naughty with the food I ate that way (oh man, was I sick of turkey and brown rice - another one of the lovely things I was 'allowed' to eat), I figured it was one of two things. Number on was the sun (as you have concluded) and number two was the exercise. Since I had a bit of a tan after just that one day, I figured it was the sun, and tried to go for a walk every day (remember I worked at home), to catch whatever of the sun I could (it was about February, so yeah...). It wasn't great, but actually there was some results. Was it the sun? Or, again, was it the exercise? If it was the sun, I was going to be shit out of luck during the winter months.\n\nIn the end, something secured my idea for good. As part of my routine, I was going for a lot of jogs at that time arond my local area. On day, I had a couple of those nasty green spots you get after I pigged out on a big Chinese dinner (my folks would treat me to once every once in a while, and boy were they sweet after such a bland diet). Anyway, so I take a picture of myself that morning. Then I go on this crushing run. It was a warm day and I sweated my balls off. I mean I pushed myself lots. When I came back, only two hours later, I took another picture. The spots were noticeably smaller. So what was this? Some kind of miracle? I repeated the same thing a few weeks later, but I didn't work myself as hard and the results were different (not really a noticeable drop). So was it the physical exercise or the sweat? Well, I had planned to get myself down to a sauna, but the only ones around here require a gym membership (so possibly expensive).\n\nAnyway, after this revelation, I spent a little more time experimenting, and I seem to be better now. That is to say, compared to the worst days before, I am a lot times better, even if I'm not free from it. I guess it's a 75% improvement or there abouts. It's enough for me to have my old lifestyle back.\n\nSo, you ask me, how can I have my old lifestyle back and not get the spots as bad? Doesn't sound very scientific. Well, let me add a few caveats to that. The system I developed is sort of a number system I suppose. While I don't have exact numbers, it basically works like this: you've got one number. When you eat stuff, that number goes up, and when you exercise, that number goes down. Certain things you eat will make that number go up more than other things (yorkshire pudding is a high one for me, but chips are a low one). Conversely, the harder the work out, the faster that number comes down. Yes, there do seem to be other minor factors to this, but those are the main ones. Also, and I hope this was obvious but I'm going to state it anyway, if that number remains high, you have a greater chance of getting spots). Since I'm lazy and don't work out that much very often, it's settled down to this: go for a walk (of about an hour) every day or two and try to avoid those foods which seem to bring you out the most (I mentioned yorkshire puddings, but ice cream is on my list, as are those Aero mousses, some Foxes cookies, and a number of other things - mostly high fat or high sugar things - the good stuff basically). Dairy and stuff like that seem to be common causes.\n\nI guess that about covers it. Oh, I also had the York Test (a food intolerance test). Didn't really tell me much, although I also get bad headaches from certain foods, so that's a no so fun related aspect.\n\nLike I said, I'm not completely cured. I could get less spots if I wanted, but I am a slave to my sweet tooth (even within this category, some sweets aren't so bad as others - like jellies). I'd say what I have is a decent conclusion, although I will get occasional puss spots if I neglect myself.\n\nI was passionate about getting this done, and can go into more detail about any of this if you'd like. Just message me. Hope this helped.",

When it began *nothing* helped, washing my skin twice a day, changing sheets, trying products, *nothing*. I was superfrustated and kind of gave up. A couple of weeks later I started taking dance-lessons 5 times a week. 2 months into starting working out I haven't had a single new pimple. \n\n\n**TL;DR: You already look like a fit guy, but it's possible working out heavily will help you as it did for me.** (I'm female though and I don't know if working out will affect our hormones differently?)",

Virgin hair, never been chemically treated, I don't do any heat styling, no blow-drying. Only Air-drying\n\n[Pic 1, Im turning away from camera](https://imgur.com/a/3YQDuew.jpg). Hair is so hard so photograph properly, If I get more accurate pictures, I'll edit to add.\n\nSo life's pretty bad right now, so I'm not able to do the elaborate hair care routine I used to. Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only.

Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles.

I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: Oh my god, you guys. Best find of this year. This gives super shiny, sleek looking hair. I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember. I used up the entire bottle. I think 9ish months?? or more.\n\nConsistency: Normal shampoo consistency, HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above. Forever Repurchase. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Oriental Botanics Red Onion Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients: This has an ingredients list a mile long. Will update soon.\n\nPrice: MRP 449 for 300 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years and I'm only done with half the bottle\n\nConsistency: Normal Shampoo\n\nUsage: I take a lot and apply it from shoulders to ends, if I've not oiled my hair.\n\nReview: I literally had to go and check what the name of this product was to type this review and I've been using it for 2+ years. I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

    "body": "This is a pretty long review that I have been adding to and compiling for a long time, so please bear with me. Hair and climate details are:\n\n**Hair and scalp type:**\n\n3A/2C curls, very dry and course strands, low-porosity, silicone and protein sensitive, oily scalp. I am not sensitive to fragrance, and find the fragrance of these products very mild. However that might be different for other people.\n\n**Climatic conditions:**\n\nHot and Humid.\n\n**Age range:**\n\nTwenties.\n\n**Usage timeline:**\n\nThe Moisture Duo have been my favourite styling products for about two years now.\n\nThe Protein Duo was bought approximately a year ago and has been used intermittently for 6-8 months since then.\n\nThe Wash-Day products were also bought at around the same time, and I have regularly used the Cleansing Shampoo and the Conditioner every wash-day since.\n\n# ✨Wash-Day Bundle✨\n\n# 🔹Cleansing Shampoo\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua),Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Panthenol, Polyquaternium -7, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-73, Fragrance, Apple Cider Vinegar, Disodium EDTA, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Oil, Polyquaternium -10, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick gel that lathers into a thick foam.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit while massaging into hair, completely washes off on rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nIt is sulphate-free so it is only mildly cleansing. If you are not prone to a lot of build-up and don’t have dandruff, this is good enough. Does not strip off moisture from the hair strands and doesn’t dry out the scalp either. I use this as my regular shampoo and use a sulphate shampoo every once in a while to clarify any build-up since this shampoo isn’t enough for me.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nEven though this is a cleansing shampoo, the website clearly states that this is not a Clarifying Shampoo. They actively encourage using a sulphate shampoo if you are prone to build-up, which I thought was a refreshing change from the usual marketing of sulphate-free shampoos.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n## 🔹Everyday Moisturising Shampoo\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua) Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium -7, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Panthenol, Phospholipids (and) Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/Palmitate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-73, Cetrimonium Chloride, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Fragrance Polyquaternium -10, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Citrus Aurantium (Neroli) Oil\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Mild to no lather.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit while massaging into hair, completely washes off on rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nI did not like this shampoo at all. It didn’t clean my scalp well at all and the strands felt weirdly brittle after washing. It isn’t hydrating enough to use without following up with a conditioner. However, if I am going to be using a conditioner anyway, the additional step is pointless for me. It might work for someone who needs extremely mild cleansing, but it is not for me. I stopped using after 2-3 washes at most, and switched full-time to the cleansing shampoo alone. Though the fact that this shampoo has proteins might be contributing to my dislike of it.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n1/5. Will Not Repurchase.\n\n## 🔹Hydrating Deep Conditioner\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Quaternium-87, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Phospholipids, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Polyquaternium -7, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/​Palmitate, Polyquaternium-73, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Avena Sativa (Oats) Extract, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Tamanu Oil, Honey Extract, Goji Berries Oil, Taraktogenos Kurzii Seed Oil, Jojoba Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Oil, Disodium EDTA, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, Potassium Lauroyl Wheat Amino Acids, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Leptospermum Scoparium Branch/​Leaf Oil, Capryloyl Glycine, Cysteine\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Low to medium slip.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit even after rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis conditioner is protein-moisture balanced, and this is the max protein my hair will tolerate. It doesn’t have a lot of slip, so if you are someone who detangles with conditioner, this one might be difficult to detangle with. My hair is always dry, and it felt softer immediately on the first use with this. It does tend to make hair a little greasy afterwards. But after adding styling products, it works out for me so I don’t really mind the greasiness. I have also used it as a deep conditioner and kept it in my hair for 30 minutes and then washed off. It didn’t make much of a difference in comparison with leaving it in for 5 minutes like I usually do, so I didn’t bother to do that again.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nFMC says the conditioner can also be used as a leave-in conditioner, though I have never tried this myself, and do not plan to try either.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Protein Duo✨\n\n## 🔹Leave-in Cream\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Dicetyl Phosphate & Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Panthenol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-87, Polyquaternium -7, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/Palmitate, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acids, Sodium PCA, Hydrolysed Milk Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Cetrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Polyquaternium-68, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Ceramide, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Fragrance, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Tocopheryl Acetate, Potassium Lauroyl Wheat Amino Acids, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Leptospermum Scoparium Branch/Leaf Oil, Disodium EDTA, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, Taraktogenos Kurzii Seed Oil, Capryloyl Glycine\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Thins out a little on emulsifying.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHeavy fragrance that lasts for the whole day. This is the only FMC product whose fragrance is too much for me.\n\n**Review:**\n\nI purchased the Protein Duo when I was still experimenting and figuring out the needs of my hair. I very quickly realised that my hair is protein-sensitive and this cream does not work for me. Thankfully I had only bought the 50g travel pack. It is very protein-heavy, not very hydrating. If your hair is already healthy, this may work well. However for very dry hair, this will not provide enough moisture.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nI know now that the cream doesn’t work for me in regular usage. However I do keep the 50g tube around for the rare moisture-overload days to give my hair a little boost of protein. I only need a tiny amount for that purpose, so the tube is going to last me a very long time.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n1/5. Will Not Repurchase. Didn’t work for me, might work for someone else.\n\n## 🔹Defining Hair Gel\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Polyacrylate-2 Crosspolymer, Phospholipids (and) Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Polyquaternium -7, Polyquaternium-73, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Panthenol, Fragrance, Disodium EDTA\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nVery sticky, thick gel.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays for a few minutes, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis is a very strong-hold gel. It is a part of the Protein Duo, but it isn’t as protein-heavy as the leave-in cream. Even with my protein-sensitive hair, I was able to use it occasionally on days when I wanted some serious definition. If I used it 2-3 times consecutively, it caused protein-overload. Overall, a nice gel that gives pretty good definition and hold. I haven’t bought it again, though I might do so once my current hoard of gels is finished.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n3/5. May repurchase sometime.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Moisture Duo✨\n\n## 🔹Curl-Quenching Hair Butter\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract, Salvia Hispanica(Chia) Seed Extract, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-87, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Panthenol, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond Oil), Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Glycerin, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, PEG/​PPG-8/​3 Diisostearate, Astrocaryum Vulgare Kernel Oil, Tocopherol, Olea Europea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Euterpe Oleracea (Acai) Fruit Oil, Mauritia Flexuosa (Buriti) Fruit Oil, Fragrance, Polyquaternium-73\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick white cream. Emulsifies into a thinner non-sticky cream.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nMild fragrance that lingers around for a few hours, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis one is an extreme boost of hydration. It is a heavy product, and tends to make hair greasy if too much is used. Since my hair is very dry, this works really well to keep it considerably soft and frizz-free. It doesn’t help me a lot with definition though, I don’t feel my hair is more defined on the days I use this butter as opposed to some other leave-in cream (usually the green Arata styling cream). Since it is heavy, it might weigh down wavy or fine hair. But for tighter curl patterns and/or coarser drier hair, this is great.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nThe product label mentions that it can be used as a one and done styling product. But for better definition, I prefer always using the gelly with it.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased. \n\n## 🔹Curl-Quenching Flaxseed Gelly\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract, Sorbitol, Propanediol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Salvia Hispanica (Chia! Seed Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-73, Panthenol, Sodium Gluconate, Fragrance, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Vinegar\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThin to medium, non-sticky gel.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays for a few minutes, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis is protein-free and quite hydrating honestly. Has a lot of slip, so it is a nice experience to style. It doesn’t have a lot of hold. Curls last for a day or two maximum, and that is after all protective measures like a satin pillowcase, satin scrunchies, etc. If long-lasting curls are not a goal for you, and you don’t mind refreshing more frequently, I would highly recommend this. The Moisture Bundle would probably be my most highly recommended FMC products.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nThe product label mentions that it can be used as a one and done styling product. I do use it as my sole styler sometimes, and it works out fine.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Miscellaneous Notes About Fix My Curls✨\n\nFix My Curls website used to have the full ingredients list of their products on the product pages prominently displayed. However during their recent website update, they have replaced it with Key Ingredients. So, minus points for that from me.They do have a photo of the back label in the product images, which shows the ingredients, but I feel that is not good enough. I prefer having the ingredients easily accessible. \n\nThey always have some kind of sale, discount offers, freebie offers, etc on their website. A lot of Indian Curly Hair Influencers also have affiliate codes for FMC. If you are planning to buy anything, I’d recommend comparing prices from the official seller on Amazon and the website during sales. I would have included other platforms like Nykaa, Foxy, Purpple, etc, but they are pretty much always out of stock or very highly priced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ✨Frequently Asked Questions✨\n\n🔹How do I find my curl type/porosity?\n\nI used [this quiz](https://www.naturallycurly.com/quiz)!\n\n🔹How do I know whether my hair needs moisture or protein?\n\n[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/mzhv17/haircare_guide_to_proteinmoisture_balance/) might help.\n\n&#x200B;",

I use FMC leave in cream, hair mousse & defining hair gel & quite like them as they don't weigh down my hair while making them soft enough. Provide moderate hold & don't make them look crunchy. \n\nI agree with your assessment that they don't provide much moisture.

    "body": "Hair Type: Thin, 2B/C Curl Patterns, Oily scalp, prone to hairfall\n\nSome hair background:\nSo I switched to using silicone and sulphate free haircare on a whim back in 2017. To my surprise, this changed my previously mostly straight hair to pretty curly. I learnt about CGM afterwards but since that seemed like a lot of effort, I just stuck to using CG friendly products and was happy with what my hair looked like. Cut to 3 months ago, when I moved to a new place with a really humid climate and my hair fall became like 10 fold. I tried going back to products that had worked for me in the past but nothing helped. Eventually, I thought, that the increased frizziness caused by humidity was the cause of the hair fall and since no product seemed to make my hair soft and silky like before, I decided to go back to silicones. A combination that helped my hair fall to some extent was Bblunt Intense Moisture Shampoo (the blue one) and Loreal Professional Serie Quinoa Protein Hair Mask (used this as conditioner after every wash). But this combination also did make my hair straighter than it had been in recent years. Decided to give the BBlunt Curly Hair range a try (the pink color one). This range does contain Silicones, so it is not strictly CG friendly but it has worked for me. I do not use any leave-in products to style my hair, but I don't mind some frizz. The curls I get from just these 3 products are pretty impressive, as good as any other CG friendly shampoo/conditioners I have used in the past. And my hair fall though still not as less as it was 6 months ago, is definitely better. Details below.\n\n1) Bblunt Curly Hair Prepoo (Pink and white tub packaging)\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aloe Vera Extract, Cocos (Coconut)Water, Aayla mido propyltrimonium Chloride/Acrylamide Copolymer, Citric Acid, PEG-90M, Parfum (Perfume)\n\nThoughts: Definitely my favourite of the 3. I have been looking for a  pre-shampoo product to add to my routine. Oiling and Aloeing have not worked for me. I have previously used some hair masks that said they can be used before shower but they were thick and creamy and impossible to spread properly on semi-wet or dry hair. THIS product is everything I wanted. It is a gel-like consistency, spreads super easily. I usually brush out my hair before showering and this is when I lose the most hair. Since this product claims at helping in detangling I decided to use this before I brush my hair and the hair I lost was significantly less! During and post-shower, my hair maintains great slip!  This has the potential to be HG for me. It has a pleasant coconutty smell, but the fragrances in these products do not last too long, which is nice (The loreal mask makes my hair smell like a salon even 2 days later).\n\nRepurchase Status: WRP Definitely!\n\n2) Bblunt Curly Hair Shampoo (Pink Tube)\n\nIngredients: Aqua (Water), Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Cocamidopropyl Retain, Decyl Glucoside, Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Glycol Distearate, Glycerin, Acrylates Copolymer, Cocamide MEA, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipropylene Glycol, PEG-150 Distearate, Polysilicone-29, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-7, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Menthol, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panthenol, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cocoyl Sarcosine,TriticumVulgare (Wheat) Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Polysorbate-20, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Polysorbate-80, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Parfum (Perfume).\n\nThoughts: It is a shampoo that does its job. It cleans my oily scalp well without stripping it too much. It does not lather and spread as well as the blue BBlunt shampoo but that is to be expected as this one does not have SLS. One thing I have to mention is that near my roots this is the only product from the 3 that I used, and I noticed that the hair in that area did have some curls (usually hair close to my roots does not curl up), so this shampoo is definitely doing something right. Smells pretty fresh (like a cactus? or something softer than that lol) cant describe it. But again the smell does not linger post-shower.\n\nRepurchase Status: Maybe (I have a bunch of other shampoos lying around that I have to finish up first post-monsoon. If using any of those increases my hair fall again, will return to this)\n\n3) Bblunt Curly Hair Conditioner (Pink Tube)\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Amodimethicone, Behentrimonium, Methosulfate, Isopropyl Myristate, Dimethicone, Almond Oil, Polyquaternium-10, Silicone Quaternium, Polyquaternium-7, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cococoyl Satosire, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Polysorbate-20, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Panthenol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, MAgnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Trideceth-12, Laureth-23, Laureth-4, Polyglyceryl-3 Caprate, Dipropylene Glycol, Perfume\n\nThoughts: When I first used it I felt like it was super light and would not do much conditioning, but to my surprise when I rinsed it out, my hair had great slip, and detangled very easily. Some of that I will say must be because of the prepoo, but this conditioner also must be contributing. I guess since I was using the super thick loreal mask as conditioner previously, that's why this conditioner feels very light to me, but if it's doing its job, then it's ok of course. This smells like something sweet... white chocolate or marzipan. Overall I like it, and in combination with the prepoo, my hair is a lot softer than the loreal mask. \n\nRepurchase Status: Probably (again have a bunch of conditioners, i wish to use up first)\n\nI am a bit confused that even with silicones, how do these products work so well in giving me curls. Maybe I just don't know enough about how silicones work. But if with continued use I feel like silicone buildup is weighing my hair down, I can use my Fix My Curls Cleansing Shampoo once in a while, I guess.",

        "body": ">I am a bit confused that even with silicones, how do these products work so well in giving me curls. Maybe I just don't know enough about how silicones work. But if with continued use I feel like silicone buildup is weighing my hair down\n\nThat's because silicones are not the devil that cg hair community paints them out to be... Silicones are nothing but emollients just like natural oils that cg community likes to sing praises about... Except silicones are better than natural oils at their job of calming down the frizz and are lighter. And about weighing down, would your hair feel weighed down if you continuously apply oil without washing it off? Yes, yes you will. And what are oils again? Emollients same as a silicones. You see the similarity and the comparison. It took me a while to get out of the influencer-fed info that SILICONES WILL ABSOLUTELY DESTROY CURLY HAIR... Because I use sulphate free shampoo (wow shampoo at that) and silicone conditioner and feel no difference.\n\nSome people cannot tolerate silicones because that's how their *individual* hair is... Just like some people can't tolerate hyaluronic acid or a niacinamide serum. But this fear of silicones and this blanket statement that silicones are bad for curly hair comes from lack of education and knowledge about them. And if you have any doubt, feel free to ask.",

    "body": "# [Alpecin Double Effect Anti Dandruff and Natural Hair Growth Shampoo, Energizer for Strong Hair Care, Red, Fresh, 200 ml](https://imgur.com/kWt4nzz.jpg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Hair type:** Extremely straight that doesn't hold a curl for more than 1 hour. 1A leaning 1B (if I squint). An inch or two shorter than classic length (Aka mid butt length hair), High Porosity\n* **Hair concerns:** Split ends, normal amount of hairfall, prone to frizz, can look dry and damaged if I don't take care of it.\n* **Scalp type:** Normal, I think. Gets oily 2nd day night or 3rd day morning after hairwash\n* **Scalp concerns:** I don't use any product on my scalp but I feel like it's prone to build up and if I don't use an anti-dandruff shampoo every few washes, I get CCs on my forehead. Whatever causes my CCs are particularly invisible but my then derm insisted it was dandruff and following her regimen did get rid of the CCs without any skincare topical or prescription.\n* **Age/age range** \\- 25 to 35\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Current Haircare routine:**\n\n1. Pre Shampoo - Some homemade oil concoction (I add a lot of tiny oil bottles, I needed to empty, so I just mixed them all together.) or Plum Avocado Hair Mask\n2. Anti dandruff - Scalpe pro (I got L'oreal pure clay a while ago, to see if that will work instead of this, but haven't fully tested it out yet)\n3. Scalp shampoo - Alpecin Double Effect\n4. Length of the hair - Dove hydrating shampoo for curly hair (early days, haven't formed any impression yet.)\n5. Protein conditioner - Plum Olive and Macadamia Hair Mask (as and when necessary)\n6. Conditioner - Garnier Hair Food Papaya variant or Banana variant ( I like Papaya way better than banana, but neither of them are worth full price and Im still mourning the discontinuation of Matrix biolage purple cap)\n\nI've reviewed quite a few of the products I use, including Alpecin [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/vqot48/my_current_haircare_routine_reviews_reequil/), but Alpecin deserves its own review.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Climatic conditions under which the product was tested:** All. Summer, What passes for winter in the south, Monsoon.\n* **Usage timeline:** 1.5 years atleast. Almost done with my second bottle. And I've purchased it in Mid-September, this bottle has lasted me 8 months.\n* **Ingredient List:** [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n* **Price:** MRP 699 for 200 ml. Never seen this on discount. :(\n* **Texture, Consistency details:** Normal shampoo consistency, A blueish grey colour, so definitely added colour. You can see a hit of the colour and consistency [here](https://imgur.com/CVTsVhO.jpg)\n* **Fragrance:** HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n* **Usage:** I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply **on scalp only (Never below nape)**. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp. If I've oiled twice, I shampoo twice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Effect on hair issues and result of using the product:** Shiny frizz free hair, but definite loss of volume. If I had to use 1 word to describe it \"sleek\".\n* **Experience and thoughts in detail:**\n\n***Old Review, copied from my previous post and slightly edited***\n\nThis shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation.\n\nAlpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (obvious conflict of interests. I remember reading the study but can only find the [abstract](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17396054/) now) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit this for it. Maybe it'll work for others but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Updated Review***\n\nBarely anything to update if I'm honest. I stand by everything I said above, and they still hold true.\n\nAbout hairfall, I definitely don't think it helps. SO still thinks it helps, but acknowledges that he likes the user experience of it so much that he may be biased. Don't trust him.\n\nIn 2018, the UK Advertising Standards Authority ruled that caffeine shampoo Alpecin must no longer advertise that it can \"help to reduce hair loss\" as there was no adequate evidence to support the claim.  ***I definitely don't recommend buying this hoping it'll cure your hairfall issues.***\n\nThe main reason, I wanted to re-review this, is to post [this video](https://imgur.com/pt98TCe)\n\nI took these too [Pic 1](https://imgur.com/Sb7u13B.jpg), [Pic 2](https://imgur.com/fZMkSHb.jpg), but even though they are from back cam, quality is super bad. The video is a decent representation of what it looks like.  I'll update this post with better pics when I'm able to take them.\n\n**Other things to add**\n\n* The whole time I used Alpecin, I also used Scalpe pro. ie I used scalpe pro every few washes most of the year, but peak summer and winter or if I see signs of CCs, I used it every single wash and followed it up with Alpecin.  So every wash I used Alpecin but every few washes I used Scalpe pro + Alpecin.\n* u/santa96 has commented below that it didn't work for them, so I was running over possibilities. And one theory is the AD shampoo was actually stripping than I thought (I have used it alone, only for experimenting / testing purposes.  I originally thought it wasn't as stripping as most other AD shampoos but still drying compared to regular shampoos. Which is why I followed it up with Alpecin. But it could be that continued usage, caused dryness and the protein in the Alpecin was immediate damage control and THAT's why I love it so much.\n* This is just a hypothesis and is of now, untested. But my scalpe pro is almost over and I should know in a couple of months if I right.\n* Anyone for now, I obviously need to test it out under more conditions. This review is moot. I mean I still love it, but it needs to have more information for anyone else to judge if it'll work for you and I currently don't have that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ETA on 10/02/24: \n\nI had previously tagged this as OP-ED because I wanted to test out the following.\n\na) If I use Alpecin with no stripping products will it cause protein overload\n\nAnswer: No. It doesn't. 9 months later I still use Alpecin every single wash.\n\n* I've used it with the following variables affecting it\n   * Oiled hair\n   * Oiled hair + Clarifying shampoo (Loreal Pure Clay)\n   * Oiled hair + Normal shampoo (Loreal Hyaluronic acid)\n   * Unoiled hair\n   * Unoiled hair + Normal shampoo (Loreal Hyaluronic acid)\n\nand no protein overload. In fact except for a couple of months in the middle where I damaged my hair in beach vacations, my hair is way way way more healthier now than it was before.\n\nb) If I use it with a garden variety clarifying shampoo instead of a stripping anti-dandruff shampoo, will I still rave about it.\n\nAnswer: Yes. I would and I am. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Anything that you think others might find a con:** Price probably\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** Holy Grail, Forever repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;",

The few ingredients that are helpful are so far down the ingredients list that they're essentially useless for anything other than being able to use buzzwords in advertisements. This will clean your hair, probably pretty thoroughly considering most of these ingredients are surfactants. This will not hydrate, strengthen, soften, smooth, volumize or otherwise change your hair in any way. It might fade hair color.\n\nIn general, the ingredients to look for and ingredients to avoid vary a lot based on your hair and what you would like your hair to act like.

    "body": "To preface, I have dry skin and had heard good things about the Missha cleansing milk (this is not that product). I picked up this cleanser (around $10-11, on sale) because I couldn't find the cleansing milk at my local Missha store. Apparently they had run out so I decided to try my luck at what I hoped to be a similar product. I did look up the ingredients before buying since my skin is susceptible to a burning sensation when it doesn't like things. \n\nHere is the list: \nWater, Myristic Acid, Lauric Acid, Butylene Glycol, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycol Distearate, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Nymphaea Coerulea Flower Extract, Lauramide DEA, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Acrylate Coploymer, Polyquaternium-7, Capylyl Glycol, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Hexylene Glycol, PEG-90M, Methyl Gluceth-10, Ethoxydiglycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Buthoxy Diglycol, Glycereth-26, Diglycerin, Diethoxy Diglycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nSo I've been using this since December and am almost out. I used to only use this during the PM but started using this both morning and night to wash away the eye goo and stuff (lolew?). I normally lather it up before I apply it to my face. \n\nThe product does claim to be a one step type of product - the kind that can remove your make up. I didn't really use it this way so I'm unsure how well it functions as one. I will say that I did use it a few times to remove my every day make up but I don't wear a lot of makeup to begin with - mascara, light eyeshadow, bbcream and light blush at most (mascara always). However, it DID remove all of that makeup when I tried to use it as a one step. So for lazy, light make up days I think it works. Of course, it worked just fine as a second cleanser. \n\nThe cleanser didn't burn my skin while in use nor did it feel stripping or drying or tight when I finished cleansing. It didn't have that \"clean\" feeling that ordinary soaps give but it felt like my face...was my face, if that makes sense. It felt like the whole day had been washed away but all the natural oils hadn't. I didn't even feel the need to rush to put on my toner when I get out of the shower, which is where I cleanse my face. I'm unsure what the ph is though, unfortunately, so I apologize since many people look for that in reviews. \n\nThere is a fragrance that goes away after you wash. The strength was that of a normal shampoo, I think. However if you're super sensitive to fragrances, this may not be for you. \n\nAnyway, I think I'd rate this a 4/5 only because it's not an HG right now. I would definitely repurchase this, but I'm still experimenting with cleansers so I can't say it's HG status just yet. It does its job without making my skin cranky! I also like that it's available at my local store lol. \n\nTLDR: It's a foamy milk cleanser, does agree with my dry, sensitive, hates the world skin. Not super drying, not super stripping and would RP. PH level currently unknown. \n\n",

It also has numerous surfactants (ingredients below) so hard to tell which one was doing the trick. Should I try good old SLS? \n\nEdit: just wanted to add that I already have one of the shower head filters with the beads from amazon and it hardly does a thing, and I don't have the funds to install an expensive softening system.

        "body": "Why is it a problem to have silicone on the hair shaft? Specific emollients in hair care products are there for a reason. Iirc polyquats are even more difficult to remove than amodimethicone, but why bother? These ingredients impart shine and smoothness and are somewhat protective (among other things). Your hair does not contain living cells and does not require nutrients to be delivered into the inner core, nor does it require water inside the hair shaft. In fact, from my research less water in the hair shaft is ideal. So a layer of emollients will do more good than harm imo.\n\n\nObviously buildup will occur after some time, and when this occurs you can always use a clarifying shampoo. I was strictly no sulfates/silicones for a few years for my curly hair. Nowadays knowing the science behind things, I don't understand the movement.",

        "body": "There seems to be some disagreement about which cleansers remove which silicones. Amodimethicone is definitely one of the harder silicones to remove. My shampoo has that same cleanser, and some people describe it as essentially a sulfate while others say it's the most stripping of the non-sulfates but still weaker. If it were me, I would go by how my hair feels. If your hair seems gunky, sticky, or like it won't detangle the way it normally would, you can throw in a suave daily clarifying wash. If not, maybe your hair just likes being coated in silicone (or the shampoo is cleaning adequately) and you don't have to worry about it. The other thing to watch out for is that those heavy silicones tend to prevent oils from getting to your hair, so if you feel like your hair is really dry, or like the texture of it when unconditioned is getting worse, that may be a sign to switch conditioners or at least do a sulfate wash and use a silicone-free deep conditioner before you resume using the amodimethicone one.",

    "body": "Long rant so brace yourself. So I was looking over my dog's shampoo recently and was fairly surprised at the ingredients in them. Coconut and jojoba oils, fish oil, hemp oil, and nothing that really stood out to me that would flag it as unsafe but I'm also an ignoramus sooo... Without finding too much luck on the internet with people who have tried it I decided to give it a go. Just a little background, my scalp has recently been EXTREMELY itchy, dry and flaky, and gets pretty oily after two days without washing. I've tried a number of different methods before, and I haven't found anything holistic that has stuck, and I'm pretty set on not having to break my bank unless I really can't find anything else. So I decided why the hell not. I used the dog shampoo. It probably would have worked better had I washed it in the morning rather than going to sleep with wet hair, but man. My scalp feels SO much better its insane. My hair itself is pretty soft, and not at all frizzy like usual. I have read about the difference in a dogs ph vs a humans, so I am a little cautious but man. I really do notice a difference. I'll list the ingredients for reference: Purified water, anionic, non ionic, and amphoteric surfactants, acrylates cocopolymar, polyquaternium-7, fragrance, jojoba oil, dl-panthenol, dmdm-hydantoin, tetrasodium edta, dc red 33, natural pigments.\n\nSo if anyone else has ever had a similar experience, I'd love to hear about it! Feel free to let me know if this is ultimately a terrible idea haha.\n\nTL;DR I used dog shampoo and I might use it forever unless somebody tells me otherwise.",

I only see jojoba oil? Or is that in a different bottle?\n\nAlso what are the anionic, non ionic and mphoteric surfactants? It appears to be something in the process of making soap and the function of soap, but it's a bit vague. I'm not sure if it's a harsh detergent or not, because it doesn't mention which type it is. Anionic surfactants could be alkylbenzene sulfonates, alkyl sulfates, alkyl ether sulfates or just soap? So is it sulfates or soap? Both ending with sulfates appear to be similar to SLES. So it's nice to know which one it is. It looks kind of confusing, because they're not clearly telling you what is in there.\n\nI'm not sure, I wish I could be more enthusiastic for you and be like 'go ahead!' but I'm not too confident about it to be honest. I'd love to hear from someone with more knowledge about the surfactants.\n\nAbout the pH, I believe it increased to the alkaline pH right? You could consider an ACV rinse, maybe that could either neutralize it or bring the pH back again. The right pH can really help in a healthy scalp.",

The conditioner seems to be great for curly and very curly hair but from the look of the INCI might weigh wavy hair down? Thoughts?\n\nPRICE:\nThese products are pretty expensive. DevaCurl products are usually around $25 for 12 oz. I suppose this is understandable because this is a one-woman enterprise. However, what doesn't help is the...\n\nSHIPPING:\nCurrently, the shipping is $9~ via USPS. Which is really a bummer because it bumps up the price of the already expensive products.

Or maybe curly girls who live in the same area could split the shipping among themselves?\n\nPACKAGING:\nThese products come in a soft plastic bag with a nozzle. These look cute but I don't know how easy they would be to use in the shower. For that price, maybe there should have at least been bottles?\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nI have been following Massey's updates about her line and am enthusiastic about the products. Just looking at the INCI I can tell they are very well formulated. However, the price might be prohibitive for quite a few of us.",

    "body": "Hair Care History:  \nI have been using low-sulfate silicone-free shower gels as shampoo for a couple of months already while not using any conditioner. I only restarted using conditioner last Tuesday, because I finally found a 'cone-free conditioner. I can go almost a week without needing to wash my hair, is that a good sign?   \nMy sister has been using high-sulfate shampoos containing a bunch of 'cones, occasionally shampoos containing keratin as well, and accompanying conditioners. I think she might need a few more shampoo washes to get out all of the build-up out of her hair, but I'd love some advice here!  \n  \nHair Properties:  \nI was born with a full head of wavy/soft curl hair and have had waves and/or brushed out curls ever since my hair was long enough to be brushed. I always thought my hair was super frizzy, because it looked so unkempt after all the brushing I did. I found a kind of routine to keep it manageable: brushing while it was still damp after a shower would help form flatter and larger waves, so it would stay closer to my head.  \nI think my curl pattern right now is about 2b, but I think I might have some 2c potential, looking at some of my new-found curls. My hair is somewhere between medium and fine. The strands are somewhat thin, but they aren't brittle and my hair holds shape pretty well if I don't mess with it. I don't think it's very porous. I did the [Slip'n'Slide test](http://www.naturallycurly.com/texture-typing/hair-porosity) and that went about as smoothly going up as going down. My hair is medium-long, going a bit past shoulder length.  \nMy sister was born with curly hair, but has lost those curls by constantly brushing them out. She has what I think are a lot of flyaways on the top of her head, probably in part caused by curl-unfriendly hair cutting techniques. My sister has had her hair thinned out in the past, which I think is mostly cutting certain strands of hair shorter than others with the goal to remove volume. But I think in her case it had an opposite effect, the shortest hairs have the most curl and now they stand away from her head. What kind of styling product would she need to deal with these flyaways? There could also be some frizz involved.  \nMy sister's curl pattern is closer to 3a/b if you give her hair a chance to curl. Before CG it looked more like 2a. Her hair likes to form medium-sized ringlets. I think her hair is somewhat coarse, it is very thick and she has a lot of hair. Her hair holds shape better than mine, if she twists her hair into a ringlet with her fingers it will stay in that shape for hours. Her hair is very long, slightly past bra band length. Her hair feels more porous than mine doing the same test, but I’m not sure how to distinguish between medium and high porosity. Her hair is very dry. She has a lot of split ends and is probably in desperate need of a hair cut, but I'm not sure if that's wise to do now that we're adjusting our routines. Advice?  \n  \nCurrent Routine:  \n*Shampoo * : Sanex Advanced Dermo Repair (this is technically a shower gel)  \nIngredients: Aqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Coco-Glucoside, Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Sodium Chloride, Glyceryl Oleate, Parfum, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Salicylate, Polyquaternium-7, Allantoin, Caprylyl Glycol, Zinc Sulfate, Benzoic Acid.   \n*Conditioner * : Argan Care conditioner  \nIngredients: Aqua, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Parfum, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Citric Acid, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Magnesium Nitrate, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool.  \nI’m planning on running all these ingredients through the ingredient list of Tightly Curly, but if there’s something in these products that shouldn’t be in our hair, please let me know!  \n  \nWe used these products on Tuesday, combed our hair with a wide tooth comb after applying a lot of conditioner. Afterwards plopping it with a T-shirt and sleeping with our hair up in pineapple.  \n  \nI have also attempted  a deep treatment using 100% pure coconut oil on Wednesday. After application with a hair paint brush (is there a specific name for these things?) we let it sit under a shower cap and towel for an hour, then applied a bunch of conditioner and combed it through. Then rinsing it out in the shower using shampoo and conditioner, combed again. My sister plopped for 30-60 minutes, I think? And slept with a pineapple. I showered really late, so I slept with T-shirt plopping overnight (only 6,5 hours of sleep).  \n  \nResults?:  \nIt’s kinda hard to say what product did what, but this method is really working for me so far. Having curls is an immediate boost of confidence for me, because it feels like my hair is finally starting to look how it’s supposed to look. The problem is that I’m constantly playing with my curls. I’ll twist them around my fingers, or pull on them to see them bounce. I think I lost quite some definition today because of this. Is there any way to get some of this definition back for second-day curls? Would it help if I scrunch in some water and/or conditioner and/or coconut oil?  \nMy sister had some mixed results. She has more wavish curls, but her hair came out very greasy on Thursday morning. I think she might not have rinsed everything out properly (long hair is a lot of hair), but I was also thinking about some other causes: Is this because of previous buildup? Should she attempt co-washing about every other day until it improves? It seems that washing with the shampoo could be a little harsh to do it so often, but it might be more effective?  \n  \nI would also like to have some advice on dealing with the weather. We live in the Netherlands and basically go everywhere by bicycle, so our hair is exposed to rain, fog and humidity quite often. My hair will attract the moisture and frizz. I’m not sure how much my sister’s hair is affected by it, because I find it difficult to distinguish frizz from curly flyaways. Are there any styling products we could use to help deal with this?  \n  \n[Pics!]( http://imgur.com/a/8Rnpj)  \n  \nAnd my final question!: How are we doing so far?  \n  \nTL;DR: Just started CG.  \nMy hair: medium-long, medium-fine, low-porosity, 2b-ish curls. How can I hold on to curl definition for 2nd day curls or bring the definition back? How can I combat weather-induced frizz?  \nMy sister’s hair: long and thick, coarse, more porous, 3a/b? curls. Only recently stopped using silicones and sulfates, how to ease the transition. Possibly still has some build-up, attempt co-washing more often? Has a lot of flyaways and probably also some frizz, advice on styling product? Needs a haircut, do it now or wait for routine to set in?  \nWe live in the Netherlands and this will influence product options available to us.  \n  \nSorry for the long post, I just wanted to share my excitement!",

You should probably invest in a few restorative products, like a deep conditioner and protein treatment. Also, be careful with oils. They can be a wonderful thing, but can easily weigh down your hair, especially if you're low-porosity. \n\nFrizz has always been a problem of mine, and there's not that much to do other than use products based on dew points(Link in sidebar) and use gel. \n\nWhen you're just starting out, it will take time for your hair to adjust. I know this seems like a lot of terminology and work, but just keep trying new things, read the posts on naturallycurly.com and you'll get the hang of it in no time.",

    "body": "In early January 2020, actress and hairstyling enthusiast [Taraji P. Henson]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taraji_P._Henson) launched her haircare line, TPH. The collection is currently sold exclusively at Target, both in stores and online. The line contains 18 products and is not designed to be exclusive to any hair type.\n[Five beauty editors at Allure](https://www.allure.com/story/tph-hair-taraji-p-henson-review) – including three who have Type 4 hair – tested the products and had complimentary things to say.\n\n##Product Details\n* __Price:__ $9.99 + tax for 12 oz. (355 mL)\n* __Hair Type:__ Curly & Coily\n* __Appearance:__ White conditioner\n* __Texture:__ Thick (maintains shape when poured); non-greasy feeling\n* __Scent:__ Light natural scent – shea butter, olive oil, sage oil; scent does not linger\n* __Marketing Spiel:__ Hustle & Co is an ultra creamy, suds-free conditioning cleanser that deeply refreshes while moisturizing your coils, curls, and waves. No side hustle (in this case additional conditioner) necessary- Hustle & Co delivers hydrating goodness into your hair without stripping your hair of its natural oils. To use, wet hair and apply a generous amount to hair and scalp. Massage in with your fingertips and rinse. Repeat if needed.\n\n##Ingredients (NOT CG-APPROVED)\nwater (aqua/eau), cetyl alcohol, glycerin, isopropyl palmitate, behentrimonium chloride, ISODODECANE, fragrance (parfum), cetrimonium chloride, AMODIMETHICONE, phenoxyethanol, laureth-4, guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-7, ethylhexylglycerin, panthenol, trideceth-3, trideceth-15, disodium edta, olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, aminomethyl propanol, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, salvia officinalis (sage) oil, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, limonene\n\n###Method\nFor each wash, I poured an Oreo-sized mount of conditioner. I spread the conditioner out over my scalp and massaged vigorously for about two minutes. I then took a paddle detangling brush to spread the conditioner down to my ends and undo knots for somewhere in the 3-5 minute vicinity. I rinsed for about one minute.\n\n##Results & Observations\n * The product spreads super-easily. I got great coverage and had no trouble brushing it down to my ends.\n* While my hair was saturated and even after rinsing*, my hair had a TON of slip and I could have detangled manually if I had wanted.\n* The product absorbs into my hair very quickly. Even  after three washings and trying longer-than-usual rinses, I wasn’t entirely sure that I had most of it out.\n* I would have expected my Overtone to bleed, but the water rinses out 99.7% clear. My color looks as good as it did on the day I applied it.\n* My hair feels soft and amazing now, wet or dry. \n* My hair is super, *duper* shiny.\n* I’m getting much better than average volume at the roots, which lasts through my second day.\n* Either I’m not rinsing well enough or the product is too heavy for my ends to support. I have 2b/2c hair on Day 1 and wake up with 1c hair on Day 2.  (Which I am totally willing to let slide for how nice my hair looks and feels.)\n\n#Conclusion\nI’m deeply impressed with the salon-like power of this product for its drugstore price. I’m ready to kick my existing shampoo and leave-in conditioner off the shelf and make TPH a permanent fixture in my shower.",

    "body": "I've been using Formulate shampoo and conditioner for about 10 weeks now and I'd like to share my thoughts with you wonderful people who have taught me so much! I was so curious about these before I bought them, but I couldn’t find many reviews from people who follow CGM or have curly/wavy hair.\n\nAbout my hair: I have type 2 (ranging from a-c in different places on my head), fine, medium porosity, protein loving hair that is a bit longer than shoulder length. It has light bleach damage on the bottom 1/4 of it. \n\nAbout my routine: I live in Phoenix, AZ where it is very hot and very dry most of the time. I have pretty hard water, so I switch between using this shampoo and using a light chelating shampoo (Bb Sunday shampoo). I shampoo then condition and STC upside down. I detangle with a wetbrush and drizzle rinse out the conditioner, then using a TON of water, I scrunch in a defining cream, usually AG Re:coil, then glaze and scrunch in Harry's gel. I pixie diffuse to 80% dry and root clip, then SOTC once 100% dry.\n\nFormulate review: I started with the 8oz. size of both shampoo and conditioner (ingredients listed below).  I set my preferences to be no dyes, no anti-brass, silicone free (all formulate products are sulfate and paraben free). There are options to make them vegan and gluten free, but I did not select those.\n\nThe hair concerns I chose for them to base the ingredients off of were number one curl definition (lol wavy probs) followed by improve scalp health, prevent thinning, volumize and anti-frizz. For scent I chose Tidal for my first round (described as Ocean, Sage, Lily and Musk). \n\nI wasn’t really expecting to be that blown away by these. I've tried function of beauty and really didn't like it. I was considering Prose, and got these instead as a way to talk myself out of spending Prose money and I am SO GLAD I DID. I never knew I could love a shampoo and conditioner, I'm not a brand loyal person and almost never get the same thing twice because I like to experiment, but I will not be straying from these anytime soon. The shampoo is A GAME CHANGER. It has so much slip and is so hydrating I could honestly detangle my hair with just the shampoo in it. It feels so good and lathers well, leaves my scalp feeling actually clean. It has a weird consistency, there's a jelly-like substance mixed into a more traditional shampoo-like substance, but it doesn't really bother me at all when I'm using it. The conditioner is similarly amazing - so much slip, super moisturizing. It gives me such good definition, I mean better than most curl definers, that I started drizzle rinsing, something I’ve never done before, to leave some of it in even though it's not meant to be a leave in. It is shocking how much definition and clumping action it gives my hair!! \n\nLike most CGM users, and because I use my chelating shampoo every fourth wash day or so, I went through the conditioner faster than the shampoo and am now on my second bottle. I've sized up so now my conditioner will be 16oz. and my shampoo will be 8oz. I AM IN LOVE. I switched to a new scent because Tidal smells a bit too much like a man for my personal preference. I set my scent level to medium and I will say it does linger, not overpoweringly, but your hair will smell faintly like it even on day 2. \n\nMy formula does contain a little protein in both the shampoo and conditioner. My hair loves protein, so that's cool with me! Plus I feel it helps balance out the moisture. I suspect it's part of the reason I get such good definition from these. If you are considering trying Formulate, I cannot recommend it highly enough and truly feel it is worth every penny. In the past I've tried TGIN, Jessicurl, DevaCurl (pre-scandal) and As I Am, and nothing compares to Formulate, including products from my pre-CGM days.\nPackaging is really nice, although I wish they would offer the sustainable option to just get refills every month instead of new plastic bottles. I love the ease with which you can make edits to formula and cadence and bottle size. Having access to the formulation chemist and technician so you can talk to them if you have concerns or want changes instead of a call-center type of person is a really nice touch. The website has this awesome feature where it will tell you what every single ingredient is and why it’s there, which is so nice if you’re trying to learn more about hair care ingredients. \nI will say they put a weird amount of emphasis on whether you are a “him or a her” in their hair quiz and that’s just so dumb in my opinion. Hair has no gender, I can’t imagine why they need to know this, and they should have more options than the binary if it’s that important to them. Also it’s really hard even once you have an account to circumvent the stupid quiz and just login. Like way more annoying than it needs to be. These are my only complaints though. \n\n\nTL;DR: Very highly recommend these, worth every penny imo!!\n\nIngredients in my shampoo: Purified Water, Coconut-Derived Cleanser, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Diglycerin, Cocamide MIPA, At Dawn(scent), Methyl Gluceth-20, Guar Gum, Coconut-Derived Cleanser, Polyquaternium-7, Polyglycerol-2 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-6 Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate, Polyglyceryl-4 Cocoate, Polyglyceryl-6 Ricinoleate, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Argan Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Propanediol, Phenylpropanol, Panthenyl Hydroxypropyl Steardimonium Chloride, Sesame Seed Oil, p-Anisic Acid, Levulinic Acid, Vegetable Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Lactic Acid, Sodium Lactate, Carbamide, Starch Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Saw Palmetto, Sweet Almond Oil, Avocado Oil, Vitamin C, Beta-Sitosterol, Hemp Seed Oil, Vitamin E, Citrus Fruit Acid, Pumpkin Seed Oil, Broccoli Seed Oil, Aloe Vera\n\nIngredients in my condiitoner: Purified Water, Polyquaternium-7, Diglycerin, At Dawn(scent), Polyquaternium-32, Lecithin, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Oilseed Turnip, Butyl Stearate, Polyquaternium-37, Mineral Oil, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Polyglycerol-2 Laurate, Acetamide MEA, Sesame Seed Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Propanediol, Phenylpropanol, Argan Oil, Methyl Gluceth-20, Keratin Oil, Vitamin B5, Sweet Almond Oil, Cocoyl Hydrolyzed Collagen, Avocado Oil, Oleoyl Sarcosine, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenyl Hydroxypropyl Steardimonium Chloride, Coconut-Derived Cleanser, Saw Palmetto, Guar Gum, p-Anisic Acid, Levulinic Acid, Vegetable Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Lactic Acid, Sodium Lactate, Carbamide, Starch Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Vitamin C, Hemp Seed Oil, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitol, Beta-Sitosterol, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Polysorbate 80, Vitamin E, Jojoba Seed Oil, Linoleic Acid, Wheat Germ Oil, Wheat Germ Acid, Cocoyl Sarcosine, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acids, Vitamin E, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Aloe Vera, Broccoli Seed Oil, Pumpkin Seed Oil, Citrus Fruit Acid\n\nEdit: formatting",

When the BOGO sale was happening at Walgreens, I decided to try the Mousse- just to see.\n\n\"SheaMoisture's Coconut & Hibiscus Frizz-Free Mousse enhances natural curl memory and wave pattern. No sticky, crunchy or flaky residue-just high impact volume with a soft finish. Fight frizz all day while promoting shine.\"\n\n**Ingredients** (as listed on product):\n\nDeionized water , Cocamidopropyl Betaine , Vegetable Glycerine , Olea Europaea Fruit Oil (Olive) , Butyrospermum Parkii Oil (Shea Butter) , Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil , Keratin , Polyquaternium-7 , Hibiscus Sabdariffa Extract , Silk Protein , Polyquaternium-10 , Alcohol , Sucrose Laurate , Melia Azadirachta Seed Oil (Neem) , Proprietary Essential Oil Blend , potassium sorbate , Citric Acid.\n\n**Price**\n\n$9.99 for 7.5 oz\n\n**Where to Buy**\n\nTarget, Walgreens, CVS, Ulta... I haven't found this in everystore that carries SM, but in a fair amount of them.\n\n\n**How to Use**\n\n\"Divide damp hair into sections. Apply 2 to 3 pumps to each section and comb through. Style as desired.\"\n\n**Pros**\n\nIt wasn't waxy!! Yay! It seemed moisturizing also, so that's great.  Light- didn't weigh down my fine hair.\n\n**Cons**\n\nNo hold whatsoever.  If I'm paying $10 for a product I'll go through quickly(trust me, I'm using a lot of product and still not getting the results I want), I want it to actually work. I feel like it's expensive on its own and doesn't offer the moisture AND hold I wanted.\n\n**Overall**\n\nIf you have hair that doesn't frizz easily, this might be the product for you. My hair is fairly porous, and it needs a bit of hold to keep it in clumps instead of frizzing out. This product was not it. :( Sad times.",

        "body": "For a shampoo thickener, Crothix is usually fairly common. Don't know how you feel about the ingredient, but it does really well at 1-2 wt%. Alternatively, sulfonates can be thickened with salt (either monovalent NaCl or divalent MgCl2). Usually somewhere around 2-4 wt% is the transition point to networked worm-like micelle gels.\n\nGetting that much SCI to dissolve can be difficult. Definitely pre-dissolve SCI in CAPB first. It isn't an easy substance to work with, for sure and can contribute to an opaque product when cooked to room temp (around 20 °C or so).\n\nYour conditioner doesn't have an emulsifier fit for this system. Glyceryl stearate can be a great secondary emulsifier, but it is best used when paired with something that forms normal micelles like PEG-100 glyceryl stearate to bring the emulsion back into a place where it can be kinetically stabilized. Using both together helps promote lamellar networks that contribute to better emulsion stability. \n\nMany try BTMS or BTMCl because it provides thickening and conditioning. I'd use polyquaternium-10 and polyquaternium-7 in your conditioner, but save the polyquaternium-7 for your shampoo. Quaternized HEC tends not to play well with strong anionics (like sulfonates, which is what SCI is).\n\nI'm not sure the reasoning for avoiding sulfates, but sulfonates are basically the same, so if you worry about stripping, these both can be formulated to be gentler. \n\nChatGPT sucks and usually doesn't give good answers. I would try and learn more about how these ingredients work before making a complicated emulsion like a conditioner or shampoo. \n\nTry making a simple 3-5 ingredient hand wash that uses salt to thicken to get a feel for thickening, and test out a simple emulsion (like a 4 ingredient lotion) before wasting too much on expensive polyquats.\n\nAlso pH will matter a lot! Make sure you're pHing your product at the end appropriately. 0.25 wt% citric acid might not be enough to bring the pH down to the proper place. Always leave extra room for pHing and make up the difference in water.",

All the products I use and review here are completely fragrance free, contain no masking fragrance, no “natural” fragrances or essential oils, no photo-sensitizing plant oil/extracts (lavender, eucalyptus, citrus, etc ). So here we go: \n\n**BEST**: \n\n1. **Acne.org cleanser**: this is my HG face cleanser that I have repurchased so many times. No matter how many products I try over the years, I always come back to this because it’s cost effective, works well without drying out my skin, and does not leave a residue behind. It has a gel texture and come in a pump bottle which make it super convenient to use. \n\n**Ingredients:** Water, PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, PEG-150 Distearate, Sodium Laureth 13 Carboxylate, Disodium Cocamphodiacetate, Butylene Glycol, Sage Extract, Cucumber Extract, White Oak Bark Extract, Panthenol, Allantoin, Acrylates Copolymer, Methylgluceth-20, Polysorbate-20, Quaternium-15, DMDM Hydantoin, Disodium EDTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. **First Aid Beauty Pure Skin Face Cleanser:** This cleanser is one of my recent discovery and I like it a lot. It’s a little more pricey than the [Acne.org](http://acne.org/) cleanser, but it works well and is gentle on the skin. It comes in a tube which makes it convenient for travel. \n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua/Water/Eau, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Hydrogenated Coconut Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Stearyl Alcohol, Allantoin,  Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Tocopherol, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides Citrate, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Sodium PCA, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Sodium Chloride, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Maltodextrin,  Tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. **Soon Jung pH 5.5 Foam Cleanser:** This is a Korean product. It comes in a tube and does cleanse well, doesn’t over dry, and leaves no residue behind. Overall, this is a good cleanser. If you are looking for a good Korean water based cleanser, I would recommend this one. This would be best for people with normal to oily skin, IMO.\n\n**Ingredients:** Water / Aqua / Eau, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Coco -betaine, Potassium Benzoate, Sodium Chloride, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Disodium EDTA, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Madecassoside\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WORST**: \n\n1. **Hada Labo Goku-jyun Foaming Face Wash:** This is probably the worse cleanser out of everything I tried in a long time. I decided to purchase this product to try because I like the oil cleanser from Hada Labo, but this one is a total let down! This cleanser come in a pump bottle, which makes it easy to dispense the product, but that’s the only pro. Now the cons: This foam cleanser does not cleanse well. For me, It’s too gentle on the skin, leave a greasy residue on my skin and made me break out. I believe the greasy feeling is due to the Vaseline in the formula. I think this cleanser will only work for people with dry to very dry skin, but even if you have dry skin, there are so many other better cleansers out there. Those of you with oily, acne-prone or combo skin, this product will be a disaster! So stay away!\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, BG, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, PEG-8, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamide DEA, PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Sodium Taurine Cocoyl Methyltaurate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate(Super Hyaluronic Acid), Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate(Skin-adsorbed Hyaluronic Acid), **Vaseline**, Citric Acid, Polyquaternium-7, EDTA-2Na, BHT, Methylparaben\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SO-SO:**\n\n1. **Rovectin Skin Essentials Conditioning Cleanser:** This is another Korean product. It comes in a pump bottle and is very convenient to use. However, this is a very average cleanser. It’s not the worst, but not the best either. It works and is gentle on the skin, but there’s nothing wow worthy about it. Also, there’s nothing it does that the other cleansers I mention above cannot do. I won’t be repurchasing this one. \n\n**Ingredients:**  Water, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Decyl Glucoside, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Centella Asiatica (Gotu Kola) Extract, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Glycine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Serine, Glutamic Acid, Aspartic Acid, Protease, Leucine, Alanine, Lysine, Arginine, Tyrosine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Proline, Valine, Isoleucine, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Histidine, Cysteine, Methionine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Potassium Benzoate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Trioleate",

None of these leave my skin dry or tight. \n\n* **Simple Hydrating Cleansing Oil** - this is very nice for such a cheap product. My HG until I tried out fancier stuff. For drier and dehydrated skin that isn't acne prone, you could use this as a single cleanse. I have all winter. \n\n* **Clinique Take The Day Off Balm** - I got this as a sample pot and it's really cosmetically elegant. Lathers up beautifully. Very satisfying to use. Single cleanse works for me. \n\n* **Beauty of Joseon Radiance cleansing balm** - this is so fancy! Unlike the Clinique, it turns straight to an oil texture when you rub it in. I prefer that the Clinique is a slightly thicker texture when you rub it in personally but I'm trying a fermented skincare routine which is why I bought it. The packaging is amazing - it comes with a spatula in a little compartment in the lid! I'm not sure it emulsifies as well as the Clinique so I double cleanse my T-zone to be safe. \n\n* **Simple Refreshing Gel face wash** - very nice, good second cleanser. Cheap but effective. Also Fungal Acne safe according Folliculitis Scout but please check yourself. I use this as my second cleanser on my T-zone and my sole cleanser on my neck/upper chest.",

It is color treated (because I have some greys) and I rarely use heat to style. The one upside it that is tends to be very soft (except when I pick the wrong product and dry it out). \n\nI am getting so turned around and confused with all the hair care advice I read. I am currently using [HairStory](https://www.hairstory.com/products/new-wash/) and it is going alright, but that s\\*&t is expensive. I made the mistake of using a leave-in that came in an Ipsy bag ( [FoxyBae Magic Daily Leave In Hair Mask - 12-in-1](https://www.foxybae.com/products/12-in-1-magic-daily-leave-in-hair-mask)). It was good the first time I used it but now my hair is feeling a bit grubby (so I guess I need to use a clarifying shampoo). I like to wash my hair ever other day, but on day two I always have to wear it in a ponytail. I'm tired of fighting it every day and spending a fortune on stuff that never seems to work. \n\nI have tried CG method, untold products for decades, products for curly hair, products for wavy hair, products for fine hair...). If I don't wash my hair frequently my scalp itches, so I have never managed more than three days. It takes my hair a long time to air dry, so I hate washing it because I have to go to work with wet hair or sleep with wet hair. \n\nI just want my hair to be moisture/protein balanced and not weighed down. I don't like complicated hair routines and prefer to use little or no product outside of shampoo and conditioner. I occasionally use [L'anza Bounce Up Spray](https://www.ulta.com/healing-oil-bounce-up-spray?productId=xlsImpprod18041073) and that seems to be magic. I have [Olaplex](https://olaplex.com/) 3 and it worked great the first time and has had diminishing returns since. I also have Olaplex 6 and it feels heavy in my hair. \n\nI tried that hair in water test and it never sunk despite leaving it in the cup for over an hour; however, I hear that this test may not be that helpful. Again, I get conflicting information. \n\nI am currently eyeing the [Verb Ghost line](https://www.verbproducts.com/products/smooth-shine-duo?variant=32294608240729). Ingredients below. Should I try that one? Or is there something else that could work for me? Please help.

A couple of years ago they changed the formula and I've been buying boxes of old cans ever since. However, it looks like I'm about to run out forever. I cannot switch to their new formula because it has coconut oil and avocado oil. I'm a oily hair gal, so both a no go for me. Does anyone know of any alternatives that are close or have worked for them personally? Would appreciate any help here! \n\nAlso sharing the list of ingredients here in case it may be helpful: water (aqua), isobutane, hydrofluorocarbon 152a, vp/va copolymer, propane, polyquaternium-11, polysorbate 20, polyquaternium-4, pvp, fragrance (parfum), ppg-12-peg-50, lanolin, olealkonium chloride, polyquaternium-7, sodium benzoate, propylene glycol, cyclopentasiloxane, sorbitol, glycerin, cocamidopropyl betaine, cyclohexasiloxane",

I know that there was someone who mixed topical Finasteride with lipids to give it a higher molecular weight, but that still goes systematic. My other post was about a hydrophobic topical Finasteride which would be harder to do, but why not just mix topical Finasteride with something that physically cannot penetrate the scalp. Like the molecule pp405 is using. They claim that their solution will stay topical in the scalp. Why not use that molecule with topical Finasteride. \n\n I asked chat gpt for some other examples of bases and they gave me this: Polyquaternium-11 (or Polyquaternium-7):\n\t•\tPolyquaternium compounds are large-molecule, water-soluble polymers that are commonly used in hair and skin products. They form a thick, non-penetrating layer on the skin and hair. Polyquaternium-11, in particular, has a high molecular weight and is often used for conditioning, moisturizing, and forming protective barriers.\n\t•\tIt creates a flexible, smooth layer that doesn’t allow active ingredients or environmental elements to penetrate deeply.\nHydrolyzed Silk Protein:\n\t•\tSilk proteins have a high molecular weight and can help condition and protect the scalp without deep absorption. When hydrolyzed (broken into smaller fragments), they still have large molecular structures and stay on the surface, providing a smooth coating effect.\n\t•\tThese proteins also help improve the appearance of hair without penetrating deeply into the skin.\n\nWe quite literally have the mechanism that stops hairloss but 1-5% of people get sides from them (some think higher). Why is no company exploring a side effect free Finasteride?! Please someone poke holes into this argument. Not sure why a bunch of different bases with a topical Finasteride wasn’t tested or at the very least the molecule that pp405 is using can’t be used in topical Finasteride ",

Increasing absorption leads to higher levels in the blood\n\nPersonally I don’t think reducing dht with Finasteride is harmful because it’s not completely suppressed. There are benefits like better skin and less oiliness because Dht ages you. Prostate health and avoiding future enlarged prostate complications. Also the hair benefits",

I've read that cocamidopropyl betaine can easily remove amodimethicone (even regular dimethicone) without being harsh on your hair. I've tried searching for other milder, non-sulfate cleansers that can also do this, but cocamidopropyl betaine seems like the most popular choice. \n\n[Here](https://www.amazon.com/Palmers-Formula-Co-Wash-Cleansing-Conditioner/dp/B00EDQWRQ2/ref=sr_1_32_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1550859002&sr=1-32&keywords=cowash) is the product I've been looking at - Palmer's Olive Oil Formula Co-Wash Cleansing Conditioner, Non Lather Shampoo Alternative. The ingredients are:\n\nWater, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Isopropyl Palmitate, Polyquaternium-7, Behentrimonium Chloride, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laureth-4, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower/Leaf Extract, Equisetum Arvense Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Hyssopus Officinalis Extract, Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, **Cocamidopropyl Betaine**, Panthenol, Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, Myristyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Alcohol, Sodium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Propylene Glycol, Blue 1 (CI 42090), Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Red 4 (CI 14700), Caprylyl Glycol, Benzyl Salicylate, Linalool\n\nOf all the products I looked at that were specifically marketed as co-washes, this was one of the only ones that had cocamidopropyl betaine in the ingredients list. Is it high enough on the list though to make a difference?\n\nI've also looked for heat protectants that are silicone free or contain water soluble silicones only. My search has been unsuccessful... products with water-soluble silicones only that are high up in the ingredient list are basically unicorns that are impossible to find, and the options that don't use silicones at all seem to be pretty weak; not strong enough to protect against flat ironing, at least. \n\nIf someone here could tell me if it looks like I'm heading in the right direction, I'd be very grateful.

    "body": "Hello everyone, I am new to this fungal acne as I recently discovered that it is what I have. I have only had problems for about 3 years (I am 37 years old). My problem is that I recently bought a lot of products (before I understood that I have fungal acne), and I am not well-read yet on which products are suitable or not. Below, I have a list of products that I use but am unsure if they are fungal acne safe. Some I can see are not safe, but as I said, I am not sure. Therefore, I need help with the ingredients list of these products. Which are okay and which are not okay? If some kind soul who is knowledgeable about this could just look through the list and mark \"OK\" or \"NOT OK\" on all the products, I would be so grateful so that I can sell or give away these products as they are new. \n\nTheese are the products i use:\n\n  \n**FACE MASKS**\n\n**Evolve organic beauty, bio retinol gold mask**\n\n**INCI:** Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil [\\[1\\]](https://www.ecco-verde.com/evolve-organic-beauty/bio-retinol-gold-mask#cite_note-fa75add99e33c3b7b-1)Glycerin [\\[2\\]](https://www.ecco-verde.com/evolve-organic-beauty/bio-retinol-gold-mask#cite_note-fa75add99e33c3b7b-2)KaolinPrunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil [\\[1\\]](https://www.ecco-verde.com/evolve-organic-beauty/bio-retinol-gold-mask#cite_note-fa75add99e33c3b7b-1)Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil [\\[1\\]](https://www.ecco-verde.com/evolve-organic-beauty/bio-retinol-gold-mask#cite_note-fa75add99e33c3b7b-1)MicaCi 77891 (Titanium Dioxide)SilicaCi 77491 (Iron Oxide)Sucrose LaurateRosa Canina (Rosehip) Fruit Oil [\\[1\\]](https://www.ecco-verde.com/evolve-organic-beauty/bio-retinol-gold-mask#cite_note-fa75add99e33c3b7b-1)Perfume (Fragrance) [\\[3\\]](https://www.ecco-verde.com/evolve-organic-beauty/bio-retinol-gold-mask#cite_note-fa75add99e33c3b7b-3)Bidens Pilosa ExtractAstrocaryum Murumuru Seed ButterGossypium Herbaceum (Cotton) Seed OilLinum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Seed OilCitrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Water [\\[1\\]](https://www.ecco-verde.com/evolve-organic-beauty/bio-retinol-gold-mask#cite_note-fa75add99e33c3b7b-1)Vanilla planifolia fruit oilTocopherol (Vitamin E)Sucrose StearateSucrose PalmitateTin Oxide\n\n1. from controlled organic agriculture\n2. made using natural raw ingredients\n3. from natural essential oils\n\n**Mantle, The dream mask**\n\n**INCI:** Aqua (Water), Hydrogenated Ethylhexyl Olivate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propanediol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Cannabis Sativa (Hemp) Seed Oil, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cannabis Sativa (Hemp) Leaf Extract, Bakuchiol, Hydrogenated Olive Oil Unsaponifiables, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hippophae Rhamnoides Fruit Extract, Ubiquinone, Phospholipids, Sphingolipids, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Tocopherol, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Beta-Sitosterol, Squalene, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Litsea Cubeba Fruit Oil (Parfum/Fragrance), Citral, Limonene, Linalool, Citronellol, Geraniol\n\n\n\n**La prairie, 3 min peel mask**\n\n**INCI:** water (aqua), lactic acid, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, glycolic acid, tetrahydroxypropyl ethylenediamine, polyglyceryl-3 laurate, peg-8/smdi copolymer, hexylene glycol, sodium hydroxide polyglyceryl-6 caprylate, polyglyceryl-4 caprate, salicylic acid, malic acid, hydroxyethylcellulose, glycoproteins\\*, panax ginseng root extract\\*, equisetum arvense extract\\*, saccharomyces cerevisiae extract\\*, lactobacillus ferment\\*, sucrose, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, glucose, fructose, glycerin, urea, tocopheryl acetate, sodium nitrate, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil unsaponifiables, cardiospermum halicacabum flower/leaf/vine extract, dextrin, polysorbate 60, octyldodecanol, sorbitan isostearate, sodium stearoyl glutamate, tetrasodium glutamate diacetate, echium plantagineum seed oil, alanine, polyquaternium-7, tocopherol, ethylhexylglycerin, fragrance (parfum), alpha-isomethyl ionone, linalool, phenoxyethanol, sodium benzoate, titanium dioxide (ci 77891)     i75\n\n\n\n**La prairie, Luxe sleep mask**\n\n**INCI:** Water (Aqua), Propanediol, Dimethicone, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Oil, Squalane, Glycerin, Sorbitan Stearate, Jojoba Esters, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Alcohol, Nylon-12, Glycoproteins\\*, Panax Ginseng Root Extract\\*, Equisetum Arvense Extract\\*, Carrageenan, Caviar Extract, Caulerpa Lentillifera Extract, Lactobacillus Ferment, Acmella Oleracea Extract, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Tocopherol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide NP, Sodium DNA, RNA, Hydrolyzed Rice Bran Protein, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Tetrapeptide-3, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Tocopheryl Acetate, Pullulan, Panthenol, Coco-Glucoside, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Pantolactone, Sucrose Stearate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lactate, Sodium Oleate, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Phytate, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Yeast Extract, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Polysorbate 60, Fragrance (Parfum), Linalool, Limonene, Geraniol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Red 4 (CI 14700), Blue 1 (CI 42090) i74 \\* New patent pending for la prairie’s exclusive Cellular Complex in addition to US Patent 5,840,309 \\*\\* The declaration on the packaging prevails.

Any ingredient that ends in -cone is a silicon, which is used to coat the hair to reduce frizz and tangles. These are found in like 90% of conditioners.\n\n Silicones can create buildup that make the hair heavy and dull but sulfate and other clarifying shampoos take care of that.\n\nPersonally I dont use any silicones in my hair care routine because I'm sensitive to sulfates. \n\nQuick google search gave me this awesome article going into detail of silicones in hair products. https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/curl-products/curlchemist-amodimethicone-and-other-amine-functionalized-silicones",

I have searched through the archives of posts in this sub and I can't manage to find any cleansers that fit the bill. I'm looking for a second cleanser, and the only one I've used that isn't discontinued and hasn't caused any problems was from AmorePacific, which I received as a gift. Even *that* had butylene glycol, but I guess it was low enough on the list that it didn't irritate my skin. I would really, really not like to spend $50+ on a second cleanser. I feel like that's obscene. But it seems impossible to find an affordable cleanser without those ingredients that isn't just micellar water or something. The beloved Krave is out. So are LRP, CeraVe, Vanicream, Avene, pretty much all the favorites. I really appreciate any recommendations you might have.\n\nIngredients of AmorePacific's Treatment Cleansing Foam below:\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, PEG-8, Myristic Acid, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, LauricAcid, Palmitic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Alcohol Denat., Polyquaternium-7,Phytosteryl/Octyldodecyl Lauroyl Glutamate, Fragrance/Parfum, PEG-150 Distearate, Dextrin,Butylene Glycol, Trehalose, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Benzoate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional,Lactobacillus Ferment Lysate (210 PPM), Sodium Hyaluronate, Limonene, Citronellol, Gossypium Herbaceum (Cotton) Extract, Tocopherol.\n\nEdited to add: I am currently using Dr. Loretta Gentle Hydrating Cleanser, which has coco-betaine and stings my skin.

That makes it excellent for both curls and color, but it may not be enough for you in terms of cleaning your hair and scalp.\n\nThe Love for Hue and Curl Defining shampoos are actually pretty similar in that they both use very mild detergents. This would be good for both color and curls and sufficient for cleansing unless you have a lot of buildup or certain scalp conditions. It would be a little harsher on hair than the kinky moves, but a lot of people can't cowash.\n\nIf you can't cowash, try alternating cowashing with low poo (both the curl defining and love for hue shampoos are low poos). That will help keep your color fresh and your curls moisturized.",

My university's pharmacy sells stuff like CeraVe and Aqua Glycolic very cheap ($11 for a tub of CeraVe, and I believe the toner is $13), so I can afford to try stuff out. \n\nI've also seen that CVS is now carrying Nip + Fab products. The questions I've seen here concern their pads, which is not what I'm interested in. Anybody here use the serum or scrub? I highly doubt I'll buy anything, but I'm curious to see if it isn't just a junk line. \n\nAs for the Neutrogena, I picked it up because I can never really find any AHA's around here, and I'm not interested in ordering from Paula's Choice. At $7, I figured I could give it a try. So far, I've used it about 4 times, and my skin doesn't seem to mind it. Maybe a little drying, but that could also just be my skin throwing a fit over the recent weather change. Any thoughts on it? I know it doesn't reduce the size of pores; that isn't what I'm interested in. Personally, I wouldn't recommend it to people whose skin is sensitive to fragrance, but mine is never affected by fragrances.\n\n\nIngredients:\n\nAqua Glycolic: \n>Water Purified, SD Alcohol 40B, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Eucalyptus Oil, FD&C Green 3\n\nNip+ Fab Glycolic Fix Serum:\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol, Limonene, Parfum (Fragrance), Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA, Benzyl Benzoate, Pistacia Lentiscus (Mastic) Gum, Lecithin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Geraniol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citral, Linalool, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract\n\nNip + Fab Glycolic Fix Scrub: \n>Aqua (Water), Triethanolamine, Polyethylene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycolic Acid, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Xanthan Gum, Limonene, Parfum (Fragrance), Disodium EDTA, Salicylic Acid, Benzyl Benzoate, Trideceth-6, Dehydroacetic Acid, Geraniol, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citral, Linalool, CI 42090 (Blue No. 1)\n\nNeutrogena: \n>water, sodium laureth sulfate, glycerin, cocamidopropyl betaine, methyl gluceth-20, PEG-7 glyceryl cocoate, PEG-80 sorbitan laurate, PEG-120 methyl glucose dioleate, salicylic acid, sodium chloride, benzyl alcohol, glycolic acid, fragrance, sodium hydroxide, polyquaternium-10, BHT, benzophenone-4, polyquaternium-7, ext. violet 2, blue 1",

Your hair is wavy so if you wanted to go CG method you could. I put both of these in and the shampoo is approved with caution (meaning some ingredients might not work for everyone but if it works for you keep using it) and the conditioner was not approved based on the inclusion of Isododecane which is not a silicone but it is insoluble in water and can act as one in the sense that it can prevent your hair from getting “real” moisture.\n\nOverall that being the only unapproved ingredient tells me these are probably alright to be using and shouldn’t damage your hair or dry it out. If you notice any product buildup or your roots being more oily than normal you can use a clarifying treatment and if your hair seems like it’s still not getting moisturized from the shaft down you could try getting a deep conditioning mask to do once or twice a week. If all else fails you could just switch to a new shampoo and conditioner after you use these up.",

I want to understand why so I can avoid that happening again when I get new CG approved products.\n\nShampoo disaster- In August 2019 I unintentionally tried a CG approved shampoo according to isitcg: Soapbox Coconut Oil Shampoo (see ingredients  below). The first two times were okay, but every time since then my hair has a terrible reaction. It makes my hair ridiculously tangled and matted, almost gummy? Yet simultaneously dry as straw at the bottom? No amount of conditioner helps. It makes it terribly difficult to brush/comb and consequently I lose a bunch of hair. \n\nWhy might this have happened? It is very confusing and makes me very nervous to switch to a CG shampoo, despite the non-CG one I am currently using causing some other smaller issues.  \n\nSomeone else suggested maybe my hair doesn’t like coconut oil, but I’ve always used products with it since 2012. They also said it sounds like protein overload, which it does sound like that, but the Soapbox shampoo does not have protein as far as I can tell...?  \n\nFor context, I think I have 2A-2B wavy hair that has low porosity at the top and maybe medium at the bottom. I have very thick, fine hair that gets very frizzy in humidity. Where I live has 90% humidity most of the time. It basically doesn’t grow beyond my shoulders and just breaks off. It’s very prone to oil and grease at the top, but always dry at the bottom. Products cause nasty build up at the top, and sometimes are absorbed a little at the bottom and it is gross.

I experienced these same bumps several years ago with the LUS line (I loved what it did to my hair, but couldn't deal with the bumps!).  These are both supposed to be very ingredient-friendly lines, so I'm trying to compare and figure out what I apparently reacting to.  I analyzed the ingredient lists from both brands' conditioners and found the following matching ingredients (see below).  I also ran the ingredients through CosDNA to see if anything dinged as a problem.\n\nNothing I'm doing is healing these bumps (other than time I guess).  I've tried tea tree, clay masks, anti-fungal shampoo, neosporin.  They don't pop like pimples.  \n\nI cut everything out the last week, and last night I added in the Zotos conditioner only to try to narrow down the issue and I have a couple new sore bumps on my scalp.\n\nClearly I have to avoid one (or several) of these ingredients, but I need help narrowing it down and seeing if anyone else has had experience with this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nZotos Daily Conditioner:\n\nWATER/AQUA/EAU, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, ISOAMYL LAURATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, GLYCERIN, GLYCERYL STEARATE SE, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) OIL, HONEY/MEL/MIEL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII (SHEA) BUTTER EXTRACT, HYDROLYZED SOY PROTEIN, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND) FRUIT EXTRACT, SCLEROCARYA BIRREA SEED OIL, GLYCINE SOJA (SOYBEAN) OIL, PHENOXYETHANOL, POLYQUATERNIUM-67, GLYCERYL LAURATE, SODIUM GLUCONATE, CITRIC ACID, LECITHIN, ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL, LIMONENE, COUMARIN, LINALOOL, ALPHA-ISOMETHYL IONONE, FRAGRANCE/PARFUM.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLUS Conditioner:\n\n Aqua/Water/Eau, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Glycerin, Cetrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-11, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Polyquaternium-7, Polyquaternium-37, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance/Parfum. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShared ingredients from both products:\n\nCETEARYL ALCOHOL, glycerin, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII (SHEA) BUTTER EXTRACT, PHENOXYETHANOL, Citric Acid",

I do notice that both products have fragrance which can irritate the skin and cause reactions, so fragrance sensitivity or allergy is a possibility. Phenoxyethanol is a preservative that can cause skin irritation or allergies in some people, but it’s likely in other products you use as well. If you have skincare with it and don’t have that issue, I would rule this out as a culprit. It’s very common and wouldn’t be in a very high concentration based on the ingredient list. Same with citric acid, I don’t think that’s it. It’s a ph adjustor in a very small concentration.",

If you do this, is this then still considered nopoo with all its beneficial effects?\n\nI struggle with thin hair that get oily really quick (after 1-2 days) after washing. \n\nWhat is the best natural shampoo alternative to use 1-2 times a week?\n\nThank you already for helping out!!! \n\n&#x200B;",

Cleansing oils are oils with emulsifiers in it - they have oily texture at first and once you apply water they turn milky and wash off without leaving a residue. \n\n  \nThis seems to be a regular cleanser with oils in it  - that will make it more suitable and less drying for sensitive skin. Bioderma and Eucerin have same kind of products. One of the comments [here](https://www.hebe.com/cz/dermedic-cistici-olej-na-oblicej--200-ml-000000000000307015.html) says that it has more of a gel texture.

This product is not from the US but it is quite popular in my country and it’s sold in supermarkets, but a phenomenon I’ve seen (per social media and in myself) across many people it is this gel no matter how you prepare your hair before, wether is clarifying or not, using a leave in before or not the result it’s the same: flakiness a couple of days later after using the product, not even the same day of use. Also I had a heavy sense of build up the two times I have used it, I guessed it was because of the amount of oils it has in the ingredients, I thought it wouldn’t be a big deal since they all are after the preservative (guess I was wrong). It has a strong fragrance like men’s perfume that goes away once it is dry. I only just used it two times and I wanted to give it a third try before not using it anymore.

My hair was so defined and I got an amazing cast. With a hard hold gel I can get some 3A curls. On a bad wash day with a jelly or medium-hold, it's only 2B/barely 2C. So I'm upset it didn't work for me. \n\nThe next day my hair was a dry ratty mess. It was so frizzy, tangled, and knotty. And detangling in the shower with conditioner was just awful, I could barely get the brush through it even with lots of conditioner. I was trying not to rip my hair out. My hair felt terrible. \n\nMy hair is fine and high porosity because it's been balayaged, so the roots are virgin but the lengths are blonde. \n\nI really want this product to work for me!  One thing I will note is that I did not shampoo it out with a clarifying shampoo, I used the Curlsmith purple protein one (can't remember the name). Maybe that was not cleansing enough to get the gel out? I tried using the gel with the Curlsmith protein curl cream, then tried again with the weightless leave in air dry cream. \n\n  \nAny suggestions as to why this didn't work for my hair or how to make it work? I'll post the ingredients below: \n\n  \nAqua/Water/Eau, Polyquaternium-11, Polyquaternium-37, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, PPG-3 Benzyl Ether Myristate, PVP, Isoceteth-20, Polyquaternium-7, Hydroxypropyl Bis-Hydroxyethyldimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Parfum/Fragrance, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil, Panthenol, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Sericin, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Benzyl Salicylate, Hydroxycitronellal, Limonene.",

In natural salon quality shampoo formulation, extracts and actives like polyquaternium-7, sodium PCA, baobab protein, witch hazel is added to the water phase before surfactants and superfatting agents are added. While in anti-dandruff shampoo formulation, active zinc pyrithione is added in the cool down phase after surfactants and superfatting agents are added.WHY?           Is it because natural salon quality shampoo is a cold-process formula and the order of the actives/extracts and surfactants/superfatting agents do not matter much? If the natural shampoo is to be made with a hot process formula by adding few pasty and powdery surfactants, will extracts/actives be added in the cool down phase or water phase?  Can zinc pyrithione also be added in the water phase before heating and mixing surfactants? What is the ideal stage to add extracts and actives in cold and hot processed formulations?\n2. In the the anti-dandruff shampoo formulation, what is the significance of adding glycerin with surfactants and superfatting agents in the heated phase? Isn’t it usually used as a dispersing agent for thickeners or as a humectant? Won’t it be ideal to dissolve van natural xgb(bentonite+xanthum) in it before adding both to the water phase and then mixing everything under high shear? Or can I chose not to add it with surfactants/superfatting agents but add it with zinc pyrithione in the cool down phase, will it give the same result and effect as the video?\n\nI'll be utterly grateful if someone can clarify these doubts of mine!

        "body": "When we make shampoos  (all cold process) the usual addition process is :\n\n1. Water\n\n2. Surfactants (starting with the least soluble or most \"pasty\"), slow mixing to reduce air induction..\n\n3. \"Mouse Milk\" - those bits and pieces used for marketing claims\n\n4.  Humectants / Conditioning agents / etc\n\n5.  pH adjust (gross) \n\n6. Preservatives / colours / fragrances\n\n7.  pH adjust (fine)\n\n8, Viscosity adjust (usually salt thickening or trace surfactant)\n\nThere may be reasons to vary this process however depending on the actives/ingredients involved - for example, we rarely use gelling agents for viscosity adjustment (xanthan gum tends to be \"slimy\", carbopols don't react well with high ionic loads and HPMC is, generally, too expensive) so our formulations are designed to be either salt thickenable or self thickening. In the example shown in the video the bentonite/Xanthan blend ( I suspect the bentonite may be a laminar thickening agent - similar to the laponites) requires hydration prior to the addition of surfactants and, unlike \"pure\" xanthan (which you would premix with glycerine and simply high speed disperse) the glycerine may interfere with the bentonite hydration. (Personally, I'd find a better thickener). I also think that the final viscosity looks too thin.\n\nSome actives are heat sensitive, so would only be added into the cold phase. or only in cold process.  ZP may be one of these, but I suspect the real reason is to ensure that the viscosity modifiers are sufficiently \"set\" to ensure the ZP is protected from dropping out (separation over time). The bentonites create a somewhat thixotropic gel (similar to paint formulations) where high density, particulate additives are \"held up\" in the mix rather than settling out.\n\nOnce again, withe the \"natural\" \"salon quality\" shampoo - final viscosity looks too low and no formulation chemist would add / mix the way they did. Every transfer of material left something in the bowl (you don't do that in industry - every bit costs money!) and would throw out either the level of active or the final physical attributes of the product. We would measure everything directly into the final mix - and if we had to \"pre-build\" phases would weigh-in to ensure the formulation was accurate.",

I haven't dyed my hair since high school, and almost never use products or a hair dryer.\n\nFor the last 3-4 weeks or so, I've been using Cake's \"The Posh Wash\" shampoo and conditioner set every 1-3 days, which I liked initially because it did seem to help me go longer between washes (hair gets greasy quite fast). But in the last week or so, I started noticing that my hair that collected in the drain was an unfamiliar light brown. I also noticed that in certain lights, my hair on my head did indeed look lighter or duller in color. Some highlights almost looked gray or white until I looked closer!\n\nI heard that citric acids can in fact lighten hair in certain quantities, but I'm not sure I can entirely blame this Cake shampoo for my lighter hair, since I'm also getting older and my hair might have just gotten lighter right under my nose in recent years (my mom probably would blame my dad's European genes). And I couldn't find any reviews for Cake that mentioned lightening...\n\n**Tl;dr Could this shampoo with citric acid have permanently lightened my hair over the course of a month's near-daily use, or am I more likely just getting older/going crazy?**\n\nHere's the ingredients list for the Cake shampoo I was using. Citric acid is pretty far down there:\n\n>Water/Aqua/Eau, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Acrylates Copolymer, Glycerin, Peg-4 Rapeseedamide, Glycol Distearate, Polyquaternium-7, Amodimethicone, Parfum (Fragrance), Acetum/ Vinegar/Vinaigre, Polyquaternium-10, Polyquaternium-55, Moringa Oleifera Seed Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, ***Citric Acid***, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Glycolate, Dimethylaminopropylamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Benzyl Benzoate, Limonene, Eugenol.\n\nMore info at its Ulta page: [https://www.ulta.com/posh-wash-sulfate-free-swirl-shampoo?productId=pimprod2013508](https://www.ulta.com/posh-wash-sulfate-free-swirl-shampoo?productId=pimprod2013508)\n\nThanks for any advice!!",

This product is not from the US but it is quite popular in my country and it’s sold in supermarkets, but a phenomenon I’ve seen (per social media and in myself) across many people it is this gel no matter how you prepare your hair before, wether is clarifying or not, using a leave in before or not the result it’s the same: flakiness a couple of days later after using the product, not even the same day of use. Also I had a heavy sense of build up the two times I have used it, I guessed it was because of the amount of oils it has in the ingredients, I thought it wouldn’t be a big deal since they all are after the preservative (guess I was wrong). It has a strong fragrance like men’s perfume that goes away once it is dry. I only just used it two times and I wanted to give it a third try before not using it anymore. I will leave the ingredientes down below: \n\ndemineralized water, hydroxyethylcellulose, glycerin, polyquaternium-7, yodopropynyl butylcarbamate, Cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) extract, Prunus amigdalus dulcis (sweet almond) extract, Argania spinosa kernel (Argan) oil, Prunus amigdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, Persea gratissima (avocado) oil, Ricinnus communis (castor) oil, olea europaea fruit (olive) oil, Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) oil, fragrance \n\n",

        "body": "Haircare isn't my area of expertise, but from what I know about those ingredients there isn't really anything that jumps out as being a cause for flakiness.\n\nWhat I see in the ingredients is water, a thickener which makes the gel a gel and is bog standard for this application, glycerin as a plasticizer probably, or to help disperse the hydroxyethylcellulose in water, a conditioning quat, a preservative (though one i'm not familiar with, a bunch of random but vaguely trendy for hair plant oils, and fragrance.\n\nIs the gel marketed as being extremely strong hold? Or is it very thick? I ask because one way I could see flakiness happen is the gel forming a cast around the hair and the flakes are bits of that cast breaking off. All gels do this to some extent (and it's a property that some haircare routines like CGM rely on), but maybe this one's a bit extra about it? I can't tell just from the ingredients list so I'm purely speculating here, but it's one guess I can offer.",

It contains salicylic acid but it’s in the middle of the ingredients list so it might’ve been a low amount. The box cautioned me to keep it away from my eyes, so that’s what I did. I applied it on my face but kept it far away from my eyes, when I washed my face I kept my eyes shut tight and didn’t get any soap in there. After 2 days my eyes felt really dry and uncomfortable. My vision’s fine but my eyes are still dry and I can’t make it moist no matter how much I blink and how much water I drink. I stopped using it yesterday but the dryness is still the same. If you did have dry eyes, how long did it take for you to recover and what did you do to alleviate it?\nEdit: if anyone wants to see the ingredients list to see what could be causing my dry eyes, here it is: \n\nWater, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Lauryl Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Citric Acid, Peg-60 Glyceryl Isostearate, Sodium Chloride, Glyceryl Stearate Se, Coco-Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Phytate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-7, 1,2-Hexanediol, Quillaja Saponaria Bark Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Ceramide Np, Ceramide Eop, Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide Ap, Centella Asiatica Extract, Niacinamide, Ceramide As, Panthenol, Ceramide Ns, Salicylic Acid, Arginine, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Tocopherol, Stearic Acid, Ascorbic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine",

Bạn có thể dùng tẩy da chết vật lý chứa các chứa các hạt scrub siêu nhỏ để khi massage trên da sẽ cuốn theo lớp sừng và da chết đi ra. Hoặc có thể dùng sản phẩm tẩy tế bào chết hóa học  có nồng độ axit nhẹ rồi từ từ nâng dần lên, với sản phẩm tẩy tế bào chết có BHA nên sử dụng nồng độ 1-2%, sau 1-2 tháng nâng lên 4%, còn với AHA nên sử dụng từ nồng độ 3-5% sau nâng lên 7-10%\n\nBước 4: Đắp mặt nạ đất sét/ than hoạt tính\n\nĐắp mặt nạ đất sét không chỉ giúp làm sạch sâu bên trong lỗ chân lông mà còn giúp loại bỏ dầu thừa, bụi bẩn trên da đem lại hiệu quả trị mụn tốt hơn. Cách thực hiện vô cùng đơn giản, chỉ cần đắp mặt nạ 1 lớp mỏng trên da và giữ trong vòng 15-20 phút sau đó rửa sạch lại bằng nước ấm.\n\nBước 5: Nặn mụn\n\nSau khi đắp mặt nạ khoảng 10 phút, lỗ chân lông đã được làm sạch và mở rộng hơn giúp dễ dàng tiến hành bước nặn mụn. Bạn hãy rửa sạch tay sau đó sử dụng cây nặn mụn đã được khử trùng sau đó dùng lực quét cây nặn mụn nhẹ nhàng trên da để loại bỏ nhân mụn.\n\nBước 6: Đắp mặt nạ phục hồi\n\nSau khi nặn mụn đầu đen, làn da của bạn bị tác động và trở nên nhạy cảm, vì thế bạn cần được đắp mặt nạ để làm dịu da, chống viêm và giảm thâm sau nặn mụn. Có thể sử dụng mặt nạ giấy, mặt nạ sủi bọt, mặt nạ gel,…\n\nBước 7: Sử dụng Toner/ Serum và Kem dưỡng\n\nVới các bạn da khô, sau khi đã nặn mụn và đắp mặt nạ, bạn có thể tiến hành cả 3 bước dưỡng da tiếp theo: dùng toner, serum và kem dưỡng\n\nVới các bạn có làn da dầu: Sau khi đắp mặt nạ nên chọn 1 trong 3 bước dưỡng da trên để tạo lớp bảo vệ, giúp da mau lành vết thương sau nặn mụn\n\nƯu tiên các sản phẩm không có hương liệu, không cồn, kết cấu mỏng nhẹ và chứa ít gốc dầu gây bít tắc da\n\nBước 8: Chấm mụn\n\nNếu là người mới bắt đầu sử dụng các sản phẩm chấm mụn, bạn nên sử dụng các dòng sản phẩm có chứa hoạt chất Benzyl Peroxide 2 – 5% hoặc Adapalene. Sau một khoảng thời gian, khi đã quen với các hoạt chất này có thể đổi sang sử dụng Retinol-A hoặc Teetrea oil. Tuy nhiên, Benzyl Peroxide 2 – 5% và Adapalene vẫn là 2 hợp chất được các chuyên gia da liễu khuyên nên sử dụng.\n\nBước 9: Dùng kem chống nắng\n\nSau các bước chăm sóc trên đừng quên thoa kem chống nắng trước khi ra ngoài vào ban ngày nhé! Kem chống nắng sẽ giúp bảo vệ làn da, giúp các dưỡng chất được hấp thụ hoàn toàn mà không bị mất đi, đem lại hiệu quả tốt nhất.\n\n# Một Số Lưu Ý Trong Quá Trình Chăm Sóc Da Mụn Đầu Đen, Lỗ Chân Lông To\n\nGiữ da luôn sạch và thông thoáng\n\nHạn chế sử dụng những đồ uống có cồn, caffeine và các chất kích thích,…\n\nBỏ các thói quen xấu: sờ tay lên mặt, nặn mụn khi chưa sát trùng tay,…\n\nKiểm soát lượng bã nhờn trên da bằng cách: uống đủ nước, ngủ đủ giấc và dùng giấy thấm dầu thường xuyên\n\nBảo vệ da tránh các tác nhân từ bên ngoài: dùng kem chống nắng, đeo khẩu trang\n\nBổ sung dưỡng chất cho da: Vitamin C, A, B3,..\n\nCó thể đến spa nặn mụn theo chu kì 3 – 7 ngày/ lần\n\n Không lạm dụng các biện pháp lột mụn vì sẽ khiến lỗ chân lông to và dễ tổn thương hơn\n\nTại Sao Da Dầu Thường Gặp Trình Trạng Bị Mụn Và Lỗ Chân Lông To\n\n# Nguyên Nhân Da Dầu Thường Bị Lỗ Chân Lông To\n\nNhững người có làn da dầu, da nhờn thường có lỗ chân lông to hơn những người có làn da khô và da thường. Nguyên nhân là do bã nhờn và dầu trên da quá nhiều khiến bụi bẩn dễ dàng bám dính lại, các chất này có tích tụ trên da khiến lỗ chân lông càng ngày càng nở ra, thậm chí gây nên mụn trứng cá. \n\nHậu quả là, sau khi nặn mụn, vùng da bị kéo dãn đó không hồi phục về hiện trạng ban đầu, lỗ chân lông trở nên to và rõ hơn, hình thành sẹo rỗ.\n\n# Nguyên Nhân Da Dầu Thường Bị Mụn Đầu Đen\n\nDa dầu có tuyến mồ hôi hoạt động cực kỳ mạnh mẽ. Chính vì vậy cũng là nguyên nhân hình thành mụn đầu đen. Cơ chế hình thành mụn đầu đen là do tuyến dầu trên da hoạt động mạnh như không thể thoát ra khỏi bề mặt da do lỗ chân lông bị bít tắc bởi bụi bẩn, tế bào chết hay sản phẩm trang điểm và vi khuẩn. Khi các nốt mụn trong lỗ chân lông tiếp xúc với không khí sẽ bị oxy hóa và nhân mụn chuyển sang màu đen sậm.\n\n**Nguồn bài viết gốc:** [Review 10 Loại Sữa Rửa Mặt Trị Mụn Đầu Đen Cực Kì Hiệu Quả](https://odayreview.com/sua-rua-mat-tri-mun-dau-den/)",

    "body": "If you’ve ever tried deciphering a skincare ingredient list and felt like you needed a PhD in chemistry, you’re not alone. Words like methylisothiazolinone and polyquaternium-7 sound less like skincare and more like a villain’s evil plan in a sci-fi movie. Yet, for decades, these tongue-twisting chemicals have made their way into our everyday products, leaving consumers clueless about what they're slathering onto their skin.\n\nBut times are changing. Transparency in skincare is no longer just a trend; it’s a revolution. And at the forefront of this movement is OM Botanical, a high-performance plant-based skincare brand that doesn’t believe in playing hide-and-seek with ingredients. Let’s dive deep into why ingredient transparency matters, how to spot the good, the bad, and the greenwashed, and how OM Botanical is setting a gold standard for clean beauty.\n\n# Why Ingredient Transparency in Skincare is a Big Deal\n\n# 1. Your Skin is Not a Hazmat Suit\n\nYour skin, the largest organ of your body, absorbs a significant amount of what you apply to it. If you wouldn’t drink formaldehyde, why should you rub it into your pores? The scary reality is that most mainstream skincare products still contain harmful chemicals like parabens, sulfates, phthalates, and synthetic fragrances—ingredients linked to allergies, hormonal disruptions, and even cancer.\n\nBrands that embrace ingredient transparency empower consumers to make informed choices, ensuring that what goes ON their skin isn’t slowly sabotaging their health. The current epidemic of endocrinal disorders affecting women in this country can at least be partly attributed to beauty products filled with toxic ingredients. \n\n# 2. Greenwashing is a Dirty Game\n\nJust because a product has the word “natural” or “organic” on the label doesn’t mean it’s actually clean. The beauty industry loves to sprinkle in a few botanical-sounding words to make a product seem safer than it actually is. This practice, known as greenwashing, misleads well-meaning consumers into thinking they’re making healthier choices. Spoiler alert: If you see “fragrance” or “parfum” on the label, there could be hundreds of undisclosed synthetic chemicals lurking in that one innocent-looking word. Always, check the entire ingredient list and not just the few select ingredients highlighted on the website or the product packaging. \n\nHave you ever wondered why a skincare product claiming to be natural and organic is still white in color, when most plants and herbs are not white? A truly natural and organic skincare cannot be white.\n\n# 3. Knowledge is Power (And Profit for Ethical Brands)\n\nThe rise of conscious consumerism means that more people are demanding full disclosure about what’s in their products. Brands that prioritize transparency are gaining loyal customers, while those still hiding behind vague labels are losing trust faster than a sketchy online date. People want to buy from companies that align with their values—businesses that care about both people and the planet.\n\n# How to Spot True Ingredient Transparency\n\n# 1. Full Disclosure on Labels and Websites\n\nThe first rule of an honest skincare brand? No ingredient secrets. If a company refuses to disclose its full ingredient list or hides behind couple of highlighted ingredients, it’s a red flag bigger than the one you ignored before that bad haircut decision. And disclosure shouldn’t just stop at the tiny text on the outer packaging that most people discard —brands should also list full ingredients on their website so consumers can easily access this information before making a purchase, and on product jars/bottles.\n\n# 2. Ingredient Names You Can Actually Pronounce\n\nWhile not every natural ingredient has an easy-to-read name (looking at you, Butyrospermum Parkii—aka shea butter), a transparent brand will provide explanations. Ethical brands even list both the scientific name and the common name for clarity.\n\n# 3. Ingredient Education\n\nThe best brands don’t just list ingredients; they educate their customers on why they use them. If a company has an [ingredient glossary](https://ombotanical.com/pages/ingredient-glossary), blog posts, or detailed explanations on their website, that’s a sign they have nothing to hide.\n\n# OM Botanical: A Beacon of Ingredient Transparency in Skincare\n\n# 1. 100% Plant-Based, Full Disclosure Formulas\n\nOM Botanical is not just another brand jumping on the “clean beauty” bandwagon. They’ve been committed to 100% plant-based, non-toxic skincare since day one. Every single ingredient is clearly listed, with no sneaky hidden chemicals lurking in fine print. And they go beyond just labeling their products—they make sure their full ingredient lists are available on their website, so customers can research and verify before they buy.\n\n# 2. Safe Enough to Eat! - No Synthetic Junk, Ever\n\nNo parabens, no sulfates, no artificial fragrances or petrochemicals—just pure botanical goodness. Unlike brands that claim to be “natural” but still sneak in questionable preservatives, OM Botanical sticks to ingredients that nourish and heal, rather than harm. Our belief: if the product is not safe enough to eat, it's also not safe to slather on your skin.\n\n# 3. Transparency Beyond Ingredients\n\nIt’s not just about what’s in their products—it’s about how they’re made. OM Botanical is committed to ethical sourcing, sustainable packaging, and cruelty-free practices. Their dedication to both environmental and personal health is why they’ve built such a loyal following.\n\n# 4. Skincare Education for Everyone\n\nOM Botanical doesn’t just want to sell you products; they want to empower you with knowledge. Their website and social media are packed with science-backed insights on skincare ingredients, helping consumers cut through the marketing noise and make informed choices.\n\n# Common Ingredients to Avoid (And What OM Botanical Uses Instead)\n\n||\n||\n|Harmful Ingredient|Why It’s Bad|OM Botanical Alternative|\n|Parabens|Linked to hormonal disruptions|Natural plant-based preservatives|\n|Sulfates (SLS, SLES)|Strips skin of natural oils, causes irritation|Soap nut & coconut-based surfactants|\n|Synthetic Fragrances| Contain thousands of undisclosed chemicals|Essential oils & plant extracts|\n|Phthalates|Associated with reproductive issues|Zero phthalates—only natural stabilizers|\n|Formaldehyde|A known carcinogen|No formaldehyde, no exceptions|\n\n# The Future of Skincare: Demand Transparency\n\nIf there’s one takeaway from this, it’s that skincare should be as honest as your best friend after three margaritas—no lies, no secrets, just the raw truth. The shift towards ingredient transparency is growing stronger, and brands that refuse to adapt will soon find themselves left behind.\n\nWith companies like OM Botanical leading the way, consumers no longer have to choose between effectiveness and safety. Clean, [ethical skincare](https://ombotanical.com/pages/about-us) is not a luxury—it’s a necessity. And as more people demand transparency, the industry will have no choice but to follow suit.\n\nSo, the next time you pick up a skincare product, flip it over. Read the ingredients. Ask questions. Check the brand’s website. And most importantly, support brands that tell you the whole story—not just the parts they want you to hear.\n\nBecause when it comes to your skin, you deserve nothing less than the truth. The whole truth.",

If you don't find it drying, then that's not an issue.\n\nHowever because it's not intended to be used on the face or hair, I'd be concerned that they may have used something in it that could potentially cause irritation on the face or cause issues if it got in your eyes or ears.  A hand wash is unlikely to get in your eyes or ears so the safety requirements and the toxicologists who determine what the safe levels of each ingredient should be in the product aren't taking that into account.\n\nAdditionally, I notice that it has Methylisothiazolinone and Methylchloroisothiazolinone.  These ingredients are common allergens and have been shown to sensitize people to them, i.e. cause people to be allergic to them with frequent use.  That's no fun if you become allergic to these ingredients, as they're used in a lot of different products as preservatives.  So for that reason, I would avoid using it on any part of the body.",
