Please visit the new version:** https://www.reddit.com/r/VeganBeauty/comments/ru1k4g/bland_fragrancefree_nonirritating_moisturizer/ \n\nDo you need to replace your beloved CeraVe moisturizer to veganize your routine? Is your skin so sensitive, it turns red just *thinking* about a new cleanser? Your moisture barrier is shot and you're dreading spring hayfever?\n\nI'm here to help, thanks to far too many hours spent shopping for products that my skin will tolerate.\n\nEvery product here is:\n\n* Vegan\n* Cruelty-free\n* Completely fragrance-free: no masking fragrances, \"natural\" fragrances, or essential oils\n* Free of irritating and sensitizing plant oils like lavender, thyme, citrus, and eucalyptus\n* Ragweed allergy safe: free of chamomile, feverfew, echinacea, calendula, and other ragweed flowers\n* Retinol-free\n\n**Warning for the extremely ragweed sensitive:** Certain non-ragweed ingredients can cause cross-reactions in some people with ragweed allergies. These ingredients include sunflower oil, safflower oil, watermelon seed oil, and cucumber fruit extract. I noted the products that contain these ingredients. \n\n**Products may contain other allergens, such as soy and nuts. If you have any severe allergies, read all ingredient lists carefully! No product can be safe for every allergy!**\n\nFeedback and corrections are always welcome! Please let me know of any products I can add or anything on the list that has been discontinued.\n\n**Moisturizers without SPF**\n\n**Name** | **Packaging** | **ROUGH cost per oz in US** | **Notes**\n:- | :- | :- | :-\nSheaMoisture 100% Marula Oil & Shea Butter Body Lotion Fragrance Free | pump | $0.80 | contains sunflower oil\nATTITUDE Extra Gentle Daily Moisturizing Natural Body Lotion | pump | $1 | \nKiss My Face Olive & Aloe Fragrance Free 2n1 Deep Moisturizing Body Lotion | pump | $1 | \nDesert Essence Hand and Body Lotion, Fragrance Free | tube | $1 | contains sunflower oil\nOrganic Fiji Nourishing Lotion with Organic Coconut Oil Fragrance Free | pump | $1 | contains sunflower oil\nCloud Island Fragrance Free Baby Lotion | tube | $1 | Target store brand\nBambo Nature Snuggle Time Body Lotion | tube | $1.10 |\nCeramedx Restoring Body Lotion | pump | $1.25 | contains safflower and sunflower oil\nShiKai Borage Therapy Lotion (Original Formula, Advanced Formula, or Children’s Formula) | pump | $1-$1.25 | contains safflower oil\nEarth Science Multi-Therapy Hand, Body & Massage Lotion | tube | $1.25 | contains safflower oil\nACURE Everyday Eczema Lotion | tube | $1.50 | contains safflower and sunflower oils\nACURE Seriously Soothing 24hr Moisture Lotion | tube | $1.50 | contains safflower and sunflower oils\nPipette Baby Lotion | tube | $1.50 | \nYes to Avocado Fragrance-Free Daily Hand Cream | tube | $1.50 | \nDrunk Elephant Sili Body Lotion | pump | $2 | contains sunflower oil, banana extract\nPipette Baby Oil | bottle | $2 | contains sunflower lecithin\nThe Seaweed Bath Co.

He was using a system called the \"intense repair treatment\" which consists of shampoo, conditioner, and intense treatment spray. His hair is now growing back and he was ecstatic about his results. I was super skeptical trying products from Modern Nature but after 6 months my hair has never been healthier. I don't have breakage or lose as much hair plus it's grown 5inches. I know someone who can help with discounts for products so if you want to learn more reply to this post and I can get you in contact with her !!!!  \n\nTheir company just released a new sun screen- 30spf, reef safe, all vegan, is not heavy on the skin. I am obsessed with it. I also use their face wash and moisturizer which feel super light on the skin and have helped me with breakouts.

I know I have sensitive acne prone skin.  but it is often dry and flakey.  the only time I get oily is when I am wearing makeup, which I do very often. I think I might have hormonal acne, because I will break out with hard cystic acne a couple of weeks out of the month, then it will calm down after my monthly cycle ends.  \n\nother problems: I get very bad cystic acne deep in my skin. I usually only get these on my chin or around my mouth, but I have recently gotten a couple of the left side of face on my upper cheeks.  I have large pores the are constantly clogged.  I have these weird small bumps that look like they are filled with gunk but are hard to pop.  i also have clogged pore looking things that i can squeeze and a never ending noodle of puss will come out (sorry to be so gross im just trying to explain what i deal with) not to mention little white heads here and there.  but most the the problems are around my mouth/lips and on the apples of my cheeks/around my nose area\n\nwhat ive tried to do: first of all let me say i cant afford to go to a derm, but i am not opposed to seeing an esthetician if it is affordable.  i have been using aveeno clear complexion foaming face wash to wash my face, makeup removing cloths before i wash, then i use face moisturizer.  but i have just started using OCM with castor oil and avocado oil.  I have done A TON of research on this before i started so Im almost positive im doing it right BUT i got a HUGE HARD cyst on my chin the day after starting :(\n\nother products i may use:\nlush's celestial moisturizer,\nLUSH enchanted eye cream,\nolay day time moisturizer,\nwitch hazel (not often),\nst ives exfoliating pads (2x a week),\ni also don't use towels to dry my face i let it air dry and pat some of the water with my hands\n\ni have also used a couple of other products that i actually really like, but im not sure if they are doing my face any good, or actually may be causing some of my problems. i will list the product, how i use it, and the ingredients because they are lesser known:\n\nOSEA ADVANCED PROTECTION CREAM: I use this at night before bed after i wash my face, before i put moisturizer on...\nits supposed to even hyper pigmentation, fine lines, and stimulate collagen production:\nINGREDIENTS: aqua, algae extract*, dipalmitoyl, hydroxproline, coco caprylate/caprate, cetearyl glucoside, olive, glycerin*, aloe barbadensis leaf juice*, macadamia seed oil*, grape seed oil*, jojoba seed oil*, capryloyl glycin, vitamin E, avacodo oil*, chondrus crispus*, undecylenoyl glycin, glycine, calendula officinalis flower extract, anthemis nobilis flower extract*, potassium ascorbyl tocopheryl phosphate (natural vitamin C), citrus medicalimonum peel oil*, xanthan gum, sodium benzodate, potassium sorbate (*certified organic) ( 100% natural derived ingredients) \n\nOSEAS red algae mask: HG mask for me at the moment. when i have a cystic acne break out it soothes my face and helps ease the pain and i always feel like my acne is less inflamed and my skin has a slight glow after using this. i use this 1x a week but not every week...\nINGREDIENTS:  red algae gel extract, glycerin, corrective oil complex, cocoglucoside and coconut alcohol, sodium lauroyl oat amino acid, French red clay, frech pink clay, magnesium aluminum, silicate, cahadian willowbark extract, multifruit extract, sesame oil. jojoba oil, sodium magnesium aspartate, water lily extract, chamomile extract, red wine extract, lactic acid, vitamin e, calendula extract, greentea extract, grapefruit seed extract, xanthan gum, phenoxyetanol\n\ni also have a face lotion that i use on my infant son, and i was wondering if i could use it as a gentle face lotion:\nnatures baby face and body lotion:\ningredients:\norganic aloe barbadenis leaf juice, safflower seed oil, ethylhexyl palminate (from coconut), glycerl stearate, sorbitan olivate, shea butter, macadamia ternifolia seed oil, olive fruit oil, jojoba seed oil, glycerin, rosa centifolia flower water, natural vitamin E, cellulose gum, xanthan gum, organic comfrey extract, organic chamomilla matricaria flower extract, organic calendula flower extract, amino acid, amino acids, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, glycine, citric acid\n\n\n\nso that's it! any help/advice/words will be very appreciated !\n\nthanks for reading.

Based on the items you have in your collection, I'd say a month or two of saving will be sufficient to cover the costs. If you're THAT against it, stick with the OCM for at least six weeks before switching it up. \n\n-EDIT-\n\nAlso remove any foaming cleansers you have - they're not good for sensitive acne prone skin. They mess with the pH balance - you want your skin to be more acidic than base as that acid helps kill bacteria.",

It might be worth it to at least get a consultation with a derm (some do that for free), get some recommendations/samples, and then ask your GP to prescribe you things. I generally am pretty against recommending Accutane, but I think it's worth it for people who have that sort of painful, deep cystic acne, especially if it's causing you a lot of emotional distress. I have no idea if a GP can prescribe Accutane, though.\n\nI notice you said you have an infant son. Were you on any kind of birth control before you had him? Have you ever been on birth control? Cystic acne is frequently related to hormones. Can you see an OB/GYN? They would at least be able to talk to you about that, and if you are ok with going on birth control or other hormonal meds, that might help.\n\nI agree with what most other commenters are saying, though. Drop the multitude of heavily fragranced Lush products and start over from scratch with some gentle products like CeraVe and maybe some oils. Seeing an esthetician might be worth it just so someone can see your skin and guide you through treating it irl, but don't let anyone try to sell you miracle products.

It was time-consuming process and there were a lot of restrictions.  You had to have blood work done regularly before you could get your new prescription for the month and you had to call to \"certify\" in order to pick up your prescription, etc.  It's a very expensive process if you don't have insurance.  I think the medication alone (without insurance), was around $300 per month.  It was the only thing that worked for me.  I ended up going through two more courses of the treatment, each time a lower dose/shorter period of time.

Obviously when you see the derm, just reiterate that you don't have insurance and you would just like to work out the least expensive option at this point that will still be effective. The derm should be able to give you quite a few free samples as well :-) I know for me personally, nothing besides the medicine would have helped with my acne because it was hormone related (due to PCOS) so I needed the androgen blocker in spiro in order to clear it up. After the initial skin-freakout, which was a bitch, my skin cleared right up and I haven't had another breakout since. I still get pimples, but they are always small and not cysts. \n\nI no longer take the spiro because I don't feel that I need it, but my current routine includes the following:\n\n1. Cerave foaming cleanser wash stuff\n\n2. Cerave moisturizer in the tub\n\n3. Alpha hydrox oil-free formula (aha) - several times per week\n\n4. Epiduo (acne topical med prescribed by doctor) - several times per week\n\n5. Aztec clay mask, Queen Helene mint julep mask, and a few freeman's masks - 1-2 times per week\n\n6.

My skin has changed for the better by removing all processed food and sugar (this includes eating out), becoming gluten free, and removing all dairy products from my diet.

I also started taking more vitamins since I am vegan and it is hard to get all the necessary fatty acids and nutrients I was once getting from fish and meat. R-Lipoic Acid, EPA-DHA, evening primrose oil (great to help balance your hormones) and a multivitamin containing iron. I saw my skin change again in about 3 months. As far as OCM, I have been using sunflower oil which I read somewhere is good for acne prone/combination skin. \n\nNow, this might not work for you but it's important to look at all options when you're trying to clear up your skin. And drink lots of water, I mean TONS! It will make a big difference in your skin as well. And if you smoke, stop smoking! And please, stop picking! It only makes your acne worse in long run and your skin will end up scarred once it finally clears up. Good luck on your journey and don't give up! It will get better!",

    "body": "**Intro (copy and pasted from my original post, FYI)**  \nHi Everyone! I have recently taken it upon myself to purchase and review body oils from many many different indie brands. I originally was going to post this as one big post but I have gathered so many oils and have so many opinions on them that I think it's best to break it up a little bit into a few different posts as I go along. If there's any oils you want to see reviewed, please let me know and I will do my best to get my hands on some.  \n  \n**About my skin:** I have very dry, eczema prone skin. I have had psoriasis in the past but do not currently. I am sensitive on the inside of my elbows and behind my knees where the skin is thin.  \n  \n**What I like:** You will notice I prefer a bit of a thicker oil. I know this is not always everyones preference so I have also reviews some thinner oils. I try all the oils in the same way: Coating my body head to toe and sleeping with the oil on my skin. In the morning, my skin will either feel adequately moisturized or still a bit dry.  \n  \n**Cocoa Pink Dry Oil Body Spray (2oz = 5.25 USD, +/- 2.63/oz)**  \n(Naughty Gingerbread: Naughty begins with two of our bestselling fragrance oils specially formulated just for CocoaPink: Spiritueuse Double Vanilla and our exclusive triple amber blend that we call “CP Black”.  Then we added a dash of gingerbread and a splash of sugar.  Try not to lick this one off.)  \n**Ingredients:** Fractionated Coconut oil, Isoproyl Mystearate, Jojoba oil, Cyclomethicone, Fragrance.  \n  \n**Notes:**  \n**Formula:** This one is somewhere right in the middle. Feels heavier than Solstice Scents’ Burnishing Glacé and Alchemic Muse Body Gloss, but Lighter than Sucreabeille’s Body Oil and the other Cocoa Pink I reviewed [Here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/7blc22/indie_body_oil_review_bonanza_part_1_of_a_lot_of/). I like this one and feel like it might be my favourite one for the bath, I felt like I needed less of this in the bath than some of the other ones but my skin still feels soft after using it.   \n**Scent:** Oh my. Oh my freaking god. This is so good. I keep all of my body oils in a container on my desk beside my laptop. As I’ve been watching Netflix recently I will sometimes just sit there and smell this. It’s that good. I can’t be around it without opening it and smelling it. It’s a sweet gourmand, I would describe it as a “frosted gingerbread”. It’s more sweet than spicy but it’s still quite spicy. I’ve layered it with Solstice Scents Dark Ginger Spice Cake (which is much less sweet and more herbal). It’s possible I was meant to be born a gingerbread woman. After sleeping in this, in the morning the scent has barely faded!  \n  \n**Alchemic Muse (4oz = 12.00 USD, +/- 3.00 USD/oz)**  \nBody Gloss (Vanilla Oak: Flighty top notes of bergamot, camphor, cassia root lead to a heart of smoky vanilla-tobacco and warm spice grounded with aged oak, soft amber, and frankincense)  \n  \n**Ingredients:** Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Fractionated Coconut Oil), Cyclomethicone, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Oil, Olive Squalane, Cymbidium Grandiflorum (Orchid) Flower Extract, Fragrance  \n  \n**Notes:**\n**Formula:** This is another lighter one. I expected something a bit different, being that it’s called Body Gloss, I thought it would give you a bit of a glossy, coated feeling but actually of the oils I’ve tried so far this one sinks in the fastest. Definitely would be ok to use in the morning before getting dressed. This one also is nice as a bath oil and I feel like it really absorbs nicely, when you get out of the bath you can tell you don’t necessarily need to apply lotion.  \n**Scent:** This is not at all what I was expecting but the scent is really nice. I don’t get any of the top notes (not that I know what Camphor or Cassia root really smell like). It’s mainly a Sweet Vanilla with some woods, but I would not say it’s very deep or very sweet. I think a ton of people would like this scent, it’s just nice. I also get the impression that I’ve smelled this scent somewhere before but I can’t put my finger on it.   \n  \n**Queen Bee Apothecary Dry Oil Body Mist (1oz=6.00 USD)** \n (Femme Noir: a blend of bitter orange, vanilla, sandalwoods & ambers, rose & jasmine......but this is what it smells like to me.....an initial bold blast of tobacco, sweet and rich but spiced in a sultry way. It soon develops a delicious powdery femme quality and sweetens with vanilla. A pristine blend.)  \n  \n**Ingredients:** Cyclomethicone, Organic Coconut Oil, Fragrance  \n  \n**Notes:**  \n**Formula:** Another thinner one. This formula is similar to that of Solstice Scents, See my review [Here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/7blc22/indie_body_oil_review_bonanza_part_1_of_a_lot_of/), if anything it’s just a touch lighter. Again, not moisturizing enough for my personal taste but I will continue to use it as a bath oil.  \n**Scent:** This is quite a powdery scent on me, I don’t get any orange or rose. Mainly Sandalwood and Jasmine. Nice enough but I wouldn’t repurchase. I will say my mom is obsessed with this scent and she tends to like very deep,sweet patchouli scents (she’s big on Aromatics Elixir and Angel, so if those are your jam, this might be for you. Never got any orange here either, Am I an Orange black hole? I would never have known because I don’t gravitate towards citrus fragrances.   \n**Queen Bee Bath and Body Oil (2oz = 6.00 USD, +/-3.00 USD /oz)**  \n(Whiskey River: This whiskey scent is still made with the scent of pure, amber southern whiskey, but also has notes of mixed spice, walnut nuances, benzoin & oak. This does have a rich, boozy scent but a little lighter on the sweetness.)  \n  \n**Ingredients:** Soybean Oil, Safflower Seed Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Grape Seed Oil, PEG-40 Sorbitan Peroleate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance  \n  \n**Notes:**\n**Formula:** This is to date the thickest oil I’ve tried. I do like the formula despite it being thicker and taking quite a while to sink in (20-25 mins). My skin felt nice in the morning but it’s not the most moisturizing of the formulas I have tried. I haven’t tried this one in the bath yet, unfortunately.  \n**Scent:** I have truly never experienced anything like what I have experienced with this scent. Don’t even look at the notes, they mean nothing. When I opened the bottle upon it’s arrival, I smell unadulterated cherry cough syrup. It’s the weirdest thing. Sprayed out of the bottle, into my hand, I smell chocolate with a hint of cherry. Worked into the skin it’s literally just plain cinnamon stick. What?????\n  \nI think I only have 2 formulas left to review after this! Some Witch Baby and some Epically Epic! Again, if you have any questions feel free and if you have any recommendations I would love to hear those too :)\n",

    "body": "I, an American, know people who just came back from a Cuban trip and instead of bringing back any sort of gift/treat from such a unique island like normal human beings, they brought back... a trashcan. While this may come off as a rant, hopefully an educated comrade can disentangle or reign in some of these talking points. \n\n1. Chewing gum: Group flies in to one of the airports and distinctly noted what appeared to be soldiers (or TSA equivalent not sure) asking tourists for chewing gum because it doesn't seem to be available in Cuba. Instead of - again - just acting normal, the group was distraught and couldn't believe that these poor poor people didn't have chewing gum. Now, when they told this probably embellished tale to me, of course it needs to be worked into reaffirming the consumerism = freedom = free will talking point. Why? I don't recall any person in this group as having ever rushing to a store in desperate need for gum, but all of a sudden, it's an impenetrable pro-Capitalist argument. Nor do I think anyone in America has ever had a conversation about gum lasting more than like 2 seconds (\"Got gum?\"). See above, they didn't bring back a gift for me. I thought I was a pretty nice guy. \n\n2. Old cars: I was told that Cubans need to shell out USD $100k for a new car to become a taxi driver. That sucks and all, but I don't see that many people outright owning their cars here in the states either (lease/finance much). Because of the expensive cars in Cuba, the citizens are *forced* to rework old cars to drive around the island. Apparently only new = choice and a chance at a better life. Not to mention that I'm only ever told that buying used is the financially smart way to go about life here in America... Apparently \"buying used\" isn't okay in Cuba?\n\n3. Cooking oil: So I guess they saw some people standing in line for what I understood to be cooking oil. They couldn't stand seeing this line for such a basic commodity. As if I or any of them have never stood in any semblance of a queue or line in our lives in America. Just the other day I had to wait in the heat for gas at Costco for lord knows, like 30 minutes? I didn't have tourists staring at me crying for me or wanting to free me from these chains of the lines. They were also implying that Cubans had a set amount of oil they were allowed per month. I don't know about you comrades, but I never went to the store maniacally filling up my cart with gallons of cooking oil to make sure I can survive. How much does one family really need, like a liter or two per month? One person from this group does use like 8 different types of \"oil\" (avocado oil, safflower seed oil, etc. etc.) so maybe I'm missing out on tons of freedom. \n\nAnyways, thank you for your time comrades. If you have links that either debunk or have any of your own stories about Cuba or else, I'm all ears for the content.",

TRAFFIC. LIGHT.\n\nOn top of that, we are an agricultural powerhouse, our country alone occupies like, half of South America, and export foodstuffs.\n\nAnd yet people beg for food, and some are luck to manage to eat once a day.\n\nWorse, we are a tropical country, no strong winters, and homeless people die from... hypothermia.\n\nBelieve me, capitalism isn't the answer. Cuba may be an island, a tiny island in the midst of a hurricane corridor, and yet they manage to feed everyone, to educate everyone, to take care of the health of everyone.\n\nTo the point that Brazil alone literally asked Cuba for help to bring healthcare here, Cuba sent... 8.000 doctors. And this tiny island saved the lives of thousands here.\n\nWe do asked our capitalism-friendly countries, did they help? Of course not. They don't help even those who dies for them, fight for them. Colombia is just booting the soldiers who defected Maduro, ironic, isn't it?\n\nMy country would have done the same, anyway.\n\nAnd both Bolivia and Brazil are being hostile to Venezuela.\n\nDo you know any capitalist country that treat their veterans well? Here, those who fought in WWII were thrown in slums if they were poor.\n\nSuch is the way the \"markets\", the burgeoise, treat those who saved them.\n\nBrazil is trying to save the countless Venezuelans that try to enjoy the \"capitalist freedom\" and find themselves enslaved by Brazilians, be it at the agriculture, construction, even amusement parks enslaved Venezuelans.\n\nAnd how the average Brazilian reacted? \"They are spies, they are slaves (the Cuban doctor here earned, more money than 90% of the population, after the taxes discount, and this salary wasn't attractive to our own doctors, but they were slaves because Cuba collected about 70% of the payment as taxes), they can't speak our language and, HELL, they didn't have training\". Not to mention the racist slurs that I won't repeat here.\n\nTo be honest, I know it myself, the average Cuban doctor were far superior than the average Brazilian, not to mention their working ethics and dedication.\n\nWe do have lots of doctors, but guess what? They don't want to work to the poor, away from big cities. The private sector wouldn't set up shop at those places, as people are so poor that they wouldn't have the money to pay it.\n\nMarket forces, huh?\n\nAnd Cuba, a country that has been under embargo for 50 years, an island, inside a hurricane corridor, sent us thousands. Thousands. \n\nA socialist country.\n\nTo the people who portray Cuba as an horror history, tell them to take a look at Latin America as a whole. \n\nOr just take a stroll at downtown and ask if capitalism worked for the homeless and destitute.\n\nAs a Brazilian I'm proud of Cuba, they thrive where capitalism would fail for sure.\n\nIt's easy to compare the US, the main Imperialist countries, Swiss and Panama, countries that are backing heavens and hold the money of the corrupt and deserve our contempt.\n\nLet's see how they compare Cuba with capitalists in South America and Africa. Let's see how they justify it.\n\nEdit 1: when I said slavery I meant it. It's modern slavery, not \"just\" wage slavery.",

Not only does the embargo make it very difficult to get cars onto the island, Cuba is a poor country. You are right people fix old cars with whatever parts they can or buy cheap motorcycles from China. Transportation is a big problem they are working to improve but getting better. Bus tickets only costs 1 peso which is 0.05 USD and government just bought a lot of buses from China, shipped in parts and assembled in Cuba, cheap shitty bus but gets people around! taxi shares are v cheap for locals, but might have to wait a long time for one.\n\n3. Lines for cooking oil were probably lines for a bodega. Which is like a small shop where you get essentials. Not only is it incredibly cheap but Cubans get free oil, rice, beans and coffee every month from the bodegas. If you want more oil you can buy it. And if you don't want to wait you can go to the dollar store but it is much more expensive (probably still cheaper than in Puerto Rico tho)",

While they are not the exact products of Beauty of Joseon, some of the ingredients are similar but of course not exactly the same.  Some of the products are particularly popular in Korea at the moment because Hanbang and plant based?\n\n[KIcho Sheep Oil](http://beautyfaceskin123.blogspot.com/2016/07/review-on-kicho-sheep-oil-cream.html)\n-this product is free from T.E.A, artificial scents, mineral oil, isopropyl alcohol, paraben, urea, heavy metals and formaldehyde.   Since it is anti aging product and is for dry skin, it contains a lot of plants extract(8 types of berries), essential oil, beeswax, silicone, shea butter hyaluronic acid and oils(grapefruit,lemon, orange) Dimethicone is the second ingredients after water.   So, it can be clogging if you do not like those ingredients.  The moisture lasted whole day.  There are ceramide, lanolin, collagen and sea water. No butylene glycol. (press sample, no affiliate link)\n \n[Hansaeng Cosmetics RIN Bi-gyeol Soo Essence](http://beautyfaceskin123.blogspot.com/2016/07/review-on-hansaeng-cosmetics-rin-bi.html)\nThis is a hanbang skincare from Korea. Niacinamide is high on the list along with a lot of hanbang which include the famous ginseng ingredients(6 fermented years). It has floral scent to it. Texture is light and absorb well.  It has Triethanol amine  which some said it is dangerous but it is not a problem for me.  No paraben.( press sample ,no affiliate link)\n\n[Hansaeng Cosmetics RIN Bi-gyeol Soo Cream](http://beautyfaceskin123.blogspot.com/2016/07/review-on-hansaeng-cosmetics-rin-bi_28.html)\nIt has the same hanbang ingredients(fermented 6 years ginseng) in the cream with the same smell but with different kind of texture. It is pretty light and calming. The jar is of course luxurious and looks like a blue pearl. Niacinamide is lower than the essence but it is still high. No paraben but contains Triethanol amine  to adjust the ph.

Winters means dryness & cracked lips for me.\n\n[LIPPSSSSS](https://preview.redd.it/5phvc72etx661.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8a379572e84286d26fce0b36539b61233412ec8)\n\nThe prime way to fix dry lips is to increase your water intake. Lips are an extension of the throat and if you tend to often lick your lips subconsciously, it is your body's indication that it needs more water. Take my advice, I don't listen to it anyway. It is not easy to increase your water intake overnight. I struggle with drinking an adequate amount of water. A good lip product is my saviour from Sahara lips.\n\nI am ranking these lip products in order of preference.\n\n***1. Bakson's Sunny Lip Balm - ₹40***\n\nThank you @ for introducing me to this small wonder.\n\nDon't be misguided by the packaging. This lip balm is much more than your basic vaseline; It's the vaseline killer. This inexpensive lip balm provides the ideal balance of moisturisation, emollience and occlusiveness. The ingredient list is stellar. This lip balm does not just sit on my lips and lock moisture, but it also conditions my lips. It glides on my lips in a thin layer and you can immediately feel it emollize my lips. It keeps my lips hydrated for longer. I definitely need to reapply during the day but it provides immediate comfort to dry and cracked lips. Within 2-3 days of religious use, my lips are completely healed. This is the perfect lip balm to throw - in your bathroom, car, pocket, bag, and at your *'Sun yaar lip balm denaa?'* friends.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Petrolatum, Lanolin Anhydrous, Shea Butter, Souabran Glycerides, Bees Wax, Almond Oil, Vitamin E, Distillates of Aloe vera & Calendula, B.H.T., Sorbic Acid, Perfume.*\n\nAdditional tip: Lanolin makes for a great nipple balm. It is prescribed to pregnant & lactating mothers. If you suffer from dry nipples, you can use this lip balm to perk 'em up to life.\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WRP**\n\n***2. Unpa Bubi Bubi Lip Ampule - $6***\n\nIt would be on the top of my list had its competitor not been 1/10th of its price. Its name can certainly raise eyebrows, but this one packs a punch. I was pleasantly surprised by this random buy. The texture is like honey, but it is not at all sticky or goopy. It is very comfortable to apply during the day or at night. It goes on in a thin layer and adheres well to your lips. It does not just stay put and form an occlusive barrier, but a part of it descends into my lips and makes my lips moisturised & naturally plump. It helps deeply condition my lips, repairing flaky and dry skin. I had recently cut my lip, and this one helped to repair my lips overnight. I feel I do not need to reapply during the day, and it keeps my lips hydrated through the night as well. Love the tube packaging. A little goes a long way with this one, and it truly gives me baby lips. I want to repurchase this again.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Diisostearyl Malate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Castor Oil Isostearate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Microcrystalline Wax, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Dehydroacetic Acid, Ceramide NP, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Water, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hyaluronic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter*\n\n**Rating: 4.5/5, WRP**\n\n***3.  Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula - with SPF 15 - Dark Chocolate & Mint ₹130***\n\nThis lip balm has the perfect shape for a lip balm in a stick & the texture is like that of a stick of butter. It does not have the typically waxy feeling. It is highly emollient and moisturising. SPF is an added benefit as lips also need sun protection to protect from ageing, especially if you are heading outside in the sun. Perfect for throwing in your purse. The smell and flavour are surprisingly nice. Ideal for all mint chocolate lovers out there. Even though it has some chemical filters, it doesn't have an unpleasant smell or aftertaste. I feel the need to reapply during the day, but it is an enjoyable feeling due to flavour and scent. Overall I quite enjoyed this lip balm. I will repurchase.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Dimethicone 1.5%, Octinoxate 7.5%, Oxybenzone 4.5%. Inactive ingredients: mineral oil (paraffinum liquidum), microcrystalline wax (cera microcristallina ), copernicia cerifera (carnauba) wax, theobroma cacao (cocoa) seed butter, fragrance (parfum), tocopherol, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, isopropyl myristate, beta carotenex0003(CI 40800), zea mays (corn) oil, benzyl alcohol.*\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WRP**\n\n***4. The Body Shop Strawberry Lip Balm ₹250***\n\nThis used to be one of my favourite lip balms before I tried the ones above it. There is a theme here. This lip balm too adds emollience to your lips. The artificial strawberry flavour and the smell are intense and quite enjoyable in my 15-year-old brain. This lip balm has been intended for your partner to enjoy. I'm not too fond of the pot packaging, but there is enough product here to last you months. The flavours are interesting and mood uplifting. Overall it is a nice lip balm but I won't be repurchasing it because I can get something similar in a better packaging for 1/5th the price.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax, Lanolin, Parfum, Cera Alba, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Silica \\[NANO\\], Tocopheryl Acetate, Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Ammonium Glycyrrhizate, Aroma, Fragaria Vesca Fruit Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Benzoate, BHT, CI 15850, CI 15850.*\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WNRP**\n\n***5. Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask - Choco Mint ₹1150***\n\nThis popular pick used to be my holy grail lip mask two years ago. This innovative product was one of the first of its descent and ahead of its time. Its thick and goopy texture catches eyeballs. This is my second tub of this product, and if you have tried one of these you know, this lasts a lifetime. Sadly, this queen has been dethroned by Bubi Bubi Lip Ampule. I do not find myself reaching for it anymore. My relationship with this product was like a young romance. I went in starry-eyed and fell fast for the bling, but now I find myself looking for more material suitors. The texture of this is very thick & goopy, but my issue with the product is that it never truly sinks in. It stays sticky, thick and wet on your lips and once you remove it (because it won't sink in), your lips won't feel much different than when you first put it on. The feeling on your lips is not particularly pleasant. This is why you cannot use it in the day. It is a good sleeping mask for the night if you put something underneath it as works well for locking in moisture. If you are curious to try this, I recommend getting a smaller sample size as that would last you 6 months and be more pocket friendly. The mint flavour quite nice and not overpowering. The tingle is not intense. I will not be repurchasing this.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Diisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl/Isostearyl/Cetyl/Stearyl/Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax/Cera Microcristallina/Cire Microcristalline, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Synthetic Wax, Ethylene/Propylene/Styrene Copolymer, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Mica, Butylene/Ethylene/Styrene Copolymer, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax/Candelilla Cera Hydrocarbons/Cire De Candelilla, Candelilla Wax Esters, Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax/Copernicia Cerifera Cera/Cire De Carnauba, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Blue 1 Lake (Ci 42090), Limonene, Yellow 10 Lake (Ci 47005), Water/Aqua/Eau, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Linalool, Potassium Alginate, Glycerin, Propanediol, BHT, Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus Seed Extract, Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Disodium Edta, Ascorbyl Glucoside*\n\n***Rating: 3/5, WNRP***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***RiRe Bubble Bubble Mask: - Bubbling mask that does nothing.

One week in, I've got 2 deep cysts, a pus-filled something between my eyes, and more blackheads than I've seen in years (and they are HUGE!)  So yes, apparently I still need the BHA!\n\nThis morning I went through my routine, using PC Skin Recovery Toner, PC 2% BHA Lotion, PC Skin Recovery Hydrating Treatment Mask, and Vaseline over my entire face.  (I planned a day doing indoor spring cleaning, blackout curtains closed, so no makeup or sunscreen to throw things off!)\n\nThis evening, I slathered my face in my DIY Safflower Cleansing Oil (safflower seed oil and Cromolient SCE) then massaged all of my trouble zones.  And oh, the grit.  I finally know what you're talking about.  I've never had grit before (perhaps due to my daily BHA acting as a preventative?), but WOW.

I keep putting off making a post for these, but I needed to finally get rid of them!\n\nI've organized the empties into three groups - Yay, Nay, and Okay! Some of the Nay products aren't empty, but I decided I hated them so much I didn't want to waste days of my life using them. See the pictures [here](https://imgur.com/a/OM9wxCG) featuring my Causebox winter throw in the background! Sorry for the terrible lighting - my apartment has awful lighting once the sun goes down. \n\n**Yay** \n\n- **Pixi Skintreats Glow Mist** (Ipsy GBP July 2019): Pixi markets this as a lot of things - a skincare face mist, setting spray, even hair treatment! The two main ingredients in this are water and olive oil. For skincare, olive oil has been shown to possibly break down the moisture barrier with extended use - definitely not the best face oil! For a setting spray, it doesn't have any makeup preserving ingredients, but the water can help \"meld\" your makeup. I used this only as a hair refresher for my very curly hair and loved it for that purpose! My hair gets very dry between washes and this helped give it some some moisture and life to get me to my next wash. WRP\n- **Drunk Elephant Protini Polypeptide Cream** (Sephora Birthday Gift): This was a great moisturizer - fragrance free, hydrating without being greasy. WRP if it were like, a third of the price.\n- **Sol de Janiero Brazilian-4-Play Moisturizing Shower Cream Gel** (SDJ GWP): I just realized now that 4-Play is like foreplay?? Ok I guess this fits with the bum-bum cream thing... Anyways, this was nice. Moisturizing, has the signature smell. The smell doesn't linger but I kind of like that! WRP if it were on major sale.\n- **Curology Clean Sweep Cleanser** (Allure November 2019): I think this is the only cleanser I've tried that I like as much as my HG cleanser, LRP Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Cleanser! This too was hydrating and gentle and I think my skin really like it. I WRP but am not sure it's worth the extra cost over the LRP, and it looks like you can only purchase it with the curology personalized treatment.\n- **Benefit Gimme Brow in 3** (Ipsy September 2019 Add-On): I've tried this before and love it! WRP and have before!\n- **Illamasqua Eyeliner in Honor** (Ipsy January 2019): I used this every day for like, 9 months or so? It's not the easiest pencil to glide on, but oh the color was so great! A purple-ish brown that looked great on my hazel eyes. WRP\n- **NYX Eyeliner in Medium Brown** (just a purchase lol): Sometimes this is kind of hard to get pigment on my upper lash line, but it looks nice for everyday. WRP\n- **Peach & Lily Glass Skin Serum** (Ulta GWP): WOW this stuff is amazing! Super hydrating and plumping. I could feel my skin was more hydrated through the next day! This contains Niacinimide which can react poorly for some skin but my skin loves it and has never looked so good! WRP for sure.\n- **Avene Hydrance Hydrating Cream** (Birchbox Kit): The main ingredients in this are mineral oil, glycerin, hydrating alcohols, safflower seed oil. You can feel the oil when applying, but my dry skin really liked the hydration! WRP\n- **Juara Coconut Illipe Hand & Nail Balm** (Birchbox October 2019): I LOVE coconut scents so this was great to me! Hydrating and not greasy - loved it and WRP!\n- **Quatre Perfume by Boucheron** (Perfume set): I got this in a set of perfume samples my mom gave me for my birthday. It smells good in a classic way, but I have no idea where you could purchase this! I liked it, but I don't think I would repurchase.\n- **YSL Black Opium** (Some GWP?): Ohh this smells SO GOOD! This is a very sexy and deep smell with good lasting power. It makes me feel sexy and I love it! WRP\n- **MoroccanOil Body - Body Polishing Scrub** (Sephora GWP?): This has some physical exfoliation but is mostly a hydrating, fragranced light scrub. It smells like I am rich and taking a bath in a fancy hotel on the beach in Greece. I absolutely love it. WRP if it were cheaper.\n- **Tarte Lights, Camera, Lashes Mascara** (Ulta GWP): I love this stuff and have repurchased many times. Volumizing and lengthening without any clumping. WRP\n- **Red Earth Brighten Concentrate Oil with Kakadu Plum** (Ipsy July 2019): This oil was very hydrating! I never quite know what to look for with brightening products, but my skin did look good! Not sure if I would repurchase, since it is pretty expensive.\n- **Wander Mile High Club Mascara** (Birchbox November 2019): This is hands down the best mascara I've ever used - it makes my lashes look so long and volumous without being clumpy at all! This stuff is amazing and I will definitely repurchase!\n- **Clinique Moisture Surge** (Clinique GWP): The first time I used this, a year ago, it was WAY too hydrating for me and gave me oily, gross skin. However, this year my skin was desperately needing some moisture and I did not have the excess oil problem. I would try this again.\n\n**Okay**\n\n- **Acure Seriously Soothing Cloud Cream** (Birchbox Kit): This was hydrating, and did its job but I just wasn't wild about it, you know? I would still use it if I got it again but probably wouldn't buy it on my own.\n- **Belif the True Cream** (Ulta GWP): This moisturized well, very similar to the Laneige Water Cream. WRP though because of the fragrance. It was strong.\n- **IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Gel Lotion Moisturizer** (Ipsy August 2019 and Ulta GWP): As you can see, I used this twice. Silicone is pretty high up on the ingredients, which could make this a nice primer for day time. It was ok, but definitely not moisturizing enough for my dry skin. Might be nice for someone with oily skin though, and I really appreciate that there's no fragrance! WNRP.\n- **Malin & Goetz Rum Body Wash** (Birchbox Kit): This was hydrating, but the fragrance was pretty bland and subtle, which was disappointing. WNRP, but like, it was fine.\n- **NYX On the Rise Mascara** (Ulta GWP): This mascara's main schtick is EXTREME CURL! I actually liked this pretty well - it did give my eyelashes a ton of lift and made them very visible. Not the greatest volume without clumping, but I MRP to try it again.\n- **KAYALI Vanilla Perfume** (Sephora GWP): Smelled nice and vanilla but didn't last long. WNRP.\n- **DOLCE Dolce&Gabbana Eau de Parfum** (Ulta GWP?): Smelled fine, but WNRP.\n\n**Nay**\nWNRP any of these.\n\n- **Cannabliss Foaming Cleanser** (Ipsy October 2019): This wasn't drying like some foaming cleansers, but wasn't as hydrating as I would like in a cleanser. However, why I really HATED this was THE SMELL. It smelled like pepto bismal - like an awful, herbal bubble gum. Disgusting. 0/10. Did hate pan it though.\n- **Acqua di Gio Fragrance** (GWP?): So this is a men's fragrance and it is STRONG. I accidentally sprayed way too much on myself one morning not knowing it was a men's fragrance and smelled like the world's classiest middle school boy's locker room all day. That terrible experience landed it here, though maybe I'll give it to my boyfriend to try in an actual appropriate quantity.\n- **Miu Miu for Women Eau de Parfum** (Sephora GWP): This had a very subtle scent with zero lasting power. Was so boring I wanted to move on to other fragrances.\n- **Lancome Hydra Zen Moisturizer** (Sephora Play): This was hydrating, but had a super strong floral scent. The scent was just too much. \n- **Clarins Extra Firming Jour SPF 15** (Ulta GWP): Strongly fragrance and made my skin burn immediately upon application (note that I have sensitive skin, so might be fine for most people). \n- **Benefit They're Real Lengthening Mascara** (Ipsy October 2019): This was fine, but I prefer more volume in my mascaras since my lashes aren't too luscious naturally. But this was so difficult to get off, and that's a deal breaker for me. I can't lose the precious few eyelashes I have!\n- **Benefit Roller Lash Mascara** (Ipsy July 2019): Meh, it was fine. I need more volume and length than curl, so this wasn't really up my alley.\n- **Thrive Causemetics Liquid Lash Extension Mascara in Brynn** (Ipsy GBP July 2019): Ok, I know a lot of people love this mascara. But I hated it! Gave decent length but clumped up really quickly. And I found the whole shedding when you remove it to be very offputting and annoying. But I also don't have many issues with regular mascara smudging, so I think the benefit of the tubing mascara is lost on me. \n- **Doucce Punk Volumizing Mascara** (Ipsy GBP November 2019): The formula for this was ok but not too impressing, but the giant brush makes it unnecessarily difficult to apply. Just... why??\n- **Too Faced Damn Girl Mascara** (Ulta GWP): Clumps. Everywhere. Just bad.",

    "body": "**Product Review: Mad Hippie Vitamin A Serum**\n\nAlright…we are in the home stretch LOL. Only 3 more Mad Hippie Products to go and I’m finally at the point where I get so say some positive things!\n\nI have to be honest in saying that I have only used 3 different Retinol (Vitamin A) Products in my life…this Mad Hippie Serum, The Ordinary Granactive Retinol 2% in Squalane, and Differin Gel. So, I don’t have a ton of Products to compare to this Serum.\n\nAs a quick overview if you need it…Retinol Products are used to help lessen signs of aging (fine lines and wrinkles), tackle Acne/breakouts, smooth rough textured Skin, and a whole list of other great things. Personally, I use Vitamin A to help smooth my Skin and strengthen it over time.\n\nOkay, getting down to business. This Vitamin A Serum did pretty much exactly what I expected it to do! Picking up from where The Ordinary Granactive Retinol 2% left off…this Serum did a decent job of keeping my Skin smooth, soft, and resilient. The milky fluid applied nicely over my Skin and although it did feel a bit drying after application…it was pretty similar to what I experienced with The Ordinary’s version. \n\nAnother thing I liked about this Serum is that I didn’t experience any irritation/redness while using it. After having a good experience with both Differin and The Ordinary…I was worried my luck would run out and I’d see the dreaded “Retinol Purge” that everyone warns about. It didn’t happen and that was a relief.\n\nAside from the Retinol in this Serum (which is the same form found in The Ordinary’s Granactive Retinol Products)…Aloe Leaf juice, Beta-Glucan, Ceramides, Sodium Hyaluronate, Coconut Oil, and Safflower Seed Oil also make the list. Honestly, I appreciate the Aloe as it may have helped in making this Product less irritating…but other than that I didn’t see any extra hydrating or nourishing benefits from the Formula.\n\nReally…the only thing I didn’t like about this Serum was the slightly citrus/floral scent. I really think that Mad Hippie could have leaned into their name a done some really interesting fresh/herbal/“Hanbang-like” scents…but these different versions of potpourri are not my style.\n\nSo there you have it, a perfectly good and effective Vitamin A Serum that I think many people would get along with. It wasn’t irritating to me and I didn’t go through any “down time” as my Skin adjusted to it. It really did maintain the work that The Ordinary 2% Granactive Retinol in Squalane had already put in and that was a pleasant surprise.\n\nNow, would I make this my new favorite…no. I’ll continue searching for other Retinol Products and for now I would most likely point to The Ordinary Granactive Retinol 2% in Squalane as my recommendation. It doesn’t have the added scent and is $23.39 USD less per bottle (Ulta prices). \n\nThings To Note:\n\nI mentioned in my previous Mad Hippie Reviews that the Cleansers from the line didn’t do their job (for me) and left my Skin looking/feeling congested. While this is true…their Vitamin A Serum and Exfoliating Serum (Review coming very soon) did their best to counteract this. \n\nI’ll post a quick “Mad Hippie Wrap Up” after I’m done with the last 2 Reviews to discuss further so stay tuned! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zix1pwxzeak41.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=048370540aca0dad356259abe9f09997f4317f1b",

    "body": "In my attempt to refresh my love of wetshaving it seems like I'm looking to what artisan soaps are in the EU. Like many of our fellow EU wetshavers they don't get many NA brands and we don't see as many EU brands, but it's a bit easier for us due to regulations. One brand that came across my radar was E&S Rasage, a husband and wife team from France that was popping up a bit online and at some retailers.\n\nI was curious about them then saw a set on the BST for cheap and figured why not. The set I acquired is [Zenith](https://es-rasage.com/en/collections/zenith) a \"Floriental\" scent as they describe it. I'll talk about the scent more later as this wasn't my focus it was the base itself. \n\n When we think France for shaving we think of the classics, [Martin de Candre](https://www.martin-de-candre.com/en/), [La Savonnière du Moulin](https://la-savonniere-du-moulin.com/), [Le Père Lucien](https://www.leperelucien.com/), and other similar brands. What most of these have in common except for LPL is that they are hard triple milled vegan base soaps, where LPL is a much softer artisan style soap in some various bases. E&S is more like a traditional artisan tallow base with goat's milk, lanolin and other butters, their base is as followed: \n\n> Ingredients: Potassium Stearate, Caprae Lac, Glycerin, SodiumStearate, Potassium Shea Butterate, Potassium Tallowate, Sodium Safflowerate, Potassium Castorate, Parfum, Persea Gratissima Oil, Sodium Tallowate, Cocos Nucifera Fruit Extract, Sodium Shea Butterate, Sodium Cocoa Butterate, Sodium Castorate, Sodium Cocoa Butterate, Sodium Castorate Potassium Cocoate, Silk Powder, Stearic Acid, Potassium Lanolate, Sodium Cocoate, Allantoin, Sodium Lanolate, Tocopherol, Adeps Bovis, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, Theobroma Cacao Seed Butter, Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuos Seed Oil, Cocianthus Annuus Seed Oil Nucifera Oil, Lanolin, Coumarin, Limonene, Eugenol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Methyl 2-Octyonate.\n\n------\n\n**Loading & Lathering**\n\nThis soap took a bit to load, it could have been the brush I was using the tips were too soft, took a few seconds longer but got the brush loaded fine. Maybe some scrubbier tips would grab the soap easier but minor things people. \n\nThe lathering portion took a bit longer to get to where I wanted to but a few extra seconds of patience while properly hydrating lead to a very dense and heavy lather with a high water tolerance, I could have pushed it more but no need in my eyes. \n\n**The Shave**\n\nI had 3 days of growth and my straight just wiped away the hair like nothing on the first pass. The lather is plenty slick for straights and for our DE users would have plenty of protection and cushioning. A 2 pass shave and some extra clean up left my face with a very nice DFS shave, BBS is impossible for me. The residual slickness felt very nice and good for clean up spots if needed. \n\n**The Splash**\n\nThe splash is pretty simple with the ingredients as followed:\n\n> Alcohol Denat., Hamamelis Virginiana, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycerin, Parfum, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Coumarin, Limonene, Eugenol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Methyl 2-Octyonate.\n\nI got a pretty big bite from it, not sure if it was the alcohol or scent but after 10 min my face was smooth and comfortable. It didn't have that super soft and tacky feel like some soaps and splashes give but it was just normal as the best way I can put it. \n\n**The Scent**\n\nI'm not going to focus on this much as I just cared about the base more, but Zenith is a warm floral scent, they describe it as: \n\n> The floral and spicy notes of ZENITH will bring you softness and well-being while leaving your skin delicately scented long after its application. Balanced fragrance, breath of freshness at the top with bergamot, the heart is warmed with enveloping notes of iris, jasmine and rose, and a base marked by the imprint of vanilla and the roundness of woody notes.\n \nTo me it was like a cousin of [Mickey Lee Soapworks - Bodhisattva](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/835/?product_type=soap). This scent isn't quite for me so will sell it.\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nSimply put the best artisan soap out of France and a really good EU artisan base too, scents are different with a solid variety. I would personally ignore the splash if buying a soap, it's more than the soap and I don't think as good, but if you want to get it get it. But I wouldn't hesitate to try the soap new or used. \n\n**Disclaimer**: I already said it, bought it on the BST.",

    "body": " About 2+ weeks ago I posted about trialling some topical melatonin products.  I'm posting my experience to date:\n\nUPDATE: I ordered the Topical Faded serum, a Melatonin Cream made by Supplement Spot, and SkinActives UV Repair cream. All contain varying amounts of melatonin, w/I think the Melatonin Cream containing the most. I would have tried the Gold Bond cream, but it contained coconut oil, which is a disaster on my face. I was going to try the LifeExtension Cosmesis Melatonin Peptide cream, which looked pretty good, but I went w/ the Supplement Spot brand because it was cheaper (at least on Amazon). I've now used all 3 at varying times (sometimes only 1 product, sometimes all 3, yeah that's crazy but oh well) for about 2 weeks now.\n\nThe Faded serum was a pale yellow creamy substance. Smelled like sulfur, but was otherwise nice, but I felt like it was lightening my skin all over instead of just my dark spots, so I felt like what's the point? The dark spots are still darker than the non-spot areas. Also, it did irritate me slightly. No clogging or breakouts though. A nice product, but I felt like it wasn't really helping my issue. To be fair, I didn't use it long enough to really know if it would work longterm. I may come back to it later.\n\nThe Melatonin Cream was unexpectedly very good. A pale beige cream in a tub, and I hate tubs - I prefer a squeeze tube. But there was no strong fragrance, only a very very faint slightly lavender/tea tree type smell. Interesting because there is no fragrance on the ing list and I didn't see any ing that might smell like this. Also the label says fragrance free. No irritation or redness whatsoever, my skin looked plumped, softened, and SUPER CALM when using this. It's a light cream and sinks in almost immediately, leaving no greasy shine or tacky residue. I have acne and rosacea, w/ both redness and pustules, and oily/combo skin that is super finicky and clog prone, so it's really hard for me to find a moisturizer that works but doesn't break me out or turn me red. This stuff had a fairly short and simple ing list, the first 4 ings being water, safflower seed oil, aloe vera gel, and Sepigel 305. It also had some other plant oils - hemp seed oil, evening primrose oil, apricot kernel oil, and grapeseed oil. Melatonin was the 5th ing. I was shocked this stuff worked so well, because usually my skin hates most oils. BUt my skin looked super plumped and calm. My skin tone even looked more even - maybe just because it was very well moisturized and calmed. Any spots (sebaceous hyperplasia and rosacea pustules) I had looked smaller and less irritated. No clogging. NO breakouts. This cream is marketed for promoting restful sleep, not for anything else. I used it at night at first, but liked it so much I am using it during the day. Have not noticed getting sleepy except one day when I slathered it pretty much everywhere - face, body, in the AM. Overall, awesome moisturizer, that i feel can be used AM and PM, as long as you don't use all over in the AM, and very calming and moisturizing w/o clogging or greasiness/oiliness.\n\nSkinActives UV Repair cream is a light golden brown cream in a small tub, again, not a fan of tubs. Had a fair amt of darker brown flecks and particles. Vaguely sulfury smell as well. Emailed the company, asking if the particles were normal. Answer was yes. So I tried it. It does leave a film or residue, plus visible particles, and tends to pill under makeup, so it's not really feasible for me to use this in the AM. NOt as moisturizing as the Supplement Spot Melatonin cream, but this is marketed as a UV Repair cream, so OK. Skin did not feel as calmed or plumped as w/ the Melatonin Cream, and not as calming. I think this may be a tx cream where longer term use is needed to judge its effectiveness.\n\nOverall, I am extremely impressed by at least one melatonin product in this line up and am interested in trying more melatonin products. Maybe I'll try the LifeExtension Cosmesis one next, but the Supplement Spot one is a keeper.",

But why then are some of the most highly recommended oils (including argan, neem, etc.) so high in oleic acid? \n\nWhat I've concluded from my (brief) research into the topic is that there's a lot more to choosing an individual oil than the fatty acid composition. These oils all contain a lot of different and varied chemicals/molecules beyond the fatty acids that provide their unique benefits. As one example, beyond the FAs listed on GoW, they list the following: \"Triterpenes, more specifically, limonoids such as azadirachtin, salannin, meliantriol, nimbin, nimbidin, meliantriol, deacetylazadirachtinol, salannin, salannol, 3-deacetylsalannin etc.\" \n\nLastly, can you provide sources on the topical use of gamma linolenic acid and its benefits? I haven't been able to find too much on that one [except this source on dietary use](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553997). Mostly just LA and ALA.",

This is because oleic acid is a monounsaturated fat, while linoleic acid is a polyunsaturated fat. So if you see a high percentage of polyunsaturated fats and a low percentage of monounsaturated fats: you've got the right one :)\n\n(edited because I can't type, apparently)",

The one thing I didn't know about, and maybe someone can answer this question, is this:  At night I use a hyaluronic acid serum, followed by cerave PM, followed sometimes by the EPO.  I also use a humidifier in my room at night.  My question is this: Is the oil acting as enough of an occlusive that when I use it, I don't get the benefit of the humidifier?  Obviously the hyaluronic+moisturizer+oil is a good combo, and obviously the hyaluronic+moisturizer+humidifier is another good combo, but do the oil & humidifier working against each other or cancel each other out in some way?",

    "body": "I cooked smelt for the first time just now. I bought them from Whole Foods, which had beheaded them and cleaned out the guts already. I dried them off, ran them through lemon juice, then tossed them in a bag of flour, salt, and pepper. Didn't want to do a ton of seasoning for my first try, really wanted to taste the fish. So, I fried them in a pan with some safflower seed oil (didn't have peanut oil on hand).\n\nNow here's my question: What the heck is up with the bones?!\n\nTwo of them I was able to eat without any problem, but the larger two, I needed to go in and remove the bones. I didn't look, but I think the ones I didn't have any problems with maybe had the bones removed in the cleaning process at WF, so I'm not sure if it's a size issue or if they were cleaned differently.\n\nBut I thought you could eat whole smelt? I've read that the heads are edible, so I figured the rest of the fish was as well. Do I need to remove the bones, or am I maybe undercooking them or something?",

It should be slightly sweet. She would put a heavy plate to weigh down the smelt and simmer them on VERY low heat for an hour or two. They were so flavorful and the bones dissolve in the sauce making it delicious and syrupy.  It's insanely good on rice.",

It’s also sold in 1 ounce and 8 ounce sizes. The cleansing oil is gold in color, has a luxurious texture and smells like neem oil (though not as  overwhelmingly strong as pure neem oil). \n\n**Application:** I use GoW Cleaning Oil (Blemish Prone) nightly as the first part of [double cleansing](http://www.justaboutskin.com/2014/05/double-cleanse/). First, I apply a quarter-sized amount of cleansing oil to dry skin and massage using circular motions. Next, I wet my hands, massage using circular motions to emulsify the oil/makeup/sunscreen and rinse. Finally, I follow with foaming cleanser via a microfiber cloth. \n\nGoW Cleansing Oil (Blemish Prone) glides across my skin smoothly and rinses away easily. Immediately after rinsing, my skin feels soft and clean. After using foaming cleanser, my skin feels softer and more “moisturized” than it does when I remove my makeup with baby wipes.\n\n**Results:** I’ve used GoW Cleansing Oil (Blemish Prone) for two weeks. It removes physical sunscreen and makeup effectively while leaving my skin in good condition. I really like it.\n\n**Adverse Reactions:** I don’t know of any adverse reactions to GoW Cleansing Oil (Blemish Prone) or a combination of the product with another. I haven’t experienced any adverse reactions while using the cleansing oil. ",

You should have been provided with aftercare instructions, considering how extreme jessner's can be, depending on how deepbof a treatment it was. But basically, you're going to be left with fresh 'baby skin' underneath. Which means that it will be very sensitive to any other chemicals until it stops peeling and heals fully which can potentially take up to 14 days from the time of the peel. It wouldn't be a bad idea to invest in a tube of aquafor. Whatever you do, do not peel the skin off or pick at it. If you have large pieces of skin hanging off, you can take a pair of sterilized (very import that they are sterilized) cuticle scissors and trim away excess skin, avoiding getting too close to where it's still attached to your face. Avoid any products that aren't simple moisturizers, such as aquafor. There's a video on YouTube of a woman who got a jessner peel, and she goes a bit into detail about how she was told to care for hers. Here's to you and hoping that you heal quickly, and love the outcome! I've seen quite a few before and afters, and the results for most people are great! Good luck!",

It’s behaving weirdly and I don’t know what to do about it.\nI’m 31, female, and have pretty sensitive/allergic type skin with a history of eczema (although never really had it on my face).\nI was ticking along happily for years using Avene Tolerance Extreme moisturiser every day. To my horror this product was discontinued and the replacement they brought out seems to cause irritation, flakiness, itchy areas etc. As I’m so sensitive to products I could not find a replacement that didn’t cause irritation. I tried everything, natural oils, mineral oil/Vaseline over a humectant like glycerin on damp skin, other French pharmacy products like LRP and Bioderma, and all the drugstore favourites like e45, aveeno etc. All seemed to make me drier and more irritated after a few uses. As I had no other option, I continued to use the new formulation of the Avene.\n\nNow I seem to have got myself into a cycle of irritated, flaky skin, which I hate so I try to gently exfoliating whilst washing with water.... which causes more irritation and flaking, and the cycle goes on.\n\nMiraculously I’ve managed to obtain a tube of my old holy grail Avene moisturiser from eBay and have been using it for about 6 days now with little improvement. Still flaky, still sore and eczema-like. The ingredients of this cream are: AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA). GLYCERIN. MINERAL OIL (PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM). SQUALANE. CARTHAMUS TINCTORIUS (SAFFLOWER) SEED OIL (CARTHAMUS TINCTORIUS SEED OIL). CYCLOPENTASILOXANE. GLYCERYL STEARATE. CYCLOHEXASILOXANE. SODIUM CARBOMER. TITANIUM DIOXIDE. WATER (AQUA). \n\nThe new version of this cream, which really irritates me, has swapped out the mineral oil for Shea butter and uses behenyl alcohol as the emulsifier. I’m sure I’m irritated by one of those. I see other people have issues with fatty alcohols. Anyway, it’s nice to have my old product back but I still look like crap and it’s really affecting my confidence at work :(\n\nHow long will my skin barrier take to heal? Should I avoid washing? as water seems to make it drier and more sore, even if I moisturise immediately!\n\nThank you so much in advance. This has been a struggle for a really long time!",

People hear alcohol and panic. Shea is not drying either. Usually the problem be a breakout. You could be allegic of course. \n\nIs the old tube helping or are you just dryer and the old products are just not up to the job?. One thing that can go very wrong is humectants (glycerine, hyaluronic acids, glycols) in a dry environment. Maybe the glincerin is not working as it is dryer season or your skin has changed.   If there is not enough moisture in the environment humectants will pull moisture out of the deeper layers of the skin. Vaseline without the glycerin might work better, still over damp skin. I had to reduce the amount of products with humectants that I use on my body for eczema. That helped. I also use a steam humidifier (Vicks) and that helps a lot.  Steam is a lot cleanser and more effective  than cool options.",

Its just about always useful to use either a different shampoo or a clarifying shampoo every couple of weeks to pick up any buildup your main shampoo might not work as well on.

A warm towel is needed to press against the Skin and wipe away the excess Product. \n\nFeatured Ingredients here include Safflower Seed Oil, Squalane, Rose Fruit Oil, Ginger Root Extract, Pumpkin Seed Oil, Oat Oil, and White Tea Extract. Key Lime Extract is used here as fragrance. This Cleansing Oil is much more thin than the previous Product I used with a similar application and removal (that would be the Little Barn Apothecary Cleansing Oil - check out that Review if you haven’t). This Product has a really interesting fruity/grape bubble gum scent that I really like LOL…but I could see some people not getting along with it.\n\nBecause this Cleansing Oil is quite thin…I found myself needing to use more Product than normal to get the slip/slide that I expect from a Cleansing Oil. I used 4-6 pumps of Product per application to get what I needed which seemed like a lot. Once on, this Product massages nicely and feels comfortable. I didn’t notice any greasiness or “Vaseline” feel. However, when it came time to rinse this Product off with a warm towel…it was a bit more of a struggle than I was expecting.\n\nEach time I used this Product I really had to rinse the towel, heat it up, and almost scrub to remove the Oil. Even so, I was always left with a bit of a residue/excess that just didn’t make me feel clean. On the plus side…it wasn’t drying or “stripping”. But it swung too much in the other direction and just wasn’t thorough enough for my Combination Skin. Those with Dry Skin may find this to be a bit more approachable (although the rubbing I had to do with the towel caused more redness than I would have liked) but overall it was a pass from me and I won’t be coming back.\n\nFor me, either the Aromatica Coconut Cleansing Oil or Aromatica Orange Cleansing Sherbet are going to be far more thorough yet not strip the Skin. They rinse like you expect from a \"modern\" Oil Cleanser and are just far better formulated. Then I Met You’s Living Cleansing Balm is also a fantastic alternative. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1g1akdhchlj41.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b01577da45fa32a5342a499b13a95c03511e6a7",

    "body": "Hi guys,\n\nSo I'm 21(m) now, started having acne around 16 and it seemed to be a gene thing (my mom had it pretty bad when she was young) and I have tried pretty much everything including:\n\n- Completely vegan diet (and almost no sugar)\n- Daily (2x) washing with a mild cleanser and gentle moisturiser afterwards \n- Antibiotics and Roaccutane briefly \n- Natural remedies (tea-tree oil, banana peel, honey and oat masks, sea salt etc.)\n- In good physical shape\n- Tons of different topical treatments (e.g. Epiduo, Differin, Dalacin T, Sulfur Treatments, Salicylic Acid and the list goes on and on)\n- Drink lots of water (and lemon in the morning)\n- Cold showers to close pores\n- Diet full of the right vegetables and fruits etc to get useful vitamins and antioxidants\n- Blackhead masks \n\nAaaand I still can't f*#king get rid of my acne. Really starting to lose my mind, it's almost like I'm living my life around spots on my face. It has gotten significantly better but still most mornings I wake up with new spots even if they are small. Most of it is small whiteheads but now and then I get some cystic stuff. My nose is always full of blackheads as well and I can't get rid of them. And to top that all I have some significant battle scarring from this never ending acne war.\n\nAnyone out there with a miracle solution? Hit me up. Please. \n\n*UPDATE*\n\nOkay so I finally did it. My acne is gone *emotional tears*. If anyone cares here's what I did, would be happy to write the whole formula if people want to know.\n\n- 1 Week Antibiotic course (to be honest I'm not sure how much this helped apart from speeding up the healing process)\n- Used the banana peel once or twice (careful with this though.. it's useful to bring down the spots but I find if I apply it too much I start to get a lot of tiny whiteheads, perhaps skin needs time to breath between treatments) Not using this anymore.\n- Stopped eating gluten (I think I am gluten sensitive.. this seemed to make the biggest difference. You can check this with your doctor but apparently Gluten and Sugar are a horrible combination for acne) hence..\n- No sugar (have reintroduced a little.. for example in oatmeal for breakfast, seems to be okay) great guide for selecting which sweeteners to use= http://supernaturalacnetreatment.com/ultimate-guide-to-acne-friendly-natural-alternative-sweeteners/\n- Creams and washes= I bought almost the whole set from Louis Widmer Skin Appeal treatments and they are proving extremely helpful most notably...\n      -Peeling Wash: Super good, deep clean without damaging the skin, I am currently using it every other day (recommended on the pack 3/4 times per week) \n       Main ingredients are Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Salicylic Acid, Benzioc Acid. Made from fruit acid.\n      -Sebo Fluide: This is for after cleaning during day and night (essentially a moisturiser) \n       Main ingredients are Jojoba, Glycerin, Advocado Extract, Safflower Seed Oil \n      - Lipo Sol Mousse: Just a facial foam wash which I use before and after sleep, contains Salicylic & Benzoic Acid and Panthenol amongst other things\n- On the actual spots themselves I have been putting Dalacin T (1%) Topical Gel and the Louis Widmer Skin Care Stick which is basically Fruit Acid, Salicylic Acid and Tea Tree Oil\n \nNow that the spots are gone I'm going to maintain it with the foam wash morning and night, use the peeling to get rid of scars and the Sebo Fluide as moisturiser. \n\n\n",

So if anyone knows about these hair products and the lovely scent, please let me know if you have any fragrance recommendations. :)\n\nAlso, I can try to explain the scent but i'll probably fail miserably.  It's beachy--maybe some hints of coconut?  \n\nThe ingredients of the products all have what they call \"Hairdresser's Six Signature oils,\" which are: Argan Oil, Coconut Oil, Macademia Nut Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Safflower Seed Oil, and Grapeseed Oil.  Not sure if that is any help lol.  But anyway, it a very addicting scent and I'd love to find a perfume like it! Thanks!",

Play Lip Balm SPF 30 - Mint and Acai\n\nSlightly different from the Lip Shield product from Supergoop! that I reviewed a few weeks ago...these lip balms are more of a gel/gloss consistency vs a stick.\n\nHowever, they utilize the same UV filters to protect lips from damaging rays that can play a part in lip dryness/cracking.\n\nOther beneficial ingredients in the formulas include Shea Butter/Extract, Safflower Seed Oil, and Sunflower Seed Oil.\n\nEach one has a unique scent/flavor using things like Peppermint Oil, Acai Extract, and Vanillin (which imparts a sweet/vanilla scent). \n\nI have to say, I’m a really big fan of both lip balms! \n\nI interchanged each one depending on the day/my mood (LOL) and found them to offer quite a bit in the way of hydration and nourishment. \n\nThese really are a nice balance of form and function as they provide just enough shine without verging into full-on glossy/sticky territory.\n\nMy only complaint is that the mint version does little to mask the chemical/sunscreen taste of the product.\n\nIt was generally less pleasant to have the mint version on compared to the acai...especially when a bit of product happened to come in contact with my tongue.\n\nThat being said, I would still consider coming back to either of the Supergoop! Play Lip Balm SPF 30 products as they provided a nice shield over my lips while out in the sun...with a nice semi-gloss look that I enjoyed! \n\nFull Ingredients List (providing the acai version here): \n\nActive Ingredients: Avobenzone (3%), Homosalate (10%), Octocrylene (10%), Octisalate (5%)\n\nInactive Ingredients: Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Polyisobutene, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Nut Extract, C18-38 Alkyl Hydroxystearoyl Stearate, Ozokerite, Cetyl Alcohol, Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate, Glyceryl Stearate, Polyglyceryl-10 Decaoleate, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Trihydroxystearin, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Stevioside, 2-Methylbutyric Acid, Barosma Betulina Leaf Oil, Benzaldehyde, Dimethylhydroxy Furanone, Trans-2-Hexenal, Tocopherol, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Ethyl Acetate, Gamma-Undecalactone, Vanillin\n\nWhere To Buy (Supergoop!

Here’s a few things that have worked for me and some advice I think might be helpful for those struggling with the same issues.\n\nFace setup: I use a plain facewash twice a day and the oil cleansing method once every night, For OCM, I use a mixture of Safflower Seed oil and Castor oil, then wipe it off with a damp microfiber cloth. After cleansing, I moisturize with a drop or two of Safflower Seed oil. When I’m planning to be outside, I put on Neutrogena UltraSheer sunscreen with at least 30 SPF. Every few days, I use a Clearasil 2% salicylic acid exfoliate. That’s it!\n\nBody setup: I started using Neutrogena Body Clear body wash (without microbeads) in the shower recently and it has worked great so far. Afterwards, I apply a thin layer of Clean & Clear dual action salicylic acid moisturizer. Always wear a clean shirt, and clean your sheets often. Also, it may be helpful to use different towels for your hair and body. I apply sunscreen to exposed skin as needed.\n\nCompulsive skin picking advice: If you’ve ever found yourself stuck in front of your bathroom mirror for hours searching for anything to pick/pop, you are most likely a compulsive skin picker! Consulting /r/CompulsiveSkinPicking and/or seeking professional help might be useful. I’ve found that the best way to deal with this habit is to replace it with a more constructive obsession. I recommend picking up a hobby that will consume your interest, time, and energy. Personally, I love to skateboard and it exhausts me to the point that all I want to do is jump in the shower. See /r/NewSkaters  and /r/skateboarding  for more information.\n\nI hope this information helps, let me know if you have any comments/questions/advice!\n",

I'm ready to do this with several products if it's cheaper that way.\n\nHere's some thoughts, I'd really appreciate help; I haven't really replaced a product on basis of a variety of ingredients before, and since I'll be carrying this scar for the rest of my life I want to make it recover as well as possible.\n\nI'm also honestly not that aware of what you *shouldn't* put on a scar, so warnings against any ingredients would be very welcome, as would products/ingredients that are good for scars but not part of the serum I'm replacing. Right now I'm only applying Vit C Serum, the PC serum and Contractubex (like Mederma) on the scar.\n\n----\n\n**PC's list of ingredients:**\n\n> Key Ingredients: ascorbic acid, alpha glucan oligosaccharide, tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, dimethicone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer, Hypericum extract, quercetin, calendula extract, sodium hyaluronate, tocopherol, safflower seed oil, petrolatum\n\nOut of the above, the following seem to be for formulation (thickening agents etc.) or otherwise non-essential:\n\n> alpha glucan oligosaccharide (emollient), dimethicone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer (emulsifier)\n\n----\n\n**Remaining ingredients one by one, going from easiest to replace to most difficult to replace:**\n\n> ascorbic acid & tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate\n\n2 forms of Vitamin C. I could replace these with the DIY serum I already make and occasionally apply to the scar.\n\n> sodium hyaluronate\n\nReplace with Hada Labo products (Perfect Gel?) I already have.\n\n> petrolatum\n\nVaseline, need I say more?\n\n> safflower seed oil\n\nHmm, I guess I should replace this with some oil? Beautypedia says it's high on antioxidants as well as linolenic acid. The oil itself is rather affordable on iHerb, but does anyone know of potentially better oils?\n\n> Hypericum extract, quercetin, calendula extract, tocopherol\n\nAlright SCA, this is where I say welp, I may be in need of help. I know tocopherol is Vitamin E, but apparently it's the least used antioxidant in this serum (quercetin is apparently the best of these antioxidants). Any suggestions for how I could replace this mix of ingredients?\n\n----\n\n**Planned post-serum routine:**\n\nThe routine post-serum could look something like this:\n\nVit C serum -> antioxidants? -> Hada Labo Perfect Gel -> (Contractubex ->) oil? -> Vaseline",

I'm worried this might not be moisturizing enough for the evenings, therefore also considering [La Roche Posay Hydreane Rich](http://www.laroche-posay.com/products-treatments/Hydreane/Hydreane-Rich-p6264.aspx) but I've read this might make you greasy. \n\n\n>AQUA / WATER\nGLYCERIN\nCYCLOHEXASILOXANE\nHYDROGENATED POLYISOBUTENE\nAMMONIUM POLYACRYLDIMETHYLTAURAMIDE / AMMONIUM POLYACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE\nMYRISTYL MYRISTATE\nSODIUM HYDROXIDE\nSTEARIC ACID\nPOLYPHOSPHORYLCHOLINE GLYCOL ACRYLATE\nXANTHAN GUM\nCAPRYLOYL GLYCINE\nCAPRYLYL GLYCOL\nACRYLATES COPOLYMER\nPOTASSIUM CETYL PHOSPHATE\nGLYCERYL STEARATE SE\n\nNot too set on either Avène or LRP, but they are OK in price range (I guess... I'd rather go cheaper but I'm desperate) and readily available for me.\n\n____________\n\n**Sunscreen**\n\nIt needs to be a physical/mineral sunscreen as chemical ones irritate my eyes. SPF doesn't need to be crazy high - Netherlands.\n\nI need help here honestly. I have so much trouble finding one. The top one right now seems to be my fav because it's cheap and I can get it anywhere. If it sucks I won't be too sad...\n\n\n* [Eart Line Argan Bio Sun Face Age Control](http://www.vannaturebeter.nl/biosunfaceagecontrole.html) (SPF 15 but they also have SPF 20)\n\n>Aqua, Macadamia Ternifolia (macadamia oil)**, Titanium Dioxide, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin (soy), Helianthus Annus (sunflower oil)**, Simmondsia Chinensis ( jojoba oil)**, Butyrospermum Parkii (shea butter)** , Prunus Dulcis (almond oil)**,Stearyl Alcohol, Argania Spinosa Oil (argan oil)**, Cocos Nucifera (coconut oil)**, Chlorella Vulgaris/Lupinus, Albus Protein Ferment, Nasturtium Officinale Flower/Leaf Extract (anti-dark spots), Porphyra Umbilicalis / Porphyra Umbilicalis Extract (red algae), Calendula Officinalis Extract **, Symphytum Officinale Extract (comfrey)**, Plantago Lanceolata Extract (plantain)**, Zinc Oxide, Fragrance (natural perfume)**, Aloe Barbadensis (aloe vera)**, Ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q10), D-alpha Tocopherol (vitamin E), Daucus Carota (vitamin A), Camellia Sinensis (white tea), Squalane, Ascorbyl Palmitate (vitamin C),  Sucrose Stearate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-2 Caprate, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Xanthan Gum, Glyceryl Caprylate, Aluminium Stearate, Phytic acid, Citric Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Stearic Acid, Isostearic Acid, Sodium Lactate, Citronellol*, Limonene*, Linalool*, Farnesol*, Geraniol*\n\nYou probably haven't heard of this one, I think it's a European brand. Hopefully you can glance something from the ingredients that I can't. Sorry for the editing, they put stars next to some ingredients which makes it bold, but I don't know what the stars mean :)\n\nI like this one because it's a physical sunscreen, SPF 20 seems fine enough for me, it's not expensive and I can buy it in many stores around here. Not too fond of the alcohol in this one again, but maybe I shouldn't be bothered so much? \n\n* [Paula's Choice RESIST Super Light Daily Wrinkle Defense SPF 30](http://www.paulaschoice-eu.com/resist-super-light-daily-wrinkle-defense-spf-30.html) - Or maybe not this one specifically as I don't like the coloring. Paula's Choice seems to have many SPF creams though. \n\n\nOther PC's options are also in my mind. I don't know. I've never used anything from PC. Everyone seems really happy with it and considering the trouble I have finding a good mineral sunscreen, I'm willing to try it. Definitely above my budget to be honest though...\n\n____________\n\n**Exfoliant**\n\nPaula's Choice, no doubt really. Can't seem to find another one that's cheaper and with all the positive responses I'm willing to spend the money on it. BHA Regular probably. *Not starting this until I have the rest of my routine sorted out though!*\n\n____________\n\n**Cleanser**\n\nCeraVe! My coworker is also bringing me CeraVe cleanser and I can't wait to use it. Until then I'll finish the cleanser I'm using now. It's not great, but it's alright (Dutch brand). I'm really putting my money on the CeraVe for the moment and I'll wait to see what that does before I worry about it any more. Finding a good moisturizer and sunscreen is difficult (and expensive) enough for now.. But if you have any options for me, please let me know! I was told I should look for one with low PH?\n\n______\n\n\nWhat else do I need? Something that's glaringly lacking? I feel like a serum sounds wonderful, but maybe I should prioritize something else. Or maybe I should chill and see what the new products over time will do for me. I don't know. I still need advice and you guys really helped me clear my mind earlier. Thanks again everyone. You're lifesavers. ",

Personally, I only buy sunscreens which are somewhat cheap (I guess around $3-4/oz) because I go through more sunscreen than any other product.  You also have to consider how much protection you want and whether a white cast on your face will bother you or not.  Most physical sunscreens do leave a white cast, so keep that in mind.  They can be a little drying too.  I think the Earth Line could be worth a try.  Asian products tend to be cheap (although small) and ship worldwide for reasonable prices.  This [Innisfree](http://www.innisfreeworld.com/product/productView.do?prdSeq=10131) sunscreen is physical and supposed to be good.  You can get more info on which website to buy from at /r/Asianbeauty. \n\nThe cleanser should be around pH 5.5  [Sebamed](http://www.sebamed.nl/nl) is known for this!  And the products are supposed to be good.  I would think you can find this locally.",

        "body": "I have tried the Isana 10% urea body milk, 5,5% body lotion, urea akut serum and the facial cream with 7% urea.\n\nThe biggest difference between the body products is that the 10% version is a water-in-oil emulsion as in the outer phase is composed of oils. So it could be called oil-based and because of that it’s extremely hard to spread over wet/damp skin. It is best applied onto dry skin. This oil based product might be a good option for people who get stinging sensations from products with urea because the oil outer phase significantly decreases the stinging from my personal experience with many other products.\n\nThe body lotion is very thin very easy to spread has a somewhat glowy finish but definitely not greasy. Stings my skin from time to time but not too bad.\n\nThe facial moisturizer with 7% urea stung my skin and turned me red every single time i tried it and it really was simply intolerable for me, i do not like this product but YMMV.\n\nAkut serum with urea didn’t really sting much but it has a very annoying base. It feels quite emollient at the start but settles down really fast amd leaves a very much matte finish and my skin feels taut and tight afterwards as if it doesn’t moisturize at all. After all it’s called a “serum” so it makes sense to follow up with a proper moisturizer but every single thing i tried after using this serum pills on me. Not a bad product per se but annoying to use.\n\nI’d say Isana’s best urea products are the body milk and body lotion which i both used on my face. I’d strongly recommend the oil-based body milk if anyone is sensitive to urea stinging their faces.",

        "body": "My apologies if I come across snappy, but your new list doesn’t seem to be a reflection of a single bit of advice you had received from your first list. There are still alcohols and synthetic components in these.\n\nYou’re starting from too complicated of a controlled perspective. You say you wish to determine what ingredients are subjectively preferred by yourself, and I doubt even the most oil-affluent human on the planet would be able to independently judge each of these 10 ingredients in each bottle. Too much combination happening at once. \n\nAdvice:\nIf you can’t pronounce an ingredient, don’t use it. If you were to use your own judgement system and be successful with finding the right oils, you’d be using natural stuff in the end. Save yourself the time now. \n\nIt was said before, but stay simple. Use your classic base oils, a little essential, and added vitamin E if you’d like. Parfume and Fragrance typically refers to alcohol-based, and you don’t want that on your skin or hair. \n\nSpend $50-75 on amazon and you’ll be able to make yourself quality beard oil for at least a few months.",

    "body": "Hi guys, \nlike the title says, I think my skin barrier is in a sorry state. I’ve had problems for a few months since my holy grail moisturiser (Avene tolerance extreme) was discontinued, and they brought out a replacement formula containing SOMETHING that irritates my skin (maybe shea butter or behenyl alcohol???). The replacement formula has really bad reviews online with people saying basically the same, that it causes irritation and rashes.\n\nFor the past few months I’ve been desperately trying to find a replacement moisturiser, but pretty much everything I’ve tried seems to make matters worse, even the basic drugstore/derm favourites, so I’ve just stuck to this new version of the Avene cream, which contains: AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA), CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, GLYCERIN, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII (SHEA) BUTTER (BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER), CARTHAMUS TINCTORIUS (SAFFLOWER) SEED OIL (CARTHAMUS TINCTORIUS SEED OIL), BEHENYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, WATER (AQUA). It sort of moisturises, but also seems to make my skin irritated, flaky and slightly itchy.\n\nI think my desperate attempts to moisturise and remove flakes (tried natural oils, mineral oils, glycerin, vaseline on damp skin, other French skincare like LRP, Bioderma etc, zinc soap(!!)) have just totally jacked up my skin barrier and my face is now rough like sandpaper, flaking, blotchy and pink with sore areas.\n\n I’ve managed to get my hands on a tube of the old version of my moisturiser. I’ve been using it a week but my skin looks awful still! I think I accidentally manually exfoliated a week ago when the cream arrived, as I massaged it in for ages trying to remove all the dead skin, and woke up the next morning with actual raw weepy patches. The cream contains: AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA). GLYCERIN. MINERAL OIL (PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM). SQUALANE. CARTHAMUS TINCTORIUS (SAFFLOWER) SEED OIL (CARTHAMUS TINCTORIUS SEED OIL). CYCLOPENTASILOXANE. GLYCERYL STEARATE. CYCLOHEXASILOXANE. SODIUM CARBOMER. TITANIUM DIOXIDE. WATER (AQUA) I used it for 10 years + before it was discontinued with no problems.\n\nI don’t know what to do. I look so bad that it’s impacting my work. Does anyone know how long the skin barrier might take to improve again? Should I avoid washing? I’m so confused!\n\nThanks in advance for your advice guys :(",

Moisturizer, rx cream or steroid, and a gentle soap is all you need, maybe zinc if it's weeping. Never try to remove dead skin, with eczema there is no difference between exfoliating and scratching, both irritate and make skin worse in the long run. It won't heal if you keep messing with it.",

YES! Allow your skin time to replenish natural oils! If you have to wash use cold water, hot water  and soap will strip your skin bare.\n\n4) Check for allergy triggers if possible, nickel, cats, plants, synthetic fabrics, fragrances, unclean pillowcases, feather pillowcases are common problems.\n\n5) Have you tried vaseline over night? It can help when you are red raw, and the looks don't matter when you are asleep. It will mostly end up on your pillowcase by morning (you can wash that to remove) and you can use a lighter moisturiser during the day.\n\nFinally, dont lose hope - good luck",

They are based on individual ingredients rather than **any negative effects the final product may have.** The way ingredients interact in a formulation can influence their potential impact, and the presence of a specific ingredient does not automatically equate to harm when used in a product. It's always crucial to do your own research, consider the product as a whole, and keep in mind that personal reactions can vary greatly. When making decisions about personal care products, it is recommended to consult with healthcare professionals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brief**: This product, verified by the EWG, generally does not cause significant problems for children, and can be a good option for many parents. This baby lotion contains mostly beneficial ingredients such as plant oils and extracts which provide moisture and soothe the skin. The inclusion of Avena Sativa Kernel Flour (oatmeal) and Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract can be particularly beneficial for sensitive skin. Tocopheryl Acetate, a form of Vitamin E, provides antioxidant benefits. However, Cetyl Alcohol, though generally mild, can occasionally cause skin irritation in very sensitive individuals. The preservative system with Caprylhydroxamic Acid and Glyceryl Caprylate is gentle and less likely to cause reactions. Xanthan Gum is a safe thickening agent but might cause issues if your baby is allergic. Always do a patch test before using it extensively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients:**  Water, Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Glycerin, Emulsifying Wax, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Avena Sativa Kernel Flour, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, Nasturtium Officinale Flower/Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Spiraea Ulmaria Flower Extract, Xanthan Gum, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Typical ingredients description and side effects\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Emulsifying Wax\n   * Emulsifying Wax is a common ingredient in many types of creams and lotions, including baby lotion. It's used to help mix oil and water, creating a smooth, creamy texture. This allows the product to evenly spread and absorb into the skin. Generally, emulsifying wax is considered to be safe for topical use and is not associated with severe side effects. However, like any ingredient, it may cause problems for certain individuals.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: In some rare cases, emulsifying wax can cause skin irritation. This can result in redness, itchiness, or a slight burning sensation. This is more common in people with sensitive skin.\n      * Allergic Reaction: Though very rare, some individuals might have an allergic reaction to emulsifying wax. This could lead to more severe skin redness, swelling, itchiness, hives, and in the most severe cases, difficulty breathing.\n      * Clogged Pores: Depending on the type of emulsifying wax used and the individual's skin type, there may be a risk of clogged pores, which can lead to breakouts. However, this is less likely with baby lotions, which are typically formulated to be gentle and non-comedogenic.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 5\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tocopheryl Acetate\n   * Tocopheryl Acetate, also known as Vitamin E Acetate, is a form of Vitamin E that is often used in skincare products and cosmetics, including baby lotion. It acts as an antioxidant and skin-conditioning agent. While Tocopheryl Acetate is generally considered safe for use in skincare products, some people may experience side effects, particularly if they have sensitive skin or a specific allergy to the ingredient.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Some people may experience minor skin irritation when using products containing Tocopheryl Acetate. This can manifest as redness, itching, or dryness.\n      * Allergic Reaction: Though it's rare, some individuals may have an allergic reaction to Tocopheryl Acetate. Symptoms of an allergic reaction can include severe skin redness, swelling, hives, and in severe cases, difficulty breathing.\n      * Eye Irritation: If a product containing Tocopheryl Acetate comes into direct contact with the eyes, it may cause eye irritation.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe grading system used by EWG in the Skin Deep database is as follows:\n\n1 to 2: Low hazard\n\n3 to 6: Moderate hazard\n\n7 to 10: High hazard",

It is wonderful for treating all kinds of skin issues, but mixing water and colloidal oats is for all intents and purposes making a weak batch of oatmeal.\n\nLeucidal Liquid SF is wholly inadequate for this purpose.\n\nQuoting from a [thread at chemistscorner](https://chemistscorner.com/cosmeticsciencetalk/#/discussion/5596/improve-lotion-skin-absorption-and-impart-non-greasy-texture):\n\n> Leucidal SF has proven to be ineffective. AMT has added the Coconut AMTCide to the product and the combination is Leucidal Complete. It still has some gaps in yeast/mold coverage. It also needs to be used as part of a hurdle technique and the final Formulation should be sent off for PET (Challenge Testing). \n\nFurther down is noted:\n\n> Much more reliable is Dermosoft 1388 combined with Dermosoft PEA (Sodium Levulinate, Sodium Anisate + Phenethyl Alcohol) all from Evonik/Dr. Straetmans.  \n\nHowever any 'natural' preservative should be regarded as suspect unless done with extreme caution in sanitary preparation followed with a challenge test.\n\nIf you are worried about skin reactions, parabens are very well tolerated and have been used for decades safely in small amounts in topical products. \n\nYou can use hemp oil -- it is pretty good, but it oxidizes (goes rancid) quickly, and it is very thin.  \n\nI do not know if lecithin will work.",

        "body": "Since you mentioned the scrub making your face super red, I wonder if you're not dealing with a bit of overexfoliation from 2x daily BHA and a nightly washcloth (physical exfoliation).  I have skin that easily  reddens, not rosacea, but my understanding is that rosacea skin doesn't like a lot exfoliation, either. \n\n\nHave you tried backing off of BHA for a few days to see what happens? Since you're using it in the AM and PM it might be contributing to the redness. Skin can change, so even if it's been fine for years, it might be too much for you right now. \n\nYou might have to carefully pull products out of you routine for a couple weeks (for each one, one at a time) to make sure nothing has turned into a trigger.\n\nAHA can help with dull skin and closed comedones. But it will require a more powerful sunscreen put on to the the proper 1/4 tsp+ amount. That's more than a moisturizer can give you.  Slip up and the AHA photosensitized skin gets a sunburn. :/   \nProbably best to up the sun protection whether you add AHA or not.. \nAlso, AHA can sting if you're skin isn't healthy and usually causes some redness/flushing. Adding it now might be outright painful. \n\nNiacinamide can help pull out redness/flushing temporarily. So can products with licorice root extract.  (A US available lotion with niacinamide + ceramides is CeraVe PM. But I don't know how the rosacea community rates it) \n\nBut, you might need to see a dermatologist to double check on how your rosacea is doing. Maybe, it has changed? (aging-hormone levels, life, weather, diet, etc cause skin changes :\\ )\n\nBe super careful on measurement with DIYing, too.",

    "body": "Hi friends,\nSo I'm not quite back to experimenting just yet, but I want to have a framework for approaching this in my head once I am:\n\nI'd like to make a fragrant body oil. Not a Perfume oil, a body oil. My research shows a concentrate/essence concentration of 1-3% in commercial applications. I realize I can play with this a little but I don't know the extent to which that's true. Here's the rub: I remain on my ambery musk train and probably won't be getting off until I get these to work for me.\n\n**So the notes are likely:** &#10;\n- Ambroxan (definitely. I'd like this to be Ambroxan heavy, even overdose levels. Will likely experiment with Ambrofix) &#10;\n\n- Ambrette Seed (possibly. Steam or CO2 distilled. I'm looking to see if I like the way it combines with ambroxan and maybe Ethylene Brassylate) &#10;\n\n- Ethylene Brassylate (maybe. extremely likely that I have some sort of sensitivity to this. So if I can replace it with something like the ambrette seed oil or a similar enough AC then I'm open to that). &#10;\n\n- Zenolide (probably. I have some and I know musks often need reinforcement) &#10;\n\nI'm definitely a bit nose blind so picking up on these notes has been harder in blended products, though I still smell Ambroxan on it's own in crystal and powder form. &#10;\n\n\n**What I've tried before:** \n\nWhen I've tried this before the ratios were 3:1:1. So 3 parts Ambroxan (at anywhere from 10% - 30% dilution) to 1 part EB and 1 part Zenolide. When added at 3% concentration to a carrier like FCO or Argan I got barely any fragrance. The Ambrette seed introduces a wrinkle and some room for fun, but I don't see how it would change the final outcome which to date has been barely any scent. &#10;\n\n\n**As for the carrier:** \n\nEither FCO + IPM or a more complex blend of nearly odorless oils. Candidates include: Sunflower Seed Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Safflower Seed Oil, Rosehip Fruit Oil, Avocado Oil and Vitamin E Oil for preservation &#10;\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nI'm hoping to make an ambroxan heavy (+ maybe other musks) body oil. Not perfume oil. I'd love thoughts on creating one that's actually fragrant/perceptible given the ingredients. I haven't had much luck in the past.",

        "body": "Note, ambroxan is a molecule that can block receptors quite fast and for a prolonged time, meaning the higher the concentration the more likely you'll get nose blind anyway. And as a body oil gets spread on a large area, in this case less is more holds even truer than would be the case anyway.\n\nIf you like ambrette seed, I'd go for the CO2 extract or the absolute. \n\nAs you only use very base notes, it's likely you don't smell much at first anyway, though.\n\nFor the oil base, I would suggest using plant derived squalan, IPM, jojoba oil, a bit of cetyl alcohol and Vitamine E (note: do NOT use Vitamin E Acetate! It is far more stable thus has hardly any antioxidant properties\\* as is, only when it gets metabolised to Vitamin E again in the skin it does have such an effect - but not on the product before use, so it does not preserve anything!), if you want to go fancy, the addition of 0.2% magnolia bark extract would have both, antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*The perpose of an antioxidant is *to get oxidised* instead of other molecules. If it gets stabilised and thus is hard to oxidise it *loses its function,* in case of tocopheryl acetate at least in the product.",

    "body": "“Does the world need yet another weight loss pill?!!”\n\nThat’s the first question we asked when we heard about Lean Belly 3X. If anything, the world needs less hyped up weight loss ‘miracles in a bottle’.\n\nBut here’s what made us sit up and take notice…\n\nWe discovered that Shaun Hadsall’s name was associated with the product. In fact, he is the creator of this product. Anybody who has been in the online fitness industry long enough knows that Shaun is a legend.\n\nHe has had several bestselling products such as The 4-Cycle Solution which focused on carb cycling and the Over 40 Hormone Reset. Both products sold thousands of copies for years and had rave reviews.\n\nSince Shaun is highly credible, we had to check out what Lean Belly 3X was all about… and we definitely were NOT disappointed…\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Good Points:\n\n1) The sales page is fantastic for 1 reason - you’re not forced to watch a never-ending video. Just as you want to exit the page, you’re presented with a ‘transcript’ version which makes for easy reading.\n\nThe page is informative and tells you all you need to know. So often, weight loss pills have skimpy sales pages that don’t tell you much. Lean Belly 3X is very transparent.\n\n2) Lots of testimonials and photos on the official website lends credibility to the product. There’s a ton of social proof that’s undeniable. The product delivers what it says it will. \n\n3) The ingredients used in the manufacture of Lean Belly 3X are natural and safe. The 2 main ingredients are: 1,500mg safflower seed oil and 5mg black pepper extract. Unlike most weight loss products which contain harmful additives to boost your metabolism, etc. this product will have no adverse effects for most people.\n\n4) Lean Belly 3X will stabilize your blood sugar levels. Once that’s achieved, your body will be less likely to store fats. It’ll also become much easier to lose weight. Keeping your blood sugar levels stable is imperative for achieving successful weight loss.\n\n5) The piperine in the black pepper extract will help to prevent the formation of new fat cells while also boosting your metabolism. This is a win-win situation. Not only will you store less fat, but you’ll also burn more fat now. The end result – a leaner you in no time at all.\n\n6) Lean Belly 3X claims to lower your bad cholesterol levels too. The only way to know this for sure will be to do a blood test before and after you take it. But generally, as you lose weight, your cholesterol levels tend to drop too.\n\n7) The product is easy to consume. 2 softgels in the morning and 2 in the evening. That’s it. No juicing. No mixing powders in water. None of that. \n\n8) Lean Belly 3X is manufactured in an FDA-approved facility and has been tested in 3rd party laboratories. It is safe for consumption. No worries here.\n\n9) The product is covered by a 60-day money back guarantee. Zero risk on your part here. This is an opportunity for you to try this product risk-free.\n\n10) There’s a fantastic bonus that accompanies Lean Belly 3X. Not only do you get the pills, but you’ll also get a free 7-Day Fat Burning Meal Plan. You’ll learn how to time your meals, how to combine foods and how to optimize your fat-burning hormones.\n\nArmed with this knowledge, it’s almost impossible not to lose weight successfully.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Bad Points:\n\n1) Lean Belly 3X works… BUT it’s not a crutch for a poor diet or a sedentary lifestyle. Let’s not forget, you’ll still need to be at a caloric deficit to see weight loss. Exercise will also help to boost your metabolism.\n\nSo, Lean Belly 3X gives you the edge to accelerate weight loss, but it’s a complement and not a substitute for exercise and a sensible diet - no matter what the sales page says.\n\n2) How many bottles you need will depend on your excess weight. If you’re 60 pounds overweight, you may need more than 6 bottles. \n\nWhile a 180-day supply will help you lose quite a bit of weight, it goes without saying that weight loss takes time, and you may need another 3 bottles to get you to your goal weight. So, don’t expect 6 bottles to get you to your dream body if 9 is what you need.\n\n3) This product is only available online. So, you’ll need to wait about 3-5 days for it to reach you. Fast, but not immediate.\n\n4) It’s not for people below 18 years of age and not for women who are pregnant or nursing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould You Get It?\n\nWe’ll be honest with you here. We were sold the moment we saw Shaun Hadsall’s name associated with it. The man’s a pro and knows his stuff. \n\nHe has generated tons of sales with his previous winning products. It’s almost as if he has the Midas touch when it comes to weight loss programs/products… and there’s a good reason for it.\n\nHis products are high-quality and they work. Lean Belly 3X would be a flop if it didn’t deliver results. Just look at the testimonials and before/after photos on the official website. What more could you ask for?\n\nThe product is affordable and only costs about $1.30 a day. And you’re covered by a 60-day unconditional money back guarantee. It’s almost as if Shaun is paying you to try his product.\n\nThat’s all the motivation you really need. Give Lean Belly 3X a try and in about 30 days, you’ll see and feel the difference. This is a risk-free investment in your health. \n\nA month from now, you can either be leaner or you can be heavier. It’s your choice. Whichever way you go, you can bet that Lean Belly 3X will still be a bestseller and others will be benefitting from it.\n\nYou might as well use this supplement and join them. You’ll thank yourself later. Give Lean Belly 3X a chance to transform your body today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\>>> [Get “Lean Belly 3X” Now](https://29e27g16-dcyky2-ow2fjtcj1h.hop.clickbank.net/?cbpage=thyroid&tid=rdt) <<<",

Lean Belly 3X, which contains safflower seed oil and conjugated linoleic acid, is said to help with weight reduction, fat burning, among other benefits.\n\nLean Belly 3X is a simpler alternative to traditional weight-loss approaches for middle-aged individuals who find it tough to undertake such strenuous lifestyles. The process of aging is unavoidable. However, in addition to enhancing life productivity, Lean Belly 3X has a definite ability to slow down premature aging and metabolic rusting.\n\nThe capsules should be taken in the morning before breakfast, according to the producers, to jumpstart the metabolism. Aside from impaired metabolism, aging can cause a variety of additional concerns, such as hormone imbalance and bodily inflammation, all of which can contribute to weight gain.\n\nKaren and Shaun Hadsell have developed Lean Belly 3X, which may be a feasible answer for many of these concerns, in order to bring this issue to a common ground. It may melt away stubborn fat from the tummy, thighs, and hips without harming any other portion of the body. It promises to do the following: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Fat loss that is both natural and safe \n* Tone muscles, particularly those in the abdomen and hips. \n* Improve one's quality of life\n* Control weight loss hormones \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis effective fat-burning supplement's components were picked after extensive study, with each component supported by many trials. According to a research published in Nutrients, conjugated linoleic acid can have a significant role in the prevention of illnesses such as cancer, atherosclerosis, obesity, and poor microbiota function.\n\nThe components in Lean Belly 3X were extracted from high-quality sources. As the name implies, this nutritional supplement has the capacity to burn belly fat 3 times faster than traditional methods for people reach their forties.\n\n[Click Here](https://dietetics-health-fitness.blogspot.com/2021/04/lean-belly-3x-review-can-ingredients-in.html) to know more.",

Some of these are highlighted below:\n\n**Okinawan Fenugreek**: This ingredient, which is traditionally used in a variety of products due to its anti-aging properties, is native to Okinawa, a Japanese island. It works to hydrate, rejuvenate, and firm the skin, and is a rich source of natural anti-aging ingredients that help to improve skin texture.\n\n**Retinol**: One of the most potent ingredients in the mixture, retinol - also known as vitamin A - is often referred to as the \"Holy Grail\" of anti-aging. It helps to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines, and also works to shrink large open pores, leaving the skin with a smooth finish.\n\n**Safflower Seed Oil**: This type of oil contains thymoquinone, a natural antioxidant that fights free radicals to reduce inflammation and keep the skin hydrated.\n\n**Vitamin E and C**: The formula includes a beneficial amount of these two vitamins, as they are some of the most effective natural antioxidants and help to reduce inflammation.\n\n**Vitamin D**: This vitamin, which the body naturally produces when the skin is exposed to sunlight, is essential for promoting anti-aging effects, hormone production, and boosting immunity.\n\n**Potassium**: Also found on the Japanese island of Okinawa, potassium is considered a natural moisturizer for the skin. It helps to rejuvenate cells and provides a youthful glow, as well as protection against external damage to the skin.\n\n**Shea Butter**: This antioxidant-rich ingredient is used as the base of the formula. Its linoleic acid content moisturizes and protects the skin from free radical damage, while its high concentration of oleic fatty acids helps to boost the skin's protective barrier. Additionally, it has been shown to stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Tilia Cordata Flower Extract**: In addition to its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, this extract is known for its skin-conditioning benefits. Its unique scent and calming effect make it a popular choice in skincare products. It can also help to repair free-radical-induced damage and protect against future damage.\n\n**Sage leaf extract:**  This natural ingredient is utilized in oils, ointments, and creams to decrease the likelihood of eczema and psoriasis while enhancing the state of skin prone to acne.\n\n# Benefits of Revisil\n\n[Revisil can rejuvenate the skin and improve its health in just a few weeks of use](https://mwebaction.com/7626/1250/2/?), without any potentially irritating chemicals as it is made entirely of natural ingredients. \n\nIt is highly effective in treating skin damage, especially on the outer layer, and penetrates deep into the skin's cells to revitalize them. \n\nThis product can even erase signs of aging and acne scars, giving the skin a youthful and radiant appearance. It has been shown to reduce the visible effects of aging, making users look up to 15 years younger. Additionally, Revisil can restore suppleness to the skin and promote the healing of environmental damage.\n\n# Why choose Revisil?\n\nMany individuals are unaware that their personality and self-esteem undergo changes as they age, but those who recognize this phenomenon strive to address the symptoms through natural means. While waiting, one can continue to inquire about the product or business. For example, is it a sound investment? Are there any long-term effects associated with it? How critical is it to adhere to strict skincare standards? Is there a specific diet that should be followed in conjunction with Revisil treatment?\n\nRevisil's marketing materials proudly declare that it is made without artificial ingredients and has not been linked to any negative side effects. Its gentle formula makes it safe to use on the face without fear of irritation, and it does not require any special attention or dietary restrictions. However, with regular use, users will notice a remarkable improvement in their skin's texture and the reduction of fine lines. This treatment is successful because it activates a protein in the body called telomerase. When applied to the skin, it acts as a barrier to protect the underlying cells from damage. In other words, it stimulates natural cell regeneration, which results in a youthful and healthy appearance.\n\n# What are the best ways to bring back a youthful glow?\n\nThere is a wide variety of formulas available in the market, each boasting its ability to make the skin appear younger, eliminate wrinkles, and firm up the skin. Nevertheless, customers may be unaware of the possible adverse effects of these creams and serums.

I've seen a lot about dry oils lately (most because Shea Moisture has a ton in drug stores), and I'm wondering if they're worth trying. I want something that is light and easily/quickly absorbed but that is still high quality.\n\nThe main ingredient in the Shea Moisture dry oils is safflower seed oil, and Neutrogena has a light body oil whose main ingredients are isopropyl myristate, sesame oil, and PEG 40. Do either of these sound like a good options? If not, are there any alternatives you'd recommend? I know jojoba oil is great, but is it also heavy/slow-absorbing?",

    "body": "  \n\nBeauty and skin health are considered important factors that represent overall well-being in humans. But unfortunately, as we get older our skin shows signs of aging earlier than we would like.\n\nWhile most people know that eating healthfully and using sunscreen are good ways to take care of their skin, the reality is that a lot more can be done. The following tips will help you look your best, feel good and stay healthy.\n\nA great way to fight aging is to start out by using effective, noninvasive treatments to prevent your skin from going into deeper stages of aging.\n\n## What is Triple Anti-Aging Cream?\n\nTriple Anti-Ageing Cream is a revolutionary anti-aging solution that helps your skin look younger than ever. It improves the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and even dark circles with the help of a combination of scientifically-proven active ingredients.\n\nThis anti-aging cream won't include any invasive surgeries, painful injections or expensive laser treatments. It's the perfect option for those who don't want to go under the knife. Just rub the cream on your skin every night and you'll see results in no time!\n\nMoisturizing, brightening, and soothing, this sunscreen is clinically proven to help protect your skin from the sun. With SPF 50+, this product blocks UVA and UVB rays and protects you from damage.\n\nHow Triple Anti Aging Cream works?\n\nAs you get older, your skin ages more. Your skin loses its elasticity and becomes thinner. Because of this, your skin starts to sag, wrinkle and become dark. Aging can take a toll on your skin.\n\nThere are a number of factors that may cause loss of skin collagen and these include exposure to sunlight, smoking, stress, environmental pollution, excess sugar, diet, lack of exercise, and hormonal imbalances. The results are usually visible after 20 years of age and there is no way to prevent them.\n\nTriple anti aging cream is a product that promises to restore youthful skin. It works by restoring the collagen in the skin. The wrinkle cream is enriched with peptides which work as potent antioxidants.\n\nTo ensure that a product's active ingredients can be delivered quickly, efficiently, and effectively, manufacturers look to the use of bio-enhancers. These enhancers increase the absorption rate of the active ingredients and ultimately, this leads to increased efficacy in treating your customers.\n\n## Science behind Triple Anti-Aging Cream\n\nAccording to the [Triple Anti-Aging Cream](https://imyreview.com/triple-anti-aging-cream-reviews-does-it-really-work-scam/) manufacturers, this product helps maintain and even improve the skin's firmness and elasticity by providing natural collagen molecules to the skin. This is accomplished by using a highly concentrated, potent formula that helps the skin produce new collagen. Collagen is the key protein that keeps skin youthful.\n\nAs we age, our body produces less collagen in the dermal layer of the skin. Collagen is a protein that helps give skin elasticity and support its structure. When our bodies don’t produce enough collagen, the result can be wrinkles and loose skin. These peptides help stimulate the production of collagen, making the skin firmer and looking younger for years to come.\n\nIn the triple anti-aging cream, peptides are added in the right proportion to tackle skin aging. It also moisturizes and nourishes the skin for longer hours so that users feel rejuvenated. Dullness and laxity of skin cells can be prevented by this breakthrough formula.As there are no harmful chemicals involved, users say that it is safe for all skin types.\n\n## Triple Anti-Aging Cream ingredients\n\nThe manufacturer has added the effective list of extracts that are natural, pure and backed by studies. Each of them is added in precise amount for effective blend that could deliver the desired results.\n\nWater is vital to the human body. In fact, your body uses a lot of water, and it needs to be replenished regularly.\n\nGlycerin is a transparent, colorless, flammable liquid composed of a tri-ester of glycerol and fatty acids. It is widely used as a humectant in cosmetics and as an ingredient in many household cleaning products.\n\nShea butter is a natural moisturizer that moisturizes the skin and helps to prevent aging.\n\nOther ingredients:\n\nAloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice Extract.\n\nSafflower Seed Oil.\n\nCetyl Alcohol.\n\nGlyceryl Stearate.\n\nCaprylic Capric Triglycerides.\n\nPalmitoyl Dipeptide.\n\nSilica.",

    "body": "As a makeup enthusiast, I’ve tried my fair share of cleansing balms, but none have quite lived up to the hype like the [**Clinique Take The Day Off Cleansing Balm Makeup Remover**.](https://amzn.to/4aYDuQ7)\n\nThis cult-favorite product has been around for years, and for good reason. It’s incredibly effective at removing even the most stubborn makeup, without stripping my skin of its natural oils.\n\n## What I Like About It\n\n### Melting Power\n\nThis balm truly melts away makeup like magic. I’ve used it to remove everything from full-coverage foundation and waterproof mascara to glitter eyeshadow and liquid lipstick. It doesn’t matter how long I’ve worn my makeup or how waterproof it is, this balm gets the job done.\n\nNEWS : [Cetaphil Hydrating Eye Gel-Cream Review: Lightweight, Hydrating, and Affordable](https://tipmakeup.com/cetaphil-hydrating-eye-gel-cream-review-lightweight-hydrating-and-affordable/)\n\n### Gentle Formulation\n\nDespite its impressive makeup-removing abilities, this balm is incredibly gentle on my skin. It’s formulated with shea butter and safflower seed oil, which leave my skin feeling soft, hydrated, and soothed. I’ve never experienced any dryness, irritation, or breakouts from using this product.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/fxvh2p7bxa5d1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a385b3438a21f9507b341b43bc9ede8f66fb694)\n\n### Non-Greasy Finish\n\nI was initially worried that this balm would leave my skin feeling greasy or oily, but that’s not the case at all. It rinses off cleanly with warm water, leaving my skin feeling soft and supple. I follow up with a gentle cleanser, but it’s not necessary to do so.\n\n### Versatile Usage\n\nThis balm can be used in multiple ways. I typically use it as a first cleanse to remove my makeup, but it can also be used as a second cleanse or even as a hydrating mask. I like to leave it on my skin for a few minutes before rinsing it off, and it gives my skin a dewy, radiant glow.\n\nNEWS : [Day and Night Collagen Remedial Pax:  Is It Worth the Hype?](https://tipmakeup.com/day-and-night-collagen-remedial-pax-is-it-worth-the-hype/)\n\n### Convenient Packaging\n\nThe jar packaging is sturdy and travel-friendly. I love that it comes with a little spatula to scoop out the product, which keeps it hygienic.\n\n## My Overall Experience\n\nI’ve been using the [**Clinique Take The Day Off Cleansing Balm Makeup Remover**](https://amzn.to/4aYDuQ7) for years now, and it’s my absolute holy grail for makeup removal. It’s effective, gentle, and versatile, and it leaves my skin feeling amazing.\n\nI highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a powerful yet gentle makeup remover. I’ve repurchased it countless times, and I don’t plan on stopping anytime soon.\n\nNEWS : [ValITIC Kojic Acid Soap: Effective Dark Spot Remover](https://tipmakeup.com/valitic-kojic-acid-soap-effective-dark-spot-remover/)\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/44pmj1lcxa5d1.png?width=842&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfb916c1557003459f17afc1d96f580d0cded7b9)\n\n## Here are some additional tips for using this balm\n\n* **Warm it up:** The balm is easier to apply and massage into the skin when it’s slightly warmed up. You can warm it up in your hands or by rubbing it between your fingers.\n* **Use a damp washcloth:** When rinsing off the balm, use a damp washcloth to help remove all of the makeup and product.\n* **Follow up with a cleanser:** I always follow up with a gentle cleanser to remove any remaining residue.\n* **Use it as a mask:** Once a week, I like to leave the balm on my skin for a few minutes as a hydrating mask. My skin feels so soft and supple after I rinse it off.\n\nIf you’re looking for a makeup remover that will take your cleansing routine to the next level, I highly recommend the [**Clinique Take The Day Off Cleansing Balm Makeup Remover**](https://amzn.to/4aYDuQ7). It’s a truly amazing product that I can’t imagine my skincare routine without.\n\n**Rating: 5/5 stars**\n\n**I hope this review is helpful!** Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nREAD MORE HERE : [https://tipmakeup.com/](https://tipmakeup.com/)",
