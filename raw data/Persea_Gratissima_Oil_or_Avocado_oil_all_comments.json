    "body": "Alright. So, I moved in with my boyfriend about 4 months ago. We've been together for almost 2 years, but existing in the same apartment has made me acutely aware of his strange behaviors and habits. \n\n\nSince we began dating, I knew how much he cared about his health. He obsessively tracks his diet, works out every single day, and is constantly researching supplements/diet trends. It's all he wants to talk about. It can get annoying, but it hasn't been a deal breaker for me. He's genuinely sweet, emotionally availabile, and my family loves him.\n\n\nHowever, living with him has been a different story. The degree of his obsession has become clear, and it seems to be getting exponentially worse. Here's an example from last month:\n\n\nWe were watching TV after dinner and I got up to get a snack. He asked me if I could grab him some fruit leather. As I was walking back to the couch, I opened it up for him and took a small bite (it was super tiny, like half the size of a dime). He got unreasonably annoyed and explained that he needs to accurately record his caloric intake, and now that I've eaten some, he can't use the total listed on the wrapper. He asked me to grab him a new one but it was the last one in the box. He stormed off and fucking got out the kitchen scale to measure the new weight of the leather to compare it to the weight listed on the wrapper. He barely spoke to me for the rest of the night. I was pretty shocked, but shrugged it off eventually and didn't really think about it again.\n\n\nThat was last month. Yesterday, I discovered something that honestly may lead to the end of our relationship. I got home early from work and rushed straight to the bathroom to pee. On the counter, next to the sink, there was a digital scale (kind of like a postage scale?) with a large cereal bowl resting on top. The bowl caught my eye first because it had a picture of Tommy's face from Rugrats on the inside. I had never seen this bowl before, and picked it up to get a check it out. That's when I got a whiff of something. It was a faint but noticeable smell of poop. \n\n\nNext to the scale there was a spray bottle of avocado oil and a piece of paper with a bunch of numbers written on it. It was a daily calendar. Some days had nothing written by them, others had numbers ranging from 0.25lbs - 1.5lbs\n\n\nAt this point, I was super confused and curious, so I called out to my boyfriend (who works from home). We he got to the bathroom door he looked super fucking pale. I asked him what was up with the scale and Rugrats bowl and he fumbled over some words until he said that his chinchilla (he has a pet chinchilla) has been sick and he's been weighing him to make sure that he's not losing too much weight. \n\n\nThis explained the poo smell, but didn't make any fucking sense in any other way. I told him that theres no way his chinchilla weighs less than a pound and fluctuates that much over a few days. \n\n\nThis is when he broke down. He started tearing up and confessed that he's been weighing his poops for the last year. He went off on this explanation about how it's giving him valuable data about how efficient his metabolism is. I don't know, it was fucking weird. I was disturbed, but I was also curious to know how the process even worked. He said that he holds the bowl under his butt in the toilet while he poops, then dumps it back in after he's taken the weight. He apparently uses the avocado oil to spray down the bowl first so that the poop doesn't stick? I don't know. He's been hiding the scale and bowl under the sink and just forgot to put it away this time. \n\n\nHe keeps trying to convince me that it's not that unusual and there's some people on this weightlifting forum he's a part of that have done it for years. I'm really fucking weirded out, and I'm not sure I can get over it. I slept on the couch last night and told him I needed some space. \n\n\nI don't know what to do. Would you be able to get over something like this? I think this is the end of my relationship...",

I'm telling you right now, as a recovering anorexic, I think he's possibly struggling with eating disorder like behavior. Possibly orthorexia. Eating disorders often have a lot to do with control and anxiety at the root. I'd try and encourage him to start talking to a therapist that has some knowledge of disorders like EDs and OCD.\n\nEdit: since tons of you are bringing this up; body scales are accurate enough for general information and it's disordered to need a hyper specific weight measurement of your poop to the point that you need to poop in a bowl on a hyper sensitive scale and record specific micro weight information about it.

Just logically, if he‚Äôs this concerned about his intake, you took a bite of fruit leather, not his protein shake.  Your small bite was probably like 6 calories/1g of sugar. I don‚Äôt know anyone that into fitness who would be this upset that someone removed a single gram of sugar from their diet.  In terms of fitness it would probably be a positive thing in relation to their goals (unless they‚Äôre diabetic or something).  This reeks of some kind of control disorder and not just a guy overly focused on health.\n\nHe obviously knows the poop bowl is weird or he wouldn‚Äôt be hiding it, and the lying is a red flag, but at least the poop bowl doesn‚Äôt involve him almost blowing up at you over something frankly insignificant.  To me, the fruit leather incident was the bigger red flag.  It shows how rigid he is.\n\nEdit: It is perfectly normal to be annoyed that someone took a bite of your food without asking, especially when you‚Äôre already on a restricted diet.  You‚Äôre already hangry and they took your food.  Totally normal and valid! \n\nThat was not his reasoning.  This man got a scale out to recalculate due to a frankly negligible change in his intake.  I‚Äôve had an eating disorder before and have to say this is disordered behavior.",

    "body": "Background info: I own my own home, and seven months ago GF moved in. We both agreed that it would be unfair for her to contribute to my mortgage, as I am gaining equity and she is not. The agreement that we came up with is that I am responsible for all house expenses (mortgage, HOA dues, taxes, insurance, maintenance) and she is responsible for living expenses (electric, water, internet, streaming, groceries). We had this all hashed out before she moved in.\n\nNow, obviously I'm paying a lot more. I pay $2000 a month, not including regular maintenance. She pays about $500 a month. This is fine by me, as it is what we agreed to. On to the actual conflict.\n\nGF has started getting annoyed about groceries. We keep a list on the fridge both can add too, and she goes shopping once every ten days or so. She says that I put too many \"luxury items\" on the list and it bothers her to buy expensive items she doesn't like. The main offenders are oils (olive, coconut, peanut, avocado), vegan yogurt (am lactose intolerant) and cashews. I admit that all of these things are expensive. However, I do not go through them very quickly. The large oil containers last over a month each. One large container of yogurt lasts over a week. A large container of cashews lasts about three weeks. Only the yogurt needs to be bought frequently, and the large container is just over $5. Furthermore, I do not eat the cheese or milk products she buys, some of which are more expensive (fancy ice cream bars and cheese dips) than what I like.\n\nGF suggested I buy my own \"luxury goods,\" since she doesn't benefit from them. She eats the dishes I cook the oils with, so this isn't necessarily true. Furthermore, this isn't our agreement. She pays no rent, and she'd be paying a lot more than $500 a month in any other roommate situation. When I pointed this out, she became frustrated, saying that's irrelevant since we aren't roommates. I argued that, in addition to being BF & GF, we are also roommates, and some of our conflicts are those that most roommates face. She hated this comparison and ended the discussion abruptly to leave for work, even though she had 20 minutes before she needed to leave.\n\nAITA? Is there a rule I didn't know about calling SOs roommates? Is expecting our agreement to stay consistent an AH move? GF mentioned that these days everyone needs to tighten the belt. Should I be sacrificing more for our relationship?\n\nExtra info: Got back from work and there were too many comments to read all/answer all, so here's the answers to the questions I saw a bunch of before I got overwhelmed and stopped reading.\n\nOil: I don't drink oil or have high cholesterol. Olive oil and avocado oil are used for sauces, salad dressings, etc... Coconut oil I use for currys and stir fries. Peanut oil for sauces and stir fries. All are bought infrequently in large containers because it's cheaper. No more than one (sometimes none) needs to be replenished each month, as I said. They last a long time. I'm not fat or unhealthy.\n\nExpenses: Utilities are not expensive where we live. We are both passionate about energy conservation and use very little electricity and water. The utilities are still in my name, she just logs into my account to pay them. I see exactly how much they are. It's $120 a month for water and electric. Internet is $60 a month. GF goes Shopping every ten days. She spends about $90 per shop. I've seen receipts. That's $270. IDK why so many of you spend $1000 a month on groceries. I recommend cooking homemade meals like I do. It's very inexpensive. Dried goods like rice, pasta, beans, cost pennies per serving. In season produce that grows in our region is affordable. I don't know how much she pays for streaming, as I didn't have it before she moved in. If it's more than $50 a month, then she should cancel one, because that's ridiculous.\n\nMy finances: I'm not house poor and can afford my mortgage. My mortgage is still cheaper than renting. I do not need my girlfriend to \"subsidize\" my house. I paid all of my own bills before she moved in and would be able to continue doing so without her.\n\nUpdate: After GF got back from her work thing and we had breakfast, we talked about finances as many suggested. Turns out she had a dispute (where she was 100% in the right) with the insurance agency that refers most of her clients. They haven't referred her to anyone since. So she's been making do with word of mouth referrals and had only been getting a fraction of the business she was before.\n\nApparently her parents have been paying her car payment/insurance as well as her phone for the last couple of months, but she's still not making enough. She didn't tell me because she was embarrassed and thought she could find a different insurance company to work with. However, the agent she was working with badmouthed her, so that didn't happen either.\n\nI asked her to move out, since I don't feel comfortable financially supporting her, and she no longer has a stable income. Also, it sounds like she's going to have to move if she wants to keep doing the work she currently does. She agreed to leave by the end of the month. Thanks for all of the advice/perspective.",

Which I get, and have allowed in our house this whole time despite being allergic to it (it won‚Äôt kill me but I have oral allergy syndrome and the main culprit is avocado. I get hives when I even eat avocado oil, and sometimes when using any skin care products with avocado in them)\n\nMy husband walked into the bedroom tonight to give me a taste of the salad he just made. He didn‚Äôt actually give me a bite with avocado so I didn‚Äôt think anything of it until my gums started burning. I walked into the kitchen and saw the grocery receipt which said two hass avocados on it. I asked him if he put avocado in the salad and he said ‚Äúoh yeah don‚Äôt freak out, I totally forgot I put avocado in there‚Äù\n\nThe first time was when he cooked tuna steaks with avocado oil and my entire arm broke out in hives. \n\nI took two Benadryl and am now waiting for my gums to stop feeling like hot fire but in the middle of yelling at him I told him no more fucking avocados in this house, he can eat them at restaurants and literally everywhere else but if he can‚Äôt keep it from me then they‚Äôre banned. He just said he was sorry he forgot. I feel like this is my only solution. So AITA?",

Why not avocado oil if wanting to add flavor, or a more neutral oil if someone wants the fat but not the flavor? This article talks a lot about it in terms of marketing, but doesn't go into all of the specifics: [https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/21/business/starbucks-oleato/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/21/business/starbucks-oleato/index.html)",

        "body": "answer: The fats in any oil can be emulsified as they are in dairy milk. At your grocer, there may be mayonnaises based on olive, soybean, avocado, and canola oils. The emulsifier can come from egg, soy or other plant lecithins.\n\nSo, there's no issue with making an olive oil emulsion to add to coffee drinks.\n\nWhy olive oil? Because olive oil has broad public understanding as a 'healthy oil'. It probably is, but there are other contenders. It's helps with marketing. And it can be much cheaper for Starbucks than branded plant-based milks, as there's not much olive oil (by weight) in an emulsion.\n\nIs this necessary? Fat emulsions like dairy milk or perhaps this olive oil emulsion reduce bitterness in extracts of dark roasted coffee. Coffees subject to lighter roasts don't have as many bitter compounds, and their taste doesn't benefit as much, even at all, with the the addition of emulsions. \n\nStarbucks is notorious in the specialty/third wave coffee world for over-roasting their beans, removing all origin character. They sell mainly dairy milk drinks with dark roasted coffee flavoring, to cut through the taste muting effect of the emulsion.",

Cappuccino, for instance, is a morning drink, so don‚Äôt try ordering it for an afternoon pick-me-up. In most cafes, coffee is consumed standing at the counter, and variations are few, usually involving only the amount of water and/or milk to be added.\n\n>Still, Starbucks, which breaks all those rules with its long menu of options that are served at any time of day, opened here in 2018 and has amassed a following. On Wednesday, the company bet on Italy once more with a combination of two ingredients at the heart of this country‚Äôs food pyramid: coffee and olive oil.\n\n>The new beverages, branded Oleato, debuted this week at an invitation-only dinner (co-hosted with the National Chamber of Italian Fashion) at the Starbucks Reserve Roastery in Milan on Tuesday, the first day of Fashion Week. Lizzo performed. Vogue‚Äôs top editor in America, Anna Wintour, attended.\n\n>On Wednesday, Oleato, which can mean oiled, oleate or greaseproof in Italian (and which is now trademarked by Starbucks), was introduced to the masses at the company‚Äôs flagship Italian venue in downtown Milan. Five olive oil-infused beverages were on the menu, including the golden foam espresso martini, which concluded the dinner.\n\nand this is from the Starbucks website:\n\n* >Starbucks Oleato‚Ñ¢ Caff√® Latte \nStarbucks Blonde Espresso Roast, a light roast that is smooth and subtly sweet, is infused with Partanna extra virgin olive oil and steamed with creamy oatmilk to create a velvety smooth, deliciously lush latte. \n\n* >\"Starbucks Oleato‚Ñ¢ Iced Shaken Espresso\nThis coffee-forward beverage offers layers of flavor sweetened with notes of hazelnut, rich espresso and creamy oatmilk infused with Partanna extra virgin olive oil.\n\n* >\"Starbucks Oleato‚Ñ¢ Golden Foam‚Ñ¢ Cold Brew \nThe inviting aroma of lush Partanna extra virgin olive oil infused cold foam cascades slowly through the dark, smooth cold brew, creating a subtle sweetness in the beverage.",

With a little bit of fat in the coffee it get's processed into your system slower and your caffeine boost rolls in less quickly and lasts a little longer. I liked the \"pat of butter in coffee\" thing but it was too much work in the morning and getting extra stuff dirty just to do the emulsion.\n\nSidenote, I don't drink or support or even like Starbucks.

    "body": "Today I finally hit that -150 milestone. It's been a long and interesting journey to this point. I don't dare come here to offer advice and try to sound like some kind of expert because what worked for me may not work for you.\n\nInstead, I hope this posts finds someone discouraged in a journey who thinks the effort (especially in the holiday season) isn't worth it. Or maybe it'll find someone who thinks they are hopeless because of how bad their health situation has gotten. To you folks, I want you to know that it's possible and that it's most definitely worth the effort.\n\nI started at 425 pounds in 2018. From March to November of 2018, I lost 130 to get down to 295. Then I got complacent. Then there was a global pandemic, and I got lazy. Then by July of this year I was up to 332, and I decided to get my act together for good. Since starting again in July, I'm down 57 pounds to 275, for a total of 150 pounds lost.\n\nHere's a little side-by-side. On the left is 1/1/2018 at a New Year's celebration. On the right is me walking in a Christmas parade this past weekend.  [https://imgur.com/a/1ZssEvI](https://imgur.com/a/1ZssEvI)\n\nHave a great day, everyone. Press on; I know it's not easy, but I promise it's worth every bit of the effort.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  \nSeveral people have asked about what I've done, so I'm sharing here. But remember that what works for 1 person may not be the best solution for someone else.  \n\nWe started with Whole 30. 30 days became 60, then 90, then 120...so we kept going. The Whole 30 plan has changed a bit, but I think white potatoes is the biggest difference between then and now. We didn't (and still don't) eat white potatoes. That was with ZERO cheating...I was losing about a pound a day for a bit, then .75 per day, then about half a pound per day. It was a crazy year, and I dropped a lot.  \n\nPart of adding stuff back to the diet caused me to find some food allergies (or at least sensitivities) that I didn't know I had. These include gluten and corn, so when I avoid those, I'm typically being pretty healthy. But I was still gaining weight by eating too much (and too much sugar).  \n\nSo in July I started trying to focus on being better about quantity and quality. Some rules I follow:\n\n 1. 3 meals per day, no snacking. Breakfast is about 350 calories, lunch is 500-600, dinner is 600-700 for a total in the ballpark of 1800. I'm male, 44, 6'5\" tall. If you're female or tiny, that could be too much food.  \n\n2. No food after 8pm. \n\n3. No drinks after 10pm. \n\n4. No sugar. \n\n5. Limit \"empty\" carbs. This is pretty much just rice for me since I can't have corn or bread. If I have rice, it'll just be a little (maybe 1/3 cup cooked). If I get a burger, it's without bun. I try to focus on protein and fat.  \n\n6. Good fats over bad fats - I cook with olive oil, coconut oil, avocado oil, and ghee.   \n\n7. Lean meats over fatty meats - I trend toward chicken, turkey, and shrimp. Fish works, but I don't love fish. I get pork or beef sometimes, but I try to focus more on the leaner meats.  \n\n8. Water, water, water. I drink about a gallon a day. I have no science to prove this helps, but I believe it has helped me, so I try to keep it up.  \n\n9. Focus on sleep schedule. I try to keep my sleep schedule consistent, and I feel that it helps my body with the weight loss. Maybe there's science here, but maybe I just think it helps. Either way, I try to go to bed by midnight for a 7:30 alarm.  \n\n10. I drink water, unsweetened tea, or club soda. No sodas or sweet drinks of any kind, including alcohol.",

I whipped it with avocado oil and jojoba oil and am loving it\n\n- I started slugging with Aquaphor and I‚Äôm loving it. ( twice a week )\n\n- I don‚Äôt use sunscreen daily ( I‚Äô m not advising that anyone does this, this is just what I do) I live in NYC and I struggle with low vitamin D levels. I don‚Äôt get much sun in the winter months even when I try. My natural complexion is a lot darker than this. I make it a point to get 20 min of sun a day if possible. During summer if I know I‚Äôm gonna be out more than 20 minutes I use mineral sunscreen.\n\n\n\nThings that I believe might affect my skin non-topical:\n\n- I do red light therapy 5 times a week with a mitopro 300 panel \n\n- Face Yoga ( polina on Youtube) she‚Äôs helped my neck enormously \n\n- Hydration. I have a reverse osmosis system and remineralize our water with trace minerals. I also take LMNT for hydration\n\n- I exercise\n\n- Guasha\n\n- I recently purchased the theraface. Has it changed my life? No. Does it make me feel good? yes lol\n\n\n\n** I‚Äôve posted about using Retinoid/Retinols before and how I believe it caused my eyebrow and hair to fall out - I suspect due to Vitamin A toxicity.

If you‚Äôre a curly hair with low porosity hair ( or if you don‚Äôt know what that means do a google search and test ) this hair routine will not work for you if you have low porosity.\n\n2) This hair routine is for winter. It‚Äôs still cold and dry here and my hair and scalp have a tendency to be dry - I initially was misdiagnosed with dandruff from a certified dermatologist who knew nothing about curly hair and scalp. She was wrong. I had dried scalp and was making things worse by treating it like dandruff. All is well now since I figured it out on my own lol\n\n3) Hair Shampoo and Conditioners I use and Love:\n-Alba Organics- they have a mango one that is my favorite ( surprise surprise the carribean girl liking mango products lol )\nBut honestly all their shampoos and conditioners I love and alternate.\n- Dessert of Essence Lemon + teatree shampoo and conditioner\n- Jason Aloe Vera Shampoo and Conditioner \n\n4) deep conditioners: \n- hot coconut oil deep conditioner weekly treatments in the winter. I apply coconut oil in liquid form, add water and put a plastic cap on and sometimes I add heat.\n- I use Camille Rose Algae deep conditioner sometimes\n- I sometimes also use Innersense Deep Conditioner\n\n5) Styling \n- creme ( any thick cream I can get my hands on- right now i‚Äôm using Curl maker by camille rose but I hate the smell)\n- I also use Aveda sometimes when I can buy at discount ( the green botanical line or the pink line ) creme\n\n6) Hair Gel\nCurrently using camille rose but again hate the smell. I guess too bad because I have to finish the bottle lol\n- used Innersense and loved it\n- also used Aveda and liked it\n\n7) Mousse\n- Camille Rose but again hate the smell\n- Innersense has a good mouse\n\nI have a Dyson diffuser( a gift from my husband because I would never be able to justify the price even though I do genuinely LOVE it) I heard the Shark one works as well too.\n\nAfter I apply all styling products in the shower I use a denman brush to soft style and then step out of the shower and diffuse and create a ‚Äúcast‚Äù look up curly hair cast on Youtube.\nThen, I slowly break the cast.\n\nSo to simplify- \n1) shampoo\n2) conditioner\n3) deep conditioner hot oil treatment ( I rinse it out but don‚Äôt shampoo it out- this might not work for everyone depending on how thirsty your hair is.\n4) hair creme\n5) gel\n6) mouse\n7) hair diffuse and create cast\n8) Break the cast",

My hair is proper 4c and I've always been told I have very tight coils. üòÖ I wish I had more zoomed in images but if you zoom into these ones you might see my hair literally looks like those tight grey springs. It's very short and it makes me shy but the people in my life make me feel confident enough to wear it out. I hope I can inspire someone to wear their short 4c hair out. ",

    "body": "**a little back story:**\n\ni want to preface this by saying that i spent ten years subscribing to fat acceptance logic, ultimately believing calorie-counting etc. was incongruous with my feminist politics. i still believe fatphobia is a thing; i grew up in a family that was pretty fatphobic, and my parents were consistently derogatory about my aunt's weight. she was morbidly obese and died of bowel cancer in her early 60s. her death was clearly related to her weight but at the time i was just sad that my dad couldn't even have a funeral for her without commenting on her size in pictures. so i know the reasons why fat acceptance logic gets lodged in your brain - it's angering that fat folks are dehumanised to the extent they are, and yes 100% i think that it's wrapped up in misogyny. \n\nanyway, i was a tall and slender child but also gender-nonconforming from a young age. idk if i would consider myself trans now but i was always non-binary as hell as a kid. puberty and adolescence was extremely traumatic as a queer in a rural village with a lot of homophobia and transphobia at school. so i was body conscious as fuck and desperate to fit in, but always remember riding the wave of my slimness and tallness to insulate me from the additional shame of having excess fat. then i discovered alcohol in my early teens and drank consistently to deal with my sadness, for a very long time. at university this habit really took flight, and wasn't helped by the fact that from my late teens throughout my 20s, i was a touring musician. i was in bars and venues almost every weekend, and often for stretches of a few weeks at a time. my eating and drinking habits went out the window, particularly because payments for gigs for many years incorporated drinks riders and buy-outs. i got used to the idea that i was just going to be 'hench' or a 'big, strong person', which also fitted with my identity as a relatively masculine-of-centre woman who is also a guitarist. \n\ni discovered exercise properly at about 27, when i decided to try and learn how to jog for my mental health. i loved it but felt like i could never advance properly because i was always recovering from drinking or eating too much. i was vegetarian from age 20 to 29 so was also riding the wave of not eating meat, in terms of my weight remaining relatively stable, despite being above healthy BMI. then i met my partner, a food-loving canadian who is just over 4 years younger than me. she introduced me to the world of north american meat: chicken wings, ribs... we enjoyed ourselves so much as we were getting to know each other but good god: because i hadn't eaten meat really as an adult, i was on meat holiday in a big way. i really went to town, and the whole time i was reading more and more fat acceptance stuff, learning from fat activists in my music scene and community, and touring more than i ever had in my life. i could sense myself expanding but was becoming gradually more alienated from my own body. at the same time, i was deepening my relationship to running, and even did a half marathon. so i was like: yeah, big people can be athletic! and eat whatever they want! woo! \n\nNOT woo. so from 28 to 31, i was doing a phd. the last year, in particular, involved pretty much sitting all day long. my eating habits and alcohol consumption were also beginning to make exercise less appealing and less possible; i would go for runs and have to break every 10 minutes. alcohol was having a cumulative effect on my mental health: i would have terrible insomnia, i couldn't regulate my temperature, i was consumed with negative thoughts about myself, i had eroding trust in other people and was convinced this was just what life became when you lived in a capitalist hellscape. obviously i figured the best way to deal with these emotions and mental illness was just to....keep drinking whisky and eating M&Ms. and this is the kind of shit i was consuming on instagram too: that i should just listen to my intuition and eat whatever i want because that is self-care.\n\nso anyway, the pandemic comes along and me and my partner - who had become my wife by this point - go HAM with the ham, effectively. we literally spent two months playing breath of the wild, getting shitfaced and ordering mcdonalds. it was, tbh, really fun. but my head and my body were suffering. and i was starting to seriously dislike the way that i looked. thing is, this wasn't a new thing: from childhood i had felt disparaging about my body for obvious reasons, and didn't look in the mirror, for example, for years. when i did look in the mirror it was just for confirmation that i still sucked. but photos of me at gigs from before covid were unavoidable and i was progressively shocked at how overweight i looked. still, these thoughts and feelings came attached to inside voices shaming and policing me for critiquing my own body, as if i was being a terrible feminist and terrible ally to my fat friends. so i just buried it and continued on my merry, buttery way. \n\nin september i got my first full-time academic job and something in me just totally flipped. i realised i literally couldn't continue drinking in the way that i had been if i wanted to do well as a lecturer. my wife and i were going through an eviction by an evil homophobic landlord that lived in the house above us and the stress of that was also pushing us more and more to shit food and the bottle. i realised i wanted more mental and physical resilience and to live my best life, if only to stick it to people like her. so i bought a scale for the first time in my life. i had not had a scale for my entire 20s, believing them to be oppressive to women and part of the auditing, measuring culture that contributes to stress and feelings of inadequacy. \n\nanyway, i got this scale and i stood on it and sure as day, i was 234 lbs. in my wildest imaginings of where my weight had gotten to, this was a distant number. i immediately took to the NHS BMI calculator and there it was: BMI of 32.7 (i'm a tall human), you're obese baby. for the first couple of days i was in denial - i googled things like 'i don't look obese but BMI says i'm obese'. in my head, obese people looked like my aunt or lizzo. at the same time, i was also still struggling against the fat acceptance narratives in my head: i'm obese, isn't this something i should celebrate or something? literally it makes no sense to me now but that is something i genuinely thought. i'm not exaggerating. so after a couple of days of denial, peppered with anger and dispair, i was just like: yeah i'm gonna have to fix this. i figured out that i needed to lose 56 pounds to get to a 'healthy' BMI. when i told my wife this was the amount of weight i had to lose she was like shiiiiiiit. but she never doubted me. so here is how i did it: \n\n**how i lost 56 lbs in 5 months:**\n\nStep One: \n\ni quit alcohol. forever. i stopped drinking on september 13, and my wife did too. i don't say this like it's easy for people, but it's hands-down the most important and best thing i've ever done for myself. i'm not gonna go on about the joys of being tee-total in this post (it belongs to another post probably) but there is not a shadow of doubt in my mind that cutting out alcohol was one of the key reasons i was able to lose the weight i did. i also feel literally incomparably happier than i ever have in my adult life.  i still smoke weed - couple of tokes a night - so i don't consider myself sober, but alcohol poisoned my belief in myself and my body and i knew if i wanted to take my health seriously it needed to go. \n\nStep Two: \n\ni quit animal products, as did my wife. a week after i quit drinking, i decided to go vegan. at first i was still eating honey but that's gone now too. again, hate to be evangelical about this, but it made my body feel healthier than it ever has in my adult life. coupled with zero-alcohol, i started having the energy of like, my 9-year-old self. my skin youthened by about 5 years. seriously, my wife and i were like WE HAVE BENJAMIN BUTTONED OURSELVES WHAT IS HAPPENING. In the first two months of no booze and being vegan, weight melted off me. From 5 October to 29 November, I lost 19 pounds. i was exercising too, but not like crazy. nothing more intense than what i had been doing before, which was running about 3 times a week. \n\nStep Three: \n\ni started actually drinking water. didn't do that before, quite literally couldn't understand the point (so alienated from my body and its needs). anyway, i started drinking at least two litres a day and it seemed to help everything on its way. also, my pee smelled better. win! \n\nStep Four: \n\ni unplugged from the internet. i deleted facebook and eventually instagram. this was an important part of my weight loss journey because i hadn't realised how susceptible i was to group think, and how disciplining social media was about what constitutes a morally good life or decision. unplugging from social media feeds allowed me to start thinking for myself, and spending more time in nature. that said, i compensated for my lack of feeds by getting heavily into youtube. obese to beast (john glaude) \\*really\\* helped me. i got super into his videos and started to understand that, actually, as an anti-capitalist, i was doing worse for the world by supporting the overproduction of food - and the nutritional crisis of obesity that unfolds from it - than by self-flagellating for wanting a smaller body. \n\nStep Five: \n\nafter the initial weight came off, i had to develop a more serious strategy. first thing i did was actually log my calories. i used my fitness pal for this and it worked well, although i never weighed my food. so a lot of it was eyeballing/guess-work. i got round this by slightly overestimating amounts so that i could insulate myself from disappointment! anyway, without my fitness pal i would never have worked out that actually olive oil isn't inherently good for you. prior to this i would happily use a cup of oil in a salad dressing. so i started switching things out and becoming a bit more inventive: i would use vinegar bases for dressings, and use tahini to thicken it up instead. \n\nStep Six: \n\ni started doing body-weight training instead of running. this was partly because i ran too much one week and gave myself a hip flexor injury. so instead, i started doing HIITs and lots of planks, bridges and the like in the park in the morning. this made my body feel strong and i think sped up my metabolism. eventually, i mixed bodyweight training and running during the week.\n\nStep Seven: \n\ni committed to a daily morning practice of food, movement and meditation. without alcohol I was able to go to sleep more easily and wake up more easily. as a result, I was able to gradually get to morning wake-ups at 6am (i had NEVER been a morning person because of alcohol and anxiety but had always dreamt of being one). i have eaten the same breakfast every morning for five months: oatmeal with agave and either half an apple or blueberries. in some ways i credit oatmeal for being my gateway drug to a healthy life. oatmeal powers me up and 45 minutes after eating it, i started going out and exercising, followed by a few minutes of meditation. this routine allowed me to start my day intentionally and with kind words to myself. \n\nStep Eight: \n\ni ate a cheat meal at least once a week. often this was a proper cheat meal, e.g. vegan fried chicken burger, giant cookie, fries, soda. i continue to do this every friday and the only thing that's changed is that, as my body gets healthier, i actually have much less desire to eat oily food. still, for me it's been important to have an evening of semi-indulgence. \n\nStep Nine: \n\ni stopped eating virtually any processed food and snacks, especially any with added sugar. i thought this would be harder than it was, but i managed it through swapping things out. i ate corn cakes and kallo spinach pesto cakes with vegan pate; i ate a lot of fruit and seeds; i would have like, only one biscuit rather than 25. \n\nStep Ten: \n\ni ate loads of fibre. this is easy to do when you're plant-based, but i also went for way more fibrous carbs. i starting making brown rice, sweet potato or quinoa my carb base, and eating it with loads of tempeh or tofu, tahini-based sauces and dressings, lots of green veggies like broccoli and spinach. tbh this is the food i love anyway, so i always felt satiated and satisfied. this diet hugely helped me exercise - i would never feel sleepy after meals (had just thought this was what happened to everyone after eating), and instead would feel energised. almost like... food can be fuel? \n\nStep Eleven: \n\ni incorporated movement into my work day. this one was hard because my job is frigging nuts right now, with teaching loads effectively doubled, if not tripled, by online delivery. i got a fitness watch which told me to stand up every hour and showed me how sedentary i was. again, hadn't realised this - really thought that running 3 times a week would somehow compensate for me sitting or lying down 90% of the time. so i started with the standing and then i did some walking at lunchtime, only a few minutes or so. i found this to be pretty boring so i got a LONGBOARD. this was a cheap board i found on ebay. i hate competitive sports and live on Plague Island so doing something solo that wasn't HIIT training or running sounded perfect. i started learning how to longboard in early February and now do that at lunchtime, when i can. i listen to miley cyrus and skate around the park feeling like the coolest 32-year-old in the world. \n\nStep Twelve: \n\nby the end of february i had started to plateau. initially this freaked me out but then i went back to treating myself like an interesting science experiment. so i dealt with plateaus through a combination of a) increasing my cardio - in particular, running and jumping more, hip-willing; and b) cutting back on oil. i had started to eat stuff like coconut oil, avocado oil, rapeseed oil - all of which are in vegan foods like pip & nut almond butter, vegan mayo and store-bought hummus. by cutting back - not necessarily eliminating entirely - and doing a bit more cardio, i was able to continue to lose weight. often this was no more than a pound a week but a pound's a pound bitch! \n\nStep Thirteen: \n\ni treated weight loss like a degree. i got curious, fascinated, data-driven; i became a scholar of my own adiposity. i made charts that eventually became a spreadsheet, tracking my loss alongside my exercise habits of the month. i mapped out my menstrual cycle and read my weight loss alongside this information (i kept retaining or putting on weight during my period which initially stumped me until i remembered that obviously bodies change then they're menstruating). i consumed HUNDREDS of youtube videos about weight loss; i also listened to podcasts from the other side of the fence, i.e. intuitive eating, health at every size, fat acceptance. i came to the conclusion that the western world - nay the world in its entirety - is in some kind of nihilistic denial that will end in an apocalyptic mukbang while pharmaceutical, food-industry, and petrochemical companies fill their pockets. i also came to the conclusion that yes, obviously the people who are pumped full of the excess sugars and fats attendant upon the over-production of food are often the poorest. i also came to the conclusion that celebrating this is FUCKED UP, and that we should all be very, very angry about it. \n\nStep Fourteen: \n\ni talked about weight loss with the people that i know care about me, i.e. my mum, dad, sister, wife, and 1-2 friends. i shared what i was trying to do and how i felt about it. this was totally out of character for me as i had been so against intentional weight loss for so long. i embraced the delicious slice of humble pie and 'i was wrong in the past' accountability that this offered me, while offering a new path to deepening my relationships with those close to me, through the vulnerability of being open about body struggles. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nanyway i think that's everything. the main things, at least. still hoping to cut down by another 5-10 pounds so i have more wiggle room for my weekend indulgences but other than that, yeah keep going! you'll get there, bit by bit. and as miley sings: \n\n'Ain't about how fast I get there  \nAin't about what's waiting on the other side  \nIt's the climb' \n\nIT'S THE CLIMB EVERYBODY!",

It‚Äôs funny (sad) that they talk about our bodies ‚Äúset point‚Äù and I pushed mine way WAY past where it had ever been ‚Äúset‚Äù before. At a certain point it wasn‚Äôt just that I believed intentional weight loss was wrong, it was that I feared it was impossible and believed all kinds of stuff about my metabolism being damaged, ‚Äústarvation mode,‚Äù etc. Getting rid of the roommate and deprogramming from all that cult mentality and coming here and learning some of the basics I had never known helped a lot. \n\nI‚Äôve still got QUITE a ways to go - ironically, 56 pounds from where I am now to no longer being obese - but I know I‚Äôm going to do it. It‚Äôs going to take some time but once I get there I‚Äôll never go back. \n\nThank you for sharing your story.",

The amount of times I've gone on the internet to see things like \"My mom said I should eat better, she's so fatphobic,\" is astonishing. That's not what it is. Everyone should try to live a healthy lifestyle, and being overweight is a key hint that you're doing something wrong. \n\nFatphobia is when you treat an overweight person as less-than-human. There's never an excuse to treat any person like they're meaningless. I've seen a lot of people (mostly on iFunny) say stuff like, \"Oh, you're fat, I don't care about your opinion, kys,\" *That* is fatphobia. \n\nYou should encourage people to be healthy but still treat them like people.

No extraordinary effort or discipline needed, just counting.\n\nBut even then,  I'd recommend people aim for slower loss because the deficit I have is pretty aggressive and completely not necessary for success weightloss. I'm only eating 1200 because it happens to be working for me this time. \n\nReally, I find the idea that you've got to become ascetic to be a normal weight is part of fat logic.

It isn't okay to judge people or mock people or think less of people for their weight. But it is okay for someone to refuse to accept their OWN fat. \n\nIt's not policing your own and other people's bodies OR accepting any weight as inevitable and healthy. \n\nOne issue is that if people see one person losing weight, they take it to be a judgement of their own weight. But just like you quitting drinking, you not having a drink isn't a commentary on my relationship to alcohol. \n\nCalorie counting can be a slippery slope if you grew up with someone (or yourself) policing your body. But it's also just information. It's so hard to try and eat less calories when you are making wild guesses at what has more calories. \n\nI see it a ton in the places that have calories counts on their menus now. Before I would order X thing even though I really wanted Y thing, because I thought it wasn't so many calories. When it turns out that X thing is actually twice as many calories! I don't calorie count daily, but I did for a while until I got a better handle on what the calorie count of the things I like to eat are. Now I can make informed decisions, instead of wildly guessing. (I grew up with the idea that meat and dairy were very \"rich\" and calorie dense, while carbs are good for you. So I ate carb heavy diet and avoided protein and was always hungry. Shocking for me to learn how low calorie meat and protein are compared to carbs.)",

Her struggle with her fat acceptance was in direct conflict with her family‚Äôs criticism and non-acceptance of weight issues. She‚Äôs the youngest in a family of women who are all thin and fit; every single one of my extended family members is the same, well over 70 people in my family, (ages 5-85) and my mom is the only fat one. Her rebellious nature reinforced her justification for not aligning, and her assumptions that they disapproved or pitied her furthered her resolve to reject any thoughts of changing her ways. \n\nShe saw fat acceptance as a comfort, and self-love could only be gained by rejecting ‚Äúconformity‚Äù entirely. Compliance with society‚Äôs standards was not only shallow, it was also a rejection of her and her self-worth. \n\nSo when her daughter wanted to lose 15 pounds, it triggered a reaction that caused us some issues for a while. Luckily, we both make an effort to stay in good places with each other, but what happened is that my advice for her was not welcome, or even my observations. My lack of acceptance of my own fat wasn‚Äôt a problem she had, she loved herself in a way I obviously couldn‚Äôt, because I was vain and insecure. As bad as that sounds, it didn‚Äôt interfere in our relationship as long as I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúbutt in‚Äù to her health habits. \n\nIt took her a lot longer than it took you, but she got there, too. She‚Äôs still struggling, but she‚Äôs lost a few pounds, and is on her way, finally. We‚Äôre shorter, mom is 5‚Äô4‚Äù, but she weighs around 160. She went from a non-drinking, sedentary vegetarian who ate a TON of carbs, sugar, and dairy (who was completely mystified about not being able to lose weight) and three-four meals a day and constant snacking, to being able to identify carbs, sugars, and excess calories. She started walking more, she started eating less, drinking more water (she always hated the taste of water??) and even doing chair yoga. \n\nShe finally started losing the hippie mentality of ‚Äúdiet culture is misogynistic‚Äù and started being able to access critical thinking when making decisions about her health. Instead of equating the struggle of hard work with being oppressed, she now makes decisions based on her own health. \n\nAs someone who struggles with my own health decisions (not health issues, just basic stuff like menopause and growing old and pudgy, lol) it‚Äôs a huge sigh of relief to see my mother finally making well-informed choices, instead of simply seeking justification for insulating her child self from a reality that she no longer exists in. \n\n\nWe‚Äôre all excited for you!",

Preheat oven to 400¬∞F...arrange sweet potatoes on a baking sheet and drizzle with a tablespoon of avocado oil. Season with salt and pepper. Roast for 40 mins until very soft.\n\n**Start stew:**\n\n1. Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat.

Pour in vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 40 mins, uncovered, until thickened and reduced and lentils are tender. Taste and season to preferences.\n\n**Finish hummus:**\n\n1. In a food processor, combine chickpeas, tahini, orange juice, and 2 teaspoons of extra virgin olive oil. Pulse until blended.\n2. Add the roasted sweet potato to the food processor and pulse until smooth. Add a bit of water to thin it out to desired consistency. You shouldn‚Äôt need more than 1/4 cup. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.\n3. Right before serving, stir in the whole sage leaves into the lentils. Cook for 1 minute. Turn off heat.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Spoon hummus onto shallow bowls and use the back of your spoon to smooth it out. Pile the lentils on top. Garnish with a plant-based yogurt, extra virgin olive oil, dry parsley, and black pepper.

    "body": "I was really curious how much cheaper it would be to prep this week with fresh protein. I have done this in the past but never tracked the cost and time like I did this week. This prep was made exclusively with ingredients bought at Costco. \n\nIt took me 3.5 hours over two days. I prepped and marinated using avocado oil, garlic and herb season, buttery steakhouse for the Sirloin and Pork Barrel BBQ seasoning for the chicken. \n\nCutting, marinating and vacuum sealing for the Sous vide took me about 30 mins. I let them all marinate overnight. I have two Sous vide machine so setting the chicken and sirloin at different temperatures and cooking at the same time saved me an extra hour for the chicken. \n\nI cooked my the veggies at 400. About ten minutes for the asparagus and twenty for the green beans.\n\nWhile everything was cooking I cooked the rice ramen. This only takes four minutes after you get boiling water. I give these an ice bath after cooking so they don‚Äôt over cooked and stick together. \n\nAfter the protein was done I threw them all on the grill to get a nice sear. This process took me about 15 minutes. \n\nI prepped 24 meals, 14 for myself and 10 for my gf. On average each meal had about 4-5 ozs of protein. \n\nThe total cost was $67.00 so about $2.80 a meal. \n\nThis is versus last weeks prep which was $85 for 21 meals at $4.04 a meal. \n\nMy ingredients are listed below, I did not add the cost of the avocado oil or seasoning because I already had them in stock. \n\n-Steak $39  half $19.90\n(I only used half of what I bought) \n-Organic Chicken $28.89\n-Brown Rice Ramen $8.99 1/4 $2.25\n-Organic Asparagus $7.49\n-Organic Green Beans $6.99\n\nSeasonings:\n-Avocado Oil\n-Buttery Steakhouse Seasoning\n-Pork Barrel BBQ rub\n-Garlic & Seasoning\n-Salt/Pepper\n\n Overall I know this prep is going to taste better and is cheaper but this very very time consuming vs buying the precooked protein. The difference between 45 mins and 3.5 hours is why I lean towards the pre cooked protein when I don‚Äôt want to spend 1/4 of my day in the kitchen. \n\n\nFor anyone curious we also eat 2-3 eggs in the morning with gluten free pita and almond butter from Costco. \n\nI‚Äôll have a protein shake a couple of times a week as well. Other that than we do a good job of not eating outside of what we prepped for the week.",

She posted in r/badroommates.\n\nThanks to u/ChickPeaEnthusiast for finding this older one.\n\n**Trigger Warning:** >!unspecified eating disorder; binge eating!<\n\n**Mood Spoiler:** >!Sad but tentative ok ending!<\n\n**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1byzw4w/roommate_wont_stop_binge_eating_my_food/)**: April 8, 2024**\n\nI (30F) am temporarily renting out half of a 2bed 2.5bath condo for a 3 month contract. I live with the owner (47F). When I moved in she told me she had lost 100lbs a year or two ago without working out. I have since come to learn she has a ‚Äòhealth coaching business‚Äô‚Ä¶. aka she is in an MLM. She only eats powdered supplements all day and has one keto meal at night. I looked into her ‚Äòcompany‚Äô, it is essentially a starvation diet and the supplements are quite expensive.\n\nNone of this is a problem for me, live and let live as long as you don‚Äôt try to recruit me to the scam. The issue comes in, at least once a week she binge eats huge quantities of my food. It‚Äôs high fat, keto type foods - entire jars of almond butter, bags of shredded cheese, 1lb bags of pecans or cashews, and recently 6oz cans of fried onions. She eats these in one sitting, usually if I am away for a weekend.\n\nShe is always very apologetic, embarrassed, and immediately runs out to replace what she has eaten. I feel bad, I definitely had some periods of binge eating in my 20s, but never to the point eating someone else‚Äôs food. One time I said I was going to an event but ended up cancelling. When I came out of my room and walked into the kitchen she looked like she had seen a ghost. There was my empty bag of 8 cheese slices and her hand was in my almost finished costco bad of nuts. It is very awkward!\n\nI have never had this issue before. I think she has some other mental health struggles and I do not want to rock the boat. Plus she does replace everything, although a few times I have had to ask her to. I‚Äôm moving out in a week or so. Should I leave this in my review of the place?\n\n***Relevant Comments:***\n\nCommenter: I am glad she replaces your food but that would be so annoying to live with.\n\n>**OOP:** Yes sometimes I go to use things I use sparingly (butter, avocado oil) and they are gone.\n\nCommenter: She a drank a bottle of avocado oil true or false\n\n>**OOP:** Ha!!! No it was a spray. She had already used a full bottle, replaced that, then used that one up entirely without replacing.\n\nCommenter: That person is destroying their liver/kidneys, between the high fat/protein binge and the powdered supplements. They'll probably wind up admitted with AKI and get yelled at by their physician.\n\n>**OOP:** Oh absolutely. She asked me if she might have anemia because she‚Äôs so tired. I pointed out she doesn‚Äôt eat any carbohydrates and that is definitely effecting her energy levels. She said her supplements provide ‚Äòall the nutrients that fruits and carbs have so it can‚Äôt be that‚Äô‚Ä¶  \n>  \n>I‚Äôd also be concerned for lack of fiber. I recently have been seeing that colon cancer is on the rise because diets are more processed/lack fiber from fresh produce.\n\nCommenter: Yeah, you should. I wouldn't want to live with someone like that who hasn't taken any steps to rectify it (it's good that she replaces the food right away, but still unacceptable that she's still eating all of it in the first place).\n\n>**OOP:** True, she has gone in my cabinets to take things out and tries to put them back exactly where they were, but I still notice. For example I always use a fork when prepping my overnight oats (feels a little easier than a spoon, maybe just a weird habit of mine), and use that fork to dig out my almond butter. A few times I‚Äôve opened the jar and there are spoon marks, with quite a bit missing. This is also disgusting if she ate straight from the jar, which knowing her hygiene habits would not suprise me.\n\nCommenter: This was me in my teens-20‚Äôs. I was ‚Äúfit‚Äù, but my binge-restrict cycles were out of control. I was basically low grade starving myself all day and the urge to eat large quantities of high-fat, high-carb food at night was uncontrollable. Especially peanut butter. Sometimes I would do it while half-asleep. My binges would spill over into my roommates food sometimes and I would feel really bad and replace it. I‚Äôm so glad that‚Äôs all in the rear view mirror.\n\n>**OOP:** Sounds like you are in the same spot as my roommate. Do you have any ideas on how I can compassionately approach her and tell her I think she needs some help? What would have been helpful to you during that time?\n\n(The above commenter's response) Honestly I was so consumed by guilt and shame and uncontrollable urges, I don‚Äôt know what I would‚Äôve needed to hear at that time. I definitely knew I had a problem. Maybe gently start with the fact that you had an eating disorder too and you know how it feels, and that you knew someone (me!) who dealt with the same thing and treatment changed their life. Granted, I‚Äôm not as small as I used to be but neither am I out of control with my weight and food. If she‚Äôs ready to embrace sanity around food over thinness, then she‚Äôll be receptive. But I was deathly afraid of weight gain at the time so any solution that would cause my artificially low weight to stabilize upwards would‚Äôve been met with a panic attack and extreme rejection.\n\nBut just showing empathy is a big first step. When I lived at home for a year (for ED treatment) I asked my parents to put a lock on the pantry door so I wouldn‚Äôt night eat, and that also helped. It sounds like it‚Äôs too late for you to do that - also an unfair burden on you - but just a thought. I wish I had a better answer for you, but it sounds like she needs to hit rock bottom and have a come to Jesus moment where she realizes a normal life is more important than desperately trying to lose weight in an unhealthy way.\n\n>**OOP:** Well said, thank you for this incredibly thought out response. I think I will have a conversation with her and say I feel for her that she seems to lose control around food. I‚Äôve had those feelings myself. But also make it clear that it bothers me. Maybe that soft boundary will be enough to push her in the right direction? I‚Äôm glad you got help!! Thank you again\n\n*To a deleted comment:*\n\n>She replaces stuff but then helps herself to the replacement! Her hygiene habits are‚Ä¶. lax‚Ä¶. so it really grosses me out if she is eating my shredded cheese straight out of the bag or almond butter with a spoon straight from the jar.\n\nCommenter: Instead of replacing your food why doesn‚Äôt she just go get her own?\n\n>**OOP:** I have no idea. Someone else commented it can be a psychological thing - if I don‚Äôt buy the ‚Äòbad food‚Äô myself then I won‚Äôt eat it - but then they feel out of control and see what‚Äôs sitting right there and go crazy.\n\nCommenter: Your review of the place? Like you are going to proactively seek out a review site and post about this woman‚Äôs struggles like that, just cause? I dunno‚Ä¶ Why?\n\n>**OOP:** I am renting the place through a website similar to airbnb. I have used it 5 other times and you are strongly encouraged to leave reviews.\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1c09ma9/update_roommate_wont_stop_binge_eating_my_food/)**: April 9, 2024 (Next Day)**\n\nThe day after I originally posted I noticed my 16oz sour cream was mostly gone and had spoon marks. I had used a fork to drizzle a small amount over nachos last time I used it, so safe to assume my roommate had eaten it. Our schedules don't always line up so I decided it would be best if I talk to her via text when she is off work. Convo went as follows:\n\nme: hey when I was home earlier I noticed a pretty significant portion of my sour cream was gone\n\nrm: At the store now. Was doing some work until 3am and had a low moment. I‚Äôm really sorry. Replaced by 5:15pm.\n\nme: It‚Äôs okay you don‚Äôt need to replace. I did want to talk about it though, it bothers me when my food is missing. can you please try to avoid touching my stuff in the fridge or my cabinet?\n\nrm: Yes.\n\nme: I understand what it‚Äôs like to be out of control sometimes when it comes to food ü´∂üèª let me know if you ever want to talk. is there anything I can do to help make it easier to avoid?\n\nrm: Not a good housemate trait. It‚Äôs disrespectful of your stuff and I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôve been struggling lately. Thanks for bringing it up. I know I need to change\n\nme: it is not a character flaw! life is tough enough as it is. I‚Äôve been there before. please do not beat yourself up about it ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nrm: Thanks. Well, do you need anything at the grocery store while I‚Äôm here?\n\nme: nah i‚Äôm all set thank you!\n\nWhen I got home she had bought an identical new sour cream and got me flowers, has been up in her room all evening though :( A very nice gesture, I really did not need any more sour cream and was not going to come close to finishing it in the next week before I move out.\n\nWhile she often takes small portions of certain things I probably wouldn't have used/noticed anyway, I mentioned in a few comments on the original post - I have other concerns of her hygiene and food safety habits. She is frankly a pretty messy/disorganized/forgetful person and frequently leaves the kitchen and living room (common areas) a mess with used dishware, crumbs/pieces of food on the couch, remnants all over the stove, dirty dishes in the sink for days, etc. I have also witnessed her several times leave meat/dairy out unrefrigerated for hours and then eat it. I do not want ANY person to eat straight out of my jar almond butter/sour cream with a spoon, or out of a bag of my shredded cheese with unwashed hands - even if it is a tiny bit. I have always been very aware and intentional of my food safety.\n\nThank you to everyone who shared their personal ED struggles. As mentioned I have definitely had my own journey toward a healthy relationship with food. After posting, I realized this situation may be particularly triggering to me as I believe my dad has a long history of what I think is binge-eating tendencies. As many suggested, I set a boundary with my roommate but also tried to be compassionate.\n\nTo those saying I should tear her down from being in an MLM - I don't think this would be productive in any way. Don't get me wrong I have consumed a lot of anti-MLM content and agree they are pretty universally bad. Yet I know those involved in these scammy companies sometimes view naysayers as fuel to strengthen their bond with their 'team'. I'm not touching on this with her.\n\nSome recommended buying a mini fridge or a fridge lock box. I won't personally be doing this for my case but both good ideas. I didn't know they made fridge lockboxes, including this in the event it is helpful to anyone reading this in a similar scenario.\n\nAs far as leaving a review - I'm still torn on what to do. I rented this place through a service similar to Airbnb in which you are strongly encouraged to leave reviews. I've used it 5 times before and honestly have never had to give less than 5/5 stars. The food is a problem but also she is very messy and often dirty as well. As someone who is super neat/organized and cannot sleep if there are dishes in the sink and counters aren't wiped down - I would really struggle to give even 4/5 stars. I am not sure if I can in good faith give a highly positive review. I am considering leaving no review, but in the event I do [u/fourpuns](https://www.reddit.com/user/fourpuns/) gave me a good idea. To include the line \"occasionally ate food I had purchased but always replaced it.\" Short, sweet, truthful, not malicious. I would never ever go into detail or 'out her'.\n\nTo those saying I should poison her with hot sauce, laxatives, cayenne, etc.... BE F'IN FOR REAL. That is illegal and dangerous to both of us. This is a PERSON that is struggling. You don't kick someone while they are down. Despite us not being a great match roommate-wise, she is a warm and kind person that has tried her best to make me feel welcomed in many other ways. I truly wish her nothing but health and happiness going forward.\n\nI am moving out in a week since my contract is ending, so I have a feeling there will not be any more food problems. This has been an eye-opening experience. I hope I handled as kindly as I possibly could have while respecting my own needs. If all else fails, I like to reframe uncomfortable/difficult scenarios as something one can use in job interviews to answer 'tell me about time you faced a problem and how you fixed it.' ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nWould love to hear from survivors, dietitians, or counselors in the ED sphere for ideas on how to help an acquaintance who is struggling with their relationship with food. Open to constructive criticism for any tips on how I could have used better language in our convo. For myself and others as a reference.\n\nThank you all!!\n\n***Relevant Comments:***\n\n*Has this happened before?*\n\nI‚Äôm not sure if she‚Äôs eaten anyone else‚Äôs food before. She didn‚Äôt eat anything of mine for the first month or 6 weeks I lived here. I needed to say something because it was bothering me.\n\n**Mini Update Next Day in Comments:**\n\nI just know she was so upset last night and hiding away I feel so bad about that! But thankfully she‚Äôs up and at it and more chipper today :)",

Remove from the oven and let cool for 5-10 minutes.\n* Once the poblano peppers are cool enough to handle, carefully remove the skins. Transfer the poblano peppers, garlic, and jalape√±o (seeds included) to a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. *Alternatively, you can roughly chop the peppers and garlic with a knife.*\n\nPrepare the Corn:\n\n* If using ears of corn, cut the corn from the husked cobs and set aside. Remove a bit of corn and reserve for garnish.\n\nStart the Chowder:\n\n* Heat the remaining 1 teaspoon avocado oil in a large pot. Add the diced onion and cook for 4-5 minutes until just beginning to soften. Add the minced peppers and garlic and cook for 3-5 minutes more until very fragrant.\n* Add the vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat.\n\nSimmer the Chowder:\n\n* Add half the corn, the coconut milk, and the kale leaves. Simmer for 10-15 minutes until softened.

    "body": "PIC: [https://i.imgur.com/axkQ2RR.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/axkQ2RR.jpg)\n\nIt's nothing really remarkable and I know I'm WAY late to the game here, but I always went for canned beans for ease of use. But I did a pot of stewy beans using dried beans and it did actually taste better than canned and I liked that I had more control over the doneness of the bean.\n\nI also like that I can soak a whole bag and use half from the pot for one recipe and continue soaking the beans in the fridge and use the other half the next night for something different (I eat a lot of beans, no judgment please but also don't come near our house when we go on a bean bender lol)\n\nHere's how I made my most recent bean recipe! What are your favorite dry beans that I should experiment with next?\n\nI liked this recipe because of the mushroom topping and the use of the celery leaves as a garnish...they had a nice aromatic finish to my beans!\n\n**Recipe here originally:** [**Stewed Beans with Manchego Cheese**](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/stewed-beans-with-manchego-cheese/)\n\n# Equipment\n\n* Large pot\n* Skillet\n\n## Ingredients\n\n* 16 ounces dry beans, like scarlet runner, kidney, great northern cannellini, lima, chickpeas, etc... soaking and cooking time will vary\n* 2 tablespoons avocado oil divided\n* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced\n* 4 ribs of celery with leaves trimmed and thinly sliced; leaves roughly chopped\n* 8 cloves garlic peeled and thinly sliced\n* 3 tablespoons butter divided (optional)\n* 1 teaspoon dry thyme\n* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika\n* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper\n* 6-7 cups vegetable stock more as needed\n* 8 ounces mushrooms of your choice sliced or chopped, such as shiitake, cremini, or oyster\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n## For garnish:\n\n* Chopped celery leaves\n* Chopped parsley\n* Cheese of your choice, cheddar, manchego, pepperjack, cotija, etc\n\n## Instructions\n\n## Soak the beans:\n\n* Pour the beans into a large pot and cover with water. Cover and soak for 8 hours or overnight. Drain and rinse and set aside.\n\n## Cook the aromatics:\n\n* Wipe out the pot used to soak the beans. Heat 1 tablespoon avocado oil over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onion and celery and cook for 7-8 minutes until they just begin to soften.\n* Add the garlic and cook for 45 seconds until fragrant.\n\n## Bloom the spices:\n\n* Melt 2 tablespoons of butter into the aromatics. Add the thyme, smoked paprika, and crushed red pepper and cook for 45 seconds until fragrant.\n* Add the dry beans and toss to coat‚Äîseason with salt and pepper. Start with 1/2 teaspoon of salt to start and add more as desired. The stock will reduce and become saltier as it cooks.\n\n## Simmer the stew:\n\n* Pour in the vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour until the beans are tender. Taste and season again to your preferences. Add more stock as necessary if the liquid evaporates too quickly.\n\n## Cook the mushrooms:\n\n* Once the beans are tender, cook the mushrooms. Heat the remaining avocado oil and the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Once the butter is frothy, add the mushrooms and cook, occasionally flipping, for 8-12 minutes until they turn golden brown and crisp up around the edges. Season lightly with salt.\n\n## To serve:\n\n* Divide the stew between bowls and garnish with celery leaves, parsley, and cheese. Spoon the mushrooms on top of each dish.

Found the solution in a cooks country magazine recipe when soaking the beans soak them in brine 3 Tablespoons / 4 quarts of water. The sodium ions displace the calcium ions in the skin. The results is softer skins on the beans. The resulting beans have a much better consistency and are surprisingly not salty in flavor.

She reflects on her grandfather's legacy as a beloved community figure and Vietnam War veteran. Zennia identifies as bisexual, dating her girlfriend, Dinah. Her neighbor, Mr. Miles, expresses disapproval of the relationship, insisting she should marry his son instead. Despite Zennia's firm stance, Mr. Miles reacts by vandalizing her pride flag. His son, Paul, attempts to ask Zennia out, dismissing her relationship with Dinah. Zennia stands her ground, asserting her relationship's validity and setting boundaries, while Dinah supports her through the ordeal.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledKarens/s/FIw2wKS1sV): **August 27, 2024**\n\nZennia recounts troubling encounter with law enforcement following harassment from Mr. Miles. With a previous incident where Mr. Miles attempted to demean Zennia and Dinah‚Äôs relationship, the couple decided to stay with family for safety. Upon returning home, they were unexpectedly visited by police responding to a call alleging Zennia was holding Dinah against her will. Zennia navigates the situation with humor, clarifying Dinah is a lesbian and the call originated from Mr. Miles. Zennia provides video evidence of Mr. Miles' prior harassments, the police inform them that without solid proof, they can‚Äôt pursue harassment charges. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledKarens/s/xPQzH5fttC): **August 31, 2024**\n\nZennia reviews her situation following a recent police incident. She describe their life, including Dinah's creative gardening and colorful decorations, which attracts HOA‚Äôs attention. They receive a notice from an HOA officer about multiple violations regarding rainbow-themed decorations. Dinah is frustrated, after receiving an unaddressed box containing American flags. Zennia is concerned with potential fines from HOA and conflicts with Mr. Miles and his son, who they suspect are behind the complaints. Zennia explains an ongoing police investigation related to a previous incident and express uncertainty about HOA's existence.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Update #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledKarens/s/MBYS6v2iM8): **September 1, 2024**\n\nZennia explains more on the developments from ongoing saga with Mr. Miles, following police involvement regarding harassment with unexpectedly twists. Zennia and Dinah discover their street lacks HOA, Dinah is excited and starts plans on painting their house in rainbow colors. Mr. Miles and his son, Paul, who raised concerns about security cameras. Zennia playfully engages with Paul, frustrating him. Dinah distributes mini rainbow flags to neighbors. Zennia's mother has history with Mr. Miles, offers to intervene. Dinah and Zennia prepare for a transformation of their home, they seek fun and creative ideas for their space.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Update #4](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledKarens/s/I6D2Kzj02i): **September 7, 2024**\n\nAt BBQ, Zennia and Dinah hosted a colorful \"painting party\" after getting the idea from Mr. Miles. Police responds to a noise complaint but found no laws were broken, leading to a fun evening filled with music and laughter. Next day, Mr. Miles visited to discuss the situation, expressing concerns about decorations for his ailing mother, Sugah. Zennia rejected his offer. Dinah returned home with more colorful decorations. When Sugah returned home, she appreciated vibrant displays but was upset about the flag Mr. Miles damaged. After sharing heartfelt stories, Sugah encouraged Zennia to propose to Dinah, leading to a surprise engagement. A romantic date night filled with nostalgia and laughter, Zennia proposed to Dinah, who accepted. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n----------------\n\n#----NEW UPDATES----\n\n**Editor‚Äôs Note: OOP made a typo with the numbers of her update. She listed the latest update as 4th, this is the 5th update.**\n\n[Update #5](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledKarens/s/DPUXh7vKCG): **September 15, 2024**\n\nHeyyyyy,\n\nSo it's only been a week and stuff happened but generally not enough for me to come back to our Lil online chat and be like slams hands down on table YALL. But in my random reddit scrolling I got a message from a troll who linked a whole ass page of accounts with every insult under the sun about me. I'm insufferable, illiterate, not black (honestly that one was just mean) or gay enough (that too), and I had a good laugh at the gatekeepers of both things. Sorry, can't help either. And my not-black-enough black ass is bisexual and very used to being not \"gay\" enough for folks so here's a think, sweetpeas, don't read my posts ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nLet me explain to you the absolute bullshit of binary spectrums in communities. They are worthless and labels should only be used for clarifications and short forms. Like I say I am bi, right? And argument can be made that I am pan...\n\nAre they gone? Good. Just you and me again boo. Fuck the trolls.\n\nI really only logged on to scroll before I found a troll page of bullies Mr. Miles would be proud of but ain't that a thing because Mr. Miles has no time for that right now and that might be because my little rainbow-themed home has been such a blessing. I have neighbors I've never met from blocks I've never visited who pull up in their cars and say hello. I've spent more time outside on the front porch because of it.\n\nThis week has been magic. Not only am I engaged to the hottest woman around, but Daddy surprised us with tickets. Christmas in paradise. We are going to ARUBA. It will be me, my boo, my mom and daddy, and a pair of friends that are more like siblings. Dinah has been so excited, though she would never admit it. I can tell she's thrilled because she's already got a suitcase out and in a weeks time has been placing items and clothing within. It's adorable.\n\nWe haven't told many people about the engagement. Dinah wants to send invites first in the mail and THEN post on socials. She's been in full wedding mode and it's...terrifying...and cute. I can't wait to marry her. I can't wait to share more about the wedding but we are a way off from there. We won't be having a wedding for at least a year. She has family not here in country and it's hard to get schedules going, plus she's in design mode and needs time to make it all perfect.\n\nSo why am I here (other than to further make the trolls in and out of my DMs angry - üíã) well, it's because Mr. Miles actually crossed a line.\n\nCan't tell you what happened before but I can tell you most of after. Whatever happened, Miles was out on the porch with his sister and they were having a HEATED talk. Dinah and I didn't even really register it until I paused our game of Injustice (great game, you should play) to grab a blanket and we heard them talking.\n\nOf course we minded NONE of our own business and rushed like kids to the window closest. Miles was drunk or SOMETHING because his sister (I guess we will call her Candy? F??? - WE DONT ASK WOMEN BEYOND A CERTAIN AGE THEIR AGE OK) kept telling him to be quiet and go inside and sober up.\n\nHe got mad and she said that he can leave as he is not helping their mom (Sugah) but making everything about him and his issues. He got in her face and started to yell, so Dinah and I stepped outside for several reasons but one was definitely to be seen so he knew if he put hands on her, there were witnesses. Plus we wanted to be able to step in if it did get out of hand.\n\nI said \"Hey Ms. Candy, you good?\"\n\nAnd Mr. Miles, loud enough for damn near the state, SCREAMED at me \"No one wants your f*g-ass opinion!\"\n\nCandy slapped him, and Dinah was already on their porch before I even knew it. She was already pulling Candy back but Mr. Miles just stood there holding his face. He called her a bitch. Then called Dinah a word I think would get me banned. Then said we were all enter incoherent but probably bigoted thing here - didn't hear him. I don't speak bigot and am only mildly fluent in moron but he was loud enough. Sugah came out asking what the hell was going on here and Dinah had no problems explaining our perspective.\n\nSugah looked at Miles and just told him to leave to his son's. Miles asked where he should go and she repeated to his son's. He asked which, and she said \"Whichever will put up with your bullshit tonight Miles, I don't care!\" And she told me and Dinah to go in. We all did and we watched her lock the man out. He didn't even try to stop her, he just watched. And then he sat there for at least 45 min -because we did check periodically.\n\nNot sure the situation because Candy and Sugah will talk about anything BUT but what. A. Week. Yall.\n\nPs. You damn right I am hanging out at the mailbox, pool, wherever to get the tea. Just don't have it all yet. Lol\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**OOP on what kind of wedding she wants to have with Dinah**\n\n> **OOP:** Im good with a courthouse wedding however Dinah would absolutely destroy me lol\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Update #6](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledKarens/s/cIRC0hZfNv): **September 18, 2024**\n\nLawd, this is becoming one of those sagas - but YALL. BABY. GOT. THE. TEA.\n\nOkay, so in my last post, I shared about Mr. Miles and his breathtaking lack of social awareness trying to take on his sister, Candy, resulting in him getting slapped by said sister and then locked out by Sugah.\n\nYesterday, I took a day off. I dont know if I ever mentioned it but I get vivid and awful flashbacks sometimes - usually only when I'm over stressed or overstimulated these days - due to CPTSD (another story for another time perhaps). Well, as much as I prefer to keep it light, Mr. Miles acting that way with my fiance within a physical range of him freaked me out a bit. I wanted to scold her for putting herself in a position where she could get hurt but I remembered 2 very important things that made me shut the fuck up.\n\nOne: If that man of a certain age hit my girl, he wouldn't get a second hit because she can and will FLOOR him and part of me thinks she would want the excuse. As said by Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther, as amusing as that might be...I still don't know where the jails are and the whooping she'd give might land her there for at least a night.\n\nTwo: Honestly, he's not that stupid. He IS a moron. They like to pile more on which is why he keeps upping his passive agressive bullshit. Different from an idiot aka an \"I do it\" reactionary. See what I mean?\n\nAnyway, regardless, I got a bit stressed. I didn't sleep that night or the night after and had flashbacks for the first time in a HOT MINUTE. Nothing I can't handle, I've dealt with this most of my adult life and I know how to recognize and cope with my symptoms. But that said, to cope and help me decompress, I took some PTO yesterday and sort of just hung around. I was out on the porch waving as folk went by, even walked to the community pool for a lunchtime dip, and then I fuddled around the garden picking some food to cook and surprise Dinah.\n\nThat's when everyone's favorite neighbor, I will call her \"Auntie\" since that's what I actually call her in real life along with checks notes everyone else. She's our resident tea party aficionado - she lives to serve and spill everybody's tea. When Pop was alive he would warn me to never volunteer info to her that I don't want God, her angels, Satan, his demons, and my Mama to know. She's...that person. She's sweet, truly, but if you ever want a secret spilled, she's your woman. I think she's 50-something but I honestly don't know. She's claimed 30 for at least a decade. I don't think even she really remembers her real age.\n\nAnyway, she walked by while I was in the front garden beds and we had one of those random chats people have when there is no polite way to just ignore one another or keep things brief for the sake of time - the south be the south.\n\nShe asked me questions, and I gave carefully selected answers per usual. She made very weird assumptions about Dinah, some of which I corrected, and some I left her to assume because, tbh it's simply funnier that way, and then she got onto Mr. Miles.\n\n\"I heard Miles hollering out here like a damn dog,\" and I laughed. I said he sure was, and maybe I am a jerk, but I \"OOPS\" LET SLIP that he dropped a slur or 2. Whoops. Sorry, not sorry.\n\nShe then said he's been all sorts of messed up about his son. I inquire who and she doesn't know which one but one of them not too long ago came out to Sugah, who, as you might guess, accepting him happily as is with no trouble. But Mr. Miles gound out and hit the fucking roof. He was screaming and ranting and throwing things and shouting insults. If I had to guess, I think I know which son, but I'm not 100% yet. When I asked when all this happened, the time she gave aligned with right before Dinah moved in with me. Like maybe a month before, if memory serves.\n\nI had that aha moment right in front of Auntie, and she said \"ooh you just thought something good\" and was trying to get it out of me and I thought about it. Hmmm...it would REALLY fuck Mr. Miles' next few week at least if I let slip - accidently - that he has tried to marry me off to his sons...\n\nSo I told her. Fuck him.\n\nShe acted scandalized and my mission was complete. I offered some of the veggies and went on my merry little way.\n\nI...didn't think it through.\n\nSugah was over right before dinner. I was frantically trying to cook - yall I should not be allowed in a kitchen - so I just invited her in. We chatted like we do and she ended up helping me cook (and by \"helping\" I mean she sort of took over in that way only mothers can by basically pitying you to death before they keep you from burning the house down - pat pat, good work honey now it's the grownups turn).\n\nAs she cooked and I cleaned and set the table, she apologized because she didn't know Mr. Miles had called me a slur. I told her I had no intention of telling her since I didn't want to upset her. She said to HELL with that notion - she's tougher than I think. She beat cancer after all.\n\nI just stared at her like, what does she mean? She looked at me like I was crazy and she said - well didn't I get the invite. I said what invite? And she is throwing a \"fuck cancer\" party to celebrate the end of her treatment. I told her that I am confused, I thought she was...?\n\nAnd she stared at me like \"What, girl, spit it out.\" So I told her what Mr. Miles told me about her dying and to not upset her. She stopped everything she was doing and spun around and shouted \"He said WHAT?\" And then explained she was in the hospital longer because in her excitement to go home, she fell and hit her head, so by their procedure had to keep her a while and do scans before release due to her condition and age. The closest she is getting to \"dying\" is merely age.\n\nI actually dropped into the chair next to me and balled my eyes out. She wrapped me up in a big hug and tried to calm me down. She kept saying \"Baby, I ain't gonna leave you just yet. Now stop that crying.\" And I just screamed \"I CAN'T\" laughing and crying at the same time.\n\nI can't break down all the memories I have with this woman. She's our community mom, grandmother, and all in between. She's the glue that keeps us a community. She keeps the peace, helps you out, offers you comfort. Steeling myself for her loss was taking so much of my energy. It's the reason even, though Dinah and I wanted the wedding out at least a year, we kept it as soon as possible within that time. We wanted her there. A weight didn't lift from my fucking shoulders, it was an entire building.\n\nShe went from comforting to angry once I calmed down cursing Mr. Miles to herself. And she said \"This is why...Mm. That boy.\" And she saw me listening to her and shrugged. She's kicking him out. He's been really terrible and has been talking about all he will inherit when she got sick at the beginning. She endured listening to her own child sounding almost like he was over her death before she died and moved on to \"gimme, gimmie\" but then he started to mistreat me and Dinah and that was enough for her to be sure she wanted Candy to be her caregiver. The night he was drunk and a special slice of stupid a few days ago was after she told him he needed to find a new place to live as Candy and her husband will be moving in after Halloween to see after her for a bit.\n\nWe finished cooking and Dinah had gotten home. She actually saw me in the kitchen apron as I went to greet her in the front and (smiling I swear) she just went \"Oh no what's the damage\" lol WOMAN I COOK FOR YOU AND THATS YOUR REACTION!?\n\nI bring her inside and we insist on sending Sugah home with a plate of the food she mostly cooked and she went home. Over dinner I spilled all the tea to Dinah who reacting similar to me at the news that Sugah will be okay. She still has a couple conditions to monitor but death's not coming stealing just yet. We then placed bets on which son came out. If I am right, we're getting a small hot tub. If she's right, I have to take over chores for 2 months. So we will see.\n\nAnyways I returned to work today and didn't have time until now to post. How's the tea taste yall?\n\nAnd just a hearty thank you for following my cray ass life lol its helpful to have fun with it and see the humor with so many friends. It really helps me release some stress at the same time. Thanks a lot.\n\nEdit: had to make a quick text but we're getting that damn hot tub. I was right. It was James.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledKarens/s/iyolEe6RWS): **September 21, 2024**\n\nComing up to the top before I post to say, this became an emotional, long, crazy, and sentimental post. I am sorry not sorry, blame it on the boogie.\n\nComing back because Dinah had read this and said I should say at the top that you should be warned about content around self harm and homophobia.\n\nHey, Boo. Been missing you.\n\nThis might be not as entertaining but I am a little sad on top of all the other feelings. This might be my last update on this crazy ass saga. Why? Well it's all about Miles. No mister here anymore. I'm southern, but that ass doesn't deserve the respect and I am feeling spicy today.\n\nLong story short - fuck who am I kidding? - It's never short with me. Sit down, get comfy, have some tea. I hear I'm great at spilling it.\n\nSo I texted James to confirm my suspicions that he was the son Miles flipped out about being gay. James confirmed it but asked if he can call me later and I agreed. I can't remember if I've said in these posts, but he and I are close. Not best friends or anything, but intimate in the sense that we don't lie to each other and always have had this kind of unpsoken pact to always be honest.\n\nAnd by the gods was that man honest. I'm allowed to share all this by the way as per our agreement I didn't lie about these posts. He said the names were different but he heard it on tiktok (GOD I AM OLD) and felt it was too similar and he'd been meaning to ask me. I laughed and he had a great time teasing me for always being one to give an account of events \"with a flourish\" - I argued that that's how we cook around here, with seasoning.\n\nBut then he got serious. He apologized for not coming out to me. Tbh it did hurt me deeply that he didn't see me as trustworthy. It took a good and deep talk with Dinah to realize that feeling was selfish and we all have different journeys in realizing and sharing who we are in this crazy ass world. She reminded me of my own crazy story (I'll have to tell you. I think I will post it someday for the cathartic release of it all. And yall are such absolute gems. I feel like maybe you're not my neighbors in the real sense of it of it, but you are in my soul). So I got my head out of my ass, and somewhat started to get over it. I'M HUMAN.\n\nI did tell James all of this. And he seemed pretty sad. I said that I wasn't blaming him, and assured him that his journey is his, I am not mad at him or anything, and given how his dad reacted to me being queer, I get it. He then told me what happened.\n\nJames realized he was gay when he was in college, but his father and grandfather had very detrimental views of \"those in sin\" so he squashed it and threw it, and his real self, firmly in the closet. Sometimes that \"monster\", as he viewed it then, came out like a trauma response when he got overwhelmed or stressed out and one day after graduation, he had been in something of a relationship with a guy James is asking me to call \"Adonis\" (LM-fucking-AO) and they wanted to eventually get married.\n\nThe problem of dear Miles still was in play, so James started to go in a dark place. It ended when Adonis came home and found James in his own sick after he swallowed a bunch of his pills for sleeping. They pumped his stomach and he was okay in the end physically - Thank the ancestors for that - but his mind was in shreds. He started therapy at the insistence of his BF. He started to feel like himself, his real self, and became the most grateful bastard in the world that his attempt to end himself didn't work because he says his life now is absolutely incredible.\n\nSo once he recovered, he went to visit his dad and grandmother. When he got Sugah alone, she was cooking his favorite meal (Jallof rice and fish - if yall haven't had this you NEED to try it out. It's not a hard recipe, it just takes time and love. I will share the recipe with anyone interested - when I got the house after Pop died, Sugah shared hers and I've adapted it to my and Dinah's taste)\n\nLord - sorry you know how I can sometimes go off on little details. Anyway, he's with Sugah and she's telling him that she missed him and why hasn't he visited and he slipped and said he was hospitalized and she - obviously - wanted to know more so he just up and told her everything: feeling not his full self, meeting Adonis in college, having his first time with him, falling in love with him, all of it. He was so sure she'd kick him out, but he says she just smiled at him, brought his hands to her forehead, and kissed his cheek. She said she already knew he was \"a little on the pendulum\" of sexuality since he got into his teens but she was swelling with joy that he trusted her enough to tell her. He felt emboldened by this and decided he would tell his family at dinner...which Auntie, as I mentioned in another post, told me about the outcome of that.\n\nAfterwards, Miles did everything he could to convince his son that \"living in sin\" was wrong, Adonis is a demon, he just needs to marry a nice girl - become a father - be on the oath God outlined for us - and I don't think the word count will allow for me to outline all the fucking abuse this man threw at James but what I will say was that in telling me about it, James broke down several times. It broke my heart and ignited a part of me I didnt know I had - rage. Pure and unbridled. I felt a rage something fierce and I couldn't let go of it.\n\nI thanked James for telling me and he said \"hey add it to your little saga, I'll be reading to see what seasoning you put on it\" and then we made plans for me to meet Adonis next time he comes around the area but he did text me a photo and....CHILD. He really did find a hot one. Think of say, Chris Evans and then Keanu Reeves and imagine they made a baby with the REAL Adonis and that will be close. Abs, blue eyes, killer smile - He's a model. James bagged a fucking model! Sorry for the cussing but damn! Even Dinah thought he was hot and her door does NOT at all swing that way.\n\nI told Dinah about my chat with James and she said we need to really foster that friendship more. I asked her what she meant and she said \"Whenever you talk about him, you look happy. I think he's a real touchstone for your joy of childhood.\" And I thought about it and she was right.\n\n\"James\", I know you are reading too. You really are such a brother to me. I know we don't talk often and I know we both have lives but you are as much apart of me as my eyelashes. I'm lucky to have you so don't you \"ducking\" dare be a stranger.\n\nYesterday was insanity. I worked a halfday from home and there was a knock at the door. It was Sugah, she brought some food because she saw me through my window working away and figured I needed to eat. If you don't have a community Sugah Mama in your life, I am sorry. They are the best.\n\nWe ate and talked and she said she had news. Miles isn't coming back. His sons refused to take him in, drunk as he was, that night so he ended up at his GF's house. And I know for a fucking fact everyone who says my posts are fake will point to this very moment but I swear there is no way to make this up. He proposed to said GF and she accepted his crusty ass! GIRL! And he calls his mother to say that now she has to choose. She is not invited to his wedding until she apologizes and helps him \"fix\" James.\n\nI literally was howling a \"No he did not\" and she's screaming \"Oh yes he did baby\" back and forth for what felt like hours. You ever have that? When you just are sharing something so ridiculous and you both know its ridiculous and you just can't get over it. That feeling. We laughed and laughed and then I saw her get a little sad.\n\nThis is already super long for a single post but in that moment, Sugah just shook her head, and she said she really tried with him. He's her son and she loves him so much, but he's not a good person. Then she went through specific moments where she might have \"gone wrong\". Like she was, what's called here, a \"whipping mama\" at first. If you're not southern, that's code for she was a spanker. She learned after her other children that \"hurting them ain't healing them\" and she never raised a hand to them again. But Miles still came out needing to be a big man. It's why his 1st wife left him. 2nd too. (Didn't know he had the 1st wife, myself, so that's new but explains a lot - I always thought the 2nd was his only). She was sad and I hate seeing people I love sad.\n\nYou may have picked up on this but I am awkward as hell. Not great in emotional situations. And when I saw her wipe a tear my brain broke and did the fuck fix it fix it fix it fix it spiral (or what Dinah calls my \"Jack O'Neil\" - if you get the reference I LOVE you - mode) so I went with being \"funny\". I told her about talking to James and made fun of both our stories and how weird it was that folk so close to each other are still not close to each other sometimes because he didn't tell me he was gay and I didn't tell him I was bi. It all had to come out after the family drama. I swear I was funnier but Dinah is making me cut that part to be \"Breif\".\n\nWe laughed and she said that she sees me like her own and loves me like a daughter. She wants me to be happy with my love the way she wished she could have been with hers. She doesn't regret her children but Mr. Richard (her late husband) was only nice as an older man. He was wretched to her when they were married young. She married him some out of a platonic type love and the rest out of pressure to be \"normal.\"\n\nWe hugged and I said something about my posts. I'm a moron. Sorry. And she got very confused. I said I only mention it to say that she has so many people now who see her as I do. A treasure. And I screenshotted yalls sweet comments about her and texted them to her. Today she's asked me to print them out for her. I'm waiting for the printer to be done now which is why I am typing on my phone.\n\nCandy texted a thank you saying that Sugah was low after kicking Miles out but she was happier when she got home from visiting me. Can't say why but that made me cry. Jury is out on if that's good or bad.\n\nDinah and I both agree, and mom is on board, to pay for one of those online classes and ask Sugah if she will officiate us. I have no clue how I will ask her but I really want her to be a part of our wedding in a really special way. We're still spitballing about it and of course we have time, but I want it to be special. She is so much a part of me - of us - I need it to be highlighted.\n\nAnd the reasons I am posting today, I was told by Candy that Miles took his belongings early this morning. He refused to speak to anyone in the house and just silently took his stuff and hauled it into his truck bag by bag. The only thing he said was he's never coming back and now they've lost a son/brother. Candy said she said back that he's no brother of hers.\n\nSo with Miles gone for good, I guess so is the end of this weird ass saga of mine lol. Dinah looked up subs and shit I can post on about other stuff but this...I don't know. It feels almost like a goodbye. Weird. I'm emotional about it. I am so glad Miles is gone, but damn. I'll miss you and our timely little tea parties.\n\nTake care of yourselves and be good to yourselves. Remember to eat well and hug your family (chosen or bio) close.\n\nA couple of items I want to spell out - call it housekeeping:\n\nAll names were fake or nicknames so no I probably am not the person next door (that was an actual message I got a lot)\n\nYes I call my stepfather daddy - it's not weird to love a paternal figure who loves you like his own, will be walking you down an aisle, has dried your tears, told you that boy, girl, or person, didn't appreciate you and took you out for treats just to see you smile. He is my hero and the weird messages and comments about him...just get therapy. Not here to kinkshame, believe me but christ on bikes batman!\n\nSugah Mama's are a thing! Do you not have those? That's so sad! They are the best. Maybe you call them something different. For me and the culture I grew up in, they're usually women without children but all of them are maternal, loving, safe, trusted, and will hound you to get your shit straight (or gay lol sorry I couldn't help it, I am a child).\n\nYes, we are looking for hot tubs and yes we are going to be sure that Sugah and Candy can come by to enjoy it too.\n\nDinah speaks several languages and English is not her first language. I might be marrying a spy but you got to admit that's pretty hot. Even if I die.\n\nAnd yes people do WFH lol what odd conspiracy theories I've read that I am not real because I WFH! I own a business, and work full time, and I also program here and there by contract. Now you know.\n\nLastly, I was an English major. If that doesn't tell you something, it should üòÖ.\n\nThank you all. My heart is full.\n\n**Edit:** got a few asks for the recipe, you're so very welcome for the droves of humans who will bow at your feet for this-\n\nOkay, so here is what you will need:\n\n2 cups long grain rice - not any other type just trust me here okay? Otherwise the type doesn't matter. - and if you can, make it parboiled rice.\n\nThen 3 tbsp vegetable oil, but I did use avocado oil before when I hadnt gotten groceries and I didn't notice a huge difference\n\n1 chopped \"red\" onion, white works fine but red is better\n\nMinced garlic. Now that is something you measure with your HEART and nothing else. I tend to throw garlic in cloves at everything.\n\nGrated ginger - now just be careful with it. It's a powerful flavor like salt and you can't un-ginger but again MEASURE WITH THE HEART\n\n1 red bell pepper that you will blend to baby food About 4 medium tomatoes also into baby food 2 tbsp tomato paste...which is already baby food.\n\nThe rest is pretty normal: 1 tsp curry powder 1 tsp thyme 2 bay leaves - don't leave it in or it will taste bitter 1 tsp paprika 1 ghost pepper if you're feeling spicy 2 cups chicken or vegetable stock - Dinah comes from a vegan family so I've done the vegan version of jallof And seasonings to your or your guests tastes\n\nThat's all for the rice alone which is very tasty but if you wanna really kick it into high gear, here is what you need for the fish: For the Grouper Fish:\n\nHowever many fresh or fresh as you can grouper fish fillets is best, but in a pinch find the best flakey white fish and pray lol\n\n2 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp lemon juice Mince garlic 1 tsp paprika 1 tsp cumin 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (if you're feeling spicy) Fresh cilantro (for garnish) 2 tomatoes chopped into quarters 1 green bell pepper chopped into bits\n\nIf you've got all that, here's how you make a woman want to marry you (or man, person, whoever).\n\nMake a fish marinade: use a bowl, toss in your olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, paprika, cumin, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. You rub that on the fish and let it sit for a half hour and OMG you're about to see heaven.\n\nNow make sure u heat oil in a large pot (youll need the real estate trust me) over \"medium\" heat. Add your onions, garlic, and ginger, and saut√©\n\nStir in the blended tomatoes, red bell pepper, and tomato paste. Cook for about 20ish minutes, stirring until its a thick as your live for yourself.\n\nNow add the curry powder, thyme, paprika, and bay leaves and stir that up like your gossip buddy does drama.\n\nPour in the chicken/vegetable stock and bring the mixture to a simmer then rice next, making sure it's evenly distributed in the sauce. Cover the pot and dial down the heat to low. Let it cook for a half hour, but DO NOT WALK AWAY FROM IT stir it so the rice is fully cooked and fluffy. Yes the fluff matters!\n\nHere it gets a little intense - while the rice is cooking, you also need to heat your pan over \"medium\" heat (I use the qoutes because no stove is the same) and add a bit of olive oil. Sear them fillets for 5 minutes on each side until golden brown and cooked through.\n\nDO NOT RUSH THIS - in the last 2 minutes of cooking, toss in the chopped tomatoes and bell peppers around the fish. Saut√© until soft.\n\nPut your cilantro on that and let your partner grovel at your greatness. They will propose so stand ready lol\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**OOP on things being resolved and her thoughts on her grandpa, Pop, being well liked in the community**\n\n> **OOP:** I would like to think I am. Pop was a favorite around here and folk still drop by to see him (usually people that moved away and are randomly in town) to see him. For a little bit, people would just walk right on in since Pop always left the door open and had an open door policy for them as kiss to keep them safe and off the streets.\n> \n> I can't be half the hero he is, but I keep the open door policy with a sign caviat. There is a light I turn on when anyone can just walk on it. But when it's off. Best knock. I've got a hottie who's dumb enough to marry me so some of my in-house activity is simply NSFW üîû.\n\n**OOP on if her father is in the picture**\n\n> **OOP:** My father and I don't talk. I honestly don't know where he is now and don't care. My daddy has been my dad for as long as I can really remember.

He's my hero and my mother is so happy with him.\n> \n> Damn sorry that was a lot of words to say: it makes me happy too!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLatest Update here: [BoRU #3](https://redd.it/1hzfa7g)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# **DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs ‚Äì BoRU Rule #7**\n\n# **THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**",

Pink salt and cracked black pepper a few hours before the bath, then 137 for 1.5 hours. Ice bath for a few before searing on a ripping hot pan with some avocado oil (new pan my mother bought for my birthday, 14\" All Clad stainless). Added some butter over top.\n\nServed with some congri and boiled yuca with mojo, chimichurri on the side for the steak.\n\nEdit - I rarely post, but thought this was worth sharing.

To answer your question, though, you can reduce gray band with any of the following:\n\n* Highest heat you can muster while searing, and flip every 20-30 seconds for no more than a minute per side.\n* Reduce oil/fat usage as much as possible. I just lightly brush my steaks with ghee or avocado oil before searing.\n* Dry brine for 24-48 hours with salt only to reduce surface moisture and pat steaks dry before brushing/searing.\n* Season with other components besides salt after you sear to maximize surface contact during the cook and avoid carbonization over caramelization due to burned seasonings.\n* Add sauce on the side so it doesn‚Äôt make your crust soggy when you go to plate everything.\n\nEdit: it‚Äôs been pointed out a couple of times that bringing your steak to room temperature before searing also helps, good catch y‚Äôall. I do so by putting the steaks on a wire rack and throwing them in the fridge for 30 minutes before searing, and I also pat the steaks dry with a paper towel before they‚Äôre oiled and seared.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bj2clwujteze1.png?width=2163&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2d8bba0d5cb190f2b7e3713eadd8a78d7af1093",

Then I sear in 15-20 second intervals, taking the steak off onto a rack and letting the pan get back up to temp.

When we were stuffed and happy, Sputnic looked at me with love in his eyes and dropped his head into my arm and pressed into me. It felt like he was trying to thank me and tell me he loved me. He is my heart. \n\nI am planning to do an avocado oil, rosemary, and thyme rub, smoke it on a trager grill for about  1 hour and then finish it at 350 and bring it to a mid-rare for him.

I didn't expect the post to blow up like this lol. I will be adding some tips to my initial post to answer some questions. These are the things that worked for me and I will do my best to keep these up to date.\n\n**What I eat:** A clean keto diet focusing on whole foods and minimal ingredients. Chicken, beef, pork, eggs, tuna, fish, broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, kale. I also only drink water or unsweetened almond milk. For treats I eat macadamia nuts, pecans, almonds, peanuts, brazil nuts, pili nuts. I never have these stocked in the house because I would finish them all on day one lol.\n\n**Calorie Partitioning:** I like to keep things simple. High protein, moderate fat, 0 to low carb. On some days it will be high fat, moderate protein, 0 to low carb, but the importance is to always hit your protein goal. Protein for me is filling and also the macronutrient with the highest thermic effect. Your body will burn 20% of the calories from protein by just processing them- this is free food. If you eat a high protein diet, you can get away with eating more because the net gain is ultimately lower than if you ate more fat or carbs.\n\n**OMAD:** I complete my training before my OMAD and break my fast with a lean protein shake (whey protein isolate). I then have my meal 20 minutes later and drink 3 tbsp of apple cider vinegar (with the mother) to end my OMAD. After so many hours of fasting, your HGH (human growth hormone) gets a giant spike. After working out, you get yet another spike to HGH. HGH is a hormone directly responsible for building/repairing muscle and a bunch of other critical body jobs. By breaking your fast with protein, you are priming your body for muscle building mode and reducing the chances of instant fat storage.\n\n**Resistance Training:** I started with [https://stronglifts.com/5x5/](https://stronglifts.com/5x5/) and then gradually tweaked it as I got stronger. You can buy a power rack and perform all these workouts at home or go to a gym. The workouts are very time efficient and as a beginner your main focus should always be proper form to ensure you don't hurt yourself. I also do pushups, pullups, and a mix of workouts with dumbbells. You also need sleep to actually build muscle so if you're working out and eating like a beast, but not getting any rest, results will be suboptimal.\n\n**Autophagy & Extended Fasts:** I did 7 day water fasts every other month. Fasting triggers autophagy and it helps with tightening up loose skin, clearing up skin, and breaking plateaus but it also has tons more benefits; [https://www.healthline.com/health/autophagy](https://www.healthline.com/health/autophagy). Our ancestors didn't have the luxury of having food available to them the way we do and so they didn't eat frequently. A lot of the metabolic diseases we see nowadays stem from us constantly consuming and what makes it even worse is we're consuming the wrong things- a bunch of processed foods with little to no nutritional value, synthetic coloring, taste, preservatives etc. If you eat healthy AND give your body a chance to clean itself and heal, imagine what you could do?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Quick Facts / Tips:**\n\n**RMR & BMR:** Stands for Resting Metabolic Rate and Basal Metabolic rate. In short, this is the amount of calories that your body burns by simply existing. Things like weight, height, sex, and age are all factors. Here is a simple yet good explanation of both terms: [https://www.verywellfit.com/metabolism-facts-101-3495605](https://www.verywellfit.com/metabolism-facts-101-3495605). There is also a calculator in there if you want to deep dive it.\n\n**Calorie Math:** A gram of fat is 9 calories. A gram of protein / carb is 4 calories. If something has 10 grams of fat and 15 grams of protein, the food still consists of more fat than protein\\~ 90 calories of fat, 60 grams of protein. Be sure to pay attention to calories from fat when going on a calorie deficit as a lot of things we eat on keto are high fat; avocado oil, nuts, condiments etc. One of my go to condiments is classic mustard as it is very low calorie and minimal ingredients.\n\n**Body Recomposition:** The more weight you lose, the more diminishing returns you will see. Your body will put up a fight to get rid of the last 5-10 pounds you want to lose because it is designed to store that fat in case of famine / starvation. You will most likely need to add in resistance training and some cardio to healthily burn off those last few pounds of fat. The good news is that if you are in the body recomposition stage, your hard work has already paid off and if you keep pushing you will see those abs and cuts soon :\\].\n\n**H2O:** Drinking freezing cold water can boost your metabolism because it forces your body to use resources to warm the water to body temperature. This may seem like a small change but if you factor this in to every glass of water you drink, the gains are huge in the long term.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

I hope you're proud as hell because you deserve to be.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking: A lot of folks who lose as much weight as you end up struggling with loose skin. Do you still have some of that? How have you dealt with it? Did any of it improve/tighten back up naturally? Did you end up getting surgery?\n\nI know that's a big source of insecurity for some people so no worries if you just wanna ignore the questions. However, I do think we should normalize the idea of plastic surgery in that situation because there still seems to be a stigma around it. In my view, anyone who has done the work you have has earned the right to make that choice free of shame. It absolutely does not cheapen the accomplishment.",

Heat the pan with no oil around medium heat to start, and periodically sprinkle a bit of water. You're looking for it to break into bubbles that skitter across the surface rather than immediately evaporate, the Leidenfrost effect. At that point, go ahead and add your oil then your food, adjust heat from there but you should be golden.\n\nEggs may still be tricky, I use cast iron or a small non-stick I still have around for them. But everything else this should work.\n\nEdit: to clarify, Leidenfrost comes at a higher temp than than the instant evaporation, so if it's instantly flashing to steam, you're not there yet.\n\nAlso... Wait until your skittering droplets do actually evaporate (it won't take long) to add oil, or you'll have a bad time.",

        "body": "Let me explain a bit. When stainless steel is cold, everything will stick. The trick is to heat up the pan on medium heat for a few minutes. Do not touch it, do not put anything in it.\n\nAfter a few minutes, get a spoon and some water and drop in some water. If the water evaporates immediately the pan is too cold. When leidenfrost effect is showing, the pan is ready to use. Leidenfrost effect will make the water bounce on a layer of its own steam.\n\nNow you can add a high smoke point oil. I use rice oil or a baking product (in europe we have liquid margarine). Doesnt really matter, avocado oil is fine if you can buy it for good prices. Now let the oil heat up a bit, like 15-20 seconds. Make sure to add enough to coat the entire bottom of the pan. If your pan is cleaned properly, drop in an egg slowly, wait for it to harden up a bit and it will slide around. Meat will always stick. Be patient! after 2 or 2,5 minutes it will get loose eventually. If its not loose its not done. The little sticky bits (way less than on your pan) are good flavour. The best thing about induction is the ultimate control you have. Once the pan is warmed up and your food is in there you can lower the heat just so slightly after half a minute but dont let the pan get too cold in the beginning. Once both sides of your chicken has a nice crust you can drop the heat to low to make sure its properly cooked and safe to eat.\n\nAlso watch videos on youtube on how to make a nice pan sauce, enjoy your meals.\n\nEdit:\n\nNow I think of it, your picture shows some veggies and potatoes. We can buy frozen mixes of potatoes, veggies and meat as a meal. This wont work in ss as its too cold. Maybe if you crank up the heat high enough but I would stick to room temperature ingredients and you will have almost no sticking except for some suc to make fond.",

    "body": "PIC:  [https://i.imgur.com/IDY4fWt.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/IDY4fWt.jpg)\n\nRecipe here originally: [Green Curry Rice with Vegetables](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/2021/04/02/green-curry-rice-with-vegetables/#)\n\nI love green curry rice but sometimes I don't want coconutty green curry. This is a great way to get the flavor of green curry paste in your rice and it's as easy as frying it up in a little oil, adding the rice, and cooking until it's toasted. Add the water, bring to a boil, and then simmer (covered) for about 15-16 minutes.  Serve it with whatever sauteed veggies you like!\n\nHere's my version of *kao pad gaeng keow waan.* Typically, this kind of green curry fried rice calls for cooked white rice (which is delicious) but you can also cook the rice right into the green curry paste as follows!\n\nThis uses mixed mushrooms and asparagus and is only 300 calories per serving but here are a few more veggie combinations that would work well in this:\n\n* Bell peppers, carrots, shiitake mushrooms\n* Green beans and eggplant\n* Bok choy and baby corn\n* Broccoli and sugar snap peas\n* Zucchini and sweet potato\n\nYou can also add protein to the stir-fry, like thin chicken strips, shrimp, or thinly sliced pork or beef.\n\n## RECIPE\n\nThis green curry rice with vegetables is a perfect vegan dinner recipe that comes together quickly. Make this recipe, so you can get back to enjoying the spring weather!\n\nServings: 4 \n\nCalories: 294kcal \n\n### Equipment\n\n* Wide skillet\n* Medium pot\n\n### Ingredients\n\n#### Green Curry Rice:\n\n* 2 teaspoons avocado oil\n* 1-2 tablespoon green curry paste depending on heat tolerance\n* 1 cup white rice\n* 2 cups water or vegetable stock\n* Salt to taste\n\n#### Vegetables:\n\n* 2 teaspoons sesame oil\n* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced\n* 1 pound mixed mushrooms such as shiitake, maitake, king trumpet, diced, torn, or sliced into rounds\n* 5 cloves garlic peeled and minced\n* 1-inch piece of ginger peeled and minced\n* 1 tablespoon soy sauce\n* 1/4 cup vegetable stock\n* 1 pound asparagus woody ends trimmed, stalks cut into thirds\n* 2 ounces Thai basil leaves a few leaves reserved for garnish\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n### Instructions\n\n#### Prepare the Green Curry Rice:\n\n* Heat the avocado oil in a small pot over medium heat. Add the green curry paste and mash it lightly into the oil until it becomes fragrant about 45 seconds.\n* Add the rice and cook for 1 minute until toasted.\n* Pour in the water or stock and add 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15-18 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the rice to rest, covered, for 5-10 minutes before fluffing with a fork.\n\n#### Cook the Vegetables:\n\n* Heat the sesame oil in the skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onion and cook for 5-7 minutes until it just begins to turn brown. Add the mushrooms and cook for 8-12 minutes, adding another teaspoon or two of oil as necessary. Season with salt and pepper and cook until the mushrooms have released their liquid and are golden brown.\n\n#### Finish Saut√©ing the Vegetables:\n\n* Add the garlic and ginger to the mushrooms and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n* Add the soy sauce and vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Stir in the asparagus and Thai basil and cook, occasionally tossing, for 5-6 minutes until the asparagus is bright green and tender-crisp. Taste and season again with salt to your preferences. Turn off the heat.\n\n#### To Serve:\n\n* Divide the cooked rice between plates and pile the cooked vegetables on top. Garnish with a few Thai basil leaves if you have them. Enjoy!\n\n### Notes\n\nTip: Replace the water with coconut milk to help reduce the spiciness of the green curry!\n\n### Nutrition\n\nCalories: 294kcal | Carbohydrates: 54g | Protein: 10g | Fat: 6g | Saturated Fat: 1g | Sodium: 272mg | Potassium: 704mg | Fiber: 7g | Sugar: 6g | Vitamin A: 1449IU | Vitamin C: 10mg | Calcium: 62mg | Iron: 4mg",

It also included yellow onion but I would limit or exclude them and carrots due to being high in carbs.\n\nIIRC, No stock was used and a full can of coconut milk was used. Also, I tried using the green curry in a jar found in most American grocery stores and didn't like it as much. It also came in too small a size and was more expensive. \n\nFor the curry, I like Mae Ploy brand which comes as a vacuum sealed bag in a cardboard tub. Asian grocery stores have dozens of curry options.\n\nI used to have a recipe for green curry chicken which I made in a big electric wok. The chicken, veggies and curry were cooked in the wok and the rice cooked separately. I like basmati rice best for this.

I found an older discussion thread on this subreddit where someone advised it is an inert chemical that is only toxic at high heat (600f), at which point it has been shown to be very toxic (it killed birds who inhaled the fumes in scientific studies, and has given humans flu like symptoms), and mentioned \"but of course everyone knows you aren't supposed to be heating your skillets over high heat so this isn't anything to be worried about.\" \n\nWELL...that is news to this non-chef. üòÇ I very often, almost daily, will heat my skillet up over high heat, drizzle some avocado oil in the pain, get it really hot and then reduce to medium-high after a bit. If I'm cooking larger items sometimes I'll leave it on high/medium high heat most of the cooking time and just reduce it toward the end.\n\nDoes anyone know if these chemicals are indeed to be concerned about and/or what other cookware I could invest in that might not have potentially harmful chemicals?\n\nIs is true that you're never supposed to heat up a pan over high heat? Have I been doing it wrong my entire life?",

If the coating starts chipping a lot just throw it out and replace it; they‚Äôre not cast iron, they‚Äôre not made to last a lifetime. Most people get 2-5 years out of them depending on how often they cook and care (I.e using wood/rubber spoons). And if you have any pet birds non-stick is a non-starter. They‚Äôre super sensitive to any fumes.\n\nBut yes you can absolutely cook on high heat, you just want to have food in the pan to absorb that heat.

        "body": "Hi there. Coatings professor who is working on alternatives to the toxic nonstick pans here. Some points to consider:\n\n-PTFE (telfon) itself is not toxic. However, at high heat it can degrade and form things like PFAS, so I would never cook at high heat with Teflon pans.\n\n-PTFE used to be made using a very nasty PFAS called PFOA to help process it. While that molecule, and others, have been banned, the newer ones used in PTFE processing are just too new to know how good/bad they are. Things like \"Gen-X\" and \"C6\" are not as safe as their manufacturers claim them to be.\n\n-Any pan containing fluorine can have the above problem. Don't be tricked by words like \"ceramic\" or \"PFOA free\" as they don't really mean safe. Ceramic doesn't mean anything actually, it's just a marketing phrase.\n\n-The health concerns arising from PFAS are largely due to what is called bioaccumulation over time. Essentially, the same inertness that allows for the nonstick properties also allows them to reside in human bodies for a long time (years). And so continual exposure means the concentration in your blood keeps going up and up. However, you should really only be concerned if you're immunocompomised or pregnant or nursing.\n\n-If you want a safe nonstick pan, find one that is \"fluorine free\". These are based off a technology similar to your silicone spatulas, and are very safe inherently. DM me if you want specific brand recommendations as I don't want to promote any one company.\n\n-As of 2020 I believe, over 1400 consumer products use PFAS. So if you're really concerned you're going to have to cut out a lot more than just cookware to protect you.\n\nEDIT: OK too many people to respond to, but two brands, at least when I bought them years ago, that I was happy with were certain GreenPan pans, and the Stone Earth pans from Ozeri. Whether they are 100% safe, I cannot say.  But they ticked all the safe box keywords. I am sure others exist too.",

        "body": "[This YT vid](https://youtu.be/_Gy8XZTK4GY) looks similar to what I do.\n\nI use stove top, any kind of pan (thin, thick bottomed its all good), any non-glutinous rice variant (jasmine, japonica, brown, violet, etc.).\n\nInitial Stage:\n\n2 cups (coffee cup sized, for simplicity) of your preferred rice, into your pan\n\nWash once/twice then drain the water, washing takes out the starch flour formed from the grains rubbing together while in the pack. It can leave a strong taste that overpowers the food that goes with your rice. Wash once, if you still like some of the taste, twice if you want a milder rice taste. Its not important to drain all of the water, some of it can be left to add some semblance of rice flavor.\n\n*Method 1:*\n\nPlace water up until the first line of your middle finger, [like on the vid](https://youtu.be/_Gy8XZTK4GY?t=160). Thats the surface of the rice, to the waterline. Some rice varieties are harder and would actually need up to the second line of your middle finger for them to properly soften and cook (some even cook with one and a half). Its an experience based thing, so if your rice comes out hard after cooking, just add some water (1/4 or 1/2 cups worth, experimentation needed) and reheat at very low heat.\n\nTurn the stove on to high or middle heat, the goal really is to just bring the water to a boil.\n\nNow here's where it greatly differs: after the water boils over (the water level has risen to the rim), **turn off the heat completely and wait for five minutes.** The rice will still cook from the heat, and its hard surface will break like corn kernels turning into popcorn. After five minutes, turn the heat back on to whatever low flame you can possibly do because at this time your rice hull should have popped, and the water level has gone well under the risen cooked rice.\n\nTake this time to taste some of the rice: is the flavor too strong(wash more next time), is the water level still visible(use a bit less next time), is the grain still hard(add a bit of hot water and increase water level next time).\n\nAfter five minutes of low heat, your rice should be good to eat!\n\n*Method 2:*\n\nThis one is used for making large tubs of rice, without burning the bottom part. Still works with our 2 coffee cups of rice. Only works with softer rice varieties (ones that only need 1 knuckles worth of water).\n\nBoil water beforehand, enough to fill up to your first knuckle of the middle finger.\n\nAdd the boiled/hot water to the pan with the washed rice. Check water level with a spoon (and then check the spoon against your middle finger) and fire up the stove to middle/high heat. Again, we just want to bring the water to a boil.\n\nAfter the water has boiled over (again, the water has risen to the rim), turn off the heat completely. Let it sit for five minutes. Take time to check the taste, hardness and water level of your rice during the wait.\n\nBring the heat back to the very lowest you can possibly do and wait for five more minutes. After that you should have your rice cooked and ready to eat.\n\nAgain, we do this adding of boiling water method for cooking rice for 10\\~50 people using large tubs. The idea really is to pop the hard grain hull using a combination of hot water and steam. Works everytime, with less fuel usage on the stove and no burnt rice crust at the bottom.",

This morning was supposed to be the last batch, but then the bottle broke while I was doing it. Since I had all this avocado oil soaked in paper towels, I figured I'd do all my iron, and my Dad's as well. I know this may sound sacrilegious, but I like to do stupid heavy coats on all parts of my iron and leave it there, except for the actual cooking surface, which I soak in oil, and then do passes with towels until there's no oil left on any part of the cook surface (besides in the pores obviously). It comes out really splotchy, oily, and sticky on the parts im not cooking with, but after a few uses and washes with regular dish soap, it comes out perfect with a deep shining black.\n\nEdit: They turned out great. A lot of people said they'd be goopy, but I went into this knowing there was more oil than usually done by members on this sub. The reason I did this is for a darker coat, and then I finish the pans with a wash, hot oil rub, wipe completely off before final season. Like I said, they turned out great!\n\nEdit 2: Results [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/castiron/comments/k9hkdd/results_from_my_divisive_heavyout_lightin_oil/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)",

I can't find a low waste moisturizer or face soap bar without this \"natural, no chemical\" crap attached to it. \n\nI want a face/bodycream with The Ordinary quality in a low wast container that hasn't been tested on animals and comes in batches of 0.5kg. Instead personal care brands are on a kitchen chemistry level making 50ml moisturizers from shea butter, coca butter, mango butter and avocado oil because it's so \"natural\" (conveniently forgetting how these butters are actually grown on former rainforest land). Or worse, the \"invisible\" \"natural\" sunscreens with white-ass titanium dioxide. There are so many excellent and invisibel chemical sun filters out there. Why?\n\nThis really bothers me. I need well-formulated products, lab produced ingredients, and translucent chemical sunscreen! \"Natural creams without chemicals\" give me essential oil mom vibes and I don't want to spend my money on it.\n\nThoughts?\n\nEdit: I'm really happy to see all your reactions. The idea for a low waste high science brand is already forming in my head.\n\nI'll keep you posted and will credit everyone single one of you in my Fortune 500 spread in a couple years time.",

I didn't want to sell online because the shipping waste undoes what the whole mission was. So those are basically the reasons why you don't see these products, not enough customers to justify cost for our niche group of people with shared values. I hope one day it will change!",

    "body": "TLDR; La Roche Posay and Brush on Block were my top picks!\n\nAfter my family had a scare with melanoma a couple years ago, slathering myself with sunscreen is an every day must! No matter the season, I'm always wearing sunscreen as my base and so I've accumulated a nice collection. I used these four over the last year and thought I'd share my take for anyone else wanting to make sunscreen part of their daily routine. \n\nI live in really cold, dry winters and very hot humid summers. I have sensitive combination skin that is medium olive tone. I probably go half the week wearing makeup and the other half makeup free. \n\nI've based my ratings on things I find important which are: \n\n1. Broad-Spectrum Protection - I need both UVA and UVB protection. \n\n2. Texture & Finish - can this be worn alone or under makeup? how does it pair with makeup? does it pile etc. is it drying or gives moisture or is it greasy?\n\n3. Sensitive Skin Approved - I lean towards formulas that are free from fragrances, alcohol, and other irritants\n\n4. Price and Accessibility - I chose USA brands on purpose since I have to re-up yaer round. And yeah, price matters when I have to wear sunscreen every day\n\n\nSummer Fridays ShadeDrops SPF 30, $36\n6/10 \n\nGrabbed this on a whim while wandering around Sephora recently. It seemed like it might be a good fit for me: broad-spectrum protection, and when I gave it a quick test in-store, the texture was all light and hydrating, without any of that sticky feeling. Plus, it's eco-friendly and seemed to be on the gentler side ingredient-wise, which is a big deal for my sensitive skin. I normally pick up a higher SPF, but some times (especially in winter) I get by with SPF 30. \n\nSo, I did the responsible thing and patch tested it on my face (lessons learned) and bam, welcomed a red itchy patch. Turns out, after a bit of a deep dive, that this isn't exactly unheard of with this product. Super glad I only did a patch test, because I've read about folks who went full face and ended up with major redness. Just goes to show, the higher pricetag doesn't always mean you're getting what's best for your skin\n\nFirst Aid Beauty Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30, $28\n6.5/10\n\nMy hopes were high with its promise of avocado oil and vitamin E‚Äîingredients known for their healing and moisturizing properties. However, the experience fell short of expectations. Despite its appealing ingredient list, the sunscreen felt thick and heavy, a far cry from the lightweight, non-greasy promise often sought in sun protection. This texture issue became particularly evident under makeup, where it failed to blend seamlessly, leading to noticeable pilling. While it didn't match up with my daily wear hopes, especially for those makeup days, it's found a niche spot as my go-to for beach days when I don't totally care if I look a little extra shiney or if there's a little white cast. \n\nSupergoop Everyday Lotion 50 SPF, $24\n7.5/10\nAgreeing with all the sunscrean afficionadoes, it's a lot of hype and not with the pricepoint. Is Supergoop the new Glossier? Good marketing and packaging, but not living up o the hype/ I thinks so! Ok so I thought this was just OK, but there were a few things that made me stop wearing it after one day. #1 thing that will make me stop wearing a sunscreen is if it stings my eyes and this stung my eyes to the point where i had to wash it off. Then I did the face powder trick: washed my face, put this sunscreen on and then immediately powdered the areas around my eyes. this worked ok. stung less, but when I sweated again, it started to sting. The other fail was that it didn't seem to dry on my skin, it was super oily. I'm wondering if this stuff is meant for the beach only and for no make-up days? maybe? And then there was the smell. I am not that sensitive to smells, though I do prefer no-sceent products. This scent was kinda ew? Ayways, I am passing on this one, but if you like Supergoop sunscreens then this vould be a good one for beach days, summertime only\n\nLa Roche-Posay Anthelios 50+ SPF, $36.99 \n8/10\n\nThis seems to be the fan fave/holy grail, so I had really high hopes. It was pretty decent, once I got the hang of it.  Super liquidy and spilled out easily (not a big deal though), which meant it also spread evenly and nicely across my face. There was a slight white cast, which is to be expected for full spectrum (it has zinc). It also has oxybenzone which that is a no for me, now that I know more about this ingredient. I will say that it felt \"\"light greasy\"\" and I broke out just a little after using it for a week. When I spread it on my face, I waited to see if it would dry on my face giving it a ten minute timer, but it stayed still kinda slightly greasy - not too greasy, but perma dewy? if taht makes sense? if you have super duper dry skin, this could be for you. Maybe the oily finish is for dry skin? I didn't hate, but i didn't find myself reaching for it\n\nBrush on Block Sheer Genius SPF 50, $36\n9/10\n\nFound this one while traveling and after some quick research while standing in the store I thought I'd pick it up, Could this also be an undercover fan fave? This might be my unicorn, I love the pricepoint, slightly less expensive than sephora brands and the bottles lasts. Let's go through it: NO STING - this is my #1 litmus test. I even did a run (and sweated) and it did not sting. The  second priority for me is just overall texture and this stuff was is pretty perfect. At first I wasn't sure befcause it came out white, applied white, but then it dissapeared and went clear. ON top of that, i didn't feel like i was \"\"wearing\"\" another layer. it was really comfrotable. No white cast (even thlugh it has zinc), layered really nicely with my makeup. It's SPF + moisture, i see there is some squalene in there, so it's kind of a unique stand alone product, as in, I put this on and did not need moisturizer or primer. It's like it was a primer on it's own too? I didn't get tanned (woot), skin felt really comfortable, no scent. Found myself reaching for this every day and it ding ding, it's the winner (with the \"\"what am i reaching for in the AM\"\" litmus test)",

    "body": "Reverse Seared Tri-Tip \n\nhttps://pauliesaucerecipes.com/post/reverse-seared-tri-tip/\n\nIngredients\n* 1 Tri-Tip steak\n* Steak seasoning about 1-2 tablespoons\n* Chimichurri\n* Garlic & Herb butter\n\nInstructions\n* Trim off any unwanted or excess fat¬†\n* Season your tri-tip on both sides with steak seasoning. For this recipe im using a simple salt, pepper, & garlic seasoning¬†\n* Let that hang out on the cutting board for 20 minutes before cooking¬†\n* Set your oven or smoker to 225 degrees¬†\n* Let the tri-tip cook till you reach an internal temp of 110-115 degrees¬†\n* Once you hit an internal temp of 110-115 degrees it's time to sear¬†\n* Set your grill to high heat (If you are doing this step inside heat up a hot cast iron with avocado oil)¬†\n* Melt down your garlic and herb butter¬†\n* Grill off your tri-tip on all sides so you develop a nice crust¬†\n* Baste your tri-tip with garlic and herb butter as it cooks¬†\n* Once your tri-tip reaches an internal temp of 128-130 degrees its done¬†\n* Let the steak rest for 20-25 minutes before slicing¬†\n* Make sure you slice your tri tip against the grain to ensure tenderness¬†\n* Plate up with some chimichurri and enjoy!¬†\nNotes\n\nWhy Choose Reverse-Searing?\n\nReverse-searing involves cooking the meat slowly at a low temperature before finishing it with a high-heat sear. This approach allows the steak to cook evenly throughout, minimizing the risk of overcooking and ensuring a juicy, tender interior. The final sear creates a gorgeous crust, enhancing the flavor and adding a satisfying texture contrast.\n",

    "body": "This prep was made exclusively with ingredients bought at Costco. \n\nIt took me 3.5 hours over two days. I prepped and marinated using avocado oil, garlic and herb season, buttery steakhouse for the Sirloin and Pork Barrel BBQ seasoning for the chicken. \n\nCutting, marinating and vacuum sealing for the Sous vide took me about 30 mins. I let them all marinate overnight. I have two Sous vide machine so setting the chicken and sirloin at different temperatures and cooking at the same time saved me an extra hour for the chicken. \n\nI cooked my the veggies at 400. About ten minutes for the asparagus and twenty for the green beans.\n\nWhile everything was cooking I cooked the rice ramen. This only takes four minutes after you get boiling water. I give these an ice bath after cooking so they don‚Äôt over cooked and stick together. \n\nAfter the protein was done I threw them all on the grill to get a nice sear. This process took me about 15 minutes. \n\nI prepped 24 meals, 14 for myself and 10 for my gf. On average each meal had about 4-5 ozs of protein. \n\nThe total cost was $67.00 so about $2.80 a meal. \n\nThis is versus last weeks prep which was $85 for 21 meals at $4.04 a meal. \n\nMy ingredients are listed below, I did not add the cost of the avocado oil or seasoning because I already had them in stock. \n\n-Steak $39  half $19.90\n(I only used half of what I bought) \n-Organic Chicken $28.89\n-Brown Rice Ramen $8.99 1/4 $2.25\n-Organic Asparagus $7.49\n-Organic Green Beans $6.99\n\nSeasonings:\n-Avocado Oil\n-Buttery Steakhouse Seasoning\n-Pork Barrel BBQ rub\n-Garlic & Seasoning\n-Salt/Pepper\n\n Overall I know this prep is going to taste better and is cheaper but this very very time consuming vs buying the precooked protein. The difference between 45 mins and 3.5 hours is why I lean towards the pre cooked protein when I don‚Äôt want to spend 1/4 of my day in the kitchen. \n\n\nFor anyone curious we also eat 2-3 eggs in the morning with gluten free pita and almond butter from Costco. \n\nI‚Äôll have a protein shake a couple of times a week as well. Other that than we do a good job of not eating outside of what we prepped for the week.",

Please rate my steak!\n\nMy method:\n1) Dry brined my ribeyes for about 7-8ish hours with the last couple of hours being outside of the fridge \n2) In a ripping hot cast iron I used avocado oil, first searing the fat cap, then 2 minutes on each side (one minute increments)\n3) Removed steaks, killed the heat, threw in my butter, garlic, rosemary until the butter was melted\n4) Add steak back in, turned the heat up to a medium-low and basted for a couple minutes on each side\n5) 10 minute resting period\n\nI know it‚Äôs probably not optimal to do two at a time in a cast iron but I have a huge 15‚Äù lodge so I said hell with it. I would‚Äôve liked the fat a little more rendered but it was still a very delicious steak. Pretty happy that I was able to do this in my apartment on a flat electric stovetop üòÖ",

I love sauces and see the food mostly as a vehicle for sauce.\n\n- roasted asparagus with garlic powder, (salt-free) lemon pepper, kosher salt. roasted in avocado oil with juice of two lemons to finish it\n\n- white mushrooms saut√©ed in butter, soy sauce, balsamic, and a touch of Worcestershire sauce \n\n- sardines with a dash of soy sauce on top\n\nsoo yummy I‚Äôve been eating this for 3 days now. i need more good fat and nutrients in my diet. i think i also need more electrolytes‚Ä¶ possible sodium deficiency‚Ä¶. a++ for taste",

    "body": "# Jewelry\n\nWearing quality jewelry is extremely important.\n\n**The best jewelry for stretching your ear lobes are \"Single Flare Glass Plugs.\"**   Acrylic & cheap metal plugs should never be used. Avoid double  flare plugs or use them with extreme caution & never use them for  stretching.\n\nPorous jewelry: wood, stone, etc should not be worn in a freshly pierced piercing.\n\nAlways buy jewelry from a known good manufacturer.\n\nSome of the Quality Jewelry Manufacturers Are:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [Anometal](http://anatometal.com/)\n* [Industrial Strength](http://www.isbodyjewelry.com/)\n* [NeoMetal](http://www.neometal.com/)\n* [Glasswear Studios](http://www.glasswearstudios.com/)\n* [Gorilla Glas](http://www.getgorilla.com/)s\n\n## Why Glass Single Flare Plugs?\n\nSingle flare plugs have a gentle tapered edge which makes inserting  the jewelry easy and comfortable. The risk of damage is very low. Glass  is extremely smooth, non-porous and can also be autoclaved, making it an  excellent choice for a fresh piercing.\n\nSingle Flare *Implant Grade* Titanium/Surgical Steel Plugs & Tunnels would be the next best option. Wood is also a good because it holds oils well, **however** it is very porous, not nearly as smooth as glass and it can also tend to stick to your lobes a bit when removing the jewelry.\n\n## O-Rings\n\nPeople often have trouble losing O-Rings.\n\nBehold! [X-Ring - Nitrile No-Roll O-Rings.](http://bodyartforms.com/productdetails.asp?ProductID=10515)  These beauties stay put much better than normal o-rings...  Unfortunately, they only come in sizes from 8 gauge to 1\". So until you  get to 8 gauge, you'll have to suffer with normal O-Rings.\n\n## Stretching Basics\n\nLubrication is **key** when stretching and everyday  maintenance. The products below are very good for keeping your lobes  healthy & moisturized. When mixed with beeswax, they will work for  twice as long.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [Jojoba Oil](https://www.amazon.com/Viva-Naturals-Pressed-Hexane-Organic/dp/B01AYG74DK/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1488192485&sr=8-3&keywords=organic+jojoba+oil)\n* [Coconut Oil](https://www.amazon.com/Carrington-Farms-Organic-Virgin-Coconut/dp/B00CPZPYLS/ref=sr_1_4_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1488192516&sr=8-4&keywords=organic+coconut+oil)\n* [Avocado Oil](https://www.amazon.com/Avocado-Oil-Sky-Organics-Aromatherapy/dp/B01I3ZVI86/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1488192560&sr=8-1&keywords=organic+avocado+oil)\n* [Emu Oil](https://www.amazon.com/Australian-Triple-Refined-Organic-100/dp/B00KGNPOUW/ref=sr_1_18_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1488192593&sr=1-18&keywords=emu+oil)\n* [Raw Cocoa Butter](https://www.amazon.com/Cocoa-Butter-Raw-Pure-Unrefined/dp/B00CIZ0DNO/ref=sr_1_8_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1488192663&sr=8-8&keywords=organic+raw+cocoa+butter)\n\n**Always keep your lobes well lubricated!**\n\nEspecially when inserting jewelry!\n\n**Patience is a Virtue!**\n\nThe longer you wait in-between stretching the better.\n\nBelow is a approximate time line you can follow. When in doubt, wait longer.\n\nThe approximate healing/wait times in-between stretches are as follows:\n\n1. Fresh Piercing 5 to 6 months\n2. 14g to 12g 1+ month\n3. 12g to 10g 1.5+ months\n4. 10g to 8g 2+ months\n5. 8g to 6g 3+ months\n6. 6g to 4g 3+ month\n7. 4g to 2g 3+ months\n8. 2g to 1g 4+ months\n9. 1g to 0g 4+ months\n10. 0g to 9mm+ 4+ months\n\nThese are just general recommendations. It is important to note that **some people may need to go slower.** It can be VERY hard to tell if you are going too fast. Stretching is not a race. The question should **never** be \"How fast can I go?\" But rather: \"How *slow* should I go to avoid doing any damage.\"\n\n## TAPERS\n\n**Tapers should never be used for stretching.** Tapers  can (and often do) easily cause severe damage before you realize what is  happening. This is due to to the very gradual increase in size. The  only person that may need to use one of these tools is a professional  piercer.\n\n## How To Stretch Your Lobes\n\nThe best method of stretching is simply \"dead-stretching\" using  Single Flare Plugs. What this means is you simply insert new plugs that  are slightly larger than what you have been currently wearing for a good  amount of time.\n\nIt‚Äôs become fairly easy to find Glass Plugs in 1MM and even .5MM  increments. The smaller the increase in size, the safer it is. You  should never stretch more than 1MM at a time.\n\nFor example, if you wanted to stretch from 14 gauge to 00 Gauge, you would buy sets of plugs in each of these sizes:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 14 Gauge (1.6MM)\n* 12 Gauge (2MM)\n* 10 Gauge (2.5MM)\n* 8 Gauge (3MM)\n* 6 Gauge (4MM)\n* 4 Gauge (5MM)\n* 2 Gauge (6MM)\n* 1 Gauge (7MM)\n* 0 Gauge (8MM)\n* 0 Gauge (9MM) <-- Always find half-sizes, the smaller the stretch the better.\n* 00 Gauge (10MM)\n* **You can find jewelry in .5MM sizes here:** [Gorilla Glass .5MM Plugs](https://www.laughingbuddhabodypiercing.com/piercing-jewelry/single-flare-stretching-kit-plugs/) & [Nirvana Glass .5MM Plugs](https://www.etsy.com/shop/NirvanaGlassMods)\n\nWear each pair for the recommended time (see above) or longer! After a  while, your ears naturally stretch enough to wear the next size. If you  ever feel tingling sensations, burning, pain, or any other sensation  after stretching, downsize immediately.\n\nIf you cannot (easily) fit the next pair of plugs after the average  time necessary, then you can use a small amount of weight suspended  through a pair of metal tunnels. Do not use glass or organic tunnels as  these can break. Only use weights for a short time each day (2-4 hours)  and give your lobes time to rest after their use. **Weights should only be used as a last resort.**\n\nTaping is a method of stretching in which one or more layers of PTFE  or Bondage tape are wrapped around jewelry to increase diameter.  Although this *can* be done safely, it's possible to cut your  lobes on the sharp edges of bondage tape. PTFE tape is thin & hard  to work with, tends to stick to your lobes and is extremely hard to keep  smooth. The methods previously mentioned are a far better option.\n\n## Gauges\n\nYou should completely ignore what ‚ÄúGauge‚Äù your jewelry is past 2  Gauge. Instead, start measuring in Millimeters. Get yourself a decent  caliper:\n\n[Vinca Digital Caliper](https://www.amazon.com/VINCA-DCLA-0605-Electronic-Fractions-Conversion/dp/B017KUC6XQ/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1487982416&sr=8-4&keywords=caliper)\n\n[Empire Pocket Caliper](https://www.amazon.com/Empire-Level-2783-Pocket-Caliper/dp/B0002H33TQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1487982452&sr=8-1&keywords=empire+)\n\nYou can find these at your local hardware or department store. They  will help you measure your jewelry and confirm you received the correct  size.\n\n**Warning:** Nearly all jewelry varies a bit in size due to being hand-made!\n\nA pair of 18.5MM plugs that I ordered from Gorilla Glass were  actually 18.66MM and 18.78MM... This means that on average the  measurements were off by .22MM. In my opinion, this pair was off a bit  more than usual and I wouldn't accept anything off by more than that.\n\n## Keeping your Lobes Healthy\n\nIt is standard practice to remove your jewelry while you are  sleeping. This helps to promote circulation to the ear lobes and  prevents thinning.\n\nThere are exceptions to the rule such as when you are  about to  stretch, or have recently stretched. However, some people simply cannot  leave their jewelry out for 8 hours. The point is to allow your lobes  time to rest each day, while still being able to easily & gently  insert your jewelry again.\n\n2-4 weeks **AFTER AND BEFORE** a stretch, you should  leave the jewelry in while you sleep. Each day after you shower still  remove the jewelry, gently massage & re-lubricate your lobes, and  let them rest for **at least 1 hour!**\n\nT**ry not to sleep on your earlobes after a stretch.**  Instead practice sleeping on your back. There are pillows that have the  center cut out that you can find, usually labeled as \"travel pillows.\"  You can also cut your own using foam.\n\nIf you are trying to re-absorb a blow-out or reduce the \"cat-butt\"  effect, lubricating and gently massaging your lobes 3 times a day may  prove to be beneficial.\n\n## How to Make \"Ear Butter\"\n\nIt is incredibly simple to make your own ear butters.\n\nFor the ear butter you will need the following ingredients:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [Coconut Oil = 1 TBSP ](https://www.amazon.com/Carrington-Farms-Organic-Virgin-Coconut/dp/B00CPZPYLS/ref=sr_1_4_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1488192516&sr=8-4&keywords=organic+coconut+oil)\n* [Vitamin E Oil = 1 TBSP](https://www.amazon.com/SALE-Tocopherol-Organic-Anti-Aging-Antioxidant/dp/B01IB3P0N4/ref=sr_1_2_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1506518831&sr=8-2&keywords=Organic+Vitamin+E+Oil+8+oz)\n* [Jojoba Oil = 1 TBSP](https://www.amazon.com/Viva-Naturals-Pressed-Hexane-Organic/dp/B01AYG74DK/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1488192485&sr=8-3&keywords=organic+jojoba+oil)\n* [Raw Organic Cocoa Butter = 1 TBSP](https://www.amazon.com/Cocoa-Butter-Raw-Pure-Unrefined/dp/B00CIZ0DNO/ref=sr_1_4_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1505929308&sr=8-4&keywords=raw+organic+cocoa+butter)\n* [Emu Oil (AEA Certified Always) = 1 TBSP](https://www.amazon.com/PRO-EMU-OIL-Natural-Emu/dp/B001DKGJQU/ref=sr_1_1_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1505929371&sr=1-1&keywords=Pro%2BEmu%2BOil%2B8%2Boz&th=1)\n* [Organic Beeswax =  1 TBSP for a soft \"butter,\" or 2 TBSP for a firmer mix](https://www.amazon.com/ChefLand-ORGANIC-Beeswax-Cosmetic-Filtered/dp/B00455IWK6/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1488193128&sr=8-3&keywords=organic+beeswax)\n\nInstructions:\n\nYou will need two pots, a large pot filled with water, and a small  pot to set inside the larger pot which will float on top of the water.  This is how you make a double boiler.\n\n**1.** Place pots on stove, on Low heat.\n\n**2.** Add all ingredients to small pot.\n\n**3.** Slowly allow all the ingredients to melt together.\n\n**4.** Stir thoroughly & pour into small mason jar or other container and allow to cool at room temp.\n\nWhen cooled, it should be creamy to slightly firm depending on how  much beeswax you decide to use. If it is too hard for your liking, melt  mixture back down and add more oils. If it is too soft add more beeswax.\n\n## Remember: It's Not a Race! Be Safe!\n\nI have written this article to pass on the knowledge given to me by  \\*professionals. I have had over a dozen (trusted) professionals read  over this guide to verify it's safety & accuracy according to  current standards in the industry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* I do not claim to be a  professional piercer nor do I work in the body modification industry.

I feel like deadstretching would be worse, since you have to shove something in instead of stretching and letting it heal. I'm up to 8g, using tapers, and I haven't had any issues so far. I do get that tapers are bad to use after 2g, since it's too big of a jump to do at once, but when you're just going .5mm increments every few months, I wouldn't consider that big. I also didn't know that you shouldn't sleep with it in, I always thought you were meant to keep them on all the time unless you're in the shower or cleaning it. I'm obviously no professional, and I was born with a lucky body (everything heals fast and I've never gotten an infection, when I was young and got my ears pierced, I wouldn't take care of it but never got an infection) so I can't speak for how it affects others, but from my experience and opinions, deadstretching seems so painful compared to tapering...",

    "body": "I've never given much thought or time for my hair, but i've always wished for the soft shiny Asian hair that I see so often in Korean beauty, Asian dramas, etc. I actually decided to do some research and buy a few things to change up my hair and I started by ditching my 'head and shoulders' and buying sheshido brand shampoo and conditioner. Switching to this actually made a huge difference right away. I ended up purchasing [Shiseido](https://www.influenster.com/reviews/shiseido-super-mild-hair-shampoo) [Super mild shampoo](https://www.influenster.com/reviews/shiseido-super-mild-hair-shampoo), and the [Shiseido Aqua daily treatment](https://www.amazon.com/AQUAIR-Shiseido-Daily-Treatment-Refill/dp/B0012UQIA8) to replace my conditioner.\n\nI did a lot of reading and found that ph balance of your scalp is really important, as well as doing a deep cleanse/exfoliate on your scalp at least once a week. I've never considered using a vinegar rinse but a lot of products i've found actually have vinegar included in them such as the [Tony Moly heyo mayo hair nutrition pack](https://en.koreadepart.com/shop/item.php/1515475777/). I also stumbled upon the gem that is 'hair masks' Just like we do sheet masks for our face there is an option to do that for your hair so I decided to try out the [Etude House silk scarf double care hair mask](https://en.koreadepart.com/shop/item.php/1333945321/), which is essentially just a hair treatment and a cap that you leave on for 10-15 minutes. But wait, there's more...Apparently it's common in Korea to use a \"Scaler\" which is an oil or gel cleanser that \"works to cleanse the scalp and get rid of dirt, oil, dead skin, and any built-up hair products.\" I picked up the [Beyond deep clean cooling scaler](https://en.koreadepart.com/shop/item.php/1500873238/) which was actually very refreshing and very nice to use. I used the deep cleansing scaler on dry hair and washed it off with shampoo, and finished with the mayo hair nutrition pack. My hair feels very soft, its shiny, and my scalp hasn't produced as much oil as it normally would have by day 2. I noticed that my ends are shinier although I'm about 8 months past due for a trim. I think the game has changed now that I am putting as much effort on my scalp as I am with my skin.\n\nI'm super excited because I'm still a hair care newbie so if you want to share your products and hair advice that would be great.\n\n[This](https://beautytap.com/2017/07/korean-hair-care-routine/) is the article I read up on, and [this](https://www.theballeronabudget.com/2017/03/19/korean-hair-care-guide/) is where I got my original product advice from.\n\nMy hair before - [https://i.imgur.com/ZRsQpKq.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ZRsQpKq.jpg)\n\nMy hair after - [https://i.imgur.com/rGdOGx9.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/rGdOGx9.jpg)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/xHTCwpb.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/xHTCwpb.jpg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.s I'll admit my after pictures aren't the best but you can see the visible difference from my dry, unmanageable hair before to a softer, shinier hair now - even though I haven't cut it in a while.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: There was some issues I experienced personally with the shampoo and conditioner that I posted (and tried) that resulted in excessive hair loss. I don't know if it was the Sheshido super mild shampoo or the Sheshido aqua daily treatment conditioner but I stopped using both of them half way through. Although I did see a difference in the health of my hair it was falling out at an alarming rate. I tried many samples of different shampoo and conditioners before I switched to [Kracie Ichikami Natural Care Select](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/kracie-ichikami-natural-care-select-trail-set-smooth-shampoo-10ml/info.html/pid.1068485139) which is a natural amino based shampoo and conditioner. After switching to this product I stopped seeing hair loss and I saw a healthier shine. I no longer use hair masks to achieve the healthy look because it's so hydrating and does not strip the hair of oils so now my hair care routine consists of exfoliating the scalp, and this shampoo and conditioner set. Other than that I occasionally do an at home hair treatment consisting of avocado oil and black seed oil (for hair growth) which I massage in my scalp and hair and leave overnight. I do this once a month or every other month since the shine / benefits last long enough before I need do another treatment. I no longer use Tony Moly Heyo mayo or Etude house silk scarf products, or any other hair treatment. (If I were to recommend one for convenience though I'd still pick Tony Moly Heyo Mayo.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust thought I'd update you on my hair journey since this is still a highly searched article.\n\n[Also more info on scalp care to put things into perspective!](https://beautytap.com/2017/11/scalp-care/)\n\n#",

Maybe there's a name for it already, but Pre-Fried Rice is the best I've come up with. It's similar to a pilaf. Fiddle with ingredients (mushroom, chilies, ground beef or pork or tofu, quinoa, egg, cabbage, etc) as you see fit, as this is more about technique than the recipe itself. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1lb ground turkey -- $3\n\n2 cups dry rice (plus water according to instructions) -- $0.50\n\n1 bunch of kale or other dark leafy green -- $1\n\n\\~2 servings powdered beef bone broth -- $2 (the brand I use has 10g protein per serving, hence the cost)\n\n1 onion -- $0.25\n\n1T tamari or soy sauce -- $0.25\n\nDash of avocado oil or some other healthy high heat oil -- $0.25\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCook the ground turkey in a pot with avocado oil over medium high heat until the meat starts to brown. Add chopped onions and chopped kale. Keep cooking over high heat and let everything brown a bit. Add rice, powdered bone broth, tamari, and water (minus one tablespoon to account for the tamari). Then just cook it like you would rice. \n\nNow all you need to do is throw this in a hot pan and sear it quickly to serve. Using the rice as a rough gauge...2 cups dry = 6 cups cooked, so this makes at least 12 servings of an all in one easy meal of meat, carb, and veg for about $7.25 or $0.65 per meal. My bag of rice says a 1/4c is a serving, but I'm trying to feed you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this helps.",

    "body": "The following post was originally contributed my /u/mjconns, who recently left the moderator team, and deleted the original post.\n  \nThis is a one-stop shop for all weight-related questions -- also known as cutting/bulking/recomp. Ideas, suggestions, guides, workouts, etc -- everything you'll need to answer 99% of questions! This is meant to be a community/collaborative effort, so please add in suggestions in the comments!\n\nTo be clear on a couple terms -- when exercising and eating to gain weight, that is called¬†__bulking__¬†(aka caloric \"surplus\"). Eating less to lose weight is called¬†__cutting__¬†(aka caloric \"deficit\"). And eating just enough to not gain or lose weight is called¬†__maintenance__¬†(aka recomposition or \"recomp\").\n\n## A visual guide to male and female BF% estimates\n\n-   [From athleanx](https://www.instagram.com/p/B8IPmtkFYQx/?igshid=17upb60h7gk3)\n\nI don't like guessing BF% as there's no way to know how much visceral fat we store internally. But athleanx's general guidelines are as good as any for visual estimates.\n\n## Who should cut or bulk?\n\nThe idea behind cut and bulk cycles is to gain muscle and fat in a bulk phase and then try to keep all your muscle and burn off fat in a cut phase. This approach is generally 'faster', when done correctly, than \"recomps\" (recompositions) where you maintain your weight but work out hard and try to replace fat with muscle.\n\nGenerally speaking, if you're an active person and/or consistently working out, you can do cut/bulk cycles. To get started, you need to know your¬†maintenance¬†calories (\"maint\") to have an idea on how many calories you can consume without gaining or losing weight, hence the term maintenance; no change in weight. To bulk, you eat more than maintenance (aka \"surplus\") and to cut you eat less than maintenance (aka \"deficit\"). If you¬†*are not*¬†working out and you bulk, that's how you get fat. So don't eat above maint if you're not also working out.\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo get started, you need to know your \"maintenance\" calorie needs and for an estimate you need a TDEE calculator (I like¬†[this one](https://tdeecalculator.net/), but you can google for others). Think of this as a starting point to use that will need some adjusting over time.\n\nOnce you have an estimated maintenance, you generally add 250-500 calories for a bulk and subtract 250-750 calories in a cut. Generally, it's safer to over-do cuts and under-do bulks. In a bulk you gain both fat and muscle and after a point you only gain fat (fat stores faster than you can build new muscle), so be cautious in bulks and don't \"dirty\" bulk.\n\n## Deciding to cut or bulk\n\nSo far as I'm aware, there isn't a hard science behind¬†*when*¬†to bulk or cut, but there are guidelines to consider. When bulking, our bodies build muscle¬†*and*¬†store fat and, after a point, our bodies prioritize storing fat over building muscle. This is why dirty bulking is bad and, generally speaking, if your BF% is > 20%, you should not bulk. Any higher BF% and your body tends to prioritize fat storage vs muscle gained from bulking.\n\nSimilarly, cuts are usually done to around 10% because any lower than that and the body will begin to consume more muscle than fat and muscle loss is more likely.\n\nYou¬†*can*¬†make strength gains on a cut. You can't build new muscle, but you can \"refactor\" (that's my word for it, I'm sure there's a scientific one) existing muscle to be more efficient, hence stronger, as you lose fat. Also, repetitive gym visits will help you become more proficient at working out which helps in the long run when you start bulking and building new muscle.\n\nIf you're really unsure, you can make a post in¬†[r/BulkOrCut](https://www.reddit.com/r/BulkOrCut/)¬†to get community feedback on what it's you personally should do.\n\nIf you're skinnyfat, generally you can eat at a small maintenance (aka \"clean bulk\") and make great strength gains. If you have little muscle mass to cut to, you will just look tiny/thin -- especially if you're tall. So for most skinnyfat people, and I would clean bulk and diligently follow a legit lifting routine. Which brings me to...\n\n## Workout routines\n\nBefore getting into routines, I think it's worth mentioning first that¬†everyone should walk more. At least 5 times per week, 30 minutes per day:\n\n-   [Get ripped. Get walking.](https://www.t-nation.com/training/get-ripped-get-walking)\n\nCheck out¬†[The Beginner's Guide to Working Out](https://www.reddit.com/r/workout/comments/ihz264/beginners_guide_to_working_out/)\n\nThe best workout routine is the one you can consistently follow. If you're new to the gym, just about anything will get you some results. To a point. If you want to be smart about it,¬†do not make up your own routine!¬†There are plenty of legit, tried-and-true, FREE¬†[recommended lifting routines](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/)¬†to choose from. I like these routines vs googling something random because these are routines many, many people in various subreddits are doing and have done in the past that can help answer any questions you might have. It's nice to have someone else that is doing or has done the program you're running to offer direct advice from their experience. But you can just google other routines if you want. Just make sure it has:\n\n-   1.  Progressive overload\n\n-   2) Structured days to not hit body parts more than 2x/week\n\nIf you're working out at home, check out¬†[this post](https://www.reddit.com/user/GovSchwarzenegger/comments/flz3es/stay_at_home_stay_fit/)¬†from Arnold Schwarzenegger with a detailed bodyweight home routine.\n\nAlso another great¬†[full body workout](https://www.instagram.com/p/CA3ajQZjUTx/)¬†for people at home with no equipment.\n\n## What to eat\n\nAt the end of the day, for 99% of people (various diseases, ailments, and conditions aside), all that matters are Calories In, Calories Out (CICO). This controls weight¬†gain¬†and¬†loss. Lifting heavy weights encourages¬†strength gains¬†or at least strength maintenance in both surplus/bulks and deficit/cuts. But to gain or lose lbs on a scale, the total calories consumed minus calories used and the resulting surplus/deficit are what matters. But how much of what you eat matters...\n\nThere's a lot of suggested science over what to eat, but there are generally sound rules of thumbs to follow which are easily broken down into \"Macros\" for tracking purposes:\n\n-   Proteins (1 gram = 4 calories)\n\n-   Carbs (1 gram = 4 calories)\n\n-   Fats (1 gram = 9 calories)\n\nCollectively, all the macros we consume = total consumption (Calories In). When cutting, it's easiest to cut down fats and carbs. But keep protein high. When bulking, generally you add carbs and/or fats. Protein should always be high; it's what helps build muscle directly.\n\nHowever,¬†*how we feel*¬†when consuming these calories and what we get out of other nutrients is important.\n\n#### Fats\n\nWe all need healthy fats to help regulate hormonal balances. This is usually room-temp fats (think extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, various nuts, avocados, etc); less important are the fats in meat and dairy products, for example. A general rule of thumb is to aim for at least¬†30% x total calories¬†for your fats macro. This is the same for cutting or bulking, but when bulking you can increase if you want.\n\nE.g. if you're consuming 2000 calories daily, aim for 0.3x2000 (600) calories to be from fats.\n\n#### Carbs\n\nNext come carbs. Carbs are not evil. They're a tool. Our body prefers and relies on carbs to refuel energy stores. Simple, nutrient-dense carbs are preferred -- not complex or junk carbs. The reason for this is 1) satiation, how long we'll feel full, and 2) other nutrient content. When you can, get your carbs from fresh/frozen fruits and veggies. That will do far more for you than crackers, cereal, donuts, etc. Even though the carbs will be utilized equally, produce holds far more vitamins and minerals that have relevant health and recovery benefits that can't be overstated.\n\nGenerally, aim for¬†25-45%¬†of your calories to be carbs (depending on cutting/bulking).\n\n#### Protein\n\nGenerally, you want to keep protein fairly high. Anywhere from¬†.75-1+ gram of protein per lbs of body weight.¬†This can come from any source, as our body will utilize them the same. But some sources are preferred, depending on whether you're cutting or bulking. Ideally, aim for now more than 40-50 grams per meal/protein shake and spread out the consumption through the day.\n\nThe remainder of your calories should be protein.\n\n#### Timing\n\nAs carbs are for energy, many people prefer to have more carbs timed around workouts (and no fats during this period) to help boost performance and recovery. If you're going to eat your carbs (e.g. rice and chicken breast), do so about two hours before working out; otherwise, liquid/quickly consumed carbs are preferred (e.g. orange or apple juice). Again, post-workout, get simple carbs and protein into your system via a shake or meal fairly soon. Save fats for well-before or after workouts.\n\n##Measuring success\n\nFirst and foremost, gym progress should always be factored in first. If your routine says X lift should go up Y amount each week, generally you want to be hitting that to know you're on track. If your lift #s are going up according to your routine, you're doing great! If you aren't, there's a breakdown somewhere and you should ask for guidance if you cannot asses the fail point yourself.\n\nSecondly, the weight scale. You want to make sure your body weight is trending in your goal direction. It's ideal to weigh yourself¬†*the same way*¬†every time.\n\nFor example, I wake up, go to the bathroom, and then weigh myself every day for three weeks and then I average my daily changes over those three weeks. I generally aim to gain .5-.75 lbs per week and lose .75-1 lbs per week. If I'm gaining or losing too much, I adjust my macros ~ 250 calories and measure again for three weeks and so on.\n\nDon't get caught up daily changes; I sometimes vary 3-5 lbs between days! Weigh daily for three weeks and average it out. Don't worry about the daily weight, find an average to determine where the trend is taking you and adjust if needed. This will take the annoying variances out of the picture and let you focus on meaningful change.\n\nYou can also measure your wrists, waist, neck, etc, as well as take photos, but that's more preference and not as commonly suggested.\n\n##Bulking and cutting strategies\n\nI've seen people make amazing progress, both gaining and losing weight, in a variety of ways. Ideally, be healthy. Emphasize fresh/frozen fruits and veggies. But, at the end of the day,¬†many approaches work. You can bulk or cut as a vegan, intermittent fasting (\"IF\"), KETO, IIFYM, etc. Many approaches work. They are but tools available to you, so find one that best helps you meet your goal. So choose the best \"diet\" or tool that helps you achieve a goal! If that's keto, great! If that's caveman, awesome. I don't care! Limit your calories in whatever \"diet\" you choose and you'll see results.\n\nIn my opinion, it's better to make¬†*lifestyle*¬†changes that to follow a diet for a short time. So I don't really like \"diets\" per se, but more so recommend eating like an adult and limiting calories. But even still, different tactics can help in that goal, and you can deploy as many or as few as you want:\n\n-   Intermittent Fasting (\"IF\")\n\n-   Tracking macros / IIFYM (If It Fits Your Macros)\n\n-   \"Banking\" calories\n\nI don't buy into the other 'benefits' of¬†IF, but it was a tactic that worked for me. I am a volume eater. I generally eat well, but I like eating¬†*a lot*. So when I'm cutting, my meals were small and sad. The idea behind IF is that you have a short window of time which you eat meals, the rest of the day you fast. Again, all that matters are calories. You can absolutely get fat eating 10k calories in a 5 hour window. So there's no magic in doing this. But for me, doing IF allowed me to have larger, more satiating meals within the \"eating window\" instead of more, smaller meals.\n\nMacros¬†are discussed above, but the idea behind IIFYM is that you've a set # for each macro and, so long as what you're eating fits neatly into the prescribed macro allotment, go for eating whatever you want! And, again, so long as total calories are low enough for you, you will lose weight. But this is¬†[r/BulkorCut](https://www.reddit.com/r/BulkorCut/), not¬†[r/weightloss](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightloss/). People here are also working out.¬†How well you workout, recover, perform, feel, etc¬†is affected by what you eat. So, sure, add in \"fun\" foods sometimes. But don't eat like a child simply because it fit your macros. A safe rule of thumb is to eat \"cleanly\" 80% of the time when bulking, whatever the other 20% of the time. When cutting, I try to eat cleanly 90-95% of the time with fewer treats. What that treat is might change -- some weeks I just want pancakes, other weeks I just want a couple beers. Do what works for you, just do so in controlled quantities.\n\nI liked¬†\"banking\" calories¬†when I knew I had a special event, date night with the wife, party, or whatever where I'd be consuming extra calories. One way to account for that is to deduct an¬†*additional*¬†amount of calories each day leading up to the event, to then splurge on that event. Example:\n\nLet's say my maintenance is 2,500 calories and I'm eating at a -500 deficit, so I'm eating 2,000 calories daily. I want to take my wife out for our anniversary, so the week leading up to our date night I deduct an additional -250 calories each day and only eat 1,750 calories daily. This gives me 7x250 (=1750) \"banked\" calories I can add to my 2,000 calories on our anniversary. Now I can have a nice dinner, dessert, a drink or two, all without blowing my diet out of whack!\n\n##Body fat % (BF%) estimates\n\nEstimating ones body fat % is kind of hard. We can't see how much fat is stored internally around organs; some people store more fat over the abs, some more around their love handles (that's me!), and others in their legs/ass. So it's really hard to tell. There are various ways to scan BF%, but most are imprecise with a +/- 20% variance. In my opinion, the only thing they're useful for is estimating BF%¬†*changes*. Let's say it reads 20% for you; in six months, you try again and it says 15%. You probably lost around 5% BF%, but your actual BF% might be 12%-18%. So it's not a particularly accurate reading, but the rate change is a useful gauge.\n\nThe best ways to learn BF% are via:\n\n-   Underwater Weighing (Hydrostatic Weighing) (1-2% variance)\n\n-   DEXA scan (1-2% variance)\n\nEverything else has huge variance and is only useful for measuring rate of change.\n\n##Differences in males and females\n\n-   Basically,¬†[there aren't any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HToXo6gS7-s)\n\n-   It ultimately comes down to¬†goals¬†and therefore what you're going to emphasize/work towards.\n\n##Useful posts/resources\n\n-   [The Absolute Beginner's Guide to the Gym](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/cg9c8d/the_absolute_beginners_guide_to_the_gym/)\n\n-   [To Bulk And Cut Or Not To Bulk And Cut](https://bretcontreras.com/to-bulk-and-cut-or-not/)\n\n-   [Here is a credible, no BS approach to getting abs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsph7_-pizw&feature=youtu.be&t=146)\n\n##People to follow\n\n-   [pheasyque](https://www.instagram.com/pheasyque/)¬†- excellent diagrams, tutorials, and generally great content on how to lift properly\n\n-   [Stefi Cohen](https://www.instagram.com/steficohen/)¬†- 22 world records, doctorate in physical therapy, gym owner, coach.

        "body": "32M Struggling to Build Muscle After Losing 176 Pounds in Less Than 2 Years (376 to 200 lbs) ‚Äì Seeking Advice\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI‚Äôm a 32-year-old male, 6‚Äô0‚Äù, 200 pounds, and I‚Äôve been struggling to build muscle despite putting in consistent effort at the gym. Here‚Äôs a bit of background:\n\nI used to weigh 376 pounds and managed to lose 176 pounds in less than two years by simply cutting out food in an unhealthy way. My body fat dropped from 58% to 28%. After that drastic weight loss, I took about a year and a half to relax and let my body adjust.\n\nFast forward to now‚ÄîI‚Äôve been hitting the gym regularly for the past year. I‚Äôm proud to say all the sagging fat from my weight loss (below my waistline, chest, etc.) has tightened up, and my body looks and feels better. However, I‚Äôm frustrated because I‚Äôve seen no significant muscle growth or strength improvement in the last few months.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôve tried and some relevant details:\n\t‚Ä¢\tDiet: I follow a strict Mediterranean diet and incorporate wild game (elk, venison, duck) that I hunt myself. However, I recently discovered I‚Äôm only eating around 50-80 grams of protein daily, far below my estimated need of 200 grams.\n\t‚Ä¢\tEnergy Levels: I feel exhausted after just a few minutes at the gym and struggle with fatigue in everyday life as well. I‚Äôm tired at work and generally feel low-energy almost all the time.\n\t‚Ä¢\tHormone Testing: I‚Äôve had my hormones tested, and while nothing major has come up so far, I‚Äôll have a much more comprehensive test on the 29th, covering vitamins, hormones, glands, and more.\n\t‚Ä¢\tWorkout Routine: I‚Äôve been relying on machines and YouTube workouts to target specific muscle groups, but I‚Äôve never had a professional guide me with a structured plan.\n\t‚Ä¢\tSupplements: I‚Äôm currently not taking any supplements.\n\nWhat I‚Äôm looking for:\n\t1.\tDiet Suggestions: Could my low protein intake be the main issue? Any tips on reaching my protein goals with my current diet?\n\t2.\tSupplements: Are there specific supplements I should consider to boost energy, strength, or recovery?\n\t3.\tWorkout Routine: Can anyone recommend a proven routine or program to build muscle effectively? Should I stick to machines, or focus more on free weights and compound exercises?\n\t4.\tGeneral Advice: If you‚Äôve been in a similar situation or have experience with plateauing after weight loss, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts.",

Being strongman or Arnold is nice but if your body is dogshit in terms of usefulness then I feel like it‚Äôs not for me. \n\nWhat should I do then? Should I try bodyweight workouts? Should I start calisthenics with some app like freeletics? If I keep my nutrition like that (high protein) will I lose muscle? \n\nThanks and have a great day",

I think paprika and oregano add alot to a steak.  Seriously, try it. \n\nAnd finally, I think ribeye is kinda over rated. Strip is the better cut. Not as tender but much better texture and flavor. \n\nHonestly if the only thing I can criticize is personal preference, you done good. I don't see any technical flaws. Cooked perfectly assuming you wanted a medium rare, reasonably well seasoned.",

Read the label inside the little pan picture, \"Seasoned Cast Iron Skillet with Silicone Handle Holder.\" Just wash it out good with water and a sponge or dishcloth to get off store shelf or shipping dust and such, dry it, then heat it on your stove or cooktop to really dry it, apply the slightest bit of oil after the pan is dry but still warm, dry the oil off as much as you can, then watch as you heat it up further for the first sign of smoke, then add a little bit of oil and start cooking. \n\nMany say best to start with bacon or some other really fatty meat, and some say toss/sacrifice the first few strips of bacon you make just because they might have some sort of new-pan steel flavor or something.  But I probably wouldn't, at least recently what I did when I broke in a brand-new already-seasoned cast-iron skillet was that I just started making and eating bacon, tossing not one single strip into the garbage.  \n\nThere are some skillets that arrive yet to be seasoned, some that arrive barely seasoned, like certain makes of carbon steel skillets/woks in particular arrive with just a couple of coats of just the thinnest of seasoning, BUT Lodge pretty much seasons the heck out of their new cast iron skillets.  \n\nIt's a Lodge and nobody seasons a new Lodge.  They just start cooking.  (Except for maybe the seriously OCD and some really crazy people.)  Just go get some bacon and start!  (Or some really fatty pork shoulder steaks.)    \n\n(Good choice by the way.  The Lodge 12-inch skillet is the 12-inch skillet owned and used by the most people, by far, more than any other brand of 12-inch skillet.  And maybe more people own and use a Lodge than every other brand of cast-iron skillet combined.  America's Test Kitchen, all sorts of reviewers recommend the Lodge 12\" skillet as the best buy choice for a cast-iron skillet.  You picked good.)",

This is the process I‚Äôm currently following:\n-     Season with salt & pepper & ‚Äòpush‚Äô it into the steak\n-\tPlace back in fridge for an hour\n-\tLet it sit outside the fridge for another hour\n-\tWarm up oven to 210 degrees\n-\tWait until the internal temperature reaches 113 degrees & take it out of the oven\n-\tLet it sit for 10-15 minutes under aluminium foil\n-\tSear in a very hot steel pan using butter for 1 minute on each side\n\nSome improvements I think I can make to get a better crust:\n-\tUse a cast iron pan instead of steel pan\n-\tUse avocado oil instead of butter \n-\tPat steak dry with paper towel before searing\n\nAny other suggestions you can give me to get even better results? Some specific seasoning you can recommend?\n\nThanks!",

If you heat up the pan too fast, the surface might still be \"oil smoking hot\" but the potential energy will not have spread across all the metal on the pan which is what you want so that the surface can retain as much temperature as possible. \n\n\\- Use a different high smoke point oil other than butter. Use a decent amount of it so that it'll cover the surface flat.\n\n\\- Pat the steak dry and let it rest after the oven\n\n\\- Pan temperature at around 450 degrees. Doesn't need to be much higher than this.\n\n\\- When you first put the steak on the pan, press all of the surface down onto the pan. I like to do this with a press/weight I have and I leave the press on top of the steak.\n\n\\- 1 min on each side x2. So I do 1 min then flip and get the other side for a min, then repeat the process for a total of 2 min per side. This method also lets you see the crust to see progress.

Also regardless of how long u salt it for, you should always pat the steak dry before putting it on the pan. Moisture is your enemy when it comes to getting a good sear.\n\n\nYour suggestions u mentioned are great tips like replacing the butter with avocado oil or even just vegetable oil will do a much better job then butter, as butter won‚Äôt fry the steak, it will boil it and burn. \n\nThe only tip I haven‚Äôt seen yet is investing in a steak press, it‚Äôs a thick steel plate that u place on top of the steak to stop it from curling and weigh down the entire steak onto the pan so u get max contact and crust. They make ones with handles that can also be used for making smash burgers and are great for searing bacon too. I got a rectangle cast iron one with a wooden handle and it‚Äôs great and can cover two steaks at once depending on the size. U don‚Äôt need to press down with the press as that will squeeze all the juice out, you just want to place it on top and let‚Äôs it‚Äôs weight hold the steak down. I haven‚Äôt invested in a cast iron skillet yet, but honestly using one of these steak presses has been the most noticeable improvement for the crust of my steaks, they are so uniform now, it‚Äôs insane",

It's possible it is coming off of the iron due to the thermal expansion differences between the ceramic and metal, but this would likely look like cracking/chipping (and then, yes, sadly, probably best to toss it because this is a food safety hazard).  I think, as many are suggesting, it's possible you just have some really burnt and polymerized oil to remove, and the ceramic might be ok.  \n\nStill, everyone should take this as a good lesson to use lower heat and be in the habit of setting yourself an alarm ALWAYS if you're leaving the stove running (this is something I've learned as a degenerate gamer lol).  \"How could I forget? I'll be back in two minutes\" is a lot less reliable than just setting an alarm for 2 minutes to be sure.

LOL\n\nIf you're doing a thick piece of meat like a chicken breast you can either pound it flat, or fillet it open so it's thinner and cooks more quickly.  *(hint: put the chicken into a heavy freezer bag to pound out, much easier clean up)*\n\nIf you're a gym rat and health conscious ... Anytime an oil smokes it's breaking down and creates some very harmful stuff to put in your body.  Plus when you flash fry meat it seizes up and is much tougher.  I know it takes patience but low and slow with a moderate sizzle will make your meals much more enjoyable.\n\nAlso, cook with a thermometer ... if you are eyeballing when it \"looks\" done it's probably been dead for some time and is very dry.  When the center temp reaches 160 for chicken it's done.  Bet you can cut cooking time by a third or even half by cooking to temp. You can get a decent probe thermometer at your grocery or amazon for about $10.\n\np.s. had another thought ... if you're meal prepping try cutting the raw meat into bite sized cubes and then kind of stir frying ... put them out on a paper towel to drain ... then they are easier to portion out",

    "body": "Coming up to the top before I post to say, this became an emotional, long, crazy, and sentimental post. I am sorry not sorry, blame it on the boogie.\n\nComing back because Dinah had read this and said I should say at the top that you should be warned about content around self harm and homophobia.\n\nHey, Boo. Been missing you.\n\nThis might be not as entertaining but I am a little sad on top of all the other feelings. This might be my last update on this crazy ass saga. Why? Well it's all about Miles. No mister here anymore. I'm southern, but that ass doesn't deserve the respect and I am feeling spicy today.\n\nLong story short - fuck who am I kidding? - It's never short with me. Sit down, get comfy, have some tea. I hear I'm great at spilling it. \n\nSo I texted James to confirm my suspicions that he was the son Miles flipped out about being gay. James confirmed it but asked if he can call me later and I agreed. I can't remember if I've said in these posts, but he and I are close. Not best friends or anything, but intimate in the sense that we don't lie to each other and always have had this kind of unpsoken pact to always be honest. \n\nAnd by the gods was that man honest. I'm allowed to share all this by the way as per our agreement I didn't lie about these posts. He said the names were different but he heard it on tiktok (GOD I AM OLD) and felt it was too similar and he'd been meaning to ask me. I laughed and he had a great time teasing me for always being one to give an account of events \"with a flourish\" - I argued that that's how we cook around here, with seasoning.\n\nBut then he got serious. He apologized for not coming out to me. Tbh it *did* hurt me deeply that he didn't see me as trustworthy. It took a good and deep talk with Dinah to realize that feeling was selfish and we all have different journeys in realizing and sharing who we are in this crazy ass world. She reminded me of my own crazy story (I'll have to tell you. I think I will post it someday for the cathartic release of it all. And yall are such absolute gems. I feel like maybe you're not my neighbors in the real sense of it of it, but you are in my soul). So I got my head out of my ass, and somewhat started to get over it. I'M HUMAN.\n\nI did tell James all of this. And he seemed pretty sad. I said that I wasn't blaming him, and assured him that his journey is his, I am not mad at him or anything, and given how his dad reacted to *me* being queer, I get it. He then told me what happened.\n\nJames realized he was gay when he was in college, but his father and grandfather had very detrimental views of \"those in sin\" so he squashed it and threw it, and his real self, firmly in the closet. Sometimes that \"monster\", as he viewed it then, came out like a trauma response when he got overwhelmed or stressed out and one day after graduation, he had been in something of a relationship with a guy James is asking me to call \"Adonis\" (LM-fucking-AO) and they wanted to eventually get married.\n\n The problem of dear Miles still was in play, so James started to go in a dark place. It ended when Adonis came home and found James in his own sick after he swallowed a bunch of his pills for sleeping. They pumped his stomach and he was okay in the end physically - Thank the ancestors for that - but his mind was in shreds. He started therapy at the insistence of his BF. He started to feel like himself, his real self, and became the most grateful bastard in the world that his attempt to end himself didn't work because he says his life now is absolutely incredible.\n\nSo once he recovered, he went to visit his dad and grandmother. When he got Sugah alone, she was cooking his favorite meal (Jallof rice and fish - if yall haven't had this you NEED to try it out. It's not a hard recipe, it just takes time and love. I will share the recipe with anyone interested -  when I got the house after Pop died, Sugah shared hers and I've adapted it to my and Dinah's taste)\n\nLord - sorry you know how I can sometimes go off on little  details. Anyway, he's  with Sugah and she's telling him that she missed him and why hasn't he visited and he slipped and said he was hospitalized and she - *obviously* - wanted to know more so he just up and told her everything: feeling not his full self, meeting Adonis in college, having his first time with him, falling in love with him, all of it. He was so sure she'd kick him out, but he says she just smiled at him, brought his hands to her forehead, and kissed his cheek. She said she already knew he was \"a little on the pendulum\" of sexuality since he got into his teens but she was swelling with joy that he trusted her enough to tell her. He felt emboldened by this and decided he would tell his family at dinner...which Auntie, as I mentioned in another post, told me about the outcome of that.\n\nAfterwards, Miles did everything he could to convince his son that \"living in sin\" was wrong, Adonis is a demon, he just needs to marry a nice girl - become a father - be on the oath God outlined for us - and I don't think the word count will allow for me to outline all the fucking abuse this man threw at James but what I will say was that in telling me about it, James broke down several times. It broke my heart and ignited a part of me I didnt know I had - rage. Pure and unbridled. I felt a rage something fierce and I couldn't let go of it.\n\nI thanked James for telling me and he said \"hey add it to your little saga, I'll be reading to see what *seasoning* you put on it\" and then we made plans for me to meet Adonis next time he comes around the area but he did text me a photo and....CHILD. He really did find a hot one. Think of say, Chris Evans and then Keanu Reeves and imagine they made a baby with the REAL Adonis and that will be close. Abs, blue eyes, killer smile - He's a model. James bagged a fucking model! Sorry for the cussing but damn! Even Dinah thought he was hot and her door does NOT at all swing that way.\n\nI told Dinah about my chat with James and she said we need to really foster that friendship more. I asked her what she meant and she said \"Whenever you talk about him, you look happy. I think he's a real touchstone for your joy of childhood.\" And I thought about it and she was right. \n\n\"James\", I know you are reading too. You really are such a brother to me. I know we don't talk often and I know we both have lives but you are as much apart of me as my eyelashes. I'm lucky to have you so don't you \"ducking\" dare be a stranger. \n\nYesterday was insanity. I worked a halfday from home and there was a knock at the door. It was Sugah, she brought some food because she saw me through my window working away and figured I needed to eat. If you don't have a community Sugah Mama in your life, I am sorry. They are the best.\n\nWe ate and talked and she said she had news. Miles isn't coming back. His sons refused to take him in, drunk as he was, that night so he ended up at his GF's house. And I know for a fucking fact everyone who says my posts are fake will point to this very moment but I swear there is no way to make this up. He *proposed* to said GF and she *accepted* his crusty ass! GIRL! And he calls his mother to say that now she has to choose. She is not invited to his wedding until she apologizes and helps him \"fix\" James. \n\nI literally was howling a \"No he *did not*\" and she's screaming \"Oh *yes he did* baby\" back and forth for what felt like hours. You ever have that? When you just are sharing something so ridiculous and you both know its ridiculous and you just can't get over it. That feeling. We laughed and laughed and then I saw her get a little sad.\n\nThis is already super long for a single post but in that moment, Sugah just shook her head, and she said she really tried with him. He's her son and she loves him so much, but he's not a good person. Then she went through specific moments where she might have \"gone wrong\". Like she was, what's called here, a \"whipping mama\" at first. If you're not southern, that's code for she was a spanker. She learned after her other children that \"hurting them ain't healing them\" and she never raised a hand to them again. But Miles still came out needing to be a big man. It's why his 1st wife left him. 2nd too. (Didn't know he had the 1st wife, myself, so that's new but explains a lot - I always thought the 2nd was his only). She was sad and I hate seeing people I love sad.\n\nYou may have picked up on this but I am awkward as hell. Not great in emotional situations. And when I saw her wipe a tear my brain broke and did the *fuck fix it  fix it  fix it  fix it* spiral (or what Dinah calls my \"Jack O'Neil\" - if you get the reference I LOVE you - mode) so I went with being \"funny\". I told her about talking to James and made fun of both our stories and how weird it was that folk so close to each other are still not close to each other sometimes because he didn't tell me he was gay and I didn't tell him I was bi. It all had to come out after the family drama. I swear I was funnier but Dinah is making me cut that part to be \"Breif\".\n\nWe laughed and she said that she sees me like her own and loves me like a daughter. She wants me to be happy with my love the way she wished she could have been with hers. She doesn't regret her children but Mr. Richard (her late husband) was only nice as an older man. He was wretched to her when they were married young. She married him some out of  a platonic type love and the rest out of pressure to be \"normal.\" \n\nWe hugged and I said something about my posts. I'm a moron. Sorry. And she got *very* confused. I said I only mention it to say that she has so many people now who see her as I do. A treasure. And I screenshotted yalls sweet comments about her and texted them to her. Today she's asked me to print them out for her. I'm waiting for the printer to be done now which is why I am typing on my phone.\n\nCandy texted a thank you saying that Sugah was low after kicking Miles out but she was happier when she got home from visiting me. Can't say why but that made me cry. Jury is out on if that's good or bad. \n\nDinah and I both agree, and mom is on board, to pay for one of those online classes and ask Sugah if she will officiate us. I have no clue how I will ask her but I really want her to be a part of our wedding in a really special way. We're still spitballing about it and of course we have time, but I want it to be special. She is so much a part of me - of us - I need it to be highlighted. \n\nAnd the reasons I am posting today, I was told by Candy that Miles took his belongings early this morning. He refused to speak to anyone in the house and just silently took his stuff and hauled it into his truck bag by bag. The only thing he said was he's never coming back and now they've lost a son/brother. Candy said she said back that he's no brother of hers. \n\nSo with Miles gone for good, I guess so is the end of this weird ass saga of mine lol. Dinah looked up subs and shit I can post on about other stuff but this...I don't know. It feels almost like a goodbye. Weird. I'm emotional about it. I am so glad Miles is gone, but damn. I'll miss you and our timely little tea parties.\n\nTake care of yourselves and be good to yourselves. Remember to eat well and hug your family (chosen or bio) close. \n\nA couple of items I want to spell out - call it housekeeping:\n\nAll names were fake or nicknames so no I probably am not the person next door (that was an actual message I got a lot)\n\nYes I call my stepfather daddy - it's not weird to love a paternal figure who loves you like his own, will be walking you down an aisle, has dried your tears, told you that boy, girl, or person, didn't appreciate you and took you out for treats just to see you smile. He is my hero and the weird messages and comments about him...just get therapy. Not here to kinkshame, *believe me* but christ on bikes batman!\n\nSugah Mama's are a thing! Do you not have those? That's so sad! They are the best. Maybe you call them something different. For me and the culture I grew up in, they're usually women without children but all of them are maternal, loving, safe, trusted, and will hound you to get your shit straight (or gay lol sorry I couldn't help it, I am a child).\n\nYes, we are looking for hot tubs and yes we are going to be sure that Sugah and Candy can come by to enjoy it too.\n\nDinah speaks several languages and English is not her first language. I might be marrying a spy but you got to admit that's pretty hot. Even if I die.\n\nAnd yes people do WFH lol what odd conspiracy theories I've read that I am not real because I WFH! I own a business, and work full time, and I also program here and there by contract. Now you know.\n\nLastly, I was an English major. If that doesn't tell you something, it should üòÖ\n\nThank you all. My heart is full. \n\n\nEdit: got a few asks for the recipe, you're so very welcome for the droves of humans who will bow at your feet for this-\n\nOkay, so here is what you will need: \n\n\n2 cups long grain rice - not any other type just trust me here okay? Otherwise the type doesn't matter. - and if you can, make it parboiled rice. \n\nThen 3 tbsp vegetable oil, but I did use avocado oil before when I hadnt gotten groceries and I didn't notice a huge difference \n\n\n1 chopped  \"red\" onion, white works fine but red is better\n\nMinced garlic. Now that is something you measure with your HEART and nothing else. I tend to throw garlic in cloves at everything.\n\n\nGrated ginger - now just be careful with it. It's a powerful flavor like salt and you can't un-ginger but again MEASURE WITH THE HEART\n\n1 red bell pepper that you will blend to baby food\nAbout 4 medium tomatoes also into baby food\n2 tbsp tomato paste...which is already baby food.\n\nThe rest is pretty normal:\n1 tsp curry powder\n1 tsp thyme\n2 bay leaves - don't leave it in or it will taste bitter\n1 tsp paprika\n1 ghost pepper if you're feeling spicy \n2 cups chicken or vegetable stock - Dinah comes from a vegan family so I've done the vegan version of jallof\nAnd seasonings to your or your guests tastes\n\nThat's all for the rice alone which is very tasty but if you wanna really kick it into high gear, here is what you need for the fish:\nFor the Grouper Fish:\n\nHowever many fresh or fresh as you can grouper fish fillets is best, but in a pinch find the best flakey white fish and pray lol\n\n\n2 tbsp olive oil\n1 tbsp lemon juice\nMince garlic\n1 tsp paprika\n1 tsp cumin\n1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (if you're feeling spicy)\nFresh cilantro (for garnish)\n2 tomatoes chopped into quarters\n1 green bell pepper chopped into bits\n\nIf you've got all that, here's how you make a woman want to marry you (or man, person, whoever).\n\n\nMake a fish marinade: use a bowl, toss in your olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, paprika, cumin, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. You rub that on the fish and let it sit for a half hour and OMG you're about to see heaven.\n\nNow make sure u heat oil in a *large* pot (youll need the real estate trust me) over \"medium\" heat. Add your onions, garlic, and ginger, and saut√© \n\nStir in the blended tomatoes, red bell pepper, and tomato paste. Cook for about 20ish minutes, stirring until its a thick as your live for yourself.\n\nNow add the curry powder, thyme, paprika, and bay leaves and stir that up like your gossip buddy does drama.\n\nPour in the chicken/vegetable stock and bring the mixture to a simmer then rice next, making sure it's evenly distributed in the sauce. Cover the pot and dial down the heat to low. Let it cook for a half hour, but DO NOT WALK AWAY FROM IT  stir it so the rice is fully cooked and fluffy. Yes the fluff matters!\n\nHere it gets a little intense - while the rice is cooking, you also need to heat your pan over \"medium\" heat (I use the qoutes because no stove is the same) and add a bit of olive oil. Sear them fillets for 5 minutes on each side until golden brown and cooked through.\n\nDO NOT RUSH THIS - in the last 2 minutes of cooking, toss in the chopped tomatoes and  bell peppers around the fish. Saut√© until soft.\n\nPut your cilantro on that and let your partner grovel at your greatness. They will propose so stand ready lol\n",

    "body": "As a shortass with a desk job, this subreddit has given me so many good ideas and inspiration. So I wanted to share some things I've learned while eating 1000-1200 cals a day:\n\n1. Graham crackers are only 60 calories each\n2. Lavash bread makes the best low cal pizza crust (better than tortillas)\n3. Shirataki rice is great, shirataki noodles can be hit or miss (Miracle Noodles are the brand I like)\n4. Froyo Ben and Jerry's is half the calories of original, and 100x better than Halo Top\n5. Speaking of Halo Top, low calorie Breyers is da bomb\n6. Sugar free pudding is ~150 calories for a huuuuge serving\n7. Almond milk is much lower cal than dairy milk, and works as a sub in everything I've tried\n8. Calorie 'free' (serving size dependent) maple syrup exists. Waffles/pancakes with a bunch of syrup can easily be less than 300 cals.\n9. Weight everything the first couple of times, after that eyeballing generally works (although I'll still weight every so often). Weight when raw and defrosted; worst cause you'll get an over estimate on cals.\n10. Baking with fake sugar is hard and I haven't found total success yet (almost always get a weird cooling sensation)\n11. The craze is real: diet soda + cake mix is great if you can portion well.\n12. Hot sauce saves everything. My favorite is Valentina (cheap, spicy and thick)\n13. Ranch seasoning can be added so many things to make them taste better.\n14. No sugar added ketchup is half the calories, tastes the same \n15. Baked chicken wings with baking soda + other seasoning is very good.\n16. To add to the above, Buffalo sauce is 0 cals.\n17. Misto is a product that turns any oil into a spray. I love it for avocado oil, cos that's hard to find in spray form (without additives)\n18. Cheese is a million calories for a crumb, the struggle is real.\n19. Buuut, low fat feta cheese is not terrible.\n20. Spike seltzer is a life safer for social drinking. Diet coke + vodka *tall* is also my go to, which is extra diet and single measure of vodka.\n21. Take out/delivery is the enemy. Those who can stick to low cal options; I salute you.\n22. Freezing small scopes of cookie dough (~70 cals each) have been helpful for taming the post-dinner sweet tooth.\n23. I save most of my calories for dinner, and have a 'double meal' with two courses of 300-400 each.\n24. As above, I generally only have two meals a day, sometimes just one. OMAD can be helpful.\n25. I mess up all the time. When I feel the strong desire to binge/indulge, I try to indulge in readily available foods, which are already lower cal since theyre in my house. This means if I go over, it's only by 500-1000 cals. Ordering out or going to the grocery store during those times could easily jump to 3000/4000 over.\n\nHope some of these are useful - and would love to know your tips and tricks too!",

He's turned me onto eating 100 calorie microwave popcorn every night and anabolic french toast (but made into smaller portions). \n2. Fiber is your friend. Eat all the fiber. I've found Ole Extreme Wellness tortillas on Amazon and they're a life saver. Super high in fiber, low in calories (only 50!!!), and they have a good taste and texture. I use them for pizzas, wraps, nachos.\n3. Diet pop and fake sugar is OK. You don't have to eat \"clean\" or perfect. Just get through the day within your calories without it being miserable.",

I admit I have a full arsenal (lol) - vitafiber powder, xylitol, powdered and brown erythritol, various flavour drops, and powdered sucralose - but they last ages and are totally worth it if you're trying keep sugar down and still bake yummy things.   For instance, I like the flavour and health benefit of xylitol but in big amounts it still adds some calories and can upset my stomach; vitafiber isn't calorie free but it helps things be more filling and adds a nice sweetness (and makes an instant cookie with protein powder and water!).  Erythritol is a go-to for lowcal, melts well, with a subtle sweet taste, but on it's own seems lackluster, and powdered sucralose (not Splenda but straight-up sucralose powder) is incredibly strong and not great by itself but works wonders in small amounts with other sweetners.  When I bake pies, protein breads or bars, or brownies, they all use a blend of sweetners rather than just one. Anyway I hope that's useful!",

I‚Äôd lose and slowly regain, often worse than where I started.  The tools and techniques are important, they are the foundation and I‚Äôve found CICO is the best strategy for me with some modifications.  That being said the mental side is mandatory.  I think it‚Äôs sad that this has had a grip on me from 14 to 40 and I hope I can help others not have to go through such a long process.  \n\n\n\n# \n\n# WEIGHT LOSS & FOOD STRATEGY\n\n**Outline**\n\n* General Tips\n* My Personal Daily Food Target\n* Tools\n* Eating Out\n* Proteins\n* Substitutions: Make the Most of your Calories\n\n**General Tips**\n\n1. The first few weeks are the hardest, if you feel discouraged don‚Äôt be!  You‚Äôre already winning!\n2. Figure out WHY you overeat: is it hunger? Boredom? Comfort?  Find a way to replace it with a healthy habit.  I feel better 1 hr after I clean a room or do a project, I don‚Äôt feel better or remember a dessert I ate 1 hr later.  IF you don‚Äôt figure out WHY, you are doomed to long term failure. Sure you can raw dog it with discipline and achieve milestones in the short terms months or a year maybe, but if you don‚Äôt address WHY you will, inevitably, end back up where you started.  \n3. Give yourself TIME to adapt and adjust to a healthy diet with reasonable portions.\n4. Focus on mental toughness and mental health, it‚Äôs 2025 if you need help get it!\n5. Work with a dietician if your insurance covers it or you can afford it, but follow reputable sources like Mayo or Cleveland clinic for health advice if not. \n6. Do something SUSTAINABLE: calculate maintenance calories at your target weight and plan what you would eat each day, eat the same stuff but less to lose weight.  See #2, you don‚Äôt want to end up back where you started-I did that for 28 years.\n7. Non-scale victories are real!  Focus on how you feel mentally, physically, bloodwork, blood pressure, blood sugar, how your clothes fit, energy level and otherwise.   I felt better only 5 days into my new lifestyle.\n8. Avoid fad diets (I won‚Äôt list what I think are fads or transition only, but realize nutrition/dieting has more misinformation online than politics)\n9. Use a TDEE calculator to figure out your maintenance calories and target deficit\n10. Vet calories in apps or online, I‚Äôve found huge errors in Loseit and myfitness pal and other rules of thumb.  USDA FoodData Central and the manufacturer‚Äôs nutrition label are what I trust.  USDA is very useful for things you don‚Äôt have nutrition facts.  Is there error?  Yes, but error goes both ways and overtime it cancels out.\n11. Spend calories wisely like money (don‚Äôt waste them on non-nutritious or non-filling food)\n12. Track calories, even if it‚Äôs a questionable estimate\n13. Use a meal app such as LoseIt to track meals or a google sheet on your phone\n14. Weigh everything you can to the gram, it‚Äôs much more accurate than volume or servings per container, just hit zero as you add things to your plate.  It‚Äôs also a heck of a lot easier than measuring things in cups and scraping them out.  Things like avocado‚Äôs and sweet potatoes there is no other way to be accurate, not 1 large or small fruit etc.  The only thing I measure by volume is salad dressings and condiments at times with a 1 TBSP measuring spoon, but they can be weighed too.  (baking is a different issue-I obviously use volume).  Over time you‚Äôll become skilled at eyeballing food and portions.\n15. Don‚Äôt let a bad meal or day carry on to the next meal or day, it happens and isn‚Äôt a reason to get discouraged or an excuse to binge the rest of the day.  You went over 500-1000 calories?  Guess what that‚Äôs probably a lot less than you would‚Äôve gone over before you started your journey.  It‚Äôs actually a victory.  I went 1500 calories over on my birthday, totally unplanned, but a year prior I would‚Äôve been 4000+!  That is a WIN!\n16. Plan meals ahead for the day\n17. Have a reserve contingency heading into late afternoon/evening\n18. Eating out can be controlled, don‚Äôt view it as you have to give up or will always go over\n19. Eat high protein, high fiber food and get plenty of VARIED greens and fruits.  Variety is important because no one fruit or vegetable has everything you need.\n20. If you have a lot of extra calories available because you skipped a meal, don‚Äôt eat them all at once, spread them out an hour especially if you are still training your body to a reasonable portion\n21. COOK!  You can make better, more filling meals for your money and calories than you can buy!\n22. Healthy foods without a corn subsidy can be more costly, but are cheaper than chronic issues associated with a bad diet\n23. Meal prep so you have options available if you‚Äôre short on time\n24. I usually batch cook a lot of chicken on the grill and freeze it in Ziploc freezer bags and defrost as needed and it‚Äôs the base in most of my meals if I don‚Äôt have time to cook fresh-this leaves me with no excuses to eat healthy\n25. Meal prep and freeze complete meals-I do this with my chicken pasta, chilli, soups, etc.  These reheat very well and are my go to when strained or working 12 hour shifts.\n26. Weigh only once a week, your weight varies too much day to day to track and for many it is discouraging when they see weight from either a delayed bowel movement or a salty meal making the ‚Äúnumbers‚Äù look bad when in reality they are doing well.\n27. Your palate will get better!  If you‚Äôre a foodie like me you‚Äôll become able to taste and appreciate things you couldn‚Äôt before because you were overwhelmed by junk foods and insane amounts of sugar or Guy Fieri entrees that use every spice known to humanity.\n28. Plan a cheat day or reward, but be reasonable and don‚Äôt let a meal turn into a day or week, we hit reset every morning.  If you find this triggers you, then don‚Äôt do it.  \n29. Do what works for YOU, this is just what worked for me and is supported by my goals and dietician.  It‚Äôs got to work for you.  Just because something worked for someone else, doesn‚Äôt mean it will work for you.  We are all individuals with unique stories and sometimes past traumas. \n30. Maintenance is tough, read my last post in CICO about this, but for me obesity is a lifelong disease that I do need to be aware of in my choices\n\n**My Personal Daily Targets**\n\nMost of my days are 30-40% protein, 35-45% carbs and 20-25% fat (note: I eat high fiber foods)\n\n140 grams of protein a day minimum (usually higher)\n\n35 grams of fiber minimum \n\nSaturated Fats <20 grams (or lower)\n\nSodium <3500 mg\n\nMultiple servings of leafy greens\n\nMultiple servings of vegetables\n\nMultiple servings of fruit (varied fruits)\n\nNo white bread, white rice, or processed food\n\nLimited sugar\n\nHealthy Fats\n\nHealthy Oils\n\nAt least one treat a day\n\n**Tools**\n\n1. $10 electronic food scale\n2. 1 TBSP measuring spoon (I recommend a stubby coffee scoop)\n3. Travel stainless/silicone condiment containers (can also be used for nuts or cheese to add to salads, not just dressing or BBQ sauce)\n4. Cooler with ice packs (so you can bring meals when needed)\n\n**Eating Out**\n\nResearch beforehand\n\nDon‚Äôt be afraid to ask for a menu item to be modified or a side changed\n\nLook for chicken, particularly boneless skinless, fish not breaded or fried, salmon, or grilled shrimp\n\nRealize some ‚Äúgrilled‚Äù items sometimes are really cooked in oil on a flat top or skillet\n\nSalads are a good option but you have to watch salad dressing as restaurant dressing can be very calorie heavy, obviously cheese is not low fat or calories, nuts and candied nuts you need to watch.  \n\nAlmost every restaurant, even if they don‚Äôt have a healthy option, I‚Äôve managed to find one.  My panic button is a salad with lean protein.  If there is an adder for chicken or shrimp I have them do that and often I ask to double the adder as usually it‚Äôs not a whole lot of meat.  I bring my own salad dressing that is 5-10 calories a serving in small pocket cups (stainless with silicone lids).  There are squeeze silicone bottles you can use but they are more difficult to clean properly.  \n\n**Proteins**\n\nI eat primarily boneless skinless chicken breast, cod, salmon and shrimp.  Most of my protein is chicken as it's cheap, has a lot of protein for the calories and is low in saturated fat.  I view calories as money and I get a lot more bang for my buck with chicken versus 80/20 ground beef.  For less calories I hit my protein target more easily and have calories to spare on other items I enjoy.  Cod, crab and shrimp are good too, particularly prepared in a non-stick pan with a minimal amount of healthy fat.  I eat salmon once a week for the Omega 3.  If I do eat ground beef I use 93/7 to get more protein for the calories and less saturated fat.  My cholesterol numbers were poor before and now optimal with this strategy.\n\n**Substitutions: Make the Most of your Calories**\n\n**Potatoes**\n\nI love sweet potatoes, they are so good they can be eaten plain, but I sometimes top with cinnamon, splenda brown sugar blend, a sugar free syrup, or cheese.  \n\n**Greek Yogurt**\n\nGreek yogurt is a great food.  It is reasonable in calories and has a lot of protein for the calories and if bought in low fat or nonfat versions has low saturated fat.  I use it as a sub for sour cream, to create dips (fiesta ranch seasoning, ranch seasoning, add sals or hot sauce).  I also use it with fruit to create a nutritious snack or pre or post workout snack that's high in protein.  In that case I add splenda to it and pure vanilla extract.  You can even strain it in the fridge overnight, add artificial sweetener and vanilla and it's almost like an icing or frosting.  \n\n**Sauces**\n\nBBQ sauce for example look at Sweet Baby Ray's the primary ingredient is sugar (HFCS).  If you look at a sauce like Stubb's you'll see the first ingredient is tomato's so it has a lot lower calories and isn't as bad for you.  You can take that a step further and use a sugar free sauce like G Hughe's line of BBQ sauces that are only 10 calories for 2 TBSP's.  There are a lot of low calories hot sauces, but you have to watch sodium content.  \n\n**Salad Dressing**\n\nLook for light or reduced calorie dressings as they are often 45-60 cals per 2 TBSP versus 110+.  You can take it further and utilize a dressing like I use at times called Skinny Girl which is 5 cal for 2 TBSP Balsamic vinaigrette or 10 cal for 2 TBSP for Honey Dijon.  I also like Bolthouse Farms for ranch dressing. Take those calorie savings, add extra protein, fruits, nuts or avocado!  Watch the salad dressings for sodium level-some are insane.\n\n**Cheese**\n\nCheese can be high in calories, sodium and watch the saturated fat.  I use skim mozarella, it's low in calories and has the most protein per calories out of most cheeses.  Alternatively I use a reduced fat mexican cheese which is 10 calories more a serving.  You still need to watch the saturated fat and sodium.  \n\n**Fats**\n\nWith eating boneless skinless chicken breasts I found my fat consumption too low. I add back in heathy fats.  I bake or cook with olive oil or avocado oil.  I also eat nuts or avocado's.  I vary the nuts but primarily use almonds.   I'll have nuts plain or add them to salads.  Avocado's I eat by themselves, as part of a salad or on taco's.\n\n**Cooking Oils/Baking Fats**\n\nI only cook with Olive Oil or Avocado oil to keep fats healthy and avoid unsaturated fats.  I use Avocado oil when I need a high temp oil to avoid smoking.  As a butter substitution when baking I use avocado oil 1:1 where it calls for butter or for lower calorie usage I substitute greek yogurt or a mix of greek yogurt and avocado oil.  Some Keto diets push coconut oil, but the saturated fat is very high.\n\n**Fruits**\n\nFruits are full of all sorts of things so I won't write an article on these.  My big takeaway is that they aren't all equal so I eat a variety to get the full picture.  I love tomatoes, apples, strawberries, raspberries, blue berries, and blackberries.  I add them to salads or soemtimes I add the latter to greek yogurt.  \n\n**Rice**\n\nI avoid white rice and utilize brown rice or a rice subsitution.  Cauliflower rice is popular and a good low calorie filler.  My favorite rice is Right Rice which is 165-170 cal per serving and has 10g of protein and fiber.  I use Right Rice 90% of the time in place of regular rice because I'm getting more for my calories.\n\n**Pasta**\n\nI use pasta from Barilla either their Protein+ line or the red lentil pasta made from chckpeas and/or red lentils.  I like both, but they have higher protein content than regular pasta and the Protein+ tastes like regular pasta.  Like Right Rice I like that I'm getting more for my calories.\n\n**Tortillas**\n\nI love Mexican food.  I use La Banderita Carb Counter tortillas.  They are much lower in calories and add a small amount of protein and fiber.  I make taco's, quesadillas, and even toast them to add to salads.\n\n**Snacks**\n\nKind mini nut bars 90 cal\n\nYasso greek yogurt bars\n\nLowfat Greek Yogurt and Fruit Bowl (Greek yogurt, Splenda, pure vanilla extract, then add raspberries, strawberries, blackberries and blueberries for a high protein snack) you can also use Jello sugar free instant pudding mix \n\nOptimum Nutrition protein powder plus frozen fruit above, add 1% milk if calories allow, but still tastes good with water\n\n**KETO Products**\n\nThey‚Äôre not all equal and some have really high saturated fats if that concerns you as it does me.\n\n**Salads**\n\nI eat a salad once a day.  I aim for 500-550 calories and 40g or greater protein and good vitamins and plenty of fiber.  It makes me feel good and keeps me full.  Early on I skipped some of the higher calorie adders. I sometimes add a fairly plain salad to add volume and fiber to keep me full if I feel my entree isn't filling enough or needs a healthy balance of fruits and veggies.\n\nI eat primarily a romaine blend and or spinach as they are both well regarded versus iceberg.  \n\nFor protein I add chicken, shrimp or salmon.\n\nThe volume helps in feeling full and you need greens.  \n\nI add any of the following:\n\nTomato\n\nRed onion\n\nblack olive\n\nalmonds or other healthy nuts\n\napple\n\npeppers\n\nlow fat cheese\n\ntoasted low carb tortilla strips\n\nshredded carrots\n\ncucumber\n\nraspberries or other berries such as strawberries\n\navocado\n",

    "body": "Hey guys. This past year I have done extensive research on hair care. I have researched hair growth tips, I have bought so many things to assist with my hair, and, I have bought so many shampoos and conditioners. I wanted to share everything I‚Äôve learned, as well as what seems to work best. My hair grows very quickly and it‚Äôs incredibly healthy with these tips. \n\nTip 1: it does not matter how often you wash your hair. Hairstylist, beauty influencers, and hair influencers love to say that you should NOT wash your hair daily. However, you definitely can. I actually wash my hair daily. It significantly depends on your hair type. If you have dry hair, don‚Äôt wash so often. If you have oily hair, feel free to wash daily. Daily hair washing has not affected my hair. \n\nTip 2: Natural shampoo and conditioner, drug store shampoo and conditioner, and salon shampoo and conditioner will most likely not yield different results. Again, this depends on your hair type. However, from my experiments, the quality of the shampoo and conditioner made no difference. All shampoos strip your hair of oil (regardless of if they‚Äôre sulfate free or not) and conditioner essentially re-moisturizes your hair. Salon quality and drug store products usually are similar in terms of ingredients. Salon products tend to have drying ingredients too (like glycols, isopropyl alcohol, and sulfates.) therefore, just use what you find best for your hair!\n\nTip 3: sulfates and silicones are not the devil. These ingredients are in hair care because they have been researched and they are effective. Sulfates will not make your hair fall out. They cleanse and most people do not get irritated from sulfates. Silicones do provide a barrier, and are often that slippery feeling in conditioner. Silicones seal moisture in, so it is hard for moisture to leave and enter your hair. However, silicones are usually beneficial in humid weather.\n\nTHE BEST WAY TO GROW YOUR HAIR IS WITH THE FOLLOWING TIPS:\n\nMy number one tip is to MASSAGE YOUR SCALP DAILY. This is definitely the way to having fast hair growth!\n\nIf your hair gets oily easily, you can use a scalp massager. They are about $5-10 dollars on amazon, and that way, you aren‚Äôt using your oily fingers. \n\nA good way to massage your scalp is through Ayurvedic pressure points. The pressure points are 8 fingers above your eyebrows, 12 fingers above your eyebrows, and 4 above the nape of your neck. \n\nMy SECOND TIP is to oil your scalp once-twice a week! The best oils for growth are Jamaican black castor oil, coconut oil, jojoba oil, Argan oil, avocado oil, olive oil, etc. Just like your face needs skin care, your scalp needs care too. \n\nAyurvedic herbs are also great for hair, like Amla and Brahmi\n\nAdditionally, rosemary is amazing for your hair. \n\nMY THIRD TIP is to follow a capillary schedule. This is Portuguese, and it basically is a weekly schedule of your hairs needs. For example, some days you need hydration, others you need nutrition, and lastly, reconstruction. These were usually masks and provide your hair with what it needs. \n\nLASTLY, never sleep with your hair wet!! Always make sure it is dry first. Put it in a protective style, like a braid, or low bun. Never sleep with it just hanging loose. This is a HUGE contribution to damage and is a VERY important tip.\n\nAnother thing you can do is add coffee to your shampoo. Caffeine improves circulation to your scalp and aids growth. \n\nThese are the tips I‚Äôve learned to be very beneficial. I know this is long, but I really hope this helps some people with their growth journey.",

        "body": "My wife has the most beautiful hair I've ever seen. It's literally her glory. She's a 41F natural brownish blonde. She developed thicker hair with natural curls after having our first and only child. She has taken great care of it and it looks absolutely amazing. I wouldn't be here to comment if i wasn't absolutely serious about how much i love it. I was actually searching for ways to grow thinning hair in men and came across this thread. I've paid close attention to how she manages it in an effort to restore my hairline to a better place. Here's what I've noticed she does.\n\nShe washes her hair with a specific kind of shampoo and conditioner. It's the purple not your mother's blonde moment shampoo. And the conditioner is an extremely thick lotion like substance called Shea moisture curl & shine conditioner. Purple shampoos work wonders for blonde hair.\n\nShe washes it about every other day, but showers every day.\n\nShe never fully dries her hair with the hair dryer and uses a low heat approach. \n\nShe occasionally straitens her hair but i keep encouraging her to keep her light natural curls because they are so pretty. I think any heat is destructive personally.\n\nSo the technique she uses is she washes her hair first thing in the shower. Rinse well. Then she immediately puts the conditioner in liberally, lots of it. She lets the conditioner soak into her hair while she washes and shaves and takes her time cleaning herself. At the end of the shower she rinses the conditioner out but makes sure to leave a little bit in the hair, not fully rinsing it all out. She then continues to rinse her body because it's like a lotion. This also moisturizes her skin. She typically waits about 20 to 30 minutes before blow drying her hair to about half dry, never fully dry. She lets the rest then dry on its own. \n\nI felt the need to share this information because i love sharing knowledge and somebody might benefit from it. This routine has taken her hair to a much higher level than it ever was before. \n\nAnother additive I've found very nice and useful is Argan Oil of Morroco. That stuff is silky smooth and amazing. I love it, she loves it. It adds the most beautiful shine and it doesn't feel heavy.",

I keep my hair in a bun with a silk scrunchie when i sleep. I do want to buy a silken sleep hat since like that i can avoid any even more friction.\n\n2. I wash my fine, wavy hair with Redken shampoo and conditioner (it the pink bottle). I then apply a leave-in conditioner on my wet hair. I will use olaplex tip oil when it is dry. I simple work a very small amount into my hair in the morning and if the ends look dry also in the evening. \n\n3. I don‚Äôt use a lot of heat styling but when i do i use my heat brush. I always use redken blowout cream for heat protection! I usually wait for my hair to be almost dry and then style it just at the end. I get a nice finish and don‚Äôt over heat my hair.\n\n4. I try to avoid using hair ties as much as possible. I do a lot of sport so i do either have a big hair clip that keeps my hair together or again my silken scrunchie. \n\n5. I go to the hair dresser twice a year and get my ends trimmed with what is a called a calligraphy cut. Basically it is supposed to promote healthy ends for people whose fine hair is prone to breaking.\n\nI think that should be it. I will definitely try the scalp massage, it makes a lot of sense to me! I yielded very good results. Again my hair type is fine and weavy :)\n\nHope that helps!",

        "body": "After the birth of my first child at 25 when my hair was very long, healthy and I actually did ‚Äúhair modeling‚Äù, my hair fell out from the root and began breaking off all over my head.  I was devastated.  It took me 10 years to get my hair to return growing well and looking good again.  \n\nBut here I am, 65 years old now and have had thick long hair for a long, long time now.  \n\nCurrently my hair is right at the top of my ‚Äòcrack‚Äô!  Myself and my husband love it.  I have been diligent about not causing breakage to my hair over the years. I have shard my tips for about 30 yrs. and thought I would do so again here.  All of these tips are true actual things I do to my hair and I also assist several other women in growing their hair too because it can be time consuming and difficult.  It takes a team.  My granddaughter‚Äôs friends think I‚Äôm the bomb because my hair is still thick and very healthy!  So I also teach them along the way.  But I work at it daily. Again, this is what works for me. I hope it helps you too. \n\nHere are my tips/tricks:\n\n1.  A SILK pillow case is a must.  \n\n2.  Lightly pin your hair up on top of your head at night while you sleep.  Not too tight.  A loose bun, up high.  Keep your hair in a loose bun as often as you possibly can, day and night.  Always in wind.  I do so at least 3 days a week and EVERY NIGHT. Stay out of the ocean and swimming pools. \n\n3.  Only wash your hair when it is really dirty.  If you wash daily you are stimulating the oil glands making your hair get dirtier quicker.  It will take awhile to get used to this.  Trust me, this is true. Your scalp will adjust in time. Swear. \n\n4.  Only Sulfate free shampoo and very gentle coloring.  I use Shea Moisture Shampoo and Conditioner and L‚ÄôOr√©al Sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.  I love the L‚ÄôOr√©al brand, I always leave a bit of conditioner in my hair from my shoulders to the ends.  Just a bit.   AND never rough your scalp up with your towel, BE GENTLE, SUPER GENTLE. (READ BELOW ABOUT THE COMBING OUT PROCESS) \n\n5.  Do not cut your hair monthly or even every other month.  Let it grow.  Figure out styles that work during the grow out and goofy looking time. \n\n5. Tell your stylist how much to take off your hair; do not let her dictate how much to take off.  They will ALWAYS cut too much without precise direction.  \n\nI usually only have my hair colored, I am totally grey, but I like to keep it colored. I color every 3 months and cut only 1.5 x per year usually 2-3‚Äù every 9-10 months.  That‚Äôs just what works for me.   \n\n*******BE SURE YOUR STYLIST COMBS YOUR HAIR OUT GENTLY WITH A PICK COMB.  Have her apply a detangler.  They don‚Äôt want to, they want to complete the comb out quickly. I used to take my own pick comb and tell her I preferred to comb it out myself.  And I did, and I do.  They will come to respect you for your dedication to the care of your hair. Believe me on this.  I now have an awesome stylist who supports all my efforts, but it took over a year to help her understand how serious I am about hair care. \n\n6.  After shampooing, *****GENTLY comb out your hair with a large pic.  If needed use a detaingling ‚Äúhand applied hair oil‚Äù.  Rub 3-5 drops between your hands, heat it up by vigorous rubbing of your hands, and apply from the ends up.  Then begin combing, ****ALWAYS start from the bottom with a 2‚Äù section.  ***Go slow; never rip through your hair.  ****When you stretch your hair, you damage your hair. \n\n7.  At the beginning of trying to get your hair healthy and to help begin the growing process do this: YES, ITS GROSS!! \n\nMix a brand name mayonnaise, a generous amount, and 3 egg yolks (pure protein) in a bowl, whip it with a fork.  Put a towel around your shoulders and apply it generously to your hair.   I lean over the kitchen sink when I do this.  Apply Very generously. \n\nPin it up on top of your head and leave it on for as long as possible.  Stay in a cool environment and be sure it doesn‚Äôt get all over your face.  I OFTEN, let it stiffen up and sleep on it for a night.  Yep, sleep on it.  Put a towel on your pillow.  I have been doing this 30+ years.   My husband loves long hair and he supports everything I have to do to keep it looking good to GREAT!! \n\nI even have had girlfriends over for Mimosas and done this together.  They do go home to wash out.  But we sit together 3-4 hours and talk while moisturizing.  THIS WILL REVOLUTIONIZE THE CONDITION OF YOUR HAIR.  But it takes several ( like 4-8 applications).  I always do this even when my hair looks great!  \n\nStart at once a week for a month, then once a month for 6 months, then every 3-4 months.  \n\nWash it out with a sulfate free shampoo and use conditioner after.  It may take more than 1 washing to get it all out.  Wash, let air dry, wash again AND condition again and let air dry.  \n\nIf you do this on a Friday night, you will have it all out by Sunday night. IT IS PURE PROTEIN!  Best thing for your hair. No need for expensive products. \n\n8.  I rarely blow dry, I do blow brush sometimes.  I prefer to let my hair air dry half way, then pin it up in a loose bun for a very airy beachy wave that looks natural.  I still use the old pink rollers on the bottom 6-8‚Äù if I want a big curl, and also sometimes use Velcro rollers. \n\nPINK ROLLER TIP:  \n\nUse the largest pink roller.  Remove the foam part and then put a medium size foam roller in its place on the LARGE plastic rolling part.  This will give you more room fr your hair on the curler.   I often sleep in these curlers at the height of about 1‚Äù below my shoulders.  I don‚Äôt even know they are there these days.  Silk pillow case of course! \n\nI have loads of other tips. If you have any questions, please just ask.  üíïüôèüèªüíï",

        "body": "Girl. GIRL! I'm lying here in bed and my eyes are leaking. I think the universe sent me to your post at exactly the right time. \n\nI have bipolar depression,  and have been through a sea of meds out there with no success. Finally,  4 years ago,  they put me on depakote. The wild mood swings are controlled now. So I really need this med. But it has caused devastating hair loss. \n\nI'm 53. All my life i have had really thick hair. Like,  can't get the pony holder to go around it twice,  thick. I did notice it thinning as i aged,  but didn't really pay attention because it was still good. Then this med. It became fragile and broken,  falling out and not growing back. It looked a mess,  so i thought,  maybe if i just shave it all off it will look better growing back. I kept it shaved for over a year. I have many chronic illnesses and not having to deal with hair was a relief. But i was missing it,  and started growing it back. I was shocked. I can see my scalp. Like,  all over. It's about shoulder length now. \n\nI have tried to be so careful with it. No heat styling, no chemical processes (pretty much 100% gray), and trying different hair masks. It just keeps falling out. My psychiatrist recommended a hair/ skin/ nails supplement, along with folic acid. Did not work. To the point of being ready to stop the med. But I'm going to try some of the things that worked for you. Can't hurt!  You have inspired me and given me new hope. \n\nI thank you so much for sharing your experience. I will come back in a few months with a report. I've already ordered some of the stuff. And congrats,  your hair is gorgeous!",

I am so afraid for him.\n\nTwo weeks ago I was holding him as he sobbed on the bathroom floor, and he told me he's giving this one more year. That he doesn't want to feel like this anymore. \n\nI'm watching him waste away. He says every day that he feels like a 90 year old man. Getting off the couch is tough for him most days. If he can find a bout of energy for a very small home workout, he's trashed for days after. He no longer does any of the things he used to love like hiking, biking, or working out at the gym. He can't walk the dogs, and can barely check the mail. He's surviving currently on turkey, fruit, and vegetables with basically no fat, because he feels sick if he eats anything else.  I am positively convinced he is dying, but I could never tell him that, because  my hope is the only thing keeping him going. I keep telling him he's going to be okay, that we will figure it out, but I just don't know anymore.\n\n  \n**We need help. I need your help. Please help us.**  \n\n\n**I am willing to listen to anything anyone has to say, answer any and all questions we can, get further testing, or see further specialists.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband began to feel ill just over 5 years ago. Since then his health has been in steady decline. \n\nPatient: \n\n40 year old male  \n5'11  \nCaucasian  \nPreviously a powerlifter  \nTook a regular low dose (his words) of anabolic steroids for approximately 10 years, quitting cold turkey in 2015.   \nPreviously ate a TERRIBLE diet (carbo loading as part of workout regimen), but stopped that in 2015, and was also vegan for about a year in 2019. Currently eats very healthy- daily fruits/veggies, NO fast food, fried food, and little to no processed food. (what is processed is basically just grain free crackers)  \nAppendectomy in 2015, first bout of pancreatitis the very next week.  \nChildhood asthma which was resolved until 2017  \nAllergy to Penicillin and amoxicillin (as told by his mother)  \nOne previous blood clot in leg (prior to 2013, but do not know the date or specifics)  \nRecovering alcoholic who has not had alcohol since he was 21. (I am 100% positive he has had none since we met, but happy to explain further)  \nWeight in 2015 was around 215 lbs, weight at beginning of decline in health was around 185, current weight around 155 lbs.  \nUp to, and into 2017 he was working out (lifting-heavy) approximately 10 hours per week, now only an occasional light dumbbell workout at home.  \nHistory of finicky sleep, but nothing like it is now  \nSome history of bowel issues, which seem to occur and resolve repeatedly over years, and may not be related to a health problem.  \n\\[May or may not be related, but years ago he did develop a large white patch on his head seen here [https://imgur.com/a/jQInUur](https://imgur.com/a/jQInUur) although it does not seem to have changed since then, nor have others appeared\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nCurrently taking:\n\nOccasional modafinil to help with brain fog for work, but he does not take a full dose, nor take it regularly.  \nCoffee enemas daily (only thing that seems to help at all)\n\nIn the past he has taken a great many supplements and medications to try to find a cure for this illness. Those include Alpha blockers, trazadone, clonazepam, RLS medication (Can't recall the name) saw palmetto, bacopa, gotu kola, st. john's wart, valerian, melatonin, benadryl, probiotics, prebiotics, iodine, colloidal silver, vitamins (you name it he's probably tried it), passionflower, lemon balm, catnip, and chamomile. Certainly there are more.\n\nHe has tried dietary changes many times over the years also. He's been vegan, vegetarian, low fodmap, low amylose, paleo, and lectin free. He's done exclusionary diets many times, and we have not been able to pinpoint a cause that is specifically food related. (He does not do well with Cauliflower, Eggplant or avocado oil, though.)  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\[\\[Illness begins around June 2017, these earlier results are included for informational purposes\\]\\]**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EARLIER RESULTS:**\n\n**10/10/2013**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Rh9B45Y](https://imgur.com/a/Rh9B45Y)\n\nDUAP CBC W/DIFF¬†\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/a35Xbop](https://imgur.com/a/a35Xbop)\n\nComprehensive metabolic panel\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/ONDQC3v](https://imgur.com/a/ONDQC3v)\n\nLipid Panel Direct Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) Cholesterol\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**03/31/2014**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/FNrTXBc](https://imgur.com/a/FNrTXBc)\n\nH Pylori C Breath Test\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2/10/2015**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/H92mubo](https://imgur.com/a/H92mubo)\n\nLipase\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/rBPvGkA](https://imgur.com/a/rBPvGkA)\n\nComprehensive Metabolic Panel\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6/05/2015**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/c1jYiar](https://imgur.com/a/c1jYiar)\n\nCreatinine\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/tYHnKVl](https://imgur.com/a/tYHnKVl)\n\nIGG SUBCLASSES, SERUM\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Hx7CY1X](https://imgur.com/a/Hx7CY1X)\n\nLipase\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/AidL36e](https://imgur.com/a/AidL36e)\n\nAmylase\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RH0gmCx](https://imgur.com/a/RH0gmCx)\n\nLipid panel\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6/15/2015**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/nzArUox](https://imgur.com/a/nzArUox)\n\nAbdominal MRI\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\[\\[ BEGINS TO EXPERIENCE MOST SYMPTOMS FROM THIS DATE\\]\\]**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn early 2017 my husband and I moved from New England, to New Mexico. \n\nThe day before we moved, he found four embedded ticks on his thighs. We do not know how long they had been attached. (He was later tested for tickborne diseases, twice. Both were negative) \n\nIn NM, we rented a home and beginning a few months after we moved in, he began to notice some strange symptoms, but nothing too alarming. \n\nHis first biggest symptom was lack of sleep. He would wake up after a few hours, and not be able to get back to sleep. If he did manage, he'd still wake feeling very unrested in the morning. He felt very fatigued, and we attributed this to lack of sleep. \n\nHis doctor ran tests but said he found no reason for his fatigue and sleeplessness, and referred him for a sleep study.   \nHe did diagnose him with an enlarged prostate, and some sort of bacterial infection of either the bladder or prostate (We cannot recall which) and put him on a long dose of CIPRO. He was taking that for quite a while (perhaps a month) when he began to notice his ankles hurting. At that time, the doctor took him off of CIPRO. I believe he replaced it with another antibiotic, and in total he was on an antibiotic for probably 3 months (as best we can recall).  \nThis same doctor's office also tried Alpha blockers (to stop nightmares?), clonazepam, trazadone, and a medication for restless leg syndrome.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the sleep study, he was incorrectly diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea. He used a CPAP nightly for close to a year before another sleep study  revealed the first diagnosis was incorrect, and he had no apnea (central, nor obstructive- we were at higher altitude)\n\nHe also saw a cardiologist during this time, due to him having heart palpitations.  They fitted him with a holter monitor. Due to an error in the office (we lived remotely and it was an issue with the cell carrier the monitors used) only about an hour of data was collected. They did say that the data showed no cause for concern, though.\n\nHe visited an ENT (thinking breathing problems may be causing sleep disturbances) and they ran a scope way up in his face. They told him he had roughly 90% blockage due to deviated septum. \n\nHe had surgery to repair this, but it did not improve his symptoms.  \nThe end also ran a test for skin allergies, showing he was highly reactive to dust mites, but not much else from their test panel.\n\nDuring this time my husband also militantly tried sleep hygiene (about 3 months) but it did not help.  \nHe also tried cutting screen time 3 hours before bed, as well as a cutoff for eating and drinking.\n\n**06/19/2017**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/TZUSt5M](https://imgur.com/a/TZUSt5M)\n\nLipid Panel+\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Oc06Nz6](https://imgur.com/a/Oc06Nz6)\n\nCBC w/ Diff/Platelets+\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Bgx2w7C](https://imgur.com/a/Bgx2w7C)\n\nComprehensive Metabolic Panel+\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/B9NOcjy](https://imgur.com/a/B9NOcjy)\n\nBorrelia burgdorferi Ab (Lyme), Total by ELISA, Reflex to IgG & IgM by Western blot (Acute)+\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Zzqatjc](https://imgur.com/a/Zzqatjc)\n\nPSA, Serum+\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/EicHkwR](https://imgur.com/a/EicHkwR)\n\nUA Dip w/o micro +\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/sLkxZyT](https://imgur.com/a/sLkxZyT)\n\nUrine culture\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**11/26/2018**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/0LV9Ix2](https://imgur.com/a/0LV9Ix2)\n\nCBC w/ Diff/Platelets+\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/H2BAj2G](https://imgur.com/a/H2BAj2G)\n\nComprehensive Metabolic Panel+\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/wDTeJnN](https://imgur.com/a/wDTeJnN)\n\nFerritin+\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/qce4FNr](https://imgur.com/a/qce4FNr)\n\nBorrelia burgdorferi Ab (Lyme), IgG and/or IgM by ELISA with Reflex to IgG by Western Blot (Late Disease)+\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/xDRSbwc](https://imgur.com/a/xDRSbwc)\n\nRheumatoid Factor+\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/I8u21vC](https://imgur.com/a/I8u21vC)\n\nTSH W/ FREE T4+\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**12/03/2018**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/1GGjeHf](https://imgur.com/a/1GGjeHf)\n\nHIV ABS W/ CONF SCREEN\\*\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/9Qs6W9M](https://imgur.com/a/9Qs6W9M)\n\nBABESIA MICROTI ANTIBODY PANEL\\*\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/cNykvMu](https://imgur.com/a/cNykvMu)\n\nEHRLICHIA DETECTION PCR\\*\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/QTUtNX7](https://imgur.com/a/QTUtNX7)\n\nESR (SED RATE) Westergren\\*\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/16WYTHi](https://imgur.com/a/16WYTHi)\n\nVITAMIN B12\\*\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/XEHn0WG](https://imgur.com/a/XEHn0WG)\n\nFEBRILE Ab PROFILE\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**05/29/2019**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/26nbBOy](https://imgur.com/a/26nbBOy)\n\nVITAMIN B12 AND FOLATE\\*\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/vforvFx](https://imgur.com/a/vforvFx)\n\nTSH W/ FREE T4\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy 2020, his symptoms were documented as follows:\n\nInsomnia  \nFatigue (extreme)  \nBody aches  \nWeakness  \nHeadaches, with sensitivity to light  \nMemory impairment  \nDifficulty concentrating/ brain fog  \nStiffness and joint pain  \nShortness of breath  \nHeart palpitations  \nDifficulty regulating body temperature  \nBlurred vision  \nNight sweats  \nMood swings  \nAbdominal pain  \nVertigo  \nRecurrance of childhood asthma\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe discovered that mold illness can cause most of these symptoms, and so found a doctor who specializes in mold and follows the Shoemaker protocol. He ran many tests, including a genetic test. He said roughly 25% of the population has a genetic problem that makes it so their bodies cannot rid themselves of mycotoxins, and that my husband was part of that group. (lab attached)\n\nHe prescribed clay binders, and moving. We did both.\n\nWe took a precious few belongings with us when we left, and then only hard items that could easily be cleaned. All soft goods like clothing, and pillows, etc were discarded.\n\n  \nAfter moving, most of the acute symptoms died down dramatically, leading us to believe this was the cause of his problems, and he would slowly improve over time, like his mold doctor said. \n\nHe stopped experiencing the headaches and light sensitivity almost immediately, along with the stiffness and joint pain, blurred vision, night sweats, and the worst of the mood swings. He also stopped needing to use his inhaler daily.  However, now 3 years later, he has not improved further, and has developed other symptoms, and some existing ones are worsening.\n\n \n\n**2/25/2020**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/ddvd6K4](https://imgur.com/a/ddvd6K4) genetic\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2/25/2020**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/scqt0o3](https://imgur.com/a/scqt0o3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3/04/2020**\n\nEnvirobiomics mold test in our rental home\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/nYRallL](https://imgur.com/a/nYRallL)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**11/16/2020**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/2P2cGym](https://imgur.com/a/2P2cGym)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the beginning of 2021 we moved again, out of state. He visited another cardiologist, who did an EKG (although most of the leads were not touching his skin due to body hair they did not shave) for his heart palpitations, and said he was fine. They too fitted him for a holter for 24 hours. It took roughly 4 months to get the results, but they said there were no concerning findings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn 2022, his pancreatitis has flared up multiple times, and he has seen a few more doctors, including a GI. The GI has done many blood tests, and also did an endoscopic ultrasound. The findings were that there was minor flattening of the duodenum, but the doctor said (over the phone) that he saw no evidence of celiac disease, pancreatic, or stomach cancer or ulcers.   \nThe pancreatitis is now chronic, and most foods (unless they pretty much have zero fat, and still even then sometimes) cause him abdominal discomfort. He has pain in his stomach area, and into his back. This is often accompanied by abdominal bloating, belching, and passing gas. There are times when eating or drinking causes these symptoms, and other times where eating or drinking relieves them. It makes no sense.  \n\n\nHe also had an infected dental crown removed in early 2022, and was placed on antibiotics. He developed C-Diff, and was treated. The GI did a test to confirm it was gone, and told us that he needs to be taking a certain brand of both probiotics and fiber (benefiber, specifically), although he was already taking another brand of both.\n\n**4/19/2022**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/NA0BtUx](https://imgur.com/a/NA0BtUx)\n\nIron, TIBC, and Ferritin panel\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5/25/2022**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/poHFM9h](https://imgur.com/a/poHFM9h)\n\nComprehensive Metabolic Panel\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe began to wonder about his previously infected dental crown. The dentist had removed that, and the tooth, and put in a bone graft. We started researching more on that, and found it plausible that he had other infection in his mouth which could be causing problems, perhaps having spread from the initial crown. We found a dentist who specializes in that type of thing. He had the bone graft removed, as well as another crown removed (which was also apparently infected) and they cleaned out (I think) two wisdom teeth cavitations. They sent in samples for testing. \n\nIt's worth noting that he did not have this work done on the opposite side of his mouth, so if there is infection there somewhere we do not know.\n\n**Dental**\n\n**6/23/2022**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/xITsXzh](https://imgur.com/a/xITsXzh)\n\nDental DNA \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5/24/2022**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/AD3QUYA](https://imgur.com/a/AD3QUYA)\n\nDental vitamin D \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**07/28/2022**  \n(GI doc again)\n\n[https://imgur.com/yiCOhMn](https://imgur.com/yiCOhMn)\n\nComprehensive Metabolic Panel\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe recently discovered we are able to order some tests ourselves through a third party, and have them processed at Labcorp or Quest. We tested for Lead poisoning, and toxoplasmosis. Lead because we do use cast iron, and occasionally antique ones, and they can have an unknown history in smelting. Toxoplasmosis because we got our first cat right around the time this all started in 2017. \n\nI messed up though: I saw it said to discontinue Biotin 72 hours prior to this test. He did not take anything called Biotin, and we thought nothing of it. However today, after getting these last results, I looked more into it. Turns out his B complex vitamins he's taking do have a high dose of Biotin (and apparently makes his urine bright yellow). Also, he began coffee enemas two days before these labs were drawn.  \n I understand that this may skew some results, but I'm including these anyway, just in case. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**12/28/2022**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/JZLoMrD](https://imgur.com/a/JZLoMrD)\n\nLead  \nToxoplasmosis  \nHormone profile  \nACTH\n\n  \n \n\nFor the last year and a half we have been living in a brand new home (in yet another state), where we are the first occupants. We now believe that he is sensitive to mold, and it may have triggered something else, or allowed some other illness to take hold/run rampant. When he enters a place now that (probably) has mold, he begins to feel what he calls \"mold sweats\". IE acute symptoms immediately. Those symptoms resolve within a day of exiting the building.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHis daily symptoms now:\n\nExtreme fatigue and lethargy  \nOccasional heart palpitations  \nInsomnia  \nMalaise  \nTinnitus (developed early 2022)  \nChronic pancreatitis (or more accurately, stomach pain we associate with pancreatitis due to his previously diagnosis)\n\n  \nI tried to cover everything here, but I know I will have missed some things. I've pared it down as much as I can, but I am glad to provide any and all information I can get my hands on, if it will help in any way.\n\nI know this has been a really long post, and if you're here at all, even if you scrolled straight to the bottom, I appreciate you. I am looking for ideas, direction, even just your curiosity. We have nothing else to lose at this point. I need to find a way to save his life. He's my whole world, my best friend, and I can't make it without him. I hope someone here has some ideas where we should go next, because I don't know what else to do but post on reddit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all very much",

    "body": "This happened a couple weeks ago and I‚Äôm still annoyed with myself so I figured I would share my shame.\n\nI have a few food allergies that I have to be mindful of, especially my allergy to avocado. 2023 I ended up in the hospital after accidentally eating some in a burrito (apparently the worker didn‚Äôt realize guacamole is made of avocado?) and now I carry an epi pen. Every time I look at new products I ALWAYS check the ingredients to make sure avocado oil isn‚Äôt used. It‚Äôs annoying since so many beauty products like lotions, conditioners, etc. \n\nA few weeks ago I was feeling a little under the weather. My nose was super stuffed up and as a result I was mouth breathing like crazy and my mouth and lips felt dry. On my way to work I stopped at CVS and grabbed a big bottle of water to stay hydrated and as I was checking out, I saw a Burt‚Äôs Bees lip balm two-pack. I‚Äôve used this brand before no problem, so I just grabbed it and added it to my transaction without a second thought.\n\nFor an entire week I was using this lip balm and when I put it on it felt great. Tingly, which was weird, but very moisturizing. But I also started getting hives on the lower part of my face and neck, and my skin was breaking out, and my lips were peeling and irritated despite the fact I was putting on this lip balm multiple times a day! Not to mention I was suddenly having issues with my asthma and ended up needing a nebulizer treatment.\n\nOne day when I was about to put the lip balm on I noticed in teeny tiny letters something about 100% natural oils with an asterisk. That‚Äôs when I realized the label had to be peeled off to see ALL the ingredients. And then I saw it: avocado oil. This amazingly luscious lip balm was trying to kill me. I immediately threw it away and checked the other lip balm from the pack, which was the classic formula and safe.\n\nWithin 2 days my skin cleared up and my breathing issues went away. Turns out if you don‚Äôt smear something you‚Äôre incredibly allergic to on your face it avoids a lot of problems. Now my husband reminds me constantly to check ingredients so I don‚Äôt die. \n\nTL;DR: didn‚Äôt check the ingredients on a lip balm and microdosed myself with my most severe allergen for a week",

I make a paste. Whatever the recipe calls for, I'll add five more cloves. \n\nBut what also happened is that I was always congested. Sore throat. Coughing. GI issues. I was diagnosed with pancreatitis a few years ago, so I blamed the GI issues on my diet. I love spicy foods and I drink more than I should (but that's for another thread). My GI issues coincided with my days off, where I would usually cook for my boyfriend and sometimes friends. I make an amazing Cesar salad dressing with a ton of garlic. Plus I'll throw garlic in basically everything. \n\nAnyway, so after being in a constant state of \"cold but it's not COVID\", I looked up food allergies and their side effects. Lol and behold, alliums popped up. I immediately cut garlic out of my diet and a week later, my congestion had cleared up. No more coughing. No more GI issues. \n\nI think right now its only garlic. Onion seems to be fine. I haven't cooked leeks in a while so I don't know how I'll react to them. \n\nAnyway, that's my allergy story. I miss garlic.",

Absolute room temperature. \n\nThen, run some hot soapy water in here and let it soak for 10-20 minutes to loosen up the crud. Relax, soaking for a short while won‚Äôt cause it to dissolve into a pile of rust!  \n\nNext, scrape out what you can with a dish brush or metal spatula or whatever, and scrub with more hot soapy water and a chain mail scrubber. You want to get the fried rice crud off, and you also want to scrub down any crud that might be in there from before. \n\nThink you‚Äôre done scrubbing? Give it a good rinse and then run a soapy dish sponge around in there. Does it come out clean?  Or are there flakes of black stuff/an oily brown residue still?  If there‚Äôs still crud, scrub it down some more. You might scrape all the crud off an area and ding up with seasoning a bit, *but that‚Äôs ok!*\n\nAll clean?  Good. Rinse like you‚Äôre going to be eating out of it, towel dry, and set it on a burner on low until all the visible water evaporates. \n\nOnce the water is gone, wipe on a thin layer of your veggie oil of choice, then wipe it back with a fresh paper towel. Pick off any bits of paper lint that stick on, then crank the heat up to medium and put the pan back on. \n\nWait until that oil looks like it‚Äôs dried (no need to let it smoke, we‚Äôre not barbarians here!), then add another layer of oil and turn the burner off. Let it cool on the stove before you put it away. \n\n\nNext time you make fried rice, use, and this is an exact quantity so measure very carefully, an *entire shitload of oil.* At least three times what you used for these pictures. Each individual grain of rice should be a little bit shiny, and there should be a little puddle of extra oil for the egg to go into. I like to preheat the pan dry, then add cold oil, then add ingredients, but you do you as long as the oil doesn‚Äôt smoke. Smoking oil tastes like butt and carcinogens. Nobody needs that.\n\nAfter your well-lubricated fried rice experience, you should have minimal stuff stuck to the pan and cleanup should be a quick scrub and set on low heat to dry. If you still have a lot of stuck-on crud, repeat as above and increase the amount of oil by at least *one metric butt ton*. That‚Äôs 2.7 Imperial butt tons, so make sure you‚Äôre converting correctly if you only have Freedom Cups at hand. \n\n\nThat‚Äôs how I would handle it, anyway. Bottom line, use more oil, slightly more nuanced is all the rest of this. \n\n\nGood luck!",

    "body": "I hate going to the doctor.  I was basically forced to recently though, and was ready to put up a massive brawl if he tried to get me to change my diet which has been working well so far.\n\nBut - it turns out that he thought Keto was great!  He is a Paleo Dieter himself, and fully understood what I was trying to accomplish.  He even gave me a handout with a load of details as to why Keto and Paleo diets work with recommendations on what to do, and I got permission to post it here.  It is an OCR of his document, so please ignore any misspellings as I tried to catch them all.\n\n**Written By**\n\n**Dr. Daniel Egan M.D.**\n\n**[Website](http://alpinefamilymedicine.com/danbio.html)**\n\n\n\n**Optimal Metabolism**\n\nIf you have trouble maintaining a healthy weight, it‚Äôs very likely that you have a problem with how fat cells communicate with your brain Contrary to conventional wisdom, obesity is caused by inÔ¨Çammation and hormone mismatches, not by a lack of will-power, lack of exercise, or even calorie intake. Here‚Äôs how it really works:\n\nFat cells secrete a hormone called leptin. Leptin travels from fat cells and tells a part of the brain. the hypothalamus, how much fat you have. Under optimal circumstances, the hypothalamus is very responsive to leptin. When this is the case, the hypothalamus matches appetite and energy expenditure, resulting in easy weight control. Likely you know someone like this. They seem to eat as much as they want, but they always stay lean and Ô¨Åt. This person is leptin sensitive. They have a fat thermostat that works.\n\nOn the other hand, in an obese person, the receptors for leptin are damaged, thus making the hypothalamus blind to leptin. Even though such a person might have a hundred pounds Of fat stored on their belly, energy to spare so to speak, the hypothalamus perceives that the body is actually starving. This hormonal ‚Äúmismatch‚Äù drives excessive appetite, cravings, persistent fat storage, low sex hormone production, low thyroid secretion, muscle wasting, weight gain, Type 2 diabetes, and fatigue. Such a person is leptin resistant. Their fat thermostat is broken and all the hormones that govern metabolism are deranged. If your hormones are wrong, you can eat like a bird and still gain weight.\n\nSo this begs the question, what causes the body to become leptin resistant? Well, there are many reasons, but here are a few of the big ones:\n\n**THINGS ASSOCIATED WITH LEPTIN RECEPTOR DAMAGE:**\n\n* inflammation\n* high insulin levels\n* poor sleep and/or night shift work\n* low Vitamin D\n* low Omega-3 to Omega-6 ratio of fatty acids\n* high blood sugar\n* high triglycerides\n* elevated LDLp form of cholesterol\n* infections (viral, bacterial, Ô¨Åmgal)\n* high fructose corn syrup\n* lectins and gluten from cereal grains\n* an injury or severe illness\n* high body fat percentage\n* low exercise or sedentary job\n* childbirth and/or multiple pregnancies\n* too much stress: physical, emotional, or mental\n* MSG, aspartame, NutraSweet, BPA, phenylalanine (common in processed foods)\n\nThe next question you might be asking yourself is whether it is possible to Ô¨Åx the leptin receptors? Yes, it is, but it requires speciÔ¨Åc actions.\n\n**HOW DO YOU HEAL THE LEPTIN RECEPTOR?**\n\nThe most important leptin receptors are in the hypothalamus. This is an ancient part of the brain that controls hormones and circadian rhythms. It‚Äôs a part of the brain that requires sleep, low stress, low inÔ¨Çammation, proper nutrition, and in some cases, cold exposure to work well. Living your life in a way that maximizes hypothalamic function will Ô¨Åx the ‚Äúbiological mismatches‚Äù that have fouled up your hormones and metabolism. **Achieving optimal health is all about correcting these mismatches and living as nature intended.**\n\nResetting your fat thermostat requires **5 LIFESTYLE CHANGES.**\n\n**1.  DEFEAT STRESS: Stress raises cortisol and turns sex hormone production off. It also makes your cells more resistant to insulin. High cortisol and high insulin keep your cells in ‚Äúfat-storage‚Äù not ‚Äúfat-burning‚Äù mode.**\n\n* Decide in your mind that you will be in charge of your health and your life.\n* Resolve any high stress conflicts.\n* Don‚Äôt procrastinate.\n* Simplify your life.\n* Take 10 slow, deep breathes every hour. This shuts off the sympathetic (panic) nervous system.\n* Plan out your meals in advance, so you‚Äôre not stressing or scrambling, and eating poor quality food.\n* Exercises like yoga, calm walks with a loved-one, and being outdoors help, too.\n\n**2.  EAT FOR YOUR GENES: The USDA food pyramid is not helping the nation‚Äôs obesity problem. The Standard American Diet is a complete failure. Our bodies crave nutrient dense food that satisÔ¨Åes our physiologic needs 100%, not processed junk and gruel.**\n\n* Eat a ‚Äúwhole food‚Äù or ‚ÄúPaleo‚Äù style diet. More on diet is explained below.\n* Don‚Äôt eat any processed, canned, or packaged foods.\n* Don‚Äôt eat anything with artificial sweeteners. Stevia might be the only exception.\n* Eat a **BIG** breakfast with 30-50 grams of protein within an hour of waking up. Eat until you‚Äôre quite full. Don‚Äôt use protein powder (whey) for this. It causes an insulin and sugar spike.\n* Eat 3 meals a day. Avoid snacking. Breakfast is big, lunch a bit smaller, dinner a bit smaller. If you eat a small, low-carb dinner, your liver will burm fat all night long. Eventually you might only need 2 meals a day.\n* Eating frequently, especially loads of carbohydrate, keeps insulin ‚Äúon‚Äù. This means you‚Äôll store fat instead of burning it.\n* Limit your carbohydrates to around 50-150 grams a day. Eat fewer carbs in the winter, more in the summer.\n* Eat dinner 4-5 hours prior to bedtime.\n\n**3.  HACK YOUR SLEEP: Leptin enters the hypothalamus only in the deep stages of sleep. Your brain won‚Äôt know how to burn fat without it. We also repair our bodies (autophagy) during sleep. When we don‚Äôt repair damage, we a more likely to get cancer. ArtiÔ¨Åcial light, especially after sunset, turns up cortisol (stress hormone that causes fat storage) and turns off sex hormone production.**\n\n* Expose your eyes to natural sunlight every day, especially in the morning.\n* Dim the lights in your entire house after dinner.\n* Keep your bedroom cool and dark.\n* Don‚Äôt read in bed.\n* Wear yellow or amber tinted glasses after dimmer time. Yellow lenses block blue wavelength light. Low light levels prepare the brain for sleep.\n* No bright lights, T.V., or computer within 90 minutes of bedtime.\n* Aim for 8-10 hours of sleep.\n* Many people will start to lose weight when they turn off the TV, computer, and iPad when the sun sets.\n\n**4.  HEAL YOUR GUT: The total surface area of the gut lining is nearly two football Ô¨Åelds. Although it is mostly hidden from us, the gut is the main way our body interacts with the outside world. We have 100 times more bacteria in our gut than we have cells in our entire body. The gut bacteria interact with our immune system in a major way. InÔ¨Çammation that damages leptin receptors and triggers auto-immune diseases usually starts in the gut. Healing your gut will promote the maximum absorption of vitamins and minerals and keep ‚Äúpoop‚Äù out of your bloodstream. This will calm down inÔ¨Çammation and allow the leptin system to heal and function normally. You will also reduce your risk of autoimmune diseases.**\n\n* Avoid cereal grains, seed oils, excessive sugar and especially high fructose com syrup, soy products, beans, excessive lactose and casein. See more on diet below.\n* Eat some food with fermentable Ô¨Åbers (starches like sweet potato, yam, tapioca, etc.).\n* Eat fermented foods like keÔ¨År, Greek yogurt, sauerkraut, kimchi AND/OR take a high-quality, multi-species pro-biotic tablet.\n* Coconut oil is a super food for damaged intestines, also bone broths.\n* Avoid NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) or PPIs (Prilosec, Nexium) if possible.\n* Older patients might need HCL acid supplements.\n\n**5.  TRY SOME COLD THERAPY: Cold exposure turns on growth hormone and GNRH, the hormone that stimulates the sex hormones. These hormones build muscle and bone. Also, the leptin receptors really turn on in the cold. Cold tells your body to turn fat into heat by converting white adipose tissue (WAT) to brown adipose tissue (BAT) and muscle. We are warm-blooded mammals and as such, much of our calorie expenditure every day is related to heat production. You can easily burn as many calories generating body heat as running on a treadmill, for example. Cold exposure also sets the body up for excellent sleep.**\n\n* Drink ice-cold water.\n* Apply ice packs to your belly for 20-30 minutes a day (a ‚ÄúColpac‚Äù brand oversized ice pack works Well and can be ordered on Amazon)\n* Exercise in colder temperatures.\n* Swim in cold water.\n* Take some cold showers.\n* Work up to taking cold-water baths\n\n\n**A BIT MORE ON DIET**\n\nThe Standard American Diet (S.A.D) is well. ..SAD. Americans suffer from more chronic health problems than any other culture. Why? We eat low-vitamin-content food that our bodies aren't designed to use in an optimal way and that often leaves us feeling unsatisÔ¨Åed and hungry.\n\nMuch modern ‚Äúfood‚Äù messes up digestion, leads to obesity, and triggers or exacerbates many auto-immune diseases.\n\nYou are what you eat after all, right?\n\nWhy not eat what the human body is designed to consume‚Äò? Eat real food! (Just in case you were\nwondering, a Twinkie is not real food.)\n\nHere‚Äôs what I avoid eating: **1) sugar, 2) grains, and 3) vegetable oils.** Along with the ‚Äúbig 3‚Äù listed above, I don‚Äôt eat many legumes and not much milk.\n\nThe above mentioned foods are toxic to some degree for most people. Although these foods don‚Äôt typically make us acutely ill, we are more likely to develop ‚Äúchronic‚Äù problems if we eat them for long enough: obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, etc. I call such problems **diseases of civilization** because they rarely existed prior to the modem diet or among present-day indigenous cultures that eat natural foods. I Ô¨Ånd that quite interesting.\n\nIf you avoid ‚Äúthe big 3‚Äù mentioned above, you are Lmlikely to be obese or get Type 2 diabetes, and you‚Äôll also reduce your risk of cancer, auto-immune disease, and heart disease. Here‚Äôs a short explanation why I don‚Äôt eat these foods.\n\n* **Sugar** causes insulin spikes and damages the leptin receptors in the brain that control appetite. Insulin is a hormone that keeps your blood sugar from going too high after you eat by storing that sugar as fat. Insulin spikes are bad because they trigger excessive appetite and eventually, obesity. Insulin spikes also burn out the pancreas, which leads to Type 2 diabetes. Sugar in the diet also causes ‚Äúglycation‚Äù, an oxidative process that damages tissues, especially arteries, thus increasing the risk of heart attacks. Glycation also damages the ‚Äúappetite control‚Äù leptin receptors in the hypothalamus. Having damaged leptin receptors puts your metabolism into ‚Äústarvation mode‚Äù, even if you have too much fat already. Not good. Sugar makes you fat, especially around the waist, and the bigger your belly, the more likely you are to get diabetes or heart problems.\n* **Grains** trigger a hyperactive immune response in many people and damage the protective lining of the gut. This makes the gut ‚Äúleaky‚Äù which allows all sorts of bad things to enter the circulation that shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äî like poop! When the immune system has to deal with more than it can handle, it can inadvertently attack ‚Äúinnocent bystanders‚Äù like thyroid tissue, brain tissue, skin tissue, lung tissue, etc. This haphazard stimulation of the immune system can exacerbate thyroid problems, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, eczema and many others. Many of these problems start with a ‚Äúleaky gut‚Äù issue. Another problem with grains, it that they spike insulin levels just as much as pure sugar does. They also contain ‚Äúphytates‚Äù that interfere with calcium, copper, magnesium, iron, and zinc absorption. Lastly, practically all grain these days is genetically modiÔ¨Åed, which makes them a questionable food source, at best. So with grains, you give yourself a triple whammy: hyperactive insulin, a hyperactive immune system, and lousy mineral absorption. Can the human organism survive on a grain based diet? Yes, of course it can, but we want the very best fuel for our bodies, not gruel.\n* Just like grains, **vegetable oils and margarine** have chemical structures that Ô¨Åre up the immune system in an indiscriminate fashion. Vegetable oils such as those derived from sunÔ¨Çower, safÔ¨Çower, canola, com, and soybeans contain an excessive amount of omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids. If you eat too much omega-6, your body over-produces inÔ¨Çammatory proteins that can lead to health problems and pain. Additionally, most soy and com these days is also genetically modiÔ¨Åed.\n\nCan we survive on a diet based on sugar, grain, and vegetable oil? Yes, of course, but this is not optimal. When you are trying to restore your health, survival foods are not going to cut it. You need to eat foods that satisfy the dictates of our evolutionary heritage to have optimal health.\n\nSo, what‚Äôs good to eat?\n\n* Pretty much all **veggies** in any quantity you like. Get all the colors: green, yellow, red, purple, orange, and white, but go easy on the starchy potatoes if you want to lose weight. It‚Äôs best to eat these in spring, summer and fall, a bit less in winter. Organic is better if you can afford it. Growing your own is the very best, in my opinion.\n* **Fruit**: 2-3 pieces of fruit a day is okay, but eat less if you have diabetes, need to lose some weight, or have irritable bowels. Our hormones and metabolism are set up to eat fruit when the days are long and getting cooler ‚Äîlate summer and autumn. That‚Äôs the best time to eat them.\n* **Fish**, including the skin if you like it. Salmon is a super-food. So are sardines. Eat Ô¨Åsh often. If you don‚Äôt like Ô¨Åsh, take a Ô¨Åsh oil, cod liver oil, or krill oil supplements to get your Omega-3 fatty acids. The longest lived people in the world all eat **seafood: shrimp, scallops, lobster, clams, mussels**, etc. **I challenge all my patients to eat some Ô¨Åsh or seafood every day.**\n* **Seaweed** is a super-food and can be a daily addition to your diet. If you decide to do a very low-carb, ketogenic type diet, you need the iodine in seafood to keep your thyroid going. Kelp tablets can help get the iodine you need on days you don‚Äôt eat seafood.\n* Grass-fed or ‚Äúfree-range‚Äù meat: **beef, lamb, pork, turkey, chicken,** etc. **Wild game** is great, too. Grass-fed meat and wild game has higher Omega-3s and many other nutrients than does ‚Äúfeed-lot‚Äù produced meat. Find a local rancher if you can. Store bought meat is not as good, but it‚Äôs okay. KSL classiÔ¨Åeds can be a good resource for this.\n* **Butter, ghee, or cream** from pasture-fed cows. Milk is loaded with carbs, so drink water instead. I restrict dairy products in some patients, but for starters, it‚Äôs probably okay.\n* **Eggs**, especially from ‚Äúfree-range‚Äù chickens that can eat insects, worms, and grass.\n* **Organ meats like liver and heart**, especially if you‚Äôre one of 25% of the population that doesn‚Äôt convert beta-carotene to real vitamin A. Butchers can mix these into hamburger for you if you don‚Äôt like it plain. Menstruating women can really get a boost from these iron-rich super-foods. Eat less of these if you have high ferritin or iron levels.\n* **Bone broths**. Critical if you have arthritis, cartilage damage, herniated discs, or osteoporosis.\n* **Ghee, lard, butter, tallow, or coconut oil** are great for cooking.\n* **Macadamia nut oil, avocado oil, and olive oil** are useful for dressings.\n* Small amounts of nuts are good for you. Macadamias are the lowest in Omega-6. Don‚Äôt go nuts on nuts, however. They are an accessory food.\n* Eat foods with ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù bacteria: **kefir, Greek yogurt, homemade sauerkraut,** etc.\n* **Dark chocolate**, 65% and up is best.\n* Drink plenty of **ice-cold water**. Green tea is okay. Coffee if you like. Avoid other beverages.\n* **Himalayan Pink Salt**. This salt has dozens of trace minerals and is vastly superior to table salt. It does not have iodine, however, but if you‚Äôre eating plenty of seafood and seaweed, you‚Äôll be getting all the iodine you need. \n* **Sweet potatoes** are a safe, starchy food. If you‚Äôre athletic and need to ‚Äúcarb-load‚Äù this is the best food to do it with.\n* Do not eat packaged and processed foods. Avoid soda, additives and preservatives. If it has a long shelf life, you should not put it in your body.\n\nBeans and other legumes are okay when sprouted or cooked for a long-time, but these foods have proteins that can damage the gut lining in some people, just like the grains do, so I can‚Äôt give them a total green light. They might be okay in small amounts. Personally, I‚Äôve stopped eating them.\n\nIf you want to lose weight, keep your daily carbohydrate intake at around 50 -100 grams and get the rest of your calories for the day from fat and protein. If there is a secret to weight loss, this is it. Use the website Fitday to calculate your carbohydrate intake.\n\nMost people will be less hungry on this diet and won‚Äôt need to cotmt calories. Just eat until you feel satisÔ¨Åed, but not ‚Äústuffed.‚Äù\n\nHere‚Äôs a site with plenty of recipes: [http://nomnompaleo.com/recipeindex](http://nomnompaleo.com/recipeindex), but meals can be very simple: some meat or seafood, an egg or two, some veggies, and a slice of fruit. Done.\n\nRead Mark Sisson. His website also has a lot of great information: [www.marksdailyapple.com](http://www.marksdailyapple.com).\n\n[http://perfecthealthdiet.com](http://perfecthealthdiet.com) is another resource I like.\n\n**HOW WILL YOU KNOW YOUR ‚ÄúFAT THERMOSTAT‚Äù IS WORKING AGAIN?**\n\n* Hunger and cravings greatly diminish\n* Sleeping like a rock\n* Feeling refreshed in the morning\n* Less muscle soreness\n* Mental calmness\n* Steady weight loss\n* Increased libido\n* Softer skin and stronger nails\n* Improved mental ability\n* Fewer headaches\n* Dreaming, especially about moving your body (dancing, exercising, exploring, etc.)\n* More energy\n* Firmer gums, smoother teeth\n\n**WHAT ABOUT EXERCISE?**\n\nIt‚Äôs important to wait until you have some clear signs of leptin sensitivity prior to working out hard. If you push it too soon, you can damage your stem cells and push cortisol levels up before your metabolic and hormonal systems are ready. Once you have 5-6 signs of leptin sensitivity (from the above list), you can start doing more exercise: walking, lifting weights, calisthenics, and eventually sprinting. You don‚Äôt ever have to jog again! (If you don‚Äôt want to, that is.) Exercise outdoors whenever possible. Long-distance running and cycling are not the best exercise for losing weight. Weight training, sprinting, and body‚Äîweight exercises like push-ups and squats are better. If you do these types of exercises at a high intensity level, your heart and lungs will get plenty of a workout. Work into exercise slowly. For many people, it‚Äôs a good idea to get a treadmill test prior to working out to make sure your heart is good to go for it.\n\n**WHAT PROBLEMS MIGHT ARISE WITH A BIG DIET CHANGE?**\n\n* Moodiness ‚Äî This can be mitigated with a 5-HTP supplement, B complex vitamins, and selenium. Also, fat is your friend with this one. Eat more coconut oil, olive oil, cream, butter, fatty Ô¨Åsh like salmon, or bacon. Eating a high tryptophan food, like turkey, along with a little bolus of carbs, like sweet potatoes, can boost serotonin levels pretty quickly, too. \n* Headache, muscle weakness, and dizziness. These will go away as your body builds up its fat buming machinery, usually within a week.\n* Smelly urine ‚Äî this is from ketones in the urine and it generally a sign that you‚Äôre eating enough protein and the right amount of carbs. Don‚Äôt be alarmed.\n* Constipation ‚Äî If this happens, eat more vegetables. They are full of soluble Ô¨Åber and have less of a ‚Äúglycemic-load‚Äù than fruit or prunes. Ground Ô¨Çax seeds and magnesium work well, too.\n* Some people, especially women, do better with a slow decrease in the amount of carbs. You can follow higher carbohydrate version of the Pale diet without eating gluten grains or sugars, just eat sweet potatoes, yams, bananas, or rice instead. As your fat burning machinery kicks in, you‚Äôll be able to decrease carbs to 50 -150 grams/day eventually without feeling irritable.\n* Plateaus: These are to be expected. Weight loss and metabolic optimization often progress in Ô¨Åts and starts. You are rebuilding your metabolism and this takes time. If you plateau at a certain Weight for more than a month, there‚Äôs probably a hormone problem to address. See me and we‚Äôll Ô¨Ågure it out with some labs and a review of your diet, sleep, and exercise pattems.\n\n\nIn general, I‚Äôm not a big fan of supplements, but most people with broken down metabolism and hormone problems have nutritional deÔ¨Åciencies that can be helped in the short term by medications or supplements. Once you are at a healthy weight and have eaten well for 6-12 months, they typically are not necessary.\n\nFor everyone:\n\n\n* A high quality **multivitamin** helps because if you‚Äôre not eating a good diet, it‚Äôs very likely you have vitamin and mineral deÔ¨Åciencies. It‚Äôs expensive to test for everything, so this is just a low-risk, low cost way to get up to normal.\n* **Omega-3 fatty acids** via Ô¨Åsh oil or krill oil help restore the balance of Omega-3 to Omega-6 fatty acids. These two fatty acids use the same enzyme pathway, so if you have too much of one, it outcompetes the other. Essentially all Americans are overloaded with Omega-6 from packaged foods, margarine, and vegetable oil. Too much Omega-6 causes persistent inÔ¨Çammation that damages the leptin receptors (and everything else for that matter.) I can take years of eating well to get to the proper balance. If you eat Ô¨Åsh daily you probably don‚Äôt need a supplement. If you don‚Äôt eat much Ô¨Åsh, take l-3 tablets a day.\n* **Vitamin D** is low in most of my patients, so get it tested. Some people need high dosages to get to optimal ranges. I test my level a few times a year. Taking 2000 IU daily is okay to start, but many people need more. A good level is between 50-100.\n* **Magnesium** is a required co-factor to make A/TP, which powers all of your cells. Magnesium competes for absorption with Vitamin D, so spacing these two supplements by 12 hours helps. Most people should take 400-800mg daily in the form of magnesium glycinate, threonate, or malate. Magnesium oxide is more readily available in stores, but doesn‚Äôt work quite as well.\n\nFor special circmnstances:\n\n* **5-HTP** helps if you get moody while adjusting to a new diet. This is a serotonin precursor.\n* **PQQ** (pyrroloquinoline quinone) helps rebuild muscle mitochondria.\n* **Vitamin K2** is a co-factor for calcium-binding enzymes. This is good for people with osteoporosis, along with Vitamin D. Naturally it occurs in fermented foods. Post- menopausal women need this as much as calcium and vitamin D.\n* **Ubiquinol** (the more costly form of Co-enzyme Q10) helps rebuild mitochondria in the muscles. This can really help when you‚Äôre ready to start more vigorous exercise.\n* **DHEA** can help if you have a sex hormone deÔ¨Åciency or pregnenolone steal syndrome. It also helps with sleep.

I think one of the goals of this document is to look at it a bit differently than we have in the past.\n\n[Leptin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin) is fairly new in our understanding of health.  It was discovered in 1994!  Just a couple of weeks ago, the news was all over a new study showing the effect of fructose has on the body and its inhibition of leptin receptors (http://www.ucsf.edu/news/2013/01/13393/sugar-fights-still-simmer-new-brain-study-finds-fructose-might-stimulate-appetite)  Please read the UCSF article!!\n\nThis document is making the case, that calorie counting when you have damaged leptin receptors does not work like it should.  After you have repaired those receptors and stop taking in things that damage them (things you find in modern diet), then calories are now doing what they should be.  You will make better decisions (making it easier to calorie count) because you are not as hungry, and your brain isn't confused as to how much storage it has.\n\nSo - both sides are correct.  Calorie counting should not be discounted, and strict calorie counting does not work for everyone.\n\nWe are all individuals, and I truly hope that generalizations in diet one day will stop.",

Personally, having a moderate amount of healthy carbs in my diet improves my hair shedding. I shed so much hair when I was on a low carb diet. My detailed hair growth routine is here:*** [***https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/173ktba/how\\_i\\_have\\_successfully\\_grown\\_my\\_hair\\_back/***](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/173ktba/how_i_have_successfully_grown_my_hair_back/)\n* **Scalp conditions: healthy white scalp, no itchiness, no flakes**\n* **Shampoo routine: shampooing every other day, using Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair every  7-10 days, Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo for the rest of the week.**\n* **Diet and Lifestyle: Mediterranean diet; go to bed before 12; 7-8 hours of sleep everyday;**\n* **Stress management: don't give a shit about things that used to bother me, overall better mood**\n\nHi there, I've benefitted a lot from this community, so I'd like to make some contributions. I was losing an average of 200-300 hairs everyday at the onset of my sebderm. After two months, I'm now only shedding about 90 hairs daily, which is within the normal range. I know that clinically speaking there is no cure to sebderm and it may come back later, but I'm just happy that it's at least under control now. So I want to share this as my SOS protocol. As for long-term maintenance, I'm still learning so much about it from this community.\n\nBackground:\n\n\\- suffered from dry dandruff (large and white flakes) for more than 12 years but never experienced any hair loss\n\n\\- Because of COVID, I developed a bad habit of only shampooing 1-2 times a week (I have an oily scalp and straight hair). On non-wash days, I used a lot of hair products to keep my scalp feeling clean, e.g. scalp serum and dry shampoo. I only found out later that they contained denatured alcohol, which can destroy our skin barrier.\n\n\\- In late Aug, I experienced increased hair shedding of a daily average of 200-300 strands when I usually only shed a maximum of 30-60 strands a day. At the worst point, I was losing 500 hairs when I was shampooing one day. And I almost passed out.\n\n\\- My scalp was tingling, burning, and sore.\n\n\\- I went to a dermatologist in early Sept. He diagnosed me with severe sebderm and folliculitis on my scalp. He said I needed to get my sebderm under control before he could treat my hair loss\n\n\\- My before and after pics (warning: my sebderm was really bad on my scalp): [https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i](https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSebderm and hair loss:\n\n\\- I was very anxious and depressed about my hair loss because I've always had thick and healthy hair. People always give me compliments on how my hair looks. The point is that I was feeling so much pain mentally.\n\n\\- I consulted other dermatologists. Some said sebderm could cause telogen effluvium because my condition was so severe that it shocked my hair. Some said even though sebderm could cause increased hair shedding, mine was too serious to be caused by sebderm alone. There might be other causes.\n\n\\- But from Dr. Donovan's blog, there is a study that revealed that the more seborrheic dermaitits a person has, the more shedding (telogen effluvium) a person will experience. This tells us that individuals with severe seborrheic dermatitis are likely to have a severe telogen effluvium.\n\n\\- I still went to my family doctor and a naturopath to get blood tests done just to be sure what we're dealing with here. Everything was normal, so I focused on getting my sebderm under control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow I got the situation under control:\n\n\\- My dermatologist prescribed me with clobetasol solution and ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo.\n\n\\- At first, I was reluctant to use steroid. However, the longer my scalp stays inflamed, the more possible damage will be caused to my hair follicles, so I followed my derm's instructions and applied clobetasol to the affected areas daily for 21 days. My scalp was less red but I was still shedding 150-200 hairs a day.\n\n\\- Using the ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo (every other day for 8 weeks, as instructed by my dermatologist) was not very helpful. After much research, I came up with my own protocol that has really helped me get my sebderm under control.\n\n**- What I found is key is that the protocol needs to consist of three components: 1) destroy the biofilm, 2) kill malassezia, and 3) rebuild skin barrier. For each component, there are numerous ingredients/products available.**\n\n**- You can do all three components on a particular day or scatter them around throughout the week, depending on whatever suits your schedule and skin needs. Experiment and observe what suits your skin the best.**\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **on a given shampoo day**: 5% xylitol solution on the affected areas to be left on for at least an hour --> wash it off with an antifungal shampoo --> apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **in a particular week** (this is what I'm doing now): biofilm shampoo on day 1 and day 3 of the week followed by ciclopirox shampoo on day 5 and day 7. Each time after shampooing, apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 1) destroying the biofilm: xylitol, ACV, and selenium sulfide, MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 2) killing malassezia: ciclopirox, ketoconazole, coal tar, zinc pyrithione, and MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 3) rebuilding skin barrier: panthenol (vitamin B5), niacinamide (vitamin B3), glycerin, and aloe vera\n\n\\- Salicylic acid is not anti fungal per se, but it's great at removing the scales, regulating sebum production, and calming down inflammation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy detailed protocol:\n\n**-  I shampoo four times a week: Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide --> Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide OR T/Sal --> Ciclopirox 1.5% Shampoo --> T/Sal (I only use Selsun Blue twice a week for 2 weeks when things are bad because it is very strong)**\n\n**- This protocol is for short-term ONLY, e.g. 2-6 weeks! To get things under control first.**\n\n**- (updated on 4 Jan 2022) As my sebderm is getting much better, I have switched to this gentler protocol, which again incorporates all the essential components, for long-term maintenance. I'm rotating three different shampoos: Neutrogena T/Sal, DermaKB Scalp Detoxifier (biofilm disrupter), and Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Shampoo (contains an antifungal Piroctone Olamine). To hydrate my scalp, I've been using a DIY niacinamide and panthenol spray.**\n\n\\- Selenium Sulfide 2.5% is a game changer for me!! The dandruff/biofilm was finally coming off after 1-2 uses. Antifungals cannot get to the malassezia to do their job if the biofilm is present.\n\n\\- After shampooing, ~~I apply a DIY 3% panthenol aloe vera gel to my scalp.~~ I'm now using this DIY 2% glycerin, 2% panthenol, and 4% niacinamide in water spray.\n\n\\- Avoid ANY ingredient that may feed malassezia (I use a website called Sezia. Simple Skincare Science is also a very good source).\n\n\\- Even though I don't suffer sebderm on any other area, I switch all of my skincare products to seb-derm safe products because my skincare may transfer to my pillow.\n\n\\- I use a silk pillow case to reduce the friction (I can't afford to lose even one more hair).\n\n\\- I change my pillow case every 2-3 days and wash my pillow every week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct recommendations:\n\n\\- What is weird is that a lot of the products that are supposed to be formulated for people with sebderm are not sebderm friendly. They contain ingredients that feed malassezia. There is a useful website called Sezia that I use to check whether a product is safe (not affiliated). This is also the reason I need to DIY the panthenol and aloe scalp treatment.\n\n\\- Products that I like: Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide Shampoo, Neutrogena T/Sal, Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Scalp, dermaKB Biofilm Scalp Detoxifier, Philosophy B5 powder, the Ordinary 100% niacinamide powder,\n\n\\- Products that made my situation worse: Head and Shoulders Royal Oils Scalp Elixir, Inkey List Salicylic Acid Scalp Treatment, Head and Shoulders Clinical Strength 1% Selenium Sulfide\n\n~~- I will be experimenting with a DIY niacinamide and panthenol toner (for rebuilding skin barrier and calming inflammation) and 5% xylitol solution (for destroying the biofilm) and will keep this community updated of my results.~~ After much trial and error, I settle on this DIY scalp toner (2% glycerin, 2% panthenol, and 4% niacinamide in distilled water, which I think is really helpful for calming my scalp.\n\n**- Neutrogena T/Sal shampoo may be too harsh for people with a dry/sensitive scalp, but my oily scalp loves it!!! It helps get rid of the oily buildup and flakes on my scalp while also regulating my sebum production. My scalp is definitely less oily. And malassezia loves an oily scalp because they also feed on our natural sebum.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDiet and supplements (Please see here for a detailed wholistic approach to tacking sebderm: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/rggsrj/a\\_novelwholistic\\_evidenceinspired\\_approach\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/rggsrj/a_novelwholistic_evidenceinspired_approach_to/)):\n\n\\- Daily: Vitamin D3+K2, cod liver oil, ~~reishi, homemade kefir~~, nutritional yeast, ~~MCT oil~~\n\n\\- 2-3 times a week: zinc, magnesium glycinate, and collagen powder\n\n**- What I would recommend for almost everyone: vitamin D3+K2, magnesium, and fish oil.**\n\n\\- Around 60-70% of people in North America are deficient in vitamin D. There are also studies that point to an association between vitamin D deficiency and inflammatory skin conditions such as sebderm. Although this does not mean a causal relationship, taking vitamin D3 overall can help regulate our hormones and immune system. Magnesium and vitamin K2 should be supplemented with vitamin D3. This combo also help me better deal with stress, which is also a trigger of sebderm.\n\n\\- Fish oil supplement helps the body repair the skin barrier. It is also highly anti-inflammatory. But remember to choose a reliable brand. Many of the fish oil supplements on the market are contaminated. Brands I love that are also third-party tested: Nordic Naturals, Natural Factors Pharmaceutical Grade Fish Oil, and InnovixLab.\n\n\\- Probiotics that I've tried and quite like: Garden of Life Dr Formulated, Seed, and Visbiome (not affiliated in any sense; purchased all products with my own money)\n\n\\- Garlic powder supplement and oregano oil capsules daily for 1 week for killing the bad bacteria in my gut\n\n\\- Homemade bone broth for repairing my gut\n\n\\- Gluten-free\n\n\\- No refined carbs at all\n\n\\- No sugar\n\n\\- No dairy ~~except kefir~~\n\n\\- Lots of greens with some meat each meal\n\n\\- Berries everyday (there is a study that revealed a correlation between low fruit intake and sebderm in women). Plus, berries are anti-inflammatory\n\n\\- Avoid using vegetable oil in cooking. Opt for more heat-stable oils that are also low in omega-6s, e.g. extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, ghee, and butter.\n\n\\- To sum up, the key is to incorporate as much anti-inflammatory food as possible.

And also to add the things that I forgot to mentionEdit: Added some before and after pics and meal idea pics.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have any questions\n\nEdit on 19 Jan 2022: Now my scalp is free from dandruff with very mild redness, itch is very neglectable like only very mild itch every 5-6 days, and I'm shedding an average of 70 strands of hair daily, which is within the normal range of 50-100 hairs daily as advised by most dermatologists. This is my latest weekly routine (I shampoo four times a week): Neutrogena T/Sal Shampoo --> Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Scalp (start with as little shampoo as possible because it lathers very well; too much lather can be irritating to the scalp) --> Phillip Adam Apple Cider Vinegar Shampoo (Fragrance Free) --> Ciclopirox 1.5% Shampoo (available by prescription only; alternatives are ketoconazole shampoo and selenium sulfide). ~~Each time after shampooing, I apply the DIY hydrating scalp spray containing 2% panthenol, 2% glycerin, and 4% niacinamide.~~ No longer using the toner as the shampoos I'm using now are very hydrating and gentle.\n\nEdit on 23 Jan 2022:  I've just stumbled across some substitutes for this DIY spray from a brand called COSRX. Although they are not hair products, the ingredient lists seem pretty good. This toner ([https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/centella-water-alcohol-free-toner](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/centella-water-alcohol-free-toner)) contains panthenol and sodium hyaluronate, which are both good hydrating ingredients. This one ([https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/bha-blackhead-power-liquid](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/bha-blackhead-power-liquid)) contains salicylic acid, niacinamide, and panthenol. I'm probably going to try these out soon as I sometimes don't have the time to make the DIY spray. BIG **DISCLAIMER: These are not products formulated for the scalp. Use at your own discretion.**\n\nUpdates on 15 Mar 2022: I'm now using a routine targeted at healing my skin barrier because my scalp is now flake-free but mildly red. Shampooing every other day: ciclopirox shampoo once a week and Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo (if you have a really oily scalp, Briogeo Be Gentle Be Kind Matcha Shampoo may be a better alternative) for the rest of the week. Each time after shampooing, I apply some diluted niacinamide serum from The Ordinary because the original 10% may be too irritating. The study that suggested niacinamide as a potential treatment for sebderm used a concentration of 4%. I also added some panthenol powder to the mixture (at a concentration of about 1.5%), which is completely optional. I'm now shedding about 50 hairs daily.\n\nThe new HA hydrating serum by The Ordinary did not work for me. I tested it on my hairline, then the sebderm migrated to my hairline while my scalp, luckily, is still clear.\n\nUpdates on 12 May 2022: Shampooing every 2-3 days because my scalp is less oily and less itchy. Not using any topical hydrating product because I think my skin has healed so much. Now I'm using ciclopirox shampoo (by prescription only) once a week, and Bioderma Node A Shampoo for the rest of the days\n\nUpdates on 7 July 2022: Shampooing every other day; Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair once a week and Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for sensitive scalp for the rest of the week; taking anti-inflammatory herbs prescribed by a licensed Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner (TCM); shedding 40-50 hairs daily; scalp pretty healthy; incorporated more carbs in my diet because realized a low-carb diet makes me shed more hair\n\nUpdates on 28 Aug 2022: Shampooing every other day; Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair every 10 days and Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo for the rest of the week; been taking the herbs for almost 2 months now. Noticed my scalp is less oily, zero itch now, no flakes, and redness almost gone. There are some days where I'm shedding only 20-30 hairs daily, which is my pre-sebderm level. But I DON'T recommend visiting a TCM practitioner in western countries. Most of them have no idea what they're doing, and the herbs, if not prescribed properly, can cause damage to the liver and kidney. They are also not well-regulated under the law. My diet is lots of cooked vegetables, some berries, some carbs, and some meat. My TCM doctor told me to avoid seafood (except some fish) and beef.",

The first time I unfortunately decided to use olive oil, and the majority burned off at 400F during the hour of seasoning in the oven due to its low smoke point. I scoured the pan with steel wool, let it dry and tried again. For the second time I used sunflower oil I had laying around, which has a higher smoke point (450F) and didnt seem to be ill-advised for seasoning cast iron. This also smoked up my apartment which I think was because I didnt wipe enough oil off, didnt realize that you basically had to wipe it clean before baking. For my third attempt, I decided avocado oil was the way to go with its boastful 500F+ smoked point. I gave it a good wipe down this time and it didnt smoke. Baked it for an hour and let it cool off. I even gave it a second layer of seasoning. Cooked some bacon in it and it was better, only stuck a little initially. Then tonight, I tried cooking some trout I marinated and this horror show was created. All the fish skin peeled off and the fish stuck to the pan like glue. This piece of iron in my kitchen has been tormenting me for the past few weeks, any advice on what Im maybe doing wrong would be appreciated.",

        "body": "First of all, your seasoning is probably just fine.\n\nFood sticks because protein binds to the metal  in your pan. So the goal is to make it bind to something else before it has time to bind to the metal. So oil is essential because it creates a barrier that reduces contact between the food and the pan. And when hot enough, it also makes protein bind to the sugars in the food (Maillard reaction), hence making it less likely to bind to the metal in your pan. It‚Äôs crucial that this reaction occurs before the protein has time to bind to the pan, so high heat is a must. \n\nHigh heat also helps to vaporize water quickly and the vapor acts as a mechanism to ‚Äúlift‚Äù the food from the surface of the pan, thus reducing contact, which reduces likelihood of food sticking.\n\nIn your case, the marinate usually has more moisture compared to dry rubs. Fish skin is also moisture rich and is known to have sticking problem. The extra moisture reduces the temperature and slows down the Maillard reaction.\n\nSo your best bet is to pre-heat the pan more, and make the fish as dry as possible before you place it in the pan. Paper towels can help.\n\nHope this long essay helps you in some ways.",

Preheat, but agree with the person who said not above medium, especially when cooking fish (when cooking bacon start with a totally cold pan).  with fish or anything else that's delicate, I'd try moving it a bit right after you put it in, and I wouldn't cook it too hot--hot enough to sizzle but not crazy hot.\n\nMy next comment will get me yelled at by some, but I've been using CI my whole life, have a number of pieces from great grandparents, some new.  It's just a pan. it's not mystical.  No matter how well seasoned, some foods will stick, especially if you use too high a heat and not enough or the wrong kind of lubricant.  Don't expect miracles, and understand the chemistry of cooking, and you'll be fine.  Also, the more you use your pan, the better it will perform, assuming you care for it properly.  If this is a brand new pan I'd cook in it 8-10 times after seasoning, before worrying about whether it needs more seasoning.  \n\nhope this helps",

Also, let the food properly sear before flipping it. One of the most helpful pieces of cooking advice is that the food will tell you when it‚Äôs ready to be flipped. 9 times out of 10, if it‚Äôs not flipping, it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not seared properly yet. \n\nMy last point is that fish is just frankly one of those foods that is better prepared in a nonstick. Fish and eggs. You can do it in a cast iron, sure, but it‚Äôs gonna save you a lot of hassle to just do it in a nonstick.",

I ended up moving multiple states and it sat in the heat, so I was afraid to use it. It sat even longer, for about a year. I have been struggling with really bad depression, and felt really guilty trying to dump it out because I hated myself for wasting it. It looked a little bit gummy, but not bad, but I was still afraid it had gone fully bad, so I ended up getting rid of the oil, soaking the bottle in hot water and dish soap, and it looked way worse after that. I soaked it again, and then put it right into the dishwasher on high heat setting. Now it looks like this. I‚Äôm so confused how it‚Äôs getting gunkier and gunkier the more I attempt to clean it. Is this salvageable, or should I just recycle it? It is thick and gooey, sticky, and doesn‚Äôt seem to rub off easily with soap and a rag.",

Add your favorite essential oil oil if you like to make it smell heavenly. \n\nUse a bottle brush to thoroughly coat the inside of the bottle and the pour spout. Leave it over night.  Scrub it with a bottle brush then rinse with hot water. It should take the gunk right off.\n\nThe paste holds the dish soap in place so it attacks the oil for hours on end.

You only have to leave it on overnight on a tough job.  \n\nI use it to clean my bathtub and sink because it leaves no grit behind.

Idk it sticks sometimes and I find I got to move the stuff around a lot but I've had it in pretty bad condition as far as stuff stuck on there. I've seasoned a few times throughout the few weeks I've been working with this first cast iron of mine. Just wanted to share the pic and methods I just scrape with wood spoon and really hot water and soap if need be. One time I used soap and hot water and practically stripped the pan with steel wool and dawn dish soap. Did a 30 min 50% vinegar soak before drying and re-seasoning. I have been seasoning with avocado oil at 450 degrees F for 1 hour. As far as performance I don't think this pan has reached its potential yet we'll see how it goes with these methods. Things sticking a little unless I move it and I haven't cracked an egg into it yet.",

    "body": "This isn't specifically a keto topic, but since plenty of people rely on chicken breast as a staple, I thought I should post about it.\n\nYesterday was my first experience with \"woody chicken\". I haven't bought breasts in a long time, but these were on sale for the holiday, so I picked up a package. I am glad I only cooked one breast, because the texture was so gross that I could only eat a little bit of it and gave the rest to the dogs. (I'm returning the remaining breasts to the store.) I thought I had just cooked it wrong, but when I started looking around on the internet, I found out about woody chicken!\n\n**What is it?** Have you ever made chicken breast, taken a bite, and thought it was still raw due to the texture? Or maybe it didn't seem raw, but just a rubbery and weird texture to where you didn't want to eat it? This is woody chicken! It is more common in large chicken breasts. There might be one or two woody ones in a package, or the whole package can be this way.\n\n**What causes it?**  [Here is one article of many.](https://thepoultrysite.com/articles/why-does-woody-breast-still-have-the-industry-stumped)  It can occur in organic/free range chicken too.\n\n**How can I avoid buying woody chicken?**  \n\n* Avoid buying the gigantic breasts.\n* Look at them before buying - if you see whitish stripes running across them, they are woody. [Here is a picture showing a non-woody breast - (score 0) - up to a highly woody breast - (score 3) -](https://i.imgur.com/egUjSny.jpg))  The breasts I bought looked like score 2.\n* If the skin is still on them, there is not really a way to tell if they are woody, so buy the smallest ones you can find.\n* Buy smaller, locally raised/farmed chicken. \n* RETURN any chicken breasts you buy that are woody. They're safe to eat, but I think returning them will help keep the pressure on producers to solve the problem.\n* Buy thighs, which are (so far) unaffected.\n\nClass dismissed :)\n\nUPDATE: I returned the remaining chicken breasts. I got them at Aldi - WOW!  I just learned they have a \"Twice as Nice Guarantee\"....you get your money back AND a replacement item! That is crazy! Obviously I didn't want more woody chicken, so I got a bottle of Avocado oil :)",

    "body": "Edit: My husband (chefman) just told me that the mason jar I use for measuring is a quart, not a pint!!! I'm so sorry if anyone made salty chicken. So that's 2-4 tblspns of salt, sugar and soy sauce for every 4 cups of water. Not 2! \n\n\nHey everyone! My husband and I have been working on getting our food prep game down and we finally have a pretty healthy routine that's helped us stop eating out so much. Some tips I learned from you all that really worked for us:\n\n1. Muffin trays! They're a Godsend! I make a huge batch of rice and beans and freeze \"pucks\" and pop them in the freezer. 2 pucks is a good serving size.\n\n2. Smoothies! That way if you eat like shit the rest of the day you started it out right. I also add cooked then frozen quinoa to my smoothie as one redditor suggested and it's good and filling. \n\n3. Bomb ass chicken! This recipe changed the game for us, so here it is. \n\nPut frozen chicken in a pressure cooker with 1/8 C  salt, 1/8 C sugar and 1/8 C soy sauce PER 2 cups of water necessary to fill pressure cooker. For me that's usually 4 chicken thighs with 2 cups of water. \n\nLess seasonings can be used if your sensitive to seasoning but I dont add any salt other than this. The pressure cooker forces the brine to permeate all of the meat. \n\nPressure cook that for 2 pressure cycles on low, 15psi or so. Then once it's done, turn a pan on HIGH heat preferable with peanut or avocado oil, get out a pan lid (read: grease sheild) and flash fry your already cooked chicken for a minute or so on either side to quickly crisp up the outside. \n\nImo it's amazing because pressure cookers already make things so juicy, then it gets infused with a brine, and flash fried. Super yum. \n\nEnjoy my friends, stay cheap and healthy!",

The grill mark pans create pockets of air that steam instead of sear.\n\nIf you can, dry brine with salt for 24hours and pat dry before searing, although it should be pretty dry on the outside by then. You will be surprised at how dry this makes the steak and enables the perfect environment for searing, almost making it too easy!!\n\nLooks like you made a fantastic meal, but just needed to cook the steak a bit longer. I haven‚Äôt tried reverse sear yet, so I haven‚Äôt dialed in my technique on that method. Keep it up because you are clearly a great cook! Don‚Äôt be discouraged if you mess it up a few times, but I‚Äôm telling you that the video I linked helped me immensely. \n\nAlso I have a previous post of a steak I made if you care to check it out in my post history.

Make sure your pan is screaming hot when you take the steak out of the oven to get a good sear. I would start at 2 mins each side and go from there based on temp. \n\nBasting is when you‚Äôre continuously coating the steak with butter throughout the cooking process. After it gets into the pan add your butter and herbs and with a spoon continuously ladle the butter over your steak while it cooks. \n\nAlso, if you have a good stainless steel pan you shouldn‚Äôt need to add any oil to it before your steak. A steak will release enough natural oils and you‚Äôll most likely get a better sear without any extra moisture in the pan. It will unstick itself when it‚Äôs ready to be released! \n\n\nI recommend watching the steak episode of mythical kitchen on YouTube! Tons of good info while they test all the things people say you should and shouldn‚Äôt do to steaks. \n\nAnyways, happy cooking!",
