    "body": "**Background**  \n\nIn August my favorite shampoo, Hask Argan Oil Repairing Shampoo, got reformulated with ingredients I'm allergic to, so I decided it was high time to try out some AB shampoos.  One of the things I really liked about the Hask shampoo was that it cleansed thoroughly but gently, so I knew I wanted a shampoo that shared some (if not all) of the same surfactants as they can make a huge difference in the harshness of the shampoo.  I also wanted a sulfate/silicone free shampoo that had a few oils like the Hask shampoo as well.  After many nights scouring cosdna for ingredients lists, I settled on Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo.  \n\n**Product Claims/Ingredients**  \n\nMoist Diane's [website](http://www.moist-diane.jp/en/products/extra-damage.html) claims the purpose of this line is to \"restore extremely damaged hair ends and roughness\", as well as repairing hair damage when heat is applied due to the line's unique \"nano repair matrix\".  I don't heat treat my hair, nor is it permed, bleached, etc so I wasn't really drawn in by these claims. \n\nMy main draw was the [ingredients list](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_63e4326873.html):\n\n>Water, **Olefin (C14-16) sodium sulphonate**, **Cocamidopropyl betaine**, **Cocamidomethyl MEA**, Cocoyl glutamic acid TEA, Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed keratin, PEG-7 glyceryl cocoate, Myristamine oxide, Sodium cocoamphoacetate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Gamma-docosalactone, Quaternium-18, Quaternium-33, **Cholesterol**, **Ceramide EOP**, **Ceramide NG**, **Ceramide NP**, **Ceramide AG**, **Ceramide AP**, Propylene glycol, Hydrolyzed keratin, **Argania spinosa kernel oil**, Mango seed oil, Theobroma grandiflorum seed butter, Prune seed extract, Carapa guaianensis seed oil, Sclerocarya birrea seed oil, **Baobab seed oil**, Opuntia Ficus-Indica seed oil, Steardimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed keratin, Pouteria sapota seed oil, Keratin, Isostearoyl hydrolyzed keratin, Alanine, Hydroxyproline, Sodium-PCA, Cetearamidoethyl diethonium hydrolyzed rice protein, **Sodium Hyaluronate**, Hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate, **Hydrolyzed hyaluronate**, **Hydrolyzed honey protein**, Malus domestica fruit cell culture extract, Argania spinosa sprout cell extract, Rhododendron ferrugineum leaf cell culture extract, **Collagen**, Hydrolyzed conchiolin, Bis-ethoxydiglycol cyclohexane 1,4-dicarboxylate, Propanediol, Dipropylene glycol, Butylene glycol, Isomalt, Polyquaternium-10, Isononyl isononanoate, Soybean sterols, Sodium chloride, Xanthan gum, Lecithin, Behentrimonium chloride, Glycerin, Citric acid, **Lactic acid**, Tocopherol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Aroma, Caramel \n\nBold indicates ingredients that my face likes or surfactants that are the same (or very similar) to the Hask shampoo.  Wow.  Five ceramides plus cholesterol, some nice oils (including baobab!!!), and some HA and collagen thrown in?  Yeah.  I like it.  \n\n**Performance**\n\nThis shampoo is a dream.  It lathers richly, which feels great, and it also has a mild fragrance (generic bubble bath scent) that is noticeable while using it but fades very quickly.  It comes in a large pump bottle, which is genius for shampoo and so much easier than fiddling with a squeeze tube.\n\nI have a naturally oily scalp that needs daily washing.  My scalp gets flaky if I use a shampoo that's too harsh, or if it gets super dry in the winter.  I've had no problems with flakiness since starting this shampoo and my scalp overall feels more hydrated and strong.  My hair also feels stronger and is glossier than it has been in a while.  I used to use Hask's argan oil hair mask 2-3x weekly, but I haven't felt the need to do so since starting this shampoo. \n\nI've also used this as a body wash since I ran out a month ago and thought why not share the goodness of this shampoo with all of my body skin. My skin is hydrated and appreciates the extra pampering.  \n\nFor curiosity's sake, I tested the pH with my aquarium drop test kit.  It's a narrow range test kit so it only shows 6.0 to 7.5, with anything below or above those values showing as a 6 or 7.5 respectively.  However, I'm not going to use anything above a 6.5 so it works for my purposes.  Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo comes in at a 6.0 or below, which is awesome so I'm considering testing it on my face because YOLO.\n\n**Verdict**\n\nI have been using this shampoo daily since September and I will continue using it for my hair and body until they reformulate it or discontinue it. **HG**\n\n**Where to find it**\n\nI bought mine off Amazon prime for $15, although it's no longer available on Prime.  You can also find it and the refill pouches for a similar price on Ebay or Amazon Japan. Edit: and Dokodemo",

All of these do not have fragrance. Both Isntree creams are great for daytime use (gel cream in the summer and moist cream in the winter). The Illiyoon Ato Lotion is for the body and even face if you prefer a little more occlusivity with a balanced moisture and has been a great all-arounder and extremely economical. Innisfree Ato Cream is a great choice is you really want to lock it all in overnight.***\n\n**My Skin: c-c-c-c-c-COMBO. My skin is drier in the winter and oily in the summer.**\n\nThe hyperlinked ingredients will take you to CosDNA analysis of each product.\n\n***PRODUCTS: ALL DO NOT HAVE FRAGRANCE ❤***\n\n***Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Aqua Gel Cream:***\n\n* Store: Jolse\n* Price: $10 (sale)\n* Size: 100 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_fe18517608.html) Water, Methylpropanediol, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Betaine, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Trehalose, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Centella Asiatica Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium PCA, Phytosqualane, Isostearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol Cocoate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters, Hydrogenated Olive Oil Unsaponifiables, Butylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Ethylcellulose, Propanediol, Phenyl Trimethicone, Pentylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n* **Review:** *I have used this for the past 6 months, and I can say this gel-cream really shines in the summer for daytime use. It is extremely hydrating, but  in the winter, it really lacks in the 'locking in water' department. I'd say this texture and performance is really similar to the cult-fave Belif Aqua Bomb and is a lot cheaper. It gives a burst of hydration with a hint of moisture, does not have any stickiness, and does not pill with sun protection layer. Has not caused any breakouts for me, but of course, avoid if you have a HA sensitivity or live in dry climate. People with pure oily skin will have more longevity in using this throughout the year. I probably will not repurchase because I love to try new products, but I have enjoyed using it and it practical price. Overall a great no-frills gel-cream.*\n\n***Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Moist Cream:***\n\n* Store: Jolse\n* Price: $10 (sale)\n* Size: 100 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_d36c550998.html) Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Dipropylene Glycol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Betaine, Behenyl Alcohol, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Water, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Cynara Scolymus (Artichoke) Leaf Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Eclipta Prostrata Leaf Extract, Pteris Multifida Extract, Beta-Glucan, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Methylpropanediol, Fructooligosaccharides, Raffinose, Ceramide NP, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Pentaerythrityl Distearate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Cholesterol, Folic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Polyquaternium-51, Tromethamine, Ammonium-Acryloyldimethyltaurate-Vp-Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA\n* **Review:** *I also used this cream for 6 months, and this is a great daytime cream for the winter. The texture here is more reminescent of Belif Moisturizing Bomb and is even more economical! This cream gives alot of moisture and balances a little bit of hydration and emollience. It takes in a bit more time to rub in and it is slightly sticky after application but that feeling goes away fast especailly when layering with sun protection. I have had zero breakouts using this cream and I recomend this for combination skin that gets drier in the winter. I have also used this at night, but I prefer a little more occlusiveness. It may be good for oily or combo skin at night if you prefer a lighter cream. I probably will not repurchase because I love to try new products, but I have also enjoyed using it and it practical price. Overall a great no-frills moisturizer and I look forward to try other products from Isntree.*\n\n***Illiyoon Ato Ceramide Lotion***\n\n* Store: Olive Young\n* Price: $37 (1+1 deal)\n* Size: 2x 528 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2f20551004.html) Purified Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Shea Butter, Cyclopentasiloxane, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Hydrogenated Poly (C6-14 Olefin), Clohexasiloxane, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Perilla Frutescens Sprout Extract, Magnolia Kobus Flower Extract, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA (Ceramide PC-104 32.75ppm), Mannitol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Caprylate, Dimethicone, Diisostearyl Malate, Lauric Acid, Myristic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Stearic Acid, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Alcohol, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cholesterol, Palmitic Acid, Propanediol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Disodium EDTA\n* **Review:** *I have used this for a month on both my body and my face, and I think out of all of these this is my favorite. I think some may not like that it leaves thin film of occlusiveness, but for me that is a plus. Locking in moisture is critical for me. It truly excels as a body cream because it does not feel sticky. This lotion is filled with so much goodness such as ferments, ginseng (korean antiaging plant), shea butter, and a bit of ceramide. It melts in to your skin and moisturizes it well. In the winter, I also enjoy it as a both a day and night face cream too since it is more emmolient and occlusive than the Isntree HA Moist Cream. Out of all the purchases, this has been a must purchase forever for my body and has an added bonus that I can use it on my face when I want to mix up routine.* \n\n***Innisfree Ato Soothing Cream***\n\n* Store: Jolse \n* Price: $23 (sale)\n* Size: 150 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_bdc7551007.html) Purified Water, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Glycerin, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Panthenol, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, C14-22 Alcohols, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Bislauramide MEA, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Arachidyl Alcohol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Cholesterol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Xanthan Gum, Sorbitan Isostearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA, Madecassoside, Glucose, Arachidic Acid, Myristic Acid, Acorus Calamus Extract, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Tocopherol.\n* **Review:** *I have also been using this cream for a month, and it is a very impressive barrier cream. It is buttery and harder to rub in, but this will 100% lock in your routine. Judging by its formulations and comparing to Innisfree Derma Formula Green Tea Probiotics Cream, I can guess that it is about 3% cermamide. This cream does not give much moisturzation, but if you are using a layering a routine it will seal all of the steps in, especially layering an emulsion before it. I feel like with this cream, it has an antiaging effect because my fine lines has redued probably due to its effectiveness as a barrier cream formulated with the ceramide and centella antioxidants! This one will be loved by those with dry, sensitive, or combo skin that loves a good barrier cream. I will probably repurchase, but I know there are other products to try in a similar catagory!*\n\nEdit: Added details addressing fragrance :)",

Lately with the economy and all, Im having to make some sacrifices which is say goodbye to my Kérastase Elixir Oil. I purchased three different drugstore hair oils to test and I came to the conclusion that this Pantene hair oil is just as good! It has a runny consistency similar to the Elixir oil as well. In the “dupe” scale Id give it a 9. It’s not a 10 because Kérastase is Kérastase in my opinion, but it’s definitely an amazing dupe. The ingredients aren’t similar, but the effect on the hair is. Here are the ingredients for both products:\n\nKérastase Elixir Ultimate Oil ingredients: Cyclopentasiloxane • Dimethiconol • Zea Mays / Corn Germ Oil • Argania Spinosa Oil / Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil • Camellia Kissi / Camellia Kiss Seed Oil • Pentaclethra Macroloba Oil / Pentaclethra Macroloba Seed Oil • Linalool • Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone • Limonene • Coumarin • Benzyl Alcohol • Parfum / Fragrance.\n\nPantene Miracle Rescue Regenerative Oil ingredients: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Panthenyl Ethyl Ether, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n",

    "body": "Take a second to look through these photos. Can you tell a difference between the two sides? Which is which? The answer will be in the comments.  \n\nHopefully I got enough pictures with different lighting. These are all different stages of my routine in the morning.\n\n\nSCENT:\n\nIt has been mentioned in this sub that the DT serum smells like pee. For me it has a clean, neutral scent. I would assume those were bad batches. \n\nIf I were to compare the two, I think Kérastase smells better. It also has a pleasant scent that lingers on my hair for a couple hours. DT does not linger, probably because it’s so neutral.\n\nSecond opinion: \nI asked my boyfriend to smell it too without context, he has a more sensitive nose than me. He stated that it doesn’t smell bad, I asked him if it reminded him of anything and he said it doesn’t. I told him that it smells like a clean scent to me and he agreed. \n\nThen I explained the rumor about it on Reddit and he said:\n“No, it doesn’t smell like urine. I am well acquainted” (referencing my dogs lol)\n\nSo do with that information what you will, maybe he’s just being agreeable 😂 but rest assured, you now have two more opinions on the scent. I would say to smell yours before applying to the hair just in case. I’ll update this post if there are any changes as I use it.\n\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\nDollar Tree (from the bottle):\nWATER, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, GLYCERIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, POLYQUATERNIUM-37,\nPROPYLENE GLYCOL, CYCLOHEXASILOXANE, DIMETHICONE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, PEG-20 STEARATE, STEARTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, FRAGRANCE, C13-16 ISOPARAFFIN, TRIDECETH-6 ACOHOL, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) OIL, DIMETHYL STEARANINE, HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, ARGANIA SPINOSA KERNEL OIL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, PANTHENOL\n\nKérastase (from their website):\nAqua / Water / Eau ● Dimethicone ● C13-16 Isoalkane ● Niacinamide ● Glycerin ● Polyacrylamide ● Phenoxyethanol ● C13-14 Isoalkane ● Laureth-7 ● Panthenol ● Ascorbyl Glucoside ● Butylene Glycol ● Linalool ● Hydroxycitronellal ● Benzyl Salicylate ● Benzyl Alcohol ● Hexyl Cinnamal ● Citronellol ● Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein ● Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone ● Coumarin ● Hydrolyzed Corn Protein ● Hydrolyzed Soy Protein ● Limonene ● Iris Florentina Root Extract ● Citric Acid ● Ci 19140 / Yellow 5 ● Ci 14700 / Red 4 ● Parfum / Fragrance\n\nOne notable difference in the ingredients is the addition of niacinamide in the Kérastase. Niacinamide is supposed to promote hair growth when used on the scalp. But if you are anything like me, I don’t apply serums all the way to the scalp, I start them from about the middle of my hair through the ends. \n\nBased on this, I do not believe niacinamide is especially helpful in the Kérastase. Niacinamide is probably more helpful in shampoos and scalp products (And now I’m tempted to use a certain DT niacinamide/squalane serum in my hair instead of on my face 🤣)\n\n\nPRICE:\n\nKérastase: $60/3.04 fluid oz, or $19/oz\n\nDollar Tree: $1.25/4 fluid oz, or 31¢/oz\n\n\nTEXTURE:\n\nI put these next to each other on the back of my hand. Kérastase has more of a serum feel, it’s clear/yellow upon application, and it has a little more of an oily texture. DT starts out a little thicker and looks white/creamy at first, then it blends out to be sheer. With both products, I rub them between my hands before applying to hair. \n\n\nMETHOD:\n\nLast night I did my normal shower routine, including a clarifying shampoo and a moisturizing conditioner. I’ve been using this particular duo of products for about 6 months. \n\nI let my hair dry for a couple of hours and applied one serum on each side, washing my hands between applications. Then I put my hair in braids for the night. I didn’t use any other leave-in products before taking pictures.\n\nIn the morning I took out the braids, hand-combed them, brushed through them, and then did some touch-ups to the ends with my curling iron, taking pictures throughout every step. \n\nSo let me know what you think and I’ll put my final thoughts in the comments!

Both sides of my hair look shiny and hydrated. The ends feel great. They are equally manageable. The dollar tree side MIGHT have a little more shine to it, or it could be the angle of my camera.\n\nI seriously can’t tell a difference besides the fragrance (I had to keep smelling each side to make sure I had them right) and the fragrance is not worth $58.25 to me. So you know where I’ll be spending my money.",

    "body": "So, I just recently bought into the whole AB shebang. I did my research and came up with a routine, and have been using a blend of mostly Korean and Japanese products for just the past two weeks or so. Here's the thing though. I've noticed that the products that are most raved about here and that are considered HG seem to be considered so mainly because of how they help with acne. I feel like 99% of the folks here are acne-prone and acne and scarring are their main problems. I feel like I belong to a very small minority. I am not at all acne prone. Never have been. My main concern is skin aging as I now have fine lines and some sun damage, including discolorations, and overall skin dullness. I also feel like my skin is dehydrated from a recent wrong encounter with tret. Now, my question is, are most of the HG products here at AB at all helpful for fine lines and other aging skin concerns? Every time I look up a review, the people who rave about the product keep saying over and over again that it helped with their acne. I hardly ever hear anyone saying it helped with their fine lines and dullness and just overall helped make their skin better, healthier, plumper, more radiant. Now, I'm not sure if I bought the wrong products. For instance, is snail supposed to provide benefits apart from helping heal acne and acne scars?\n\nFor reference, here is my current routine:\n\n* **First Cleanser:** Pond's Cold Cream (does the job, IMHO, and is so much cheaper than the Korean alternatives)\n* **Second Cleanser:** Mizon Repairing Foam Cleanser (seems okay but high PH, so I'm planning to replace)\n* **Exfoliator:** 1. Skinfood Black Sugar Wash-Off Mask (I found this too rough on my skin and I didn't really see any brightening or smoothening effects. In fact, after using it my skin felt worse than it was and I even got some scratches from the sharp sugar crystals, even after I diluted it with water and waited for it to melt a little before I started scrubbing)\n* 2. Skinfood Rice Wash-Off Mask (This one I absolutely LOVE. It is gentle and soothing, but it does its job when it comes to physically exfoliating. After first use, it just really removed like magic the wrinkly, dull dead skin cells that were sitting on top of my cheeks and forehead, and left me with baby-smooth, radiant skin.)\n* **Actives:** DIY Vitamin C serum (AM), Retin-A .05% 3x a week, buffered for now (PM)\n* **FTE:** Kiku-masamune High Moist (This one I love and seems to really provide a LOT of hydration, and I noticed an immediate difference in my skin just in the first few days of use, heck, even after the very first application.)\n* **Toner:** Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium (I can't really see what this does. Used it before I got the Kiku and couldn't see any hydration at all. It just feels sticky. Am now using it immediately after the Kiku and I still couldn't see any difference in hydration or plumping or anything like that. Really unsure about this one.)\n* **Essence:** Cosrx Advanced 96 Snail Mucin Power Essence (This is one of the items that seem to be raved about by folks who have acne problems and that I am unsure about any benefits for overall wellness for aging skin)\n* **Ampoule:** Scinic Honey AIO (Another one that I am not sure is beneficial for overall skin wellness for aging skin. Even when I use just a tad, it makes my skin so sticky and I don't really see any of the glow that it's supposed to give, nor the hydration. It looks and feels sticky, not glowy. I'm thinking of getting the LJH Vita Propolis as a replacement, but not sure if that one is also only good for the acne prone.)\n* **Light Moisturizer:** Mizon Black Snail AIO (I don't really see this doing anything for me either, but I admit it's probably too soon to tell, since I am only on, I think, my third week. Thinking of replacing with the Benton Steam Cream, but when I looked that up, again, it seems to be HG only because of how it helps heal acne.)\n* **Eye Cream:** MUZ Anti-Wrinkle Eye Cream (I don't think anyone here knows about this brand but I LOVE this. It is dirt-cheap but I feel like it has helped with my undereye wrinkles and dark circles and overall moisture more than any other high-end eye creams I've tried. It contains Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Shea Butter, Sodium Hyaluronate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Solluble Collagen, Houttuynia Cordata Extract and is paraben-free and alcohol-free. I really have seen a noticeable difference in the short time I've started using this.)\n* **Moisturizer:** Physiogel Daily Moisture Therapy (Another that is almost never mentioned here but that really makes a very noticeable difference. Hydrating, plumping, skin tone evening, this gives my skin a subtle radiance and an overall healthy look. I don't understand why no one here seems to know about it or like it. I did see one Korean video where they use this and have heard this is popular in Korea as well.)\n* **Sleeping Pack:** Laneige Water Sleeping Pack (I like this a lot, but I'm not sure if it provides any long-lasting benefits. I feel it may just be the silicone component that makes my skin look so hydrated in the morning, and not real hydration. I love how my skin looks in the morning though, but once you wash it off, it's gone.)\n* **Sunscreen:** Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Gel (better and more hydrating than the Essence, especially the BB in the pink tube, which is horribly drying and looks horrible on aging skin. I'm also using the Nivea Protect & Moisture and it is a lot more moisturizing than the Biore, but sadly the new reformulated PA++++ is not yet available here and this one is only PA++.)\n\nThat's it. I'm really just hoping to hear from the minority group of ABers who are NOT acne prone, and to hear about possible recommendations and replacements, especially for the Cosrx (and all snail products), as well as for the honey and propolis products. \n\n**EDIT:** Thanks for all the helpful responses. As an update, I have recently developed a better appreciation of both the snails and the Scinic Honey. The trick is to wait at least 5 minutes after the hada labo/toner and after the Advanced 96, and to use THREE pumps, not two, of the Advanced 96. Also, slathering all over the face before patting seems to work better for me. Ever since trying the above methods, I feel as though the products absorb better and they seem to provide better glow and hydration to my skin. After three weeks of the routine, I can definitely say that my skin quality has improved. Not yet dramatically, but it has improved. So, for now, I plan to continue using my snails and honey/propolis products and see where it goes. ",

        "body": "Sorry, this got long, I get passionate about skin care. lol.\n\nSo I'm edging towards mid-30's so I guess I would be in the anti-aging concern group although my original reason for getting into AB was acne (which I've eliminated). As for aging concerns, my concerns are: evening skin tone, eliminating PIH, and preventing wrinkles (I have a laugh line, which gives me thoughts).\n\nI know most reviews discuss acne but this is where you've got to know your science or at least where to look because the only reason you'll have an idea if a product will help with aging is if you do the research (I spent a good 3 hrs yesterday researching products for future purchases to hit on PIH/skintone issues.). Generally, AB skews younger if we take into account this reddit IMO. Some do have aging concerns but in the context of prevention rather than winding the clock back. \n\nIMO, AB offers a great foundation for aging skin. Aging skin: \n\n- losses elasticity (loss of fatty skin), \n- is more dehydrated/ dry, \n- has age spots (UV damage), and \n- wrinkles. \n\nA lot of this can be combated with a routine focused on **hydration and moisture**.  Yes, reviews discuss acne but these same products will likely in some capacity offer hydration and moisture to the skin so they can still be helpful for aging skin. And sunscreen really is non-negotiable. \n\n\nI'm pretty meh about most products you're using but if they work for you, they work for you. I don't use snail because I get hydration from other products in my routine (I find that snail is most useful for soothing, so those who still get acne). I keep moisture through having a med. moisturizer (although I plan on getting an emulsion for summer as I live in a swamp), and an oil, and make sure to use a sleeping pack to protect against waterloss. \n\n\nI have an oil like passionfruit because it supposedly fights free radicals and adds moisture but I'll be repurchasing it because I've seen awesome results in lightening the dark circles around my eyes. I use an FTE because it does brighten my skin overall. I use a BHA because my pores are huge otherwise. And the overall hydration in my routine keeps my skin plump. I'm testing a nonAB retinol right now and added a nonAB arbutin serum (for PIH) to my routine a couple of weeks ago. I notice the difference in my skin when I skip my routine for a few days -- loss of vibrancy in my skin, my laugh line is more prominent, and my skin is not plump. \n\n\n*Future purchases*: Me making a purchase decision is like making a plan of attack. I've adjusted my decision making recently and really only decide on purchasing if I find it'll add value to my skin based on research and a target to what my concerns are. \n\n- I'll add an oil like prickly pear and marula because I've heard so much about their antioxidant power and fatty acid content (I'm pretty much, gimmie all the fats). \n\n- I'm searching for the best Vit C serum and acid peel to attack the discoloration/PIH I have and I'll be re-adding a niacinamide product soon (personally, I don't know if niacinamide does anything for my skin but I'll give it another shot). \n\n- I'll be adding Stratia's liquid gold as well because it's an easily attainable product that I know hits the 3-1-1 ratio needed for actual ceramide penetration of the skin (which I think is important for aging skin). \n\nI'm adding all these things but they are on top of a routine that provides moisture/ hydration for my skin. If I feel like I'm missing something or something isn't performing, I'll add another product. Right now, I'm using HL Albutin moist lotion and I don't think it provides the hydration I need so when I finish it (hopefully in the next week or two) I'll replace it with another hydrating toner.\n\nBut I'm gonna be honest these products will not replace an Rx like tret or any retinoid. So, I view my routine as the accompaniment rather than the star. It'll provide the foundation so my skin can with stand a strong Rx (when I add one). My friend is a derm and really likes that I'm knowledgable about skin and ingredients but is very clear that tret is the best form of defense against aging (and acne) and likes to bring the papers to me, lol.  \n\n**TLDR**: Having an Rx like tret combined with a proper routine of moisture/ hydration, sunscreen protection, and a healthy lifestyle are the best methods to wind back the clock.",

Off the top of my head, I feel like the most raved about products are Benton Snail Bee Essence (for soothing acne or redness), Scinic Honey AIO (for overall brightening), Cosrx AHA and BHA (for a tonne of issues), and Hada Labo/Kikumasamune/Cezanne Lotion (for hydration). I honestly don't think there are that many acne specific products that have literally zero use for anyone without acne. BHA can be a preventative for acne, but it's also good for sebum control and SFs. AHA can help active acne or PIH from acne, but it's also good for cell turnover for brightening including anti-aging concerns like dullness and PIH from sun damage (which tends to be a bigger problem the older you get because you start to see the long-term effects of damage gained years ago). Vitamin C helps pigmentation, whether that's from acne or sun damage. The plethora of hydrating products is good for pretty much everyone, whether they use one or several.\n\nStill, there have been good general recommendations, and hopefully this thread helps those who do feel there aren't products for them.",

AHA, BHA or acids are fairly \"new\" for the AB cosmetics industry, and a lot of people steer towards western acids than Asian ones (COSRX acids is also fairly recent). For instance, Kikumasamune doesn't treat acne but it's awesome for providing hydration, brightening in some cases and repairing dehydrated skin, it even works wonders for my hair.

I mostly just use products that are full of hydration and moisture to prevent wrinkles and dryness. I think most of the reason why people say it helped with their acne is because before using the product, they had an imbalance of water and oil levels in their skin, and after adding these products, their skin does not need to react by making pimples. For me, the Laneige water sleeping pack was not occlusive enough for me and my skin absorbed it really fast, so I prefer the cosrx rice sleeping pack or nature republic aloe sleeping pack. I also love the Kikumasamune High Moist! I'm still young (17) but I'm already getting smile lines.

I don't have acne to heal, so I cant comment on its healing properties per say, but the occasional stress spot, disagreeing product while testing or time of the month spot, I find goes away faster. With that said, maybe you just don't benefit from it? And thats ok.  \n\nI also like the premium version of the hado labo - i dont use it every day, but I do use before a sheet mask or mask treatment - i feel it preps my skin and allows those preceeding products to absorb into my skin better.  \n\nBut with everything, ymmv as always. It took me months to find products that I really loved. So after the initial fangirling of AB went away, I started just focusing more on what ingredients worked well for my skin.

There doesn't seem to be many posts from older Redditors. As previous posts have mentioned, the age group of this sub skews much younger. I'm in my 40's and I've used some AB products for years (mostly Shiseido sunscreen and makeup) but didn't make the switch to all-AB skincare until 6 months ago. I was initially using a lot of Mizon products (I'm one of the suckers that way overpaid on products from Peach and Lily!) and, because my skin was so dehydrated, saw a huge improvement. However, the progress plateaued quickly once the dehydration was addressed. I went through a a couple months of buying and using many HG products that are often discussed in the sub, but didn't see much effect. Then I stumbled onto Sulwhasoo products and Vitamin C and I really began to see results. My skin has never felt so soft, been so plump, and many people have remarked that I have the AB glow. There are people on here who dismiss Sulwhasoo products as ineffective. My suspicion is they are probably younger and have skin which does not lack in whatever Sulwhasoo products replace in more mature skin so they don't see any improvement. I haven't quite picked out my HG products because I've been buying samples of their lines on Amazon and eBay (MUCH more cost-effective), but overall I've gotten better results from Sulwhasoo than anything else I've tried.",

I was planning to ask recommendations from people over 35+ soon.\n\nI have been at AB for only 3 months but I think somehow I avoided buying completely wrong products and even though anti-aging skin care won't show results so fast I will just keep using it as it seems to make my skin nicer. I'm 46 and didn't really think that much about skincare until last winter. I have been using vitamin C, AHA, resist serum and 1% retinol (besides moisturizer) from Paula's choice for the past 3 years but very inconsistently and didn't know about the PH dependent use of acids so not sure how much good what I was using did anyway. I didn't think about my skin being bad and I don't have that much wrinkles except creppines under eyes that is a problem especially when I can't sleep and am in a pain (I have fibromyalgia). But after jumping on AB wagon I started to scrutinize my face and found that my skin is kind of uneven, dull and big pores. Here is what I think are supposedly anti-aging ingredients in products that I use or going to use soon.\n\nRetinol - I didn't realized that retinol is not used as much in AB products until I couldn't find many. I did get AgeVetoLAB retinol night moisturizer that has micro-encapsulated 2.5 % retinol, vitamin C, niacinamide, peptides, HA, vitamin E and green tea. And just started using   couple weeks ago Naruko ampm  A40 pore minimizing complex that is 4% retinol. That one is pretty strong so I use tons of moisture layers before and after. I use that one twice a week. I never used retinol that was more than 1% so this might actually have some effect as the previous PC retinol and retinol booster never made me flake much.\n\nGinseng - Some ginseng products I incorporated are Hanyacho black ginseng bogam toner by Tonymoly and Sooyeran wild ginseng essence by Saem that is very thick, looks almost like honey but spreads well and its not sticky.  Also have sample of Sulwhasoo concentrated ginseng renewing cream EX  that I really like and consider getting more of the sample size because of the cost. \n\nVitamin C - I tried OST 20 but I'm back to western one Timeless with cerulic and vitamin E.  Not sticky at all. Also got Matrixyl 3000 from Timeless that I started to use before Vitamin C just a couple weeks ago, found it while researching more antiwrinkle stuff for my eyes. \n\nAcids - daily using cosrx blackhead power liquid and Mizon Aha 8% peeling serum. Once a week I use Paula's choice Resist 10% weekly treatment and (re)fresh 15%  fruit acid gel peel. Going to try PHA so I have Make P:rem pha serum, booster and night cream on the way, found great deal of all 3 for 58 USD on eBay. Also use Naruko mandelic acid masks. \n\nPropolis - I just finished Scinic propolis 95 ampoule and no I'm going to try Graymelin propolis 80. Nothing wrong with Scinic just want to experiment a bit. I also got the LJH  vita propolis but was shocked when I saw how tiny it is for the price so using only few drops with moisturizing emulsion. \n\nNiacinamid - the strongest I found is Paula's choice  Resist 10% niacinamide booster. You can add it to other stuff or just apply straight. Haven't started it yet as I have a lot of stuff with it right now. I'm using Manyo factory galactomyces niacin essence and Nature republic white vita flora capsule essence that has 5%. Also for brightening and dullness I use Naruko ampm skin immaculate duo that has 7% arbutin, 5% vitamin B3, 3% tranexamic acid. My skin looks brighter but since I'm using more than 1 product for that I can't tell what does what. I guess I will find out when I will stop using specific products.\n\nCeramides -  using dr. Jart  Ceramidin liquid, just finished Dynasty cream which I will repurchase later (have few new creams  mostly moisturizing for warm months waiting their turn), have Skin watchers ceramizing cream ready for next winter, I decided to wait to use till then as it might be heavier. \n\nAntioxidants - green tea I have Innisfree green tea serum about to start and Innisfree green tea sleeping pack that is great for moisturizing. And I really like Tonymoly chok chok green tea watery cream as moisturizer and Tonymoly black tea London classic eye cream. \n\n\nSnail - starting second bottle of Mizon snail repair intensive ampoule, using also alternatively with Benton Snail bee high content essence or lotion, when needed also steam cream. Basically there is always at least one step that contains snail. \n\nGreat for overall anti-aging properties - Freeset donkey milk 3D  moisture cream has NMFs, lipids, licorice and chaga mushroom as powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits and also niacinamide. Only been using for 3 weeks but already got two more backups for great price as I  love it. Also love Innisfree soybean energy cream, feels soft as butter. Soon will start Saem power ampoule anti wrinkle with black yeast ferment. Also got bifida ferment and beta glucan from Graymelin, Zymogen fermented soybean firming serum that has peptides, ferments and ceramide 3 and waiting for Innisfree ginger oil serum. For second eye cream I just added Peter Thomas Roth mega rich intensive anti-aging eye cream that has 4 peptides and ceramide. And two more serums I have been using  and are not AB (and got seconds of) are bareminerals skinlongevity serum and Hey honey, Good morning silk honey serum that also have sea buckthorn oil. I like to use 3-4 different serums at AM and PM so that's why I have so many. Skincare wardrobe all the way. I also use tons of hydrating layers that I'm not gonna mention here as I wanted to keep it mostly to anti-aging stuff that doesn't get mentioned as much.\n\nAgain I have no idea if any of this actually works for anti-aging but better be safe than sorry. I guess I will see in few years.",

        "body": "First of all, thank you for this post! I'm fairly new to AB but have also noticed that the majority of posts and raves are about preventing and helping with acne. And though some acne-related products help with my main concerns as well, it has still been a bit harder for me to find the right products. I mostly suffer from dryness, sensitivity, uneven skintone/redness, large pores in my nose and some wrinkles and discolorations from the first 31 years of my life when I didn't care about sunscreen that much... (I guess I thought that sun doesn't damage skin here in Scandinavia... well I was wrong.) I do get some occasional breakouts but those are so minor that I don't focus my skincare on them. \n&nbsp;\n\nIt's still too early for me to say what products tackle these problems most efficiently, but one product that I've noticed to help in almost all my concerns is the **Benton Snail Bee High Content sheet mask**. After I use it the wrinkles in my forehead look visibly smoother, it calms down the redness, evens out skin tone and really moisturizes well too.  Other masks with snail don't seem to do as much, so I guess my skin really likes the bee venom. I'm waiting for my Cosrx Advanced 96 Snail Mucin Power Essence to run out so I can try the Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence and see if that really works better.\n&nbsp;\n\nBtw, in addition to this sub I've got a lot of help from Gothamista's Youtube channel, because she talks a lot about brightening, anti-aging and moisturizing products. Some are way out of my budget though but then I scan the ingredients and try to find a cheaper product with similar ones to try out.",

So my routine focuses first on preventing acne (which it does VERY, VERY well), but secondly strongly on anti-aging. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't necessarily see those two things as being mutually exclusive.\n\nHere's what I use: Timeless Vitamin C, Hada Labo Gokujyun, The Ordinary Matrixyl (peptide serum for anti-aging), Japanese sunscreens, Clean and Clear persagel 10% BP, Paula's Choice Resist Intensive Wrinkle Repair Retinol serum, and Beauty of Joseon cream (I'm going to try switching this up soon just for fun).

The snail and honey are mostly for hydration, honey or propolis giving me major glow (tosowoong honey sheet masks). Cosrx snail cream essence is good as a layering moisturizer to counter redness and heal skin woes- my skin dislikes heavy moisturizers. Overall hydrated skin helps fight wrinkles.\n\nI've been using Manyo Factory's Galactomyces essence which also has niacinamide in it. That has been more effective at evening tone, improving texture than Cosrx's version. Just started introducing vitamin C into my routine a couple of months ago and haven't been using it on a consistent basis enough to know if it's helping. I assume it's a very slow process, as most anti-aging products are. SK-II FTE was also great at evening my skin tone and fighting dullness when I was still using it.\n\nI probably need to add in aha one day, but for now hydrating products do a great job at making my skin look younger. The effects I get from a honey or a hydrating snail mask a couple times a week are pretty crazy. And I'm not sure if this is a good way to buy products, but I start with various sheet masks with different \"active\" ingredients. I use that to find which ingredients might work best for my skin since sheet masks are usually cheap. From there I search for essences or serums with those ingredients.\n\nAlso, thanks for the info on the kiku toner, I've been considering it for a future purchase and have been on the fence.",

Snail is good for anti-aging too as it is highly moisturizing and hydration is very important for an anti-aging routine. I prefer mizon's ampoule and serum to Cosrx though, just because Cosrx products are very minimalist and the mizon products have more anti-aging ingredients in them. Though if you dislike sticky, then you should probably try the ampoule and not the serum. The serum can be a tiny bit sticky. But I use both.\n\nWhere do you buy the MUZ eye cream? I'm always looking for good eye creams. I'm currently using belif's peat miracle eye cream, which is lovely but it's always nice to try things.\n\nBenton's snail bee toner and essence might be something to look into. Though I suppose with the Kiku, you don't really need the toner but you might want to try the essence at least. \n\nI use Beauty of Joseon for my moisturizer. It's got a lot of lovely ingredients and works well for me. However, it IS quite sticky due to its very unusual texture. So maybe you might not like it. Many people use it at night only because of this (I use it both in the day and at night). And like others have said, you might want to check out Sulwhasoo products.

Rare beauty describes it as a jelly like lip oil that leaves behind a stain, which sounds like Asian beauty lip stains that have been around for a while. The rare beauty is also pretty expensive, it’s the same price as Dior lip oil per ounce. And, based on the ingredients, the Etude house has more butters and oils that are moisturizing and generally more expensive than jojoba oil and sunflower oil.",

The packaging is also just regular white plastic. It doesn’t even have retinol or anything active in it. People just pay for the name, not the actual product formula as it’s pretty much same if not worse than many drugstore formulas.\n\nSo with makeup it’s the same, although dupes tend to be cheaper in most cases, like ELF duping Charlotte Tilbury which I think they did a pretty good job on actually. \n\nCelebrity brands probably like to charge that bit more for the name, so Rare, Fenty, Kylie, REM etc. because they not only have regular makeup users but also their fans who will pay whatever. My friend is a Rihanna fan and buys fenty because of that, not for the actual product quality. I bet she wouldn’t bother if Rihanna wasn’t involved.",

I was over at r/tretinoin and saw a shared post on how sunblock inhibits blocks UV ([original thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tretinoin/comments/jf7k06/psa_this_is_how_important_spf_is/)). People were commenting on how the model in the video missed the neck, chest, and under eyes. And then I realized, \"wait a minute, I don't put sunscreen on my lips...\" Further wake-up via the thread on r/SkincareAddiction that unprotected lip can also lead to skin cancer ([thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8q4vvd/psa_remember_to_use_sunscreen_on_your_lips/)). Hence the search for AB lip product with SPF.\n\nI searched within AB for product suggestions on this topic but most of the discussion threads seemed to be from 4-5 years ago. So I went on to hunt for some Japanese AB lip care products with SPF. I'm here to share my findings!\n\n**Edit:** I've added to the product info whether if the company test on animal (cruelty-free)!! Fortunately, all five companies don't conduct the tests!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Things to note:**\n\n* I can't find a conclusive study or expert suggestions on how much SPF there should be for lip products ([doc here says \"15 or higher\"](https://www.prevention.com/beauty/skin-care/g26934681/best-lip-balm-with-spf/), [another says \"30 or above\"](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lip-balms-spf-protection)). I know SPF 30 is the rule of thumb for face and body, but I only found THREE products with AB lip care products with SPF 30 or higher in my search so far.

Low to medium porosity, medium to high density. My last haircut was about 7-8 months ago. Hair length is like middle of my back, past the shoulder but above the waist. My hair likes regular sulphate, silicone shampoos. I didn't enjoy sulphate free products.\n\n🌸 **Current haircare routine:** Minimalist Maleic Bond Repair Complex 05% Hair Serum x1 week before shampoo, I keep it on my hair for like an hour or so. I wash my hair 2x a week. My dandruff shampoo is fixed but regular use shampoo or conditioner is not fixed but I tend to stick to loreal or tresseme. I use hair serum either biolage 6 in 1 or loreal total repair 5.\n\n🌸 **Ingredients:** Capryl/Capric Triglycerides, Coconut Oil, Isoamyl Laurate, Pentylene Glycol, Maleic Acid, 4-t-Butylcyclohexanol, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Squalane, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Beta-Carotene, Cysteine, Leucine, Isoleucine, Phenylalanine, Arginine, Transglutaminase, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Tocopherol, Fragrance, BHT\n\n🌸 **Review:** I added this serum to my routine to help with hair breakage and split ends. I've been using the serum for little over 6 months now. I previously used 2 full pipet of serum but it was hard to wash off so much product and it ended up making my hair dry. So I use only 1 full pipet or sometimes just half pipet for mid to ends of my hair. Some people mentioned it caused itching on their palm but didn't happen with me. I always wash my hands well with soap after applying the serum cause it's oily.\n\nOn the day I use this, I feel like my hair becomes dry, I don't see the shine I used to and hair manageability is meh. I kind of reduced the frequency of this serum usage for the mentioned reasons. But I didn't stop using it cause I didn't wanna waste the money spent on it. Maybe dandruff shampoo was making my hair dry too, well I don't know.\n\nFast forward to today, I still feel the same on the day I use the serum but hair gets manageable with extra use of leave on serum. I colored my hair 3 times till now, at home but x2 with professional dye and x1 with box dye.I generally need to get a haircut in 5-6 months but this time I'm going 7 months+ without haircut. I've started seeing breakage (not split ends yet) at the very ends on few parts of my hair but I guess I can extend my \"no haircut\" for at least 1-2 months.\n\nIn conclusion, Minimalist hair serum didn't do much for frizz taming but it did help with hair breakage cause I was able to extend the duration between my haircuts. I included the serum in my routine for this purpose so yes, it worked for me. WRP",

I had a severe issue with breakage and split ends. It has significantly reduced breakage. My hair still falls. But it doesn't fall in bits like how breakage usually happens. \n2. I have curly hair, after coloring the curled part is straightened out and is not really curly. The bond repair serum hasn't done anything in that regard. \n3. I hate the texture. It becomes a film as soon as it comes in contact with hair. I'm not sure it spreads well too. \n4. The smell is too strong but something I can manage. \n5. Apparently bond repair stuff should be applied on fresh hair. So I plan to try it out next and see if that improves. And the minimalist website says u can keep it on for longer. I want to see this too. All these experiments because I can not afford olaplex or k18. Will people be interested in this? Lmk so I can seriously do it and report back.",

    "body": "I’ve been using these toners for the past month or so. I’ve been looking for a milky toner that works for my skin for a while now and Purito’s one was immediately of interest to me, but given how much I enjoy Isntree’s Yam Root Vegan Milk Cleanser, I thought I should try the toner from the same line as well. Other than meadowfoam seed oil and glycerin, they don’t have any ingredients in common, but they’re both hybrid oil-water toners and they’re both aimed at dry and/or sensitive skin. So, I thought it would be worthwhile comparing the two.\n\nMy skin type: Combination, sensitive skin which leans oilier (esp t-zone) in summer and dryer (esp cheeks) in winter. I’m also in the 40+ age range, so I guess I have mature skin (or heading towards mature). It’s currently Autumn/Fall here and it’s usually this time of year that my skin becomes extra sensitive so it was the right time to introduce this type of product into my routine.\n\nInitially, I used both toners and put Purito on one side of my face and Isntree on the other. By doing this, I noticed that Isntree is slightly oilier than Purito and while my skin was like a sponge when it came to absorbing the Purito toner, it took longer for the Isntree one to be absorbed. The finish is also quite different. On the Purito side, it felt very silky (I guess it’s well-named) while the Isntree side remained a little oily. I also noticed the Isntree side developing a bit of congestion, but I wasn’t prepared to write it off for that because that’s the side that I usually sleep on.\n\nNext, I used Purito on its own for two weeks. Totally satisfying! It’s soothing, lightweight and overall enjoyable to use. It smells pretty much exactly like oats which I don’t hate. I can definitely see this becoming a regular part of my routine.\n\nFinally, I’ve just completed a week of using Isntree on its own and yep congestion increased on both sides of my face and I didn’t like the finish much. In terms of smell, I didn’t really notice one, so that might work quite well for some folks. This might still be worthwhile for me to try again in the winter, but it’s definitely not working for me now.\n\n**Isntree Yam Root Vegan Milk Toner Ingredients:**\n\nYam Root Extract (80%), Butylene Glycol 1,2-hexanediol, Purified Water, Trehalose, Panthenol, Sunflower Seed Oil, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Sodium Surfactin, Ceramide NP, Cholesterol, Stearic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hibiscus Esculentus Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Root Extract, Undaria Pinnatifida Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Seed Extract, Avena Sativa (Oat) Meal Extract, Malt Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Disodium EDTA, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Sodium Polyacrylate, Citric Acid, Deoxyphytantriyl Palmitamide MEA, Glycine Max (Soybean) Seed Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract\n\n**Purito Oat-In Silky Toner Ingredients:**\n\nAvena Sativa (Oat) Seed Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Water, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Beta-Glucan\n\nIf I left anything out, or you want anything more specific on either product, please let me know.",

I was searching the sub for the cream reviews for future winter purchase and happened to end up here.\n\nSad to hear the Isntree Yam toner was giving you some congestion.  There are so many kinds of oil in this product so I can see this being a problem for me. Hopefully I'll fare better with the cream in the winter months.\n\nThe Purito toner wasnt really on my radar cause the cream seemed to fare better at calming and hydrating over the toner, but it was TOO nourishing. Your review is swaying me to get the toner now for the summer :) the oat and beta-glucan is nice and simple, and seems like I can really layer it on.",

    "body": "I posted this in the rave thread yesterday but thought I'd make it into its own post in case anyone was interested in the product. :)\n\nFor the past month I've been using the new cleansing oil from Burt's Bees. I feel like I've been using it long enough now to have developed an opinion on it, which is (YMMV): \n\n**Pros**:\n• It really does an awesome job removing makeup gently and feels so awesome on the skin. This is my first experience cleansing with any kind of oil and I have to say, I'm hooked. \n• It rinses cleanly with no oily residue left behind.\n• It's easy: just purchase and use. \n• Fragrance. It smells nice. \n\n\n**Possible Cons**:\n• Coconut oil. This isn't a con for me because my skin has never had a bad reaction to coconut oil but for those who do break out from it, be aware that it's in this. \n• Fragrance. It smells nice and I've had no issues with it, but if you are sensitive to fragrance it's something to keep in mind. \n• Price. $15.99 isn't tons of money and if you're not into DIYing a cleansing oil I would say it's totally fine, but if you don't mind mixing up your own, I don't know that this is worth it.\n\nAll in all, I have no complaints. It does what it claims to do well. I don't know if I'll be repurchasing after this is empty because I really enjoy concocting oil mixtures, so I'll probably just grab some cromollient sce and DIY a batch with oils I want to use. That said, I definitely don't regret this purchase because it really got me into using a cleansing oil in my routine and I'm loving that.\n\nEdit: **Ingredients!**\n\nIngredients: caprylic/capric triglyceride, crambe abyssinica seed oil, isoamyl laurate, polyglyceryl-2 sesquioleate, fragrance, polyglyceryl-2 caprate, argania spinosa kernel oil, cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, tocopherol",

    "body": "This is a pretty long review that I have been adding to and compiling for a long time, so please bear with me. Hair and climate details are:\n\n**Hair and scalp type:**\n\n3A/2C curls, very dry and course strands, low-porosity, silicone and protein sensitive, oily scalp. I am not sensitive to fragrance, and find the fragrance of these products very mild. However that might be different for other people.\n\n**Climatic conditions:**\n\nHot and Humid.\n\n**Age range:**\n\nTwenties.\n\n**Usage timeline:**\n\nThe Moisture Duo have been my favourite styling products for about two years now.\n\nThe Protein Duo was bought approximately a year ago and has been used intermittently for 6-8 months since then.\n\nThe Wash-Day products were also bought at around the same time, and I have regularly used the Cleansing Shampoo and the Conditioner every wash-day since.\n\n# ✨Wash-Day Bundle✨\n\n# 🔹Cleansing Shampoo\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua),Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Panthenol, Polyquaternium -7, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-73, Fragrance, Apple Cider Vinegar, Disodium EDTA, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Oil, Polyquaternium -10, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick gel that lathers into a thick foam.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit while massaging into hair, completely washes off on rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nIt is sulphate-free so it is only mildly cleansing. If you are not prone to a lot of build-up and don’t have dandruff, this is good enough. Does not strip off moisture from the hair strands and doesn’t dry out the scalp either. I use this as my regular shampoo and use a sulphate shampoo every once in a while to clarify any build-up since this shampoo isn’t enough for me.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nEven though this is a cleansing shampoo, the website clearly states that this is not a Clarifying Shampoo. They actively encourage using a sulphate shampoo if you are prone to build-up, which I thought was a refreshing change from the usual marketing of sulphate-free shampoos.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n## 🔹Everyday Moisturising Shampoo\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua) Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium -7, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Panthenol, Phospholipids (and) Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/Palmitate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-73, Cetrimonium Chloride, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Fragrance Polyquaternium -10, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Citrus Aurantium (Neroli) Oil\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Mild to no lather.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit while massaging into hair, completely washes off on rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nI did not like this shampoo at all. It didn’t clean my scalp well at all and the strands felt weirdly brittle after washing. It isn’t hydrating enough to use without following up with a conditioner. However, if I am going to be using a conditioner anyway, the additional step is pointless for me. It might work for someone who needs extremely mild cleansing, but it is not for me. I stopped using after 2-3 washes at most, and switched full-time to the cleansing shampoo alone. Though the fact that this shampoo has proteins might be contributing to my dislike of it.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n1/5. Will Not Repurchase.\n\n## 🔹Hydrating Deep Conditioner\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Quaternium-87, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Phospholipids, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Polyquaternium -7, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/​Palmitate, Polyquaternium-73, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Avena Sativa (Oats) Extract, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Tamanu Oil, Honey Extract, Goji Berries Oil, Taraktogenos Kurzii Seed Oil, Jojoba Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Oil, Disodium EDTA, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, Potassium Lauroyl Wheat Amino Acids, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Leptospermum Scoparium Branch/​Leaf Oil, Capryloyl Glycine, Cysteine\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Low to medium slip.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit even after rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis conditioner is protein-moisture balanced, and this is the max protein my hair will tolerate. It doesn’t have a lot of slip, so if you are someone who detangles with conditioner, this one might be difficult to detangle with. My hair is always dry, and it felt softer immediately on the first use with this. It does tend to make hair a little greasy afterwards. But after adding styling products, it works out for me so I don’t really mind the greasiness. I have also used it as a deep conditioner and kept it in my hair for 30 minutes and then washed off. It didn’t make much of a difference in comparison with leaving it in for 5 minutes like I usually do, so I didn’t bother to do that again.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nFMC says the conditioner can also be used as a leave-in conditioner, though I have never tried this myself, and do not plan to try either.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Protein Duo✨\n\n## 🔹Leave-in Cream\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Dicetyl Phosphate & Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Panthenol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-87, Polyquaternium -7, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/Palmitate, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acids, Sodium PCA, Hydrolysed Milk Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Cetrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Polyquaternium-68, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Ceramide, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Fragrance, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Tocopheryl Acetate, Potassium Lauroyl Wheat Amino Acids, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Leptospermum Scoparium Branch/Leaf Oil, Disodium EDTA, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, Taraktogenos Kurzii Seed Oil, Capryloyl Glycine\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Thins out a little on emulsifying.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHeavy fragrance that lasts for the whole day. This is the only FMC product whose fragrance is too much for me.\n\n**Review:**\n\nI purchased the Protein Duo when I was still experimenting and figuring out the needs of my hair. I very quickly realised that my hair is protein-sensitive and this cream does not work for me. Thankfully I had only bought the 50g travel pack. It is very protein-heavy, not very hydrating. If your hair is already healthy, this may work well. However for very dry hair, this will not provide enough moisture.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nI know now that the cream doesn’t work for me in regular usage. However I do keep the 50g tube around for the rare moisture-overload days to give my hair a little boost of protein. I only need a tiny amount for that purpose, so the tube is going to last me a very long time.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n1/5. Will Not Repurchase. Didn’t work for me, might work for someone else.\n\n## 🔹Defining Hair Gel\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Polyacrylate-2 Crosspolymer, Phospholipids (and) Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Polyquaternium -7, Polyquaternium-73, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Panthenol, Fragrance, Disodium EDTA\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nVery sticky, thick gel.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays for a few minutes, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis is a very strong-hold gel. It is a part of the Protein Duo, but it isn’t as protein-heavy as the leave-in cream. Even with my protein-sensitive hair, I was able to use it occasionally on days when I wanted some serious definition. If I used it 2-3 times consecutively, it caused protein-overload. Overall, a nice gel that gives pretty good definition and hold. I haven’t bought it again, though I might do so once my current hoard of gels is finished.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n3/5. May repurchase sometime.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Moisture Duo✨\n\n## 🔹Curl-Quenching Hair Butter\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract, Salvia Hispanica(Chia) Seed Extract, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-87, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Panthenol, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond Oil), Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Glycerin, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, PEG/​PPG-8/​3 Diisostearate, Astrocaryum Vulgare Kernel Oil, Tocopherol, Olea Europea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Euterpe Oleracea (Acai) Fruit Oil, Mauritia Flexuosa (Buriti) Fruit Oil, Fragrance, Polyquaternium-73\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick white cream. Emulsifies into a thinner non-sticky cream.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nMild fragrance that lingers around for a few hours, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis one is an extreme boost of hydration. It is a heavy product, and tends to make hair greasy if too much is used. Since my hair is very dry, this works really well to keep it considerably soft and frizz-free. It doesn’t help me a lot with definition though, I don’t feel my hair is more defined on the days I use this butter as opposed to some other leave-in cream (usually the green Arata styling cream). Since it is heavy, it might weigh down wavy or fine hair. But for tighter curl patterns and/or coarser drier hair, this is great.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nThe product label mentions that it can be used as a one and done styling product. But for better definition, I prefer always using the gelly with it.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased. \n\n## 🔹Curl-Quenching Flaxseed Gelly\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract, Sorbitol, Propanediol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Salvia Hispanica (Chia! Seed Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-73, Panthenol, Sodium Gluconate, Fragrance, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Vinegar\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThin to medium, non-sticky gel.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays for a few minutes, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis is protein-free and quite hydrating honestly. Has a lot of slip, so it is a nice experience to style. It doesn’t have a lot of hold. Curls last for a day or two maximum, and that is after all protective measures like a satin pillowcase, satin scrunchies, etc. If long-lasting curls are not a goal for you, and you don’t mind refreshing more frequently, I would highly recommend this. The Moisture Bundle would probably be my most highly recommended FMC products.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nThe product label mentions that it can be used as a one and done styling product. I do use it as my sole styler sometimes, and it works out fine.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Miscellaneous Notes About Fix My Curls✨\n\nFix My Curls website used to have the full ingredients list of their products on the product pages prominently displayed. However during their recent website update, they have replaced it with Key Ingredients. So, minus points for that from me.They do have a photo of the back label in the product images, which shows the ingredients, but I feel that is not good enough. I prefer having the ingredients easily accessible. \n\nThey always have some kind of sale, discount offers, freebie offers, etc on their website. A lot of Indian Curly Hair Influencers also have affiliate codes for FMC. If you are planning to buy anything, I’d recommend comparing prices from the official seller on Amazon and the website during sales. I would have included other platforms like Nykaa, Foxy, Purpple, etc, but they are pretty much always out of stock or very highly priced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ✨Frequently Asked Questions✨\n\n🔹How do I find my curl type/porosity?\n\nI used [this quiz](https://www.naturallycurly.com/quiz)!\n\n🔹How do I know whether my hair needs moisture or protein?\n\n[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/mzhv17/haircare_guide_to_proteinmoisture_balance/) might help.\n\n&#x200B;",

Thank you for the reviews.\n\nI've seen FMC go upto 35%off on kindlife & 30%off on their own website.\n\nEdit - I have fine 2a wavy hair, & medium porosity from what I can tell. I'm hair dumb tbh. I use FMC leave in cream, hair mousse & defining hair gel & quite like them as they don't weigh down my hair while making them soft enough. Provide moderate hold & don't make them look crunchy. \n\nI agree with your assessment that they don't provide much moisture. So sm1 with Frizzy or dry hair would need other more rich / moisturizing products.\n\nThe leave in cream & mousse are my more used products, I haven't quite figured out how to use the gel properly yet.",

    "body": "*Moisturisers seem to be the most boring and ignored category in a skincare regime but I have learnt over the years that they actually play the most important role. Sometimes actives are not what your skin is looking for and a good moisturiser can be the game-changer.*\n\n[Just a pic](https://preview.redd.it/p39fzjc4kx661.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=027cc219d95e8947525507a3beec33a9d459f961)\n\nBefore I review the products, these are my expectations from my moisturiser.\n\n1. ***Hydrate:*** Bring water/moisture to my skin\n2. ***Emolliate:*** Thanks to kindofstephen (google his blog or insta if you haven't) for providing a term to my feelings. Make my skin soft and supple by nourishing my stratum corneum with nourishing lipids without clogging my pores.\n3. ***Strengthen my barrier:*** To reduce TEWL by strengthening my barrier so that my skin stays hydrated and supple for longer. This also means I want the moisturiser to have slight occlusive properties.\n4. ***Repair:*** To help my damaged/sensitised skin by repairing my skin barrier.\n5. ***Extras/added benefits:*** Would like if the moisturiser additionally helps to deliver certain ingredients that help with targetted issues like ageing, hyperpigmentation etc. This is not a must though.\n\n\\---\n\n***1. Avene Skin Recover Cream -*** ₹*1500 (depends on discounts); Cost Per gm: ₹30/gm*\n\nThis is my go-to skin-emergency product. I do not use it on daily basis. The texture is cloudlike but not mousse-y. It is a lightweight cream. Nevertheless, it packs a punch. I have gone through 8+ tubes of this stuff. It is the only cream that does not aggravate any sensitised areas (burning/redness/dry patches/peeling patches) and absolutely calms my skin. This cream is true to its name. Repairs compromised flaking, sensitised skin in two days with twice/thrice a day usage. The ingredient list is very minimalistic. It is expensive and the sterile patented packaging kind of sucks because you will most definitely have face squirts if you are not careful. However, I can rely on this cream to fix my skin mistakes.\n\n* Hydrate: 4/5\n* Emmoliate: 4/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 4.5/5\n* Extras: 0/5\n* Status: HG, It is easily available in India but shit is expensive.\n\n***Perfect for: All skin types, Sensitive skin***\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene Aqua), Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Squalane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Serine, Carbomer, Tetrasodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, Water (Aqua)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***2. Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream -*** *$10/* ₹*1300 (with shipping/customs); Cost per gm* ₹6.5/gm\n\nI tried this product a month back and I am in love. This cream is perfectly balanced. It adequately hydrates and emolliates my skin. My skin feels supple and bouncy without being too greasy and the moisture lasts. I did not see noticeable calming benefits but as a moisturiser it is lovely. The tube is huge and a little goes a long way. This has a slight cooling effect when applied to the skin. Also uses a patented encapsulation delivery mechanism to delivery pseudo-ceramides (lab-made) which help to strengthen your skin barrier. In short, it is a simple no frill moisturiser that is easy to use - not too thick, not too thin, not too heavy, not too light, doesn't sensitize, not too silicone-y, doesn't pill, value for money.\n\n* Hydrate: 4/5\n* Emmoliate: 4/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 3.5/5\n* Extras: 0/5\n* Status: will repurchase.\n\n***Perfect for: All skin types***\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Stearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Palmitic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide Mea, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Magnolia Biondii Flower Extract, Cholesterol, Perilla Ocymoides Seed Extract, Lactobacillus/​Soybean Ferment Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohols, Glyceryl Caprylate, Dimethiconol, Mannitol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Alcohol, Acrylates/​Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polysorbate 20, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Propanediol*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***3. Eucerin Q10 Anti Wrinkle Face Cream -*** *$9*\n\nThis is my third tub of this cream. This cream is richer than any cream in the lot. It has a thick emollient texture without being too greasy. It absorbs easily in the skin. It also contains shea butter, SAP and Ubiquinone (Q10). This cream has helped me transition into tretinoin. Do not recommend it for day time use (especially in summers) but for night time/winters it is perfect. It keeps my face moisturised through the night and it has a soft blurring effect on fine lines/skin texture. It did not sensitize peeling skin but helped repair my barrier. I use this regularly at night and it helped to fix the acute dryness that comes with tretinoin. I use it around my eyes and it hasn't given me milia/ clogged my pores. My mom loves and swears by it. She finds it makes her wrinkles look softer.\n\n* Hydrate: 3.5/5\n* Emmoliate: 4.5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 4/5\n* Extras: 3/5\n* Status: HG but not readily available in India. Will stock up when relatives come post covid.\n\n***Perfect for:*** *Combo-dehydrated/Dry/ Mature skin*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Cocoate, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Stearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Octyldodecanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ubiquinone, Biotin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Zea Mays (Corn) Oil, Beta-Carotene, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Phenoxyethanol*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***4. Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume -*** ₹*1300 (with shipping/customs); Cost per gm* ₹6.5/gm\n\nThis cream is unique. As the name suggests it is a cream-balm hybrid but the texture is surprisingly lightweight. Highly emollient with occlusive properties. It absorbs quickly into the skin as the texture is not too heavy. Sadly, it leaves a greasy feeling/film on my skin. I can not use it the day time and worry that it will clog my pores if I use it on my face. I love it for the body especially my Sahara hands. It seriously brings life to my hands and I do not need to reapply often. I did notice a calming effect. Many of my friends from the community love to use it on their face. It is a little too heavy for my face. If your face is very dry, I think you may like this.\n\n* Hydrate: 3/5\n* Emmoliate: 5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 3.5/5\n* Extras: 0\n* Status: WNRP at least for my face.\n\n***Perfect for:***  *Extremely Dry Skin*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Aqua/​Water/​Eau, Glycerin, Paraffinum Liquidum /​ Mineral Oil /​ Huile Minerale, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Behenyl Alcohol, Sucrose Stearate, Canola /​ Canola Oil /​ Huile De Colza, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Pentylene Glycol, Beta-Sitosterol, Xylitol, Zinc Gluconate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Palmitamide Mea, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Rhamnose, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Phytosphingosine, Ceramide Np, Mannitol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide Ap, Cholesterol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Ceramide EOP*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***5. Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream -*** ₹2700 *(estimated); Cost per gm* ₹45/gm\n\nI was sort of disappointed with this product. It is not a bad product but it is not necessarily better. The soft blue colour deceives your mind to think the cream texture may be light. It is actually slightly thick with a silicone-y feel. It has a cooling effect on the skin when you first apply it which tricks the calming feeling. While it is hydrating when you first apply it but compared to others I feel the moisture does not last as long. Also, it makes the sensitised area skin sort of burn. The feeling is not intense but very much against claims. I did not notice any calming/repairing benefits. It may also not be enough moisturisation for the winters. The colour is aesthetically pleasing and silicone-y texture + cooling feel can outwit you into enjoying application but I do not see many real benefits.\n\n* Hydrate: 3/5\n* Emmoliate: 2.5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 3/5\n* Repair: 3/5\n* Extras: 1?\n* Status: WNRP, Expensive.\n\n***Perfect for:***  *Oily/ Combo Dehydrated Skin?*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Centella Asiatica Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Glyceryl Stearate, Stearic Acid, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Polysorbate 60, Bees Wax, Chlorphenesin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Morus Alba Root Extract, Tromethamine, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Guaiazulene, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Lecithin, Acetyl Glutamine, SH-Oligopeptide-1, SH-Oligopeptide-2, SH-Polypeptide-1, SH-Polypeptide-9, SH-Polypeptide-11, Bacillus/​Soybean/​Folic Acid Ferment Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol*\n\n&#x200B;",

    "body": "Winters means chilly winter winds, low humidity, dry indoor heat, lowered thirst, reduced perspiration, hot showers, friction from itchy - thick clothes and perpetual dryness. Winters means dryness & cracked lips for me.\n\n[LIPPSSSSS](https://preview.redd.it/5phvc72etx661.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8a379572e84286d26fce0b36539b61233412ec8)\n\nThe prime way to fix dry lips is to increase your water intake. Lips are an extension of the throat and if you tend to often lick your lips subconsciously, it is your body's indication that it needs more water. Take my advice, I don't listen to it anyway. It is not easy to increase your water intake overnight. I struggle with drinking an adequate amount of water. A good lip product is my saviour from Sahara lips.\n\nI am ranking these lip products in order of preference.\n\n***1. Bakson's Sunny Lip Balm - ₹40***\n\nThank you @ for introducing me to this small wonder.\n\nDon't be misguided by the packaging. This lip balm is much more than your basic vaseline; It's the vaseline killer. This inexpensive lip balm provides the ideal balance of moisturisation, emollience and occlusiveness. The ingredient list is stellar. This lip balm does not just sit on my lips and lock moisture, but it also conditions my lips. It glides on my lips in a thin layer and you can immediately feel it emollize my lips. It keeps my lips hydrated for longer. I definitely need to reapply during the day but it provides immediate comfort to dry and cracked lips. Within 2-3 days of religious use, my lips are completely healed. This is the perfect lip balm to throw - in your bathroom, car, pocket, bag, and at your *'Sun yaar lip balm denaa?'* friends.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Petrolatum, Lanolin Anhydrous, Shea Butter, Souabran Glycerides, Bees Wax, Almond Oil, Vitamin E, Distillates of Aloe vera & Calendula, B.H.T., Sorbic Acid, Perfume.*\n\nAdditional tip: Lanolin makes for a great nipple balm. It is prescribed to pregnant & lactating mothers. If you suffer from dry nipples, you can use this lip balm to perk 'em up to life.\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WRP**\n\n***2. Unpa Bubi Bubi Lip Ampule - $6***\n\nIt would be on the top of my list had its competitor not been 1/10th of its price. Its name can certainly raise eyebrows, but this one packs a punch. I was pleasantly surprised by this random buy. The texture is like honey, but it is not at all sticky or goopy. It is very comfortable to apply during the day or at night. It goes on in a thin layer and adheres well to your lips. It does not just stay put and form an occlusive barrier, but a part of it descends into my lips and makes my lips moisturised & naturally plump. It helps deeply condition my lips, repairing flaky and dry skin. I had recently cut my lip, and this one helped to repair my lips overnight. I feel I do not need to reapply during the day, and it keeps my lips hydrated through the night as well. Love the tube packaging. A little goes a long way with this one, and it truly gives me baby lips. I want to repurchase this again.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Diisostearyl Malate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Castor Oil Isostearate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Microcrystalline Wax, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Dehydroacetic Acid, Ceramide NP, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Water, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hyaluronic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter*\n\n**Rating: 4.5/5, WRP**\n\n***3.  Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula - with SPF 15 - Dark Chocolate & Mint ₹130***\n\nThis lip balm has the perfect shape for a lip balm in a stick & the texture is like that of a stick of butter. It does not have the typically waxy feeling. It is highly emollient and moisturising. SPF is an added benefit as lips also need sun protection to protect from ageing, especially if you are heading outside in the sun. Perfect for throwing in your purse. The smell and flavour are surprisingly nice. Ideal for all mint chocolate lovers out there. Even though it has some chemical filters, it doesn't have an unpleasant smell or aftertaste. I feel the need to reapply during the day, but it is an enjoyable feeling due to flavour and scent. Overall I quite enjoyed this lip balm. I will repurchase.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Dimethicone 1.5%, Octinoxate 7.5%, Oxybenzone 4.5%. Inactive ingredients: mineral oil (paraffinum liquidum), microcrystalline wax (cera microcristallina ), copernicia cerifera (carnauba) wax, theobroma cacao (cocoa) seed butter, fragrance (parfum), tocopherol, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, isopropyl myristate, beta carotenex0003(CI 40800), zea mays (corn) oil, benzyl alcohol.*\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WRP**\n\n***4. The Body Shop Strawberry Lip Balm ₹250***\n\nThis used to be one of my favourite lip balms before I tried the ones above it. There is a theme here. This lip balm too adds emollience to your lips. The artificial strawberry flavour and the smell are intense and quite enjoyable in my 15-year-old brain. This lip balm has been intended for your partner to enjoy. I'm not too fond of the pot packaging, but there is enough product here to last you months. The flavours are interesting and mood uplifting. Overall it is a nice lip balm but I won't be repurchasing it because I can get something similar in a better packaging for 1/5th the price.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax, Lanolin, Parfum, Cera Alba, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Silica \\[NANO\\], Tocopheryl Acetate, Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Ammonium Glycyrrhizate, Aroma, Fragaria Vesca Fruit Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Benzoate, BHT, CI 15850, CI 15850.*\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WNRP**\n\n***5. Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask - Choco Mint ₹1150***\n\nThis popular pick used to be my holy grail lip mask two years ago. This innovative product was one of the first of its descent and ahead of its time. Its thick and goopy texture catches eyeballs. This is my second tub of this product, and if you have tried one of these you know, this lasts a lifetime. Sadly, this queen has been dethroned by Bubi Bubi Lip Ampule. I do not find myself reaching for it anymore. My relationship with this product was like a young romance. I went in starry-eyed and fell fast for the bling, but now I find myself looking for more material suitors. The texture of this is very thick & goopy, but my issue with the product is that it never truly sinks in. It stays sticky, thick and wet on your lips and once you remove it (because it won't sink in), your lips won't feel much different than when you first put it on. The feeling on your lips is not particularly pleasant. This is why you cannot use it in the day. It is a good sleeping mask for the night if you put something underneath it as works well for locking in moisture. If you are curious to try this, I recommend getting a smaller sample size as that would last you 6 months and be more pocket friendly. The mint flavour quite nice and not overpowering. The tingle is not intense. I will not be repurchasing this.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Diisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl/Isostearyl/Cetyl/Stearyl/Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax/Cera Microcristallina/Cire Microcristalline, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Synthetic Wax, Ethylene/Propylene/Styrene Copolymer, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Mica, Butylene/Ethylene/Styrene Copolymer, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax/Candelilla Cera Hydrocarbons/Cire De Candelilla, Candelilla Wax Esters, Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax/Copernicia Cerifera Cera/Cire De Carnauba, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Blue 1 Lake (Ci 42090), Limonene, Yellow 10 Lake (Ci 47005), Water/Aqua/Eau, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Linalool, Potassium Alginate, Glycerin, Propanediol, BHT, Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus Seed Extract, Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Disodium Edta, Ascorbyl Glucoside*\n\n***Rating: 3/5, WNRP***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***RiRe Bubble Bubble Mask: - Bubbling mask that does nothing. DO NOT wish to review even. Total Gimmick. I fell for it. Waste of money. STAY AWAY.***",

I was told that it would extend the life of a semi-permanent hair colour... does it form a coating that wears away rather than the colour that's deposited?

If you’re mixing two things together you could maybe be providing a tone on tone shift but that also depends on what you’re mixing. All in all, if it is coming out of a tube as one product, no mixing required, it’s on the outside of your hair strand. The word “coating” makes it sound bad but it will absolutely fade away over time and as long as it’s designed to be on the hair by a reputable company with a trichology background, it will not “coat”.",

    "body": "So I've been testing this product over the past month, and since I haven't seen any other reviews of it I figured I would write one myself!\n\nI have combination skin with dry cheeks and an oily t-zone, and my skin is dehydrated from tret. I am very acne prone, and also very prone to PIH. I started using tret in november of last year, and had 5-6 weeks of purging consisting of cystic acne on both cheeks, which resulted in pretty bad PIH. My persistent acne has since cleared up, but I still get random spots that pop up here and there, and they usually end up in PIH regardless of whether or not I picked at it. For reference, here is my full routine:\n\nFANCL mild cleansing oil (PM)   \nCosrx low ph cleanser  \nEpiduo (AM)  \nCosrx bha liquid (PM)    \n.025% tretinoin (PM)  \nMissha FTE Intensive  \nMuji light toning water  \nNR white vita capsule essence    \nNR snail solution emulsion  \nCosrx honey sleeping pack  \n\nBoth the Missha FTE and the NR emulsion contain niacinamide, but they didn't make a significant difference in fading my PIH, which is why I decided to try out the capsule essence. For some reason, I can't find the product on the nature republic website right now, but when I last checked the site it states that the product contains 5% niacinamide! The product packaging also states 5%. The other products in the white vita line, if I remember correctly, contain 2%.  \n\n\n**Edited to add** Ingredients: Water, Niacinamide (5%), Methylpropanediol, Betaine, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Piper Methysticum Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Phellinus Linteus Extract, Articum Lappa Root Extract, Pancratium Maritimum Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract, Nymphaea Alba Flower Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Tranexamic Acid, Panthenol, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Gelatin, Carbomer, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Tromethamine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-51, Glycosyl Trehalose, Glycerin, Cellulose Gum, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Raffinose, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Disodium EDTA, Lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Calcium Alginate, Agar, Gellan Gum, Propanediol, Acetic Acid, Dipropylene Glycol, Lactic Acid, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Zinc PCA, Sodium Palmitoyl Proline, Inositol, Bisabolol, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate, Bioflavonoids, Ascorbic Acid, Tocopherol, Hesperidin, Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate  \n\nThe essence is a clear, slightly runny gel. You can see tiny bead-like capsules in the bottle, but they aren't so noticeable when you pump out the product and apply it. It sinks in quickly and provides light hydration. There is a slight tackiness after it absorbs, but it goes away after I apply the rest of my routine. The essence does contain fragrance, but the scent is surprisingly very subtle and clean. I barely notice it, unlike with the other NR products I've used. Also the essence came in a set with mini versions of the white vita toner and emulsion (I don't think NR sells the essence by itself, although some other online sellers might). Unfortunately they both contain alcohol, which I am sensitive to, so I couldn't test those.\n\nSo, does the essence work? For me, yes! I've noticed that over the past few weeks, my PIH is fading much faster than usual. The stubborn marks all over my cheeks have become noticeably lighter. Now that the PIH is finally going away, I barely need to use concealer for them. I haven't introduced any other products over the past month, so for now I'm attributing the improvement to this essence. I'm hoping this improvement continues, and if it does, this essence might find a permanent spot in my routine.\n",

Also, except the fact that they used too many extracts/fragrances,  they use pretty safe stuffs like pentylene glycol and methypropanediol for solvents. Betaine is a nice moisturizer, and sodium hyaluronate and Argan are also added. Even though negligible amount, Retinyl Palmitate & Vitamin C is there as well. This is a serum with excellent ingredients. Amazing!!\nAgain, Thanks for sharing!! I would definitely go online, and order it. \n\nLove, \n\nRandy",

    "body": "I had been wanting to try the old NR FTE for a long time, but it was discontinued earlier this year. Since I really liked the white vita capsule essence, I decided to take a chance on the white vita first essence after my Missha FTE intensive ran out. Since I haven't seen reviews for this product, I figured it would be good to post one myself.\n\nI have combination skin with dry cheeks and an oily t-zone, and my skin is extremely dehydrated. I am very acne prone, and also very prone to PIH. My main concerns are keeping my skin hydrated, fading PIH, decreasing redness, and acne prevention. For reference, here is my full routine:  \n\nFANCL mild cleansing oil (PM)  \nCosrx low ph cleanser  \nEpiduo (AM)  \nCosrx bha liquid (PM)  \n.025% tretinoin (PM)  \nNR white vita first essence  \nMuji light toning water  \nNR white vita capsule essence  \nNR snail solution emulsion  \nDr. Jart ceramidin cream    \n\nIngredients: Saccharomyces ferment (edited to add: 87.8%), methylpropanediol, propanediol, niacinamide (2%), betaine, phellinus linteus extract, articum lappa root extract, dioscorea japonica root extract, pancratium maritimum extract, nymphaea alba flower extract, olea europaea (olive) leaf extract, sodium hyaluronate, argania spinosa kernel oil, hydrogenated lecithin, 1,2-hexanediol, peg-40 hydrogenated castor oil, water, glycerin, sodium citrate, bifida ferment lysate, ethylhexylglycerin, citric acid, polyquaternium-51, glycosyl trehalose, hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, raffinose, biosaccharide gum-1, butylene glycol, lecithin, dipropylene glycol, sodium palmitoyl proline, bisabolol, acetic acid, lactic acid, dicaprylyl carbonate, ascorbyl glucoside, zinc pca, sucrose distearate, ceramide np, retinyl palmitate, bioflavonoids, ascorbic acid, tocopherol, hesperidin, fragrance, phenoxyethanol, potassium sorbate  \n\nTexture: The first essence is a runny liquid, but has a slight viscosity to it when compared to water. It isn't as runny as the Missha FTE. It sinks in well and provides light hydration, definitely more hydrating than the Missha. The first essence has the same light fragrance as the white vita capsule essence.  \n\nEffect: Glow! The NR first essence has given my skin much more glow than the Missha FTE did. In addition to the glow, the NR has helped with reducing PIH (the Missha had no effect on PIH). My white vita capsule essence was already doing a good job of lightening PIH, and using the first essence along with it has boosted the speed at which the PIH fades. I'm really glad I took a chance and tried the white vita first essence.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "**Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream**\n\nYay…I’m so happy to be back to writing reviews! The past couple of weeks have left me less than motivated to talk/write about skincare. But, I feel like finding a balance between keeping up with my interests/hobbies while also setting aside time to support the community will be best for me. Plus…looking at my spreadsheet and seeing so many products approaching the one month mark makes me anxious LOL! \n\nThe Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream is a product that so many people have suggested to me and raved about. This is a medium weight/thick cream style product that has a very slight “jelly” feel compared to other heavier night creams. Featured ingredients include Sodium Hyaluronate, Centella Asiatica (wow…writing that for the first time in weeks is nice), Shea Butter, Argan Oil, Jojoba Seed Oil, Lotus Flower Extract, and several Ceramides/Peptides. Blue Chamomile Extract is also featured here to really support calming/redness reduction. That ingredient is also what gives this product its light blue hue.\n\nApplication of this product is pretty straight forward…just slap it on LOL! The Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream applies/glides on fairly easily and absorbs well. In fact…for me it tended to absorb a little too well for my taste leading me to use a bit more per application than I had anticipated. The lack of added fragrance (including essential oils) here means that this product has a light “lotion” scent but really there isn’t much of a scent at all. \n\nOnce applied and absorbed…the Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream really impressed me with the light yet slightly dewy finish it left my skin. Even with the various oils and Shea Butter this product doesn’t feel greasy or leave a shiny residue. I kind of love the way my skin looks after using this product to the point that I could see myself using it in the AM if my skin was feeling particularly dry. This product really leaves my skin feeling nourished and hydrated.  \n\nAs for the calming/soothing benefit, that is where this product takes a bit of a stumble in my opinion (I know…GASP). While I do think the Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream provides a physical cooling effect upon application and some mild redness reduction…it wasn’t as impactful on my skin as it has been for so many others. It was a great support product (especially as I was adjusting to Tretinoin)…but I found myself relying much more on the I’m From Mugwort Essence and Mask as real soothing/redness reducing steps. \n\nThe Ceramides here along with the nourishing emollients are an excellent way to moisturize the skin and lock in hydration. There is no doubt that this product helped to keep my skin as happy and healthy as it could be while adjusting to Tretinoin and I’m so glad I decided two work it into my routine. But, those that are looking specifically for a calming/soothing product and aren’t as concerned with the other benefits may be left wanting more. Also, those that tend to go heavy with their night cream application (be it to quench dry skin or just as a personal preference) may burn through this product faster than anticipated. I was lucky enough to have both the 30ml and 60ml versions and I ended up having to crack open the 60ml before the month trial was up just to finish out the month.   \n \n\nWhen it comes to a recommendation…I don’t know if I can call this one a winner for me or point people to it. If calming/soothing are what you are after I would go for the I’m From Mugwort Essence and keep your moisturizer focused on hydration/nourishment. If Ceramides/Peptides are your jam this could be a good option…but keep an eye out for products that don’t have the Blue Chamomile (as they might be a bit more affordable). I have the Klairs Supple Preparation All-Over Lotion in my stash now and while it does not contain Peptides it does have Ceramides, Jojoba Oil, and Shea Butter. From what I remember it is about the same price as the 60ml Midnight Blue Calming Cream…but it comes in at 250ml. \n\nI’ll keep hunting for a moisturizer that perfectly marries soothing/calming with. nourishment…I just didn’t find the Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream to be it. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Water, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Centella Asiatica Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Glyceryl Stearate, Stearic Acid, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Polysorbate 60, Candelilla Cera, Chlorphenesin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Morus Alba Root Extract, Tromethamine, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Guaiazulene, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Lecithin, Acetyl Glutamine, sh-Oligopeptide-1, sh-Oligopeptide-2, sh-Polypeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-9, sh-Polypeptide-11, Bacillus/Soybean/Folic Acid Ferment Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\nWhere To Buy ($24.50 USD on Wishtrend for 30ml): [https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/midnight-blue-calming-cream/](https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/midnight-blue-calming-cream/)",

I know this wasn't a good idea and my skin reacted with irritation. I would describe my skin type as dry, very sensitive and a bit of acne prone (mostly on my chin). So after my skin was very irritated from the new products I wanted to start from the beginning, so I just use an oil cleanser and vaseline right now. \n\nThe oil cleanser is from a german drugstore brand. Here are the ingredients: \nHelianthus Annuus Hybrid Oil, Isopropyl Palmitate, Isopropyl Myristate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Tri-Isostearate, Ethylhexyl Stearate, Tocopherol, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil \n\nAnd after cleansing I put some vaseline on the dump skin.\n\nSo now my skin isn't dry anymore but I got a lot of closed comedones. Especially on the cheeks, under my eyes and on the forehead. It also itches on my cheeks. \n\nI know vaseline isn't actually comedogenic, but I don't know where else they could come from. They're more on the left side, so I thought maybe they're from my pillow or something but actually I'm sleeping more on my right side or on the back.\n\nI'm so frustrated right now because my skin was better when I did nothing and now I got a lot of great products and stuff and my skin is looking awful.\n\nPs: It's my first thread/post/whatever on reddit, so hi :)",

    "body": "Waitrose have a skin/hair care line called 'Pure' which is fragrance free, hypoallergenic, cruelty free and uses mostly 'naturally derived' ingredients, whatever that means. It's also really cheap, and regularly on offer. I know this isn't a hair care sub, but their shampoo and conditioners are fab, and extremely good value. The dry/damaged conditioner is how I make it up to my hair for bleaching it to all hell. \n\nAnyway, I got a few of the skincare products a few months ago when they were doing 3 for 2. They're now on 1/3 off, so I thought I'd post some mini-reviews. \n\nI would describe my skin as oily, somewhat congested, and quick to anger. It’s also probably somewhat dehydrated by bad office aircon and just, like, winter in general. \n\n**Waitrose Pure Hydration Hot Cloth Cleanser** RRP £5, currently £3.33\nhttps://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-pure-hydration-hot-cloth/508007-539993-539994\n\n**Ingredients:** Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Candelilla Cera, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, Vitis Vinifera Seed Oil, Oryza Sativa Powder, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Triticum Vulgare Germ Oil, Gossypium Herbaceum Seed Oil, Aqua, Tocopherol,  Lecithin, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Phytate\n\n**Verdict:** God, I wanted to like this. I love hot cloth cleansers, and this one was so simple and cheap - and it even comes with a cloth! However, the rice powder totally ruins it for me - using a face cloth is exfoliating enough, and I don’t want even a gentle scrub on my face. If you are super into scrubbing your face, this might be perfect - it’s not going to rip you to shreds like walnut shells, and it’s not illegal  and murderous like microbeads. \n\nI was very sad about this until I realised that what I did now have was a super-luxurious body scrub. I used it the other day - I spent a long time massaging it into dry skin before taking a hot shower and washing it all off with a sponge. Because the cleanser’s so rich, my skin was very soft and moisturised afterwards, and a couple of days later the patches of KP I had were almost gone. I might do it again next weekend - it’s not really a weekday type thing because rubbing it all in takes ages, washing it all off also takes ages, and they’re both kind of the point (it’s sort of like a soothing diy massage) so you don’t want to hurry it.\n\n**Waitrose Pure Hydration Facial Oil** RRP £5, currently £3.33\nhttps://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-pure-hydration-facial-oil/862289-541045-541046\n\n**Ingredients:** Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Vitis Vinifera Seed Oil, Shea Butter Ethyl Esters, Gossypium Herbaceum Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil,  Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Prunus Persica Kernel Oil, Tocopherol, Citric Acid\n\n**Verdict:** Blergh. I sometimes do really well with facial oils - I really love the Boots Botanics Organic one - but this was just a nope all round. Bar the absence of smell, it just feels like I rubbed coconut oil into my skin. I shine with a thin film of grease. I might try it on my hair, maybe? Or try doing the OCM with it? I will say this, the packaging’s nice - a lovely frosted glass bottle - so I suppose if nothing else I can empty it out and put other things into it. As you can see, I’m trying really hard to find positives here.\n\n**Waitrose Pure Hydration Day Cream SPF 15** RRP £5, currently £3.33\nhttps://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-pure-hydration-day-cream-spf-15/450717-539849-539850\n(It says ‘this product is unavailable’ but it’s definitely for sale in multiple shops.)\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua (Water), Zinc Oxide (Nano), Coco-caprylate/Caprate, Shea Butter Ethyl Esters, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Olivate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Sorbitan Olivate, Propanediol, Cetyl Alcohol, Simmondsia Chinesis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Titanium Dioxide (Nano), Phenoxyethanol, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Aluminum Stearate, Sodium Phytate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Isostearic Acid, Alumina, Methylpropanediol, Tocopherol, Sodium Hydroxide, Gossypium Herbaceum (Cotton) Seed Extract, Lecithin, Polyglyceryl-3 Disostearate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Glyceryl Stearate\n\n**Verdict:** Hell to the yeah. I really really love this moisturiser, and have just rebought it as I’m getting near the bottom of the jar and it’s on offer again. I think it’s just that my skin is a big fan of zinc oxide, since I find that Sudocrem also calms my skin down a whole bunch. It’s thick and creamy, and feels very protective against the winter wind, and it’s the only thing that seems capable of withstanding a day in the weird dry recirculated air in my office. It’s not every day you find a physical-only sunscreen for such a low price, either, even if it is only SPF15. There’s a slight whiteness as you rub it in, and people with darker skin tones might find it leaves a cast - I’m not sure, as I haven’t noticed one, but my underlying skin colour’s quite pale and so it’s not always visible on me. On days when I especially don’t care about ruining the SPF aspect (ie most days right now because it’s deepest winter and I’m barely leaving the house anyway) I will often mix in a bit of Sea Kelp Bioferment. \n\nThe Pure Natural line is even cheaper. In particular, I think it’s great that they offer some really basic thick face creams with no fragrance. I’m probably going to try out their SLS free face wash at some point.",

    "body": "I must admit, I bought this without giving it a lot of thought, as this was before I really began to do a lot of skincare and Asian beauty research.  But boy am I glad I did!  It’s also the first time I’ve ever used a cleansing balm and aside from pictures and descriptions, I didn’t really know what to expect!  So let's get to it!!\n\n---\n##**Packaging:**\n\n\nI really wish I took a picture of this thing before I started using it because it was so pretty!  Here’s what it looks like now after about a month of use:  http://imgur.com/defsUXI and  http://imgur.com/dTm3jSt\n\n\nEven though it comes in tub form, it provides a little spatula to keep it sanitized.  As you can see, I like to spatula only one side so I can still have a section that is un-touched and extremely smooth looking!! \n\n---\n##**Application:**\n\n\nI use this as the first cleanser in my double-cleanse routine at night, and the MRCS as my second.  The directions say to massage this product onto your face and then tissue it off.  I actually didn’t know these were the directions when I started using it so I always just washed it off instead of tissue-ing it off and it’s worked for me.  I only found out about the actual instructions later after reading skinandtonic’s review of the original lol.  I imagine tissue-ing it off would help with make-up removal immensely, but I haven’t tried (or needed to).\n\n---\n##**Smell:**\n\n\nThis cleanser doesn’t have any added fragrance (yay for you peeps with this sensitivity!), but it does have a faint, fresh floral scent.  I personally like it a lot!\n\n---\n##**Performance/Results:**\n\n\nOverall, this is one of my top cleansers; the Su:m37 MRCS is #1, and this is #2.  Compared to my old Shiseido White Lucent Cleansing Foam (which had a pH of 9.5, yikes!!), this cleansing balm is AMAZING.  It makes my face feel extremely soft and smooth after cleansing and I don’t get that dry, squeaky, tight feeling that I used to get with the Shiseido cleanser.  I think it might actually be slightly more moisturizing than the MRCS!  I have really dry skin in general, so this was a huge plus.  It also doesn’t leave behind any greasy residue like some cleansing oils or OCM can.  Finally, if you get it in your eyes, it doesn’t sting but it does blur your vision for a few minutes (I imagine this is because of the oil residue?).  It’s not really a problem for me, since I can wash it off after a few tries or I just use my MCRS right afterwards and it takes care of that issue.\n\n\nAs a make-up remover, I’d say it’s pretty good.  You may need a dedicated make-up remover for those really hard to remove make up though (I’m looking at you Kiss Me Mascara).\n\n---\n##**Ingredients:**\n\n\nThis is kind of the main reason I LOVE this cleanser so much!  It has a pretty damn rockstar ingredients list.  The full list can be found here: http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_4575161484.html \n\n\nI’ve included an analysis of some of the ingredients below.  It’s a massive wall of text, but the TL;DR is that they’re all pretty great. \n\n\n- *Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride:* This is the triglyceride fraction from coconut and is not the entire coconut oil, so it should be less comedogenic than straight-up coconut oil.  Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride has also been shown to be a non-irritating and non-sensitizing solvent, is an acceptable vehicle for topical applications [1], and is just a great overall moisturizer.  Additionally, it’s anti-inflammatory properties may actually reduce the risk of breakouts.  Finally, it has some occlusive properties to help resist water loss!\n\n\n- *Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil (Argan oil):* I don’t really need to go into this much, everyone knows about the moisturizing benefits of argan oil! It’s also got some medicinal uses against rheumatism and the healing of burns apparently.\n\n\n- *Oenothera Biennis Oil (evening primrose oil):* Evening primrose oil is rich in fatty acids, including linoleic (LA), oleic, and y-linolenic acids (GLA), that help repair the skin and improve the skin’s barrier function.  These fatty acids also have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, acne reducing and moisture retention properties!  However, it appears that evening primrose oil’s stabilizing effect on the stratum corneum barrier works only with a water-in-oil emulsion formulation (which I believe Banila Co. Clean It Zero Purity is, phew!) [2]. It also looks like it has some anti-irritant properties as well [3], so I have no idea why cosdna gives it an irritant rating of 2.  I imagine the anti-inflammatory properties should also make it more likely to help prevent acne instead of causing it, and LA is also supposedly very beneficial for acne-prone skin.  So again, not sure why cosdna rates it as 2 on acne.  Those that are acne prone, please let me know if evening primrose oil breaks you out.\n\n\n- *Portulaca oleracea extract (a type of succulent):* Seems to have wound healing properties [4], muscle relaxant properties [5], and analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. \n\n\n- *Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (Licorice root):* I think it’s pretty widely accepted that licorice root is an awesome active for skincare purposes.  It’s got anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and brightening properties!\n\n\n- *Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract (green tea):* Antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticarcinogenic properties!  Please note that most research seems to agree that green tea has potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties while applied topically; however, I’m not sure that the anti-carcinogenic properties are really that effective when used topically (compared to drinking it!).  There does seem to be some research that shows green tea extract can also prevent collagen breakdown and reduce UV damage to your skin [7 & 8].  \n\n\n- *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract:* Who doesn’t love aloe?\n\n\n- *Beta-Carotene:* good antioxidant/helps protect against sun damage [9 & 10], but this benefit is dose dependent!  Too much can actually generate oxidative damage (e.g. cell and tissue damage) [11].  I’m going to assume that because this is rather far down the ingredients list that it’s probably within the optimal amount to be beneficial.\n\n\nThe rest of the ingredients all look pretty solid, but I only had time to do a quick search on them. I don’t really see any “bad” ingredients.  Sources will be provided in comments since this post is already huge.\n\n\n---\n##**Overall Summary:**\n\n\n\nPros:\n\n- gentle and FAN-Freaking-TASTIC ingredients (unless you’re actually allergic to one or more of them…)\n\n- non-stripping\n\n- non-greasy\n\n- moisturizing \n\n- not messy \n\n\nCons:\n\n- a little pricey\n\n- I can’t figure out the pH of this thing because I don’t think pH strips work for this mostly oil based cleanser.  But that’s not really the fault of the cleanser…\n\n---\n**Would I recommend this product?**  Hellz-to-the-yeah!!\n\n\nThanks for reading, it's my first review post, hooray!\n\n\nEdit: argh how the hell do you format this thing?!\n",

    "body": "**Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream**\n\nYay…I’m so happy to be back to writing reviews! The past couple of weeks have left me less than motivated to talk/write about skincare. But, I feel like finding a balance between keeping up with my interests/hobbies while also setting aside time to support the community will be best for me. Plus…looking at my spreadsheet and seeing so many products approaching the one month mark makes me anxious LOL! \n\nThe Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream is a product that so many people have suggested to me and raved about. This is a medium weight/thick cream style product that has a very slight “jelly” feel compared to other heavier night creams. Featured ingredients include Sodium Hyaluronate, Centella Asiatica (wow…writing that for the first time in weeks is nice), Shea Butter, Argan Oil, Jojoba Seed Oil, Lotus Flower Extract, and several Ceramides/Peptides. Blue Chamomile Extract is also featured here to really support calming/redness reduction. That ingredient is also what gives this product its light blue hue.\n\nApplication of this product is pretty straight forward…just slap it on LOL! The Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream applies/glides on fairly easily and absorbs well. In fact…for me it tended to absorb a little too well for my taste leading me to use a bit more per application than I had anticipated. The lack of added fragrance (including essential oils) here means that this product has a light “lotion” scent but really there isn’t much of a scent at all. \n\nOnce applied and absorbed…the Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream really impressed me with the light yet slightly dewy finish it left my skin. Even with the various oils and Shea Butter this product doesn’t feel greasy or leave a shiny residue. I kind of love the way my skin looks after using this product to the point that I could see myself using it in the AM if my skin was feeling particularly dry. This product really leaves my skin feeling nourished and hydrated.  \n\nAs for the calming/soothing benefit, that is where this product takes a bit of a stumble in my opinion (I know…GASP). While I do think the Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream provides a physical cooling effect upon application and some mild redness reduction…it wasn’t as impactful on my skin as it has been for so many others. It was a great support product (especially as I was adjusting to Tretinoin)…but I found myself relying much more on the I’m From Mugwort Essence and Mask as real soothing/redness reducing steps. \n\nThe Ceramides here along with the nourishing emollients are an excellent way to moisturize the skin and lock in hydration. There is no doubt that this product helped to keep my skin as happy and healthy as it could be while adjusting to Tretinoin and I’m so glad I decided two work it into my routine. But, those that are looking specifically for a calming/soothing product and aren’t as concerned with the other benefits may be left wanting more. Also, those that tend to go heavy with their night cream application (be it to quench dry skin or just as a personal preference) may burn through this product faster than anticipated. I was lucky enough to have both the 30ml and 60ml versions and I ended up having to crack open the 60ml before the month trial was up just to finish out the month.   \n \n\nWhen it comes to a recommendation…I don’t know if I can call this one a winner for me or point people to it. If calming/soothing are what you are after I would go for the I’m From Mugwort Essence and keep your moisturizer focused on hydration/nourishment. If Ceramides/Peptides are your jam this could be a good option…but keep an eye out for products that don’t have the Blue Chamomile (as they might be a bit more affordable). I have the Klairs Supple Preparation All-Over Lotion in my stash now and while it does not contain Peptides it does have Ceramides, Jojoba Oil, and Shea Butter.

(This is not at all sponsored, I paid for my whole shipment, I just wanted to help others out who want to hear about it.)\n\nIt's a mineral sunscreen with 9.4% zinc oxide, unscented, and labeled as \"grease-free and no-clog\". Although I know some people were disappointed that it's not a chemical formula, it was exciting for me to see because my skin is sensitive and reacts to most chemical filters.\n\nThe formula is super lightweight, and rubs in completely clear. I have white but slightly tanned skin, and there is no white cast on my skin at all. (Although I can't vouch for how it would look on darker skin tones.) Personally I've never tried a mineral sunscreen that hasn't left at least a slight white cast on my skin - this one doesn't.\n\nThe formula is originally a bit tacky, but dries down comfortably matte after 1-2 minutes. It's not drying, nor greasy. I can't yet vouch for how well it protects my skin, or if my skin will break out from it, but it's the most comfortable mineral based sunscreen I've tried.\n\nIt's $14 for 1.4 oz, and here are the inactive ingredients: Water, Dimethicone, Propylene Glycol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Sorbitan Oleate Decylglucoside Crosspolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycerin, Squalane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter) Extract, Polyester-5, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Coco-Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohols, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Ethyl Ferulate, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Bisabolol, Sodium Chloride, Phospholipids, Gluconolactone, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Benzoate, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Urea, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nedit: I will say that the pump on the packaging is wonky, only really works at a very specific angle, which is a bit annoying. Although another bonus I forgot to mention, is that I can apply it close to my eyes without any irritation or stinging. ",

Today I decided to try the sunscreen again (hesitantly) and again after a few hours being home (roughly 8hrs after application) my face is red and effed up again...",

Their current offerings feature shaving soap, pre shave, post shave and beard care. The company’s name signifies the respect among gentlemen and their desire for personal care and quality. Each of their current scent offerings is named for a famous gentleman throughout human history. Gentleman’s Nod products can be sourced direct from their website.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nErnest, presumably named for Ernest Hemingway ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest\\_Hemingway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway)), is a bright scent based around tropical citrus. This scent features notes of: grapefruit, bergamot, lime, kumquat, green mango and tobacco flower. The accord opens with sharp, bright citrus notes and is complimented nicely by a light floral tobacco flower smell. This is a refreshing scent with mass appeal that is hard to be offended by. To me, it smells like your favorite citrus cereal from childhood. Mrs. Ruds surprised the hell out of me and really likes this scent a lot. Strength of scent is mid-strong out of the container and once lathered. Try That Soap ([https://trythatsoap.com/](https://trythatsoap.com/)) recommends Catie’s Bubbles Saturday Morning as a comparable scent profile. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGentleman’s Nod uses a non-tallow soap base consisting of the following ingredients: Aqua (Water), Garcinia Indica Seed (Kokum) Butter, Stearic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Orbignya Oleifera (Babassu) Seed Oil, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Fragrance, Sodium Lactate, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Citrate, Goat’s Milk, Raw Honey, Allantoin, Silk Amino Acids, Bentonite Clay, Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E), Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice. The soap is on the firmer side of mid firmness and loads mindlessly regardless of brush fiber of choice. This soap requires a normal amount of water and is very rewarding as it just continues to build lather with slow addition of water. When dialed in, the lather has a similar consistency to that of cool whip. Primary slickness of this soap is excellent and residual slickness is very good. Post shave is the real star and is among the elite in a crowded soap market. The face feel and protection this lather leaves behind is amazing. Gentleman’s Nod really hit a home run with this soap base and as such receives a ShaveScore of 93. For a similar performance experience I suggest Summer Break Soaps and Tallow + Steel.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Gentleman’s Nod Ernest (promotional gift)\n* Brush - ​Simpson’s Chubby 2 “Super” (gift)\n* Razor - Wade & Butcher “Buffalo” (gift)\n* Post - Gentleman’s Nod Ernest (promotional gift)",

    "body": "• There aren’t that many reviews of products by Bonajour online so I decided to make a review post. All of the products were purchased from Amazon through the official Bonajour seller. \n\n(Obviously not sponsored)\n\n1.) Coconut Oil Body Moisturizer (300 ML)\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Cetearyl Olivate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sorbitan Olivate, Pinus Densiflora Extract, Saussurea Involucrata Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Olivoyl Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Glyceryl Oleate, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Arginine, Carbomer, Fragrance, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n- Review: I’ve repurchased this body lotion multiple times already. The scent is so heavenly and it feels so good on my body. This moisturizer is lightweight but moisturizing. 5/5\n\n2.) Sensitive Skin Body Wash (500 ML)\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Disodium cocoamphodiacetate, Lauryl Glucoside, Propanediol, Sodium cocoyl glutamate, Sodium chloride, Glycerin, Centella Asiatica Extract, Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosmary) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Aniba Rosodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil, Octyldodecanol, Echium Plantagineum Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Butylene Glycol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hexylene glycol\n\n- Review: I love this body wash, I’ve purchased it 2 times and it lasts for a while too (even with daily use). It has a relaxing smell and it lathers well. I put this body wash on a Salux washcloth and the body wash doesn’t dry out my skin. 5/5\n\n3.) Mugwort Cream Calming Mask (1.9 fl. oz)\n\n- Ingredients: Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract(32.20%), Water, Kaolin, Butylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Bentonite, Sorbitan Olivate, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Apium Graveolens (Celery)Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Brassica Rapa (Turnip) Leaf Extract, Solanum Lycopersicum (Tomato) Fruit/Leaf/Stem Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Brassica OleraceaItalica (Broccoli) Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Cinnamomum Cassia Bark Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosmary) Leaf Extract, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Enantia Chlorantha (Bark) Extract, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pusatilla Koreana Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Citrusparadisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Octyldodecanol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant) Seed Oil, Oleanolic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder (4,000ppm), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Powder, Tocopherol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Artemisia Vulgaris Oil(500ppm), Sod\n\n- Review: I’m still going through my first purchase of this and it’s grown on me. Although I prefer the I’m From Mugwort Mask, this mask is skin calming too. I use mask this during my menstruation cycle (where my skin is more prone to having skin inflammation) and it felt very nice. I also like how the date when opened can be written on the product + it’s a cheaper mugwort product. 4/5\n\n4.) Propolis Serum (100 ML) \n\n- Ingredients: Propolis Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Water, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Cinnamomum Cassia Bark Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Ulmus Campestris (Elm) Bark Extract, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Gleditsia Australis Thorn Extract, Angelica Dahurica Root Extract, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Bletilla Striata Root Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Seed Extract, Trichosanthes Kirilowii Root Extract, Broussonetia Kazinoki Root Extract, Eugenia Caryophyllus (Clove) Flower Extract, Amomum Xanthioides Seed Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Sodium Carbomer, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Epigallocatechin Gallate\n\n- Review: I have mixed thoughts about this product. The price is really good especially for the size (100 ML). I would recommend this serum for oily skin types. This is more of a skin calming serum rather than a hydrating one. It did calm my face but did little for my acne. This product is also unscented. I didn’t repurchase the serum. 3/5 \n\n5.) Seaweed Lotion (150 ML) \n\n- Ingredients: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Butylene Glycol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Water, Sargassum Fulvellum Extract, Gelidium Cartilagineum Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycerin, Panthenol, Polyglutamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Allantoin, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n- Review: I also have mixed thoughts about this lotion. This product is unscented and the smell of the moisturizer doesn’t bother me. This is a very basic moisturizer. Sometimes this would make my face feel itchy but my face was dehydrated at the time I was using this. I wouldn’t repurchase it and am now using it as a hand lotion (which works). 3/5\n\n6.) Seaweed Skin Toner (150 ML)\n\n- Ingredients: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Water, Sargassum Fulvellum Extract, Gelidium Cartilagineum Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Phaseolus Radiatus Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Polyglutamic Acid, Panthenol, Allantoin, Betaine, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n- Review: This is a great toner but after I started using the Matsuyama Hadauru Moisturizing Infusion Balancing Lotion, I used this one less. I haven’t repurchased it. I also used it before applying lotion on my body (which feels nice and cooling). This is a lightweight toner that can easily be layered. This product is also unscented. 4/5",

None of these products were sponsored ~ I purchased them myself.   I do have affiliate and referral links but disclose in my blogs  &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n [Cleansing Review](\nhttps://beautyfindsforme.wordpress.com/2015/10/31/more-cleanser-reviews-cosrx-primary-raw-the-face-shop-doyouganic-cleansing-soap-plus-ciracle-revisited/)   &nbsp;&nbsp;\n  \n\n\n\n\nI did four cleansers in here ~ all with really LONG names:  The Face Shop Calming Seed Bubble Foam Cleanser, Primary Raw doyouganic cleanser soap, cosRX Low pH Good Morning Gel cleanser and a revisit with Ciracle Anti-Blemish Tea Tree Wash.  I also did a quick,unscientific comparison between cosRX & Ciracle as they are made by the same \"company\" - cosRX is the parent of Ciracle.  Lots of pictures plus how they performed    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n \n\n\n\n\n[Makeup cosRX Make Me Lovely Cream & A'Pieu Doramon EyeShadow Palette #1 My Daily](https://beautyfindsforme.wordpress.com/2015/10/27/instareview-cosrx-make-me-lovely-cream-apieu-doraemon-palette/)  \n\nswatches and all!    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nAlso, I've been reading here about requests on where to get unusual masks and hard to find masks ~ I subscribe to MaskGenie since day 1 (janaury of this year) and I have been so happy with this subscription service.  She ships directly from Hong Kong. I am not affiliated with her, nor do I make any money from mentioning her service.  These are unboxings, which means that I just give information about the masks, ingredients, and I might try one or two of them by the time I do the unboxing - if I do, then I mention the scent, texture, how it worked..\n\n\n* [October's MaskGenie Unboxing](https://beautyfindsforme.wordpress.com/2015/10/28/unboxing-october-2015-maskgenie/)\n\n* [See all of my MaskGenie Unboxings here](https://beautyfindsforme.wordpress.com/category/monthly-boxes/maskgenie-monthly-boxes/)     \n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n \nAnd finally ~ I will be reviewing this product more in depth on my blog by mid november, along with Innisfree Green Tea & Mint Hair Scaler and La’dor Perfect Hair Filler, but when I asked about this initially, there was interest in this product right away.  So, I will give you a quick rundown on Holika Holika Hair Rinsing \nVinegar From Nature  in Camellia    \n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nIngredients: Purified water, ethanol, vinegar, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, glycerin, Octyldodeceth-16, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Butylene Glycol, Cetrimonium Chloride, magnesium nitrate, magnesium chloride, Cyclohexasiloxane, silk amino acids, Ethylhexylglycerin, disodium EDTA, phenoxyethanol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, sodium benzoate , fragrance   \n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n \n\n \nI can assure you that this does not smell like vinegar at ALL!!  It smells like camellia flowers and it is not overpowering at all.  At first, when looking at the ingredient list, I thought this would be a conditioner, despite the name rinse.  However, it is a rinse ~ it is a watery product and I even put a spray pump on it, as I didn't want to waste it by pouring it into my hand (it is just like water).   I have to use a conditioner, this is not in replacement of one.  I use this product after I use a conditioner and this would be a detox product for my hair to remove build up and also bring shine back into my hair.  I don't think this would be a daily routine item for me, but every few days.   \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis is just an initial impression and hopefully, I will have more by mid November. \n\n",

Helmsman can be purchased direct from their site or on Amazon ([https://www.amazon.com/Helmsman-Mens-Shaving-Cream-Irritation/dp/B074W272LB/](https://www.amazon.com/Helmsman-Mens-Shaving-Cream-Irritation/dp/B074W272LB/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHelmsman Original Scent is a light, refreshing scent that smell similar to many modern mens soaps and grooming products. This pleasant scent is hard to distinguish individual notes from. In general it is refreshing, clean and crisp. This scent is a nice divergence from complex scents and as such, Mrs. Ruds is neutral on this one. She cannot really smell it once I rinse it away, making it a great user if you want your post shave product or fragrance of the day to dominate. Scent strength is light to mid out of the container and remains that way through the shave. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHelmsman brushless shave cream appears to be a vega based cream. Ingredients are listed as: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Purified Water, Stearic Acid, Sodium Methyl, Cocoyl Taurate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Decyl Glucoside, Glycerin, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Coco-Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Hamamelis Virginiana, Bark/Leaf/Twig Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Siloxanetriol Alginate, Caffeine, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Glycine Soja Germ Extract, Boswellia Carterii Resin Extract, Silybum Marianum Fruit Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract, Calophyllum Tacamahaca Seed Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Fruit Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Oleic Acid, Sodium Gluconate, Ceramide, Sodium Chloride and Citric Acid. Being a brushless cream, this cream can be applied with your hand or a brush but does not require water. Primary and residual slickness are good. I am able to buff without visible lather with no fear of the razor skipping or dragging. Post shave is also good. I am not left dry or tight once rinsed away. The ShaveScore for Helmsman Shave Cream is an 82. For similar performance I suggest you check out: Castle Forbes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Helmsman Shave Cream (promotional gift)\n* Brush - N/A\n* Razor - Rockwell 6S (purchased)\n* Post - Aqua Velva (purchased)",

Glow Oil SPF 50**\n\nI think out of all the Supergoop! products I picked up as part of this brand review...the Glow Oil SPF 50 had me most curious.\n\nWith Soybean, Grape Seed, Radish Seed, Meadowfoam, and Coconut Oils all in the formulation...I expected this oil to be nourishing yet heavy.\n\nBut, I was surprised with how well this “dry” style oil absorbs and applies (thanks Alcohol LOL). \n\nThis pump style mist oil doesn't dry down completely but I found it comfortable to wear in small amounts on my arms, legs, and chest. It also added a nice softness to my skin that I appreciated.\n\n“Small amount” you may be thinking? Yeah, this isn't something I would slather myself in for complete SPF protection.\n\nUsing the proper amount of this oil to get the SPF protection needed would leave me (and I assume most people) soaking in oil...no matter how well it absorbs.\n\nRather, this product ended up being a compliment to my lotion SPF to layer for a nice glow-y boost. \n\nJust a few sprays on the neck or wherever you like will not only add that boost in glow...but amp up the sun protection from whatever you are using as a base.\n\nI don’t think I will be using the Supergoop! Glow Oil very often, but once we are allowed to socialize and gather around a pool again...I could totally see myself applying some strategic sprays of this product to really shine! \n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nActive Ingredients: Avobenzone 3%, Homosalate 10%, Octisalate 5%, Octocrylene 10%\n\nInactive Ingredients: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Alcohol, Octyldodecanol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Polyester-8, Polyamide-3, Lauryl Lactate, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Diethylhexyl Syringylidenemalonate, Tocopherol, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Raphanus Sativus (Radish) Seed Oil, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Alaria Esculenta Extract, t-Butyl Alcohol, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Denatonium Benzoate, Citric Acid\n\nWhere To Buy (Supergoop!

Their current offerings feature shaving soap, pre shave, post shave and beard care. The company’s name signifies the respect among gentlemen and their desire for personal care and quality. Each of their current scent offerings is named for a famous gentleman throughout human history. Gentleman’s Nod products can be sourced direct from their website and at Maggard Razors ([http://www.maggardrazors.com/](http://www.maggardrazors.com/)) or West Coast Shaving (https://www.westcoastshaving.com/).\n\nGeorge is a darker masculine scent which features notes of cedarwood, tobacco, and cherry. It smells much like a pipe smoke fragrance, opening with a sweetness of cherry and a mellow tobacco. The cedarwood takes the scent to a smokey, dark finish. Fans of tobacco or smokey scents are sure to enjoy this. Mrs. Ruds gave this scent a “no-go”, which is not surprising given the heaviness of the cedarwood. Strength of scent is mid-strong off the puck and remains this way for the duration of the shave. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Soap Commander Influence as a similar scent profile.    \n\nGentleman’s Nod uses a non-tallow soap base consisting of the following ingredients: Aqua (Water), Garcinia Indica Seed (Kokum) Butter, Stearic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Orbignya Oleifera (Babassu) Seed Oil, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Fragrance, Sodium Lactate, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Citrate, Goat’s Milk, Raw Honey, Allantoin, Silk Amino Acids, Bentonite Clay, Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E), Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice. The soap is on the firmer side of mid firmness and loads mindlessly regardless of brush fiber of choice. This soap requires a normal amount of water and is very rewarding as it just continues to build lather with slow addition of water. When dialed in, the lather has a similar consistency to that of cool whip. Primary slickness of this soap is excellent and residual slickness is very good. Post shave is the real star and is among the elite in a crowded soap market. The face feel and protection this lather leaves behind is amazing. Gentleman’s Nod really hit a home run with this soap base and as such receives a ShaveScore of 93. For a similar performance experience I suggest Summer Break Soaps and Tallow + Steel.  \n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Gentleman’s Nod George (gift)\n* Brush - Maseto Shaving 30mm 2 Band (purchased)\n* Razor - Angelo Murro (loaner)\n* Post - Gentleman’s Nod George (gift)",

    "body": "Hi guys! I posted a few weeks ago when I noticed that a number of ebay sellers and RRS were now selling the Benton Steam Cream in a tube, instead of a tub. I ended up purchasing some Benton products, including the steam cream in the new packaging, so thought I would show you guys some [pictures](http://imgur.com/a/6DZsZ).\n\nIn my previous post, someone asked if the ingredients had changed at all. Now I have the tube in my hot little hands I can confirm that yes, there is one slight change and they seem to have added a couple of ingredients! I compared the ingredient list on my box to the list on \\u\\skinandtonics blog. I have tried to do some research on the new ingredients, however I am an engineer, not a chemist, so feel free to add and information or let me know if I've got something wrong! Apologies if you can't see the linked articles, I am accessing them from uni so am unsure whether they are visible everyone.\n\nChanges:\n\nTocopherol Acetate (instead of Tocopher Leaf Extract). Also known as vitamin E acetate - the ester form of acetic acid and tocopherol. Rates 0 for comedogenicity and 0 as an irritant on CosDNA.\n\nNew Ingredients:\n\nPlantago Asiatica Extract - Plantago Asiatica is also known as Chinese Plantain. For the extract CosDNA simply says \"skin conditioning\", but does not give it any rating. A quick literature search showed that polysaccharides extracted from the seeds of the plant displayed antioxidant properties, but less than that of ascorbic acid (vit C) - [link](http://gr2tq4rz9x.scholar.serialssolutions.com/?sid=google&auinit=JY&aulast=Yin&atitle=Chemical+characteristics+and+antioxidant+activities+of+polysaccharide+purified+from+the+seeds+of+Plantago+asiatica+L.&id=doi:10.1002/jsfa.3793&title=Journal+of+the+science+of+food+and+agriculture&volume=90&issue=2&date=2010&spage=210&issn=0022-5142)\n\n\nLaminaria Digitata Extract - Oarweek/Atlantic Kelp. Perhaps TMI but apparently can be placed inside the cervix to help expand the cervix before labour. Most of the literature on this is in the area of food science, not cosmetics, so I'm not sure what kind of benefits this extract would have. CosDNA simply says \"skin protecting\", and does not give a rating.\n\n\nDiospyros Kaki Leaf Extract - extract from the leaf of the Japanese Persimmon Tree. CosDNA says \"skin protecting, tonic\", whatever that means. Literature indicates it has antioxidant properties - [link](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691511003760) but appears to be more focussed on medicinal uses as opposed to cosmetic uses.\n\n\nHere is the full ingredients list:\nSnail secretion filtrate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Ceteryl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Niacinamide, Stearic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Phytosqualene, Human Oligopeptide-1, Bee Venom, Arbutin, Adenosine, Helianthus Annus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, Arginine, Carbomer, Urea, Tocopheryl Acetate, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Laminaria Digitata Extract, \nDiospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Ulmus Campestris (Elm) Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Zanrhoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract\n\n\nI hope this has been helpful! I purchased the steam cream, snail bee essence, aloe propolis gel and aloe bha toner from [blueprint21](http://www.ebay.com/usr/blueprint21?_trksid=p3984.m1439.l2754) on ebay, total cost approx NZD$64. Shipping was free, with tracking. I ordered on the 20th of March and my parcel arrived on the 1st of April. Pretty rapid shipping, especially to New Zealand! Happy customer here.\n\n",

I would love to use it morning *and* evening, but I'm concerned that it may be too occlusive to use under my chemical sunscreen (Biore Watery Essence). Thoughts? \n\nThe first two ingredients in the list make up 42% of the product, [according to the Banila Co website.](http://global.banilaco.com/Product/Detail/view/pid/2212/cid/540/spn/Miss-Flower-Mr.Honey-Cream)\n\n**Ingredients**: Honey extract, aureobasidium pullulans ferment, dipropylene glycol, dimethicone, cyclopentasilloxane, butylene glycol, glycerin, cetearyl alcohol, PCA dimethicone, niacinamide, glycereth-26, petrolatum, trisiloxane, glyceryl stearate SE, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, chrysanthellum indicum extract, plukenetia volubilis seed oil, argania spinosa kernel oil, olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, royal jelly extract, calendula officinalis flower extract, chamomilla recutita seed oil, pentylene glycol, dimethiconol, glyceryl stearate, PEG-100 stearate, ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP copolymer, PEG-150 distearate, water, raffinose, caprylyl glycol, dipotassium glycyrrhizate, adenosine, arginine, caprylic/capric triglyceride, octyldodecanol, hydrogenated coco-glycerides, sodium starch octenylsuccinate, maltodextrin, calcium pantothenate, hydrogenated lecithin, sodium ascorbyl phosphate, tocopheryl acetate, pyridoxine HCI, silica, xanthan gum, disodium EDTA, phenoxyethanol, fragrance, CI 19140\n\n**Edit: A random episode of The Beauty Brains podcast that I listened to in bed answered my question! They said occlusivity measures how well an ingredient keeps water from evaporating out of the skin (usually by being hydrophobic) but isn't really correlated with how well it prevents actives from penetrating into the skin as long as what you want to absorb is oil soluble. Alcohol is, and my sunscreen has a bunch of that, so I think I'm good!**",

    "body": "My hands always get dry in the winter, but this year I am taking a medication that acts as a vasoconstrictor and my already terrible circulation is struggling to get any liquid out to my extremities. Less tissue perfusion=drier skin. Even things that were reliable stand-bys while I was on Accutane (Eucerin, lanolin, keeping lotion within reach at all times) are no match for my winter Adderal hand dryness. So I have resorted to hand masking. It’s expensive IMO, even buying the cheaper hand masks and giving some side eye to $9 Sephora masks. But I’m desperate! I couldn't find many reviews for hand masks, so I thought I'd start offering mine. Here are little reviews of the four I have tried so far, from the most to least hydrating.    \nHere’s the TL; DR summary: the Absolute are the most moisturizing and the only one that isn’t scented like cheap grandma perfume, but the Smart Hand Milky Moisture are a bargain at half the price and the only ones with a built in adhesive tab to adjust them to your wrists. Tip: for ones without a built in sticky tab, you can use a hair tie around your wrist more easily than scotch taping once you are gloved.\n\n\n**Absolute New York Repair and Care Hand Mask in Tangerine**    \n**Purchased:** Hmart on sale for $3, regular price $4    \n**Ingredients:** Tangerine Water, Glycerin, PEG-8, Mineral Oil, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Sodium Hyaluronate, PEG-40 Stearate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Stearic Acid, Arbutin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Paraffin, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Triethanolamine, Tangerine Extract, Olive Fruit Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Lycium Chinese Fruit Extract, Thuja Orientalis Seed Extract, Soybean Seed Extract, Swertia Japonica Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Carbomer, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA Hand Mask – Rose Water, Glycerin, PEG-8, Mineral Oil, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Sodium Hyaluronate, PEG-40 Stearate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Stearic Acid, Arbutin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Paraffin, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Triethanolamine, Rose Extract, Olive Fruit Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Lycium Chinese Fruit Extract, Thuja Orientalis Seed Extract, Soybean Seed Extract, Swertia Japonica Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Carbomer, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA    \n**Thoughts:** This one has a strong tangerine scent, no surprise. I was worried the tangerine would be irritating, but it seemed fine. This mask was so effective at moisturizing my sad parched hand that it convinced me to try the others. My Hmart only had this version, but it comes in rose, green tea, and black pearl, all identical formulas except for the main extract and fragrance.\n\n**Repiel Smart Hand Mask Milky Moisture**     \n**Purchase:** Amazon, box of 10 for $20, even cheaper on ebay    \nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Urea, Glyceryl Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Propylene Glycol, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1.2-Hexanediol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Illicium Verum(Anise)Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Fragrance, Carbomer, Arginine, Milk Protein Extract, Goat Milk Extract, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Allantoin, Adenosine, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hyaluronate    \nThoughts: The standard scent for hand masks appears to be cheap grandma perfume: powdery, soapy floral smell. Except for the first tangerine one, these all smell like grandma in varying degrees. These ones have a medium strength scent that blessedly doesn’t linger. The essence in these is not quite as moisturizing as the Absolute ones, but it’s still good. Annoyingly, it’s not well distributed, at least in the box I got--it’s concentrated in the fingers but the thumb of the gloves doesn’t ever seem to have any, so I have to squish it down into the hand part and then squish my hand around in them for a minute to get the essence properly distributed. What I do like about these is that they have a built in adhesive tab at the wrist. So, after you get them on, you can easily tape them closed tight at the wrist to seal in that moisture goodness. At about half the price of the Absolute, it’s pretty easy to forgive the failings.\n\n**Skin Food Shea Butter Hand Mask**    \n**Purchased:** Ebay for around $3.50    \n**Ingredients:** Water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter Extract, Dimethicone, Butylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Glycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Cyclopentasiloxane, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Honey Extract, Milk Protein Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Arginine, Disodium Edta, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance    \n**Experience:** I was sooo disappointed that these smelled like grandma, because I expected a pleasant shea butter smell. They don’t smell like shea butter at all, and the moistuzing power is so-so. They also have alcohol pretty high in the ingredients list, which doesn’t impress me in skincare, and even less in something meant to moisturize. \n\n\n**The Face Shop Rich Hand V Special Care**    \n**Purchased:** Ebay for around $3.50    \n**Ingredients:** Water, dimethicone, butylene glycol, glycerin, caprylic/capric triglyceride, citrus paradis (grapefruit) extract, glyceryl sterate, peg-100 sterate, urea, cetearyl alcohol, alcohol, sorbitan sesquioleate, cyclopentasiloxane, sodium polyacrylate, acrylates/C10-20 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, hydrogenated polydecene, potassium hydroxide, dimethiconol, adenosine, trideceth-6, disodium edta, phenoxyethanol, fragrance    \n**Experience:** These have a much milder grandma scent than the others, further mitigated with a pleasant base note of shea or cocoa butter smell, which is weird since they don’t contain either. They were the juiciest feeling hand mask I tried, and I had high hopes for them. Unfortunately, they did virtually nothing. I was honestly amazed at how ineffectual these were for moisturizing, and I can only guess the difference between this and the other masks I tried is due to the dimethicone so high in the ingredients list and lack of more effective moisturizing oil, at least for my skin. \n",

Its featured ingredient is Tremella funciformis (white wood ear fungus), a traditional Chinese (I'm assuming Korean too but I'm Chinese where I first heard of it) ingredient for healthy skin (when eaten at least). It has a interesting botanicals notably Centella asiatica which has been very popular lately, and licorice root extract which is known for brightening. It also includes probiotics and humectants (glycerin, collagen, sodium hyaluronate) . I'm stocking up by getting myself another bottle so I would repurchase! But I haven't used it consistently enough to really discuss its effects on my skin.\n\ncaution if you can't tolerate niacinamide or are sensitive to plant extracts or fragrance citrus oils. I personally don't think it's heavily fragranced (scent not sensitivty)\n\nAdditional notes: IMO this is a great deal and better quality than a lot of western moisturizers (in the way that it doesn't have silicones). I'm looking at you Origins Night-a-mins. It's thinner than night-a-mins by a bit but also is less fragranced and has more humectants (glycerin, collagen, sodium hyaluronate) if you love plant extracts try it out\n\nIngredients:\nWATER, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII (SHEA) BUTTER, NIACINAMIDE, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, CENTELLA ASIATICA EXTRACT, FICUS CARICA (FIG) FRUIT EXTRACT, PHELLINUS LINTEUS EXTRACT, ARCTIUM LAPPA ROOT EXTRACT, PORIA COCOS SCLEROTIUM EXTRACT, EPILOBIUM ANGUSTIFOLIUM FLOWER/LEAF/STEM EXTRACT,PORTULACA OLERACEA EXTRACT, PUERARIA THUNBERGIANA ROOT EXTRACT, GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA (LICORICE) ROOT EXTRACT, PAEONIA LACTIFLORA ROOT EXTRACT,CNIDIUM OFFICINALE ROOT EXTRACT, LACTOBACILLUS/SOYBEAN FERMENT EXTRACT, DIOSCOREA JAPONICA ROOT EXTRACT, TREMELLA FUCIFORMIS (MUSHROOM) EXTRACT, SOLUBLE COLLAGEN, CITRUS AURANTIUM DULCIS (ORANGE) OIL, CITRUS LIMON (LEMON) FRUIT OIL, ARGANIA SPINOSA KERNEL OIL, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, CYMBOPOGON SCHOENANTHUS OIL, CITRUS AURANTIUM BERGAMIA (BERGAMOT) FRUIT OIL, CYMBOPOGON NARDUS (CITRONELLA) OIL, GERANIUM MACULATUM OIL, CARBOMER, TROMETHAMINE, XANTHAN GUM, BISABOLOL, ADENOSINE, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, CERAMIDE 3, SUCROSE DISTEARATE, PANTHENOL,FOLIC ACID,CHOLESTEROL, RAFFINOSE, PALMITOYL PENTAPEPTIDE-4\n\n",

It's sold in 60 mL bottles.\n\nYour emulsion, on the other hand, is sold in 100 mL bottles.  For about the same price point.\n\n/u/vanityrex just [raved](http://vanityrex.com/2015/10/22/neogen-dual-layer-ceramide-oil/) about a NEOGEN's ceramide oil (not the same, I know) but it's an essence/oil packed with a lot of goodness of both niacinamide and oils...and it's FIFTY mLs at a slightly lower price point.\n\nSO, I conclude with this - if you have a product that seems to have a lot of goodness in it, and mL for mL it seems to be CHEAPER than the two other ones I just listed, AND it works really well for you...?

There's a cleanser called \"Sham-Free Hair and Scalp Cleanser\" ($30 for 12oz.), a conditioner for all curl types called \"Terms and Conditions\" ($34 for 12 oz.) and a tone-correcting product for light-colored and grey hair called \"With or Without Hue\" ($36 for 12 oz.). I'm going to talk about the cleanser and the conditioner because I'm not very knowledgeable about tone correcting or color-treated hair. \n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\nSHAM-FREE: Aqua (Water/ Eau), Cetyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Chloride, Phyllanthus Emblica Fruit Extract, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Polyquaternium-7, Menthol, Selaginella Lepidophylla Extract, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Phyllostachis Bambusoides Leaf Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Oil, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone.\n\nTERMS & CONDITIONS: Aqua (Water/ Eau), Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Stearalkonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Selaginella Lepidophylla Extract, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Panthenol, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Phyllostachis Bambusoides Leaf Extract, Sodium PCA, Phyllanthus Emblica Fruit Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Oil, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone.\n\nI do think the ingredients look very promising. The conditioner seems to be great for curly and very curly hair but from the look of the INCI might weigh wavy hair down? Thoughts?\n\nPRICE:\nThese products are pretty expensive. DevaCurl products are usually around $25 for 12 oz. I suppose this is understandable because this is a one-woman enterprise. However, what doesn't help is the...\n\nSHIPPING:\nCurrently, the shipping is $9~ via USPS. Which is really a bummer because it bumps up the price of the already expensive products. However, it looks like curl-friendly salons might start selling them? Which would be helpful to at least those of us who live close to one. Or maybe curly girls who live in the same area could split the shipping among themselves?\n\nPACKAGING:\nThese products come in a soft plastic bag with a nozzle. These look cute but I don't know how easy they would be to use in the shower. For that price, maybe there should have at least been bottles?\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nI have been following Massey's updates about her line and am enthusiastic about the products. Just looking at the INCI I can tell they are very well formulated. However, the price might be prohibitive for quite a few of us.",

I have been using it for 6 years so I have become a bit of an expert. It now leaves my hair feeling heavy and my scalp itchy. Yes I have tried the baking soda cleanse. It doesn't help. I ordered Lorraine Massie new products last week. Curly world. I was excited to try them. Way too much money but I wanted to give it a shot. Unfortunately when my package arrived it was busted all through the box. I searched for a customer service phone number and couldn't find anything. I was finally able to call the company and was told someone would get back to me. They never did. So here I sit $80 later with half bags of product that I am afraid to use in the event that I have to send it back to get it replaced. So far I am not happy.",

There was a baby shampoo product we used to use that made the boys' coarse hair quite soft. I thought we had run out of that shampoo, but yesterday I found an unfinished bottle which I tried in my daughter's hair tonight. Brushing her hair, there was a 100% difference -- not only very soft, but almost no tangles, even though I use leave-in conditioner and co-wash frequently.   \n\n\nI'm hoping to find a comparable shampoo that I don't have to order online on the regular, so I'm trying to figure out what the particular ingredient(s) is/are that's working such wonders.   \n\n\nThis is the ingredient list that is working great:   \n\n\n>Aloe Barbadensis (Organic Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Water (Aqua), Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Citrus Reticulata (Mandarin or Tangerine) Peel Oil, Decyl Glucoside, Capryl Hydroxamic Acid, Glycerin, Caprylyl Glycol (Naturally Derived Preservative), Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5), Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil (ORGANIC), Ginkgo Biloba (ORGANIC) Extract, Calendula Officinalis (ORGANIC Marigold) Flower Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Prunus Persica (Peach) Fruit Extract, Prunus Domestica Fruit (Plum) Oil, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Citric Acid (Naturally Derived)    \n\n\n  \nThis is the conditioner I was using on my daughter which is, apparently, only okay:   \n\n\n>Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter\\*♥, Glyceryl Caprylate, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Macrocystis Pyrifera (Kelp) Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Silk, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Sodium lsostearoyl Lactylate, Sodium Benzoate, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Glyceryl Undecylenate, Fragrance (Essential Oil Blend)  \n\n\nAny thoughts?

Also, I live in NYC, so I'm constantly out in the elements all day. But it's \"sensitive\" in that if I try a product my skin doesn't like, it gets angry by getting red and stinging, not by breaking out. I've been a lucky, lucky lady for my 28 years on this planet: I very. very rarely get acne. /ducks from shit being flung at her\n\nSo the scent was nice and pleasant, and there was loads of sticky, rather slimy essence. Yay! Mask fit fine - but tbf, I have a big head, so it's not hard to get a mask to fit me. Plus, as I noted in my last review, mask fit and texture really aren't that important to me, so if they are to you, YMMV, etc etc. It seemed very nicely moisturizing.\n\nBut this morning I had SEVERAL ZITS, AIIEEEEEEE! Are they from the mask? I don't know. I really don't. But it turns out jojoba and coconut oil are included in the ingredients, and I've long suspected my skin to not be overly fond of either of them. But I'd have a better idea if I bought a few more of these to try, tbh. \n\nAll in all, this is a great mask, especially for winter, and I'd definitely try it again, but if you're sensitive to coconut or jojoba oil, I'd perhaps proceed with caution.",

I followed the instructions on order since it was the first time trying this brand. The milk and serum felt good and there was plenty to put a thick coat on my face. The sheet material was soft and the essence a bit slimy - seems we got slimy masks this month! I used this after my bha and found it really soothing. I had a bit of tingling when first applying it, but that happens sometimes when my skin is extra dry. It lasted about 45 minutes for me and was a bit sticky. I enjoyed it a lot, but did get some cc and a couple tiny pimples in the days following. My skin does this often without prompting and I did use a bha the same night, so I'm not ready to blame the mask just yet. I'll wait a while and try out another one. They sounded so lovely I bought a whole box...\n\n\n**February**\n\n\nI'll be doing the Lovemore, Evercos, and Tsaio myself. I'll also brew some peppermint and liquorice tea one night to really get into the spirit ;)\n\n\n**March**\n\n\nSounds like the Dearpacker mask is a popular request. I also want to try these, so I'd be happy to do a group haul for the US again. The Illi masks are also available on koreadepart, so while I won't be trying it I'd be happy to order some together with the Dearpacker masks.\n\nThe Blossom Jeju masks are $25 for a set of 5 on Glow Recipe, so I plan to buy one box. If there are enough requests I can buy a second, but given the price I want to make sure I get a good count of who wants to group haul and which masks they want. I can do the same with the Leaders (looks like Ulta has the best price at $4.20) or any other mask the group decides on. Let me know!",

The scent is a good balance between smelling like honey vs overpoweringly sweet. I do the steps out of order, ampoule, mask, then cream. The cream isn't very heavy, more like an emulsion or lotion style moisturizer, so it might not be enough for someone with drier skin than I. The mask is super soft, slightly fiddly to open as there's no extra plastic to separate the folds (which I appreciate since I realize my love of sheet masks already creates a lot of waste) and stays wet for a while. The ampoule is... an ampoule. There's a generous amount in each pocket, easily enough to cover my neck and decolletage. I feel like my skin does pick up a bit of a glow for the next morning although it wears off by the end of day. Alright, falling asleep. Hope you all enjoyed the mask!\n\nETA: one *tiny* thing that bothers me about this mask is that the packaging doesn't tear open \"cleanly\".  It's more like pulling a plastic bag until it gives than like opening a candy bar if that makes any sense.",

I shaved the underside and deep conditioned with every wash it because it was all broken off, started washing my hair less (once every 3 or 4 days now), stopped using heat products, get haircuts every 8-10 weeks, and  tried buying better shampoos/conditioners for my hair.\n\n\nAt that time, I bought an olive oil shampoo/conditioner pair from Regis Designline and it seemed to work well. I've used it for a year now and my hair seems tired of it, so I tried purchasing some new ones after asking my hair dresser for a suggestion. I've tried Healthy Sexy Hair Soy Moisturizing Shampoo ( which is supposedly sulfate free and has argon oil in it) and also Paul Mitchell's Super Skinny line. Healthy Sexy Hair made my hair feel strawlike and Paul Mitchell's made it oily within a day, and feels almost waxy when it's drying. \n\n\nI've never dyed or permed my hair and have med-course and straight-wavy hair. I'm half Cambodian, half white, so I'm wondering if my hair chemistry is different from what they make products for. When doing at home masks, my hair seems to like olive oil. Since trying these shampoos, my hair has gotten frizzier, I've noticed new split ends that weren't there before, and is more tangled.

There are lots of wavy girls over there that could help you out.  \n\n\nEdit: I forgot to say to keep away from sulfates and silicones for sure. Sulfates are harsh and damaging. Silicones coat your hair and keep moisture from it, and without heavy cleaners like Sulfates, silicones cause gross build up on your hair.",

    "body": "Hair Care History:  \nI have been using low-sulfate silicone-free shower gels as shampoo for a couple of months already while not using any conditioner. I only restarted using conditioner last Tuesday, because I finally found a 'cone-free conditioner. I can go almost a week without needing to wash my hair, is that a good sign?   \nMy sister has been using high-sulfate shampoos containing a bunch of 'cones, occasionally shampoos containing keratin as well, and accompanying conditioners. I think she might need a few more shampoo washes to get out all of the build-up out of her hair, but I'd love some advice here!  \n  \nHair Properties:  \nI was born with a full head of wavy/soft curl hair and have had waves and/or brushed out curls ever since my hair was long enough to be brushed. I always thought my hair was super frizzy, because it looked so unkempt after all the brushing I did. I found a kind of routine to keep it manageable: brushing while it was still damp after a shower would help form flatter and larger waves, so it would stay closer to my head.  \nI think my curl pattern right now is about 2b, but I think I might have some 2c potential, looking at some of my new-found curls. My hair is somewhere between medium and fine. The strands are somewhat thin, but they aren't brittle and my hair holds shape pretty well if I don't mess with it. I don't think it's very porous. I did the [Slip'n'Slide test](http://www.naturallycurly.com/texture-typing/hair-porosity) and that went about as smoothly going up as going down. My hair is medium-long, going a bit past shoulder length.  \nMy sister was born with curly hair, but has lost those curls by constantly brushing them out. She has what I think are a lot of flyaways on the top of her head, probably in part caused by curl-unfriendly hair cutting techniques. My sister has had her hair thinned out in the past, which I think is mostly cutting certain strands of hair shorter than others with the goal to remove volume. But I think in her case it had an opposite effect, the shortest hairs have the most curl and now they stand away from her head. What kind of styling product would she need to deal with these flyaways? There could also be some frizz involved.  \nMy sister's curl pattern is closer to 3a/b if you give her hair a chance to curl. Before CG it looked more like 2a. Her hair likes to form medium-sized ringlets. I think her hair is somewhat coarse, it is very thick and she has a lot of hair. Her hair holds shape better than mine, if she twists her hair into a ringlet with her fingers it will stay in that shape for hours. Her hair is very long, slightly past bra band length. Her hair feels more porous than mine doing the same test, but I’m not sure how to distinguish between medium and high porosity. Her hair is very dry. She has a lot of split ends and is probably in desperate need of a hair cut, but I'm not sure if that's wise to do now that we're adjusting our routines. Advice?  \n  \nCurrent Routine:  \n*Shampoo * : Sanex Advanced Dermo Repair (this is technically a shower gel)  \nIngredients: Aqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Coco-Glucoside, Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Sodium Chloride, Glyceryl Oleate, Parfum, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Salicylate, Polyquaternium-7, Allantoin, Caprylyl Glycol, Zinc Sulfate, Benzoic Acid.   \n*Conditioner * : Argan Care conditioner  \nIngredients: Aqua, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Parfum, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Citric Acid, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Magnesium Nitrate, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool.  \nI’m planning on running all these ingredients through the ingredient list of Tightly Curly, but if there’s something in these products that shouldn’t be in our hair, please let me know!  \n  \nWe used these products on Tuesday, combed our hair with a wide tooth comb after applying a lot of conditioner. Afterwards plopping it with a T-shirt and sleeping with our hair up in pineapple.  \n  \nI have also attempted  a deep treatment using 100% pure coconut oil on Wednesday. After application with a hair paint brush (is there a specific name for these things?) we let it sit under a shower cap and towel for an hour, then applied a bunch of conditioner and combed it through. Then rinsing it out in the shower using shampoo and conditioner, combed again. My sister plopped for 30-60 minutes, I think? And slept with a pineapple. I showered really late, so I slept with T-shirt plopping overnight (only 6,5 hours of sleep).  \n  \nResults?:  \nIt’s kinda hard to say what product did what, but this method is really working for me so far. Having curls is an immediate boost of confidence for me, because it feels like my hair is finally starting to look how it’s supposed to look. The problem is that I’m constantly playing with my curls. I’ll twist them around my fingers, or pull on them to see them bounce. I think I lost quite some definition today because of this. Is there any way to get some of this definition back for second-day curls? Would it help if I scrunch in some water and/or conditioner and/or coconut oil?  \nMy sister had some mixed results. She has more wavish curls, but her hair came out very greasy on Thursday morning. I think she might not have rinsed everything out properly (long hair is a lot of hair), but I was also thinking about some other causes: Is this because of previous buildup? Should she attempt co-washing about every other day until it improves? It seems that washing with the shampoo could be a little harsh to do it so often, but it might be more effective?  \n  \nI would also like to have some advice on dealing with the weather. We live in the Netherlands and basically go everywhere by bicycle, so our hair is exposed to rain, fog and humidity quite often. My hair will attract the moisture and frizz. I’m not sure how much my sister’s hair is affected by it, because I find it difficult to distinguish frizz from curly flyaways. Are there any styling products we could use to help deal with this?  \n  \n[Pics!]( http://imgur.com/a/8Rnpj)  \n  \nAnd my final question!: How are we doing so far?  \n  \nTL;DR: Just started CG.  \nMy hair: medium-long, medium-fine, low-porosity, 2b-ish curls. How can I hold on to curl definition for 2nd day curls or bring the definition back? How can I combat weather-induced frizz?  \nMy sister’s hair: long and thick, coarse, more porous, 3a/b? curls. Only recently stopped using silicones and sulfates, how to ease the transition. Possibly still has some build-up, attempt co-washing more often? Has a lot of flyaways and probably also some frizz, advice on styling product? Needs a haircut, do it now or wait for routine to set in?  \nWe live in the Netherlands and this will influence product options available to us.  \n  \nSorry for the long post, I just wanted to share my excitement!",

        "body": "I agree with the previous poster, shower gel isn't shampoo, and it has a very harsh sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate. You should probably invest in a few restorative products, like a deep conditioner and protein treatment. Also, be careful with oils. They can be a wonderful thing, but can easily weigh down your hair, especially if you're low-porosity. \n\nFrizz has always been a problem of mine, and there's not that much to do other than use products based on dew points(Link in sidebar) and use gel. \n\nWhen you're just starting out, it will take time for your hair to adjust. I know this seems like a lot of terminology and work, but just keep trying new things, read the posts on naturallycurly.com and you'll get the hang of it in no time.",

    "body": "Hey all! Looks like the sub is still going strong and doing well- I'm glad! :) I disappeared after having twins. They are 2.5 years old and although this stage is not as hard as the infant stage, it is still all-consuming(and I love it).   \n\n\nSo I'm popping back in to do a quick update on my hair. I was a faithful user of TRESemme Naturals Radiant Volume conditioner as my leave-in with LA Looks Sport Gel or Spikes Gel on top. When I heard that TRESemmme was getting rid of their Naturals line, I bought out every bottle I could find. Well, now I've run out. :(  The testing of various products shall commence immediately. (If you just want to see what I'm using now for my porous and fine 3a/b hair, skip to the end. Sorry this is long!!)  \n\n\nHoping to have success with the same line, I bought **TRESemme's Botanique Nourish and Replenish Conditioner**, but it was just too thick.  I didn't like how when I styled a gel on top of that conditioner, the conditioner just felt like it was falling out of my hair instead of soaking in. On to something else.... Price: $4.99\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI saw a review for **Not your Mother's Naturals Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter Curl Defining Conditioner** comparing it to the Yes to Carrots Pampering conditioner(discontinued and another favorite) so I got that! It was alright, but definitely not comparable to the YTC Pampering conditioner. Price: $8.99\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy lovely husband decided to get me various Miss Jessie's products for my birthday to try. Man, those are expensive!  Unfortunately, none of those worked for my hair either!! They were all very expensive and tended to have too much glycerin in them, leaving my hair a frizzy mess in the humid summer months. I tried **Jelly Soft Curls, Pillow Soft Curls, Curly Meringue,** and **Multi-Cultural Curls**.  Knowing that I like a stronger hold gel, I figured that I wouldn't like the first two(correct), but thought the other two might work. I didn't mind the Multi-Cultural Curls, but the meringue was a fail. STILL just not what I was looking for.  I ended up giving all of the products to my friend with low porosity waves. She likes them. :) Price: $14(Jelly soft), $22(Pillow soft), $16(Meringue), $16 (Multi-cultural Curls)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI kept seeing advertisements on my FB for **LUS Brands 3-in-1 Curly styler** and although it is expensive, I bought only the styler. Major fail for me.  Many curlies love this stuff but for anyone with high porosity hair, it's too much glycerin(it's the third ingredient!!!)  It offered no hold for me and didn't really enhance my curls. I gave it five days, tried styling it many ways that they suggested, and it just never worked. :( So sad.  Price: $18 online only\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen I found it.  My replacement. **Love Beauty & Planet Argan Oil & Lavender Smooth and Serene Conditioner**.  Friends, this conditioner is amazing.  I picked it up because it was new, I love lavender, and I saw \"no silicones\" on the bottle.  I can use a small amount of this conditioner and it feels like it soaks into my hair and is light BUT moisturizing.  I put my LA Looks Spikes Gel on top, scrunch and let it dry on it's own. This stuff controls my frizz like nothing else! It's been absolutely wonderful.  My hair feels conditioned but not overly soft(I know you know what I mean by that).  I just wish it was a bit cheaper, but I'm happy to support a company that is going for more natural products and has recycled bottles.  Honestly, I like how this works with my hair BETTER than my TRESemme Naturals!  Sidenote: If you don't care for lavender, once the conditioner dries, it has no scent. :)  Price: $6.99 at Target.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat is it!  Here are the ingredients for the Love Beauty & Planet conditioner:  WATER, CETEARYL ALCOHOL\\*, BEHENTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE\\*, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) OIL\\*, LAVANDULA ANGUSTIFOLIA (LAVENDER) OIL\\*, ARGANIA SPINOSA KERNEL OIL\\*, FRAGRANCE, DIPROPYLENE GLYCOL, ACRYLATES/BEHENETH-25 METHACRYLATE COPOLYMER, DISODIUM EDTA, METHYLCHLOROISOTHIAZOLINONE, METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE, CITRONELLOL, COUMARIN, LIMONENE, LINALOOL.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Trying to find a replacement for my beloved TRESemme Naturals Radiant Volume Conditioner(as a leave-in), I tried many products and found Love Beauty and Planet Argan Oil and Lavender Smooth and Serene Conditioner as a conditioner that makes me happier than the TN ever did!!",

I really liked it because I could put it on before bed and not feel greasy. Today, when repurchasing it, I looked at the ingredients. I'm especially intrigued by the ceramide and the use of mineral oil. I wasn't explicitly looking for a face wash, but for $8/4oz, that's a pretty decent oil with some nice additives.\n\nAnyone have any experience with this?\n\nOh, and just to clarify, this is *not* the same stuff as they sell for your hair. This is specifically for body and has different ingredients than the argan oil for hair this brand also develops.",

The \"magnets\" are like a perfect \"key\" shape to fit into the perfect \"lock\" hole in your hair.  We would normally only need 0.1-0.2% protein to achieve this, because that's the practical limit of how much we can put into the bottle, but also anymore just goes down the drain.\n\nAnalogy: your hair is like a piece of fuzzy rope covered in armor plating.  There are holes in that armor and the fuzz pokes through almost like Velcro.  The protein binds to the rope that isn't covered by armor.  When it dries that protein turns into new armor.  Your hair strand is now coated in a tough film that is resistant to oil.\n\nIt doesn't work for every type of hair.  It works best for fine, limp hair.  It doesn't work as well for kinky or stiff hair.\n\nThe fixatives such as formaldehyde do different chemistry on hair.  The purpose of those is to react with disulfide bonds in hair.  You don't want a fixative in a product with protein.  It's going to react in the bottle and you will destroy the benefits of either.\n\nAnalogy: take my fuzzy rope covered in armor.  Put cement on the ropey bits.  It's going to fix in place.",

The use of \"...hydrolyzed protein which we fix with formaļdehyde\" suggests that during the treatment (heat?) of the hair, there is an equilibrium between HCHO-X-linked protein, and HCHO-X-linked keratin (hair). These treatments are generally preceded by a reduction step (R-S-S-R') reduction, 'relaxing' the hair fiber. This is followed by the X-linker, in this case HCHO released by the X-linked protein in the product.\n\nI was involved in the assessment and banning of the original formaldehyde-containing product from this company where I live. Really dangerous for hairdressers, and I wonder how much free formaldehyde is released during application?",

Soaps and shampoos can sometimes trigger these symptoms as well, but I’ve FINALLY found a shampoo that doesn’t do those things and I truly love its scent. Because of my unfortunate sensitivities, it’s difficult to find things like scented candles or room air fresheners that don’t trigger some kind of adverse response. I would LOVE to know what comprises their “Fragrance (parfum)” as listed on their Ingredients list. It would be wonderful to be one of those people whose house smells of a lovely candle and be able to breathe comfortably in the surrounding aroma. I might even find a perfume I could wear. (I can handle wearing a touch of D&G Light Blue for a couple hours before the pinch of a headache begins.)\n\nI’ve written to and emailed the company asking about their “Exclusive Agadir aroma,” but have not gotten any reply or response. I’d guess it’s a secret proprietary formula or something, but I’d be happy to learn even one of the scents Agadir uses for their aroma. I’m reading more about the argania spinosa kernel oil, but the ingredients list still contains that elusive “Fragrance (parfum).”\n\nThanks to any and all who took the time to look at this post and I’d like to express sincere gratitude to anybody that might be able to shine some light on this. I don’t even know the name(s) of my favorite scent!\n\nIngredients :\nPurified Water (aqua), Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Polysorbate-20, Glycerin, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil (Argan Oil), Polyquaternium-10, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance (parfum), Benzyl Benzoate\n\n[Agadir Argan Oil Daily Volumizing Shampoo Website](https://agadirint.com/collections/gold-line/products/agadir-argan-oil-daily-volumizing-shampoo)\n\nIf this belongs elsewhere, please let me know!

Argan oil has a very very mild smell like most carrier oils. \n\nRather than think in terms of ingredients or trying to find ingredients, try smelling it to figure out how it smells or what it smells like to you.  You could also ask the company how they intended this product to smell. You're more likely to get an answer to that rather than a list of ingredients because that's proprietary obviously. Hope you get some feedback from the company.  Once you have some idea, post in the Recommend Me a Fragrance thread pinned to the top of the feed (sort feed by HOT).",

    "body": "**Background**\n\nI live in an area with very hard water (Minneapolis), and it’s definitely been tough on my hair. I had done the Malibu C hard water treatment packets in the past, and found them helpful. My tap water pH is 9 (!!!!! yes, nine!) and contains an average of 3.5 – 4.0ppm of chlorine (not sure how that stacks up).\n\n I have caucasian 2a wavy-ish hair that is very fine and splits easily and is very prone to frizz if I don’t use the right products. It's virgin but damages easily. I almost never blow dry it, and flat iron it occasionally - 1x a week at most. Despite being fine textured, it can take wayyy more product than you would expect. \n\n^(Extra: I was previously using the Cantu shampoo and conditioner, doing a CGM-ish routine, but have decided to switch it up my hair care this year. I think the shampoo caused buildup over time, despite me not using silicones, because I did a single wash with Malibu clarifying shampoo and swimmers treatment and holy hell did it make my hair so much lighter and bouncier! So I’ve decided to stop the CGM and look for a better routine for my hair. (That means anything goes as far as ingredients.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Problem**\n\nI got the Malibu C Hard Water Wellness Shampoo & Conditioner, thinking it would be the answer to all my life’s problems. I desperately wanted them to work for me, but I'm starting to realize that they are a total bust. :(\n\n**I’ve used them for 1.5 months and I wash my hair 1-2x a week. As soon as I started using them, my hair became *noticeably more frizzy*, and over time it seems to be getting worse, not better.** My hair hasn’t been this frizzy since I had a stint living in a very humid island climate. The conditioner also doesn’t feel particularly conditioning to me.\n\nAt this point I’m kind of at a loss on what to do, since I don’t have a go-to shampoo/conditioner to go back to. I’m trying to figure out what the problem is so that I know what direction to go in with my next product. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Theories**\n\nI also tried HealthySexyHair Moisturizing Conditioner for one use, and that didn’t help the frizz. It was about the same. I see they both have glycerin prominently on the list. Could that be it? Another hypothesis I have is the shampoo may be too harsh on my hair, even though it’s supposed to be “protective” according to the manufacturer, and the conditioner isn’t ~~moisturizing~~ conditioning enough to combat the harshness. The pH of the Malibu C shampoo is supposedly 6.0-6.8, but I got that info from an Amazon review and can’t verify (it cited the manufacturer’s website but I can’t find it). (Not sure that shampoo pH matters relative to my tap water anyway...). Malibu C claims their shampoo is not harsh, very gentle, and can be used daily. According to the site, the purpose of the shampoo is to prevent minerals from attaching to your hair, as opposed to removing them. So I honestly can’t tell if the shampoo is harsh, or the conditioner just sucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** I’m trying to figure out what it is about these products that made my hair suddenly frizzy, so I can figure out what to avoid and/or look for in a replacement. Thank you 🙏🏻🖤\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Malibu C Hard Water Shampoo:** Water/Aqua/Eau, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamide DIPA, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, PEG-16 Macadamia Glycerides, Polyquaternium 10, Linum Usitatissimum Seed Extract, Sodium Gluconate, Glucose, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Fragrance/Parfum, Limonene, Benzyl Benzoate, Linalool.\n\n**Malibu C Hard Water Conditioner:** Water/Aqua/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearalkonium Chloride, Dimethicone, Behentrimonium Chloride, Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Tocotrienols, Tocopherol, Panthenol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Tocopheryl Acetate, Polyquaternium-4, Linum Usitatissimum Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Fragrance/Parfum, Citric Acid, Cyclohexasiloxane, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Limonene, Benzyl Benzoate, Linalool.\n\n**HealthySexyHair Conditioner:** Water (Aqua, Eau), Behentrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Isopropyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Polyquaternium-37, Lactic Acid, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/ Dicaprate, Polyglyceryl-3 Caprate, Silicone Quaternium-22, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Hydroxy-ethylcellulose, Sodium PCA, Propylene Glycol, Quaternium-80, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone,Panthenol, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, C11-15 Pareth-7, Disodium EDTA, Dipropylene Glycol, C12-16 Pareth-9, Trideceth-12, Magnesium Nitrate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Palmitamidopro- pyltrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Magnesium Chloride, Trisodium HEDTA, Acacia Dealbata Flower Extract, Citric Acid, Moonstone Extract (lol), Fragrance (Parfum), Methylchloroisothiazolinone,Methylisothiazolinone, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Glyoxal, Sodium Nitrate, Limonene.",

I have been doing some research to find my routine and I have a lot of doubts I would like to receive some feedback about...\n\nSo, I have wavy, medium thickness, medium density hair. Not sure about porosity, as the glass and Water spray tests show low porosity but I have been ironing with heat my hair almost daily during 10 years and it gets frizzy even in dry weather (with humidity it's just untreatable) so I'm still pretty sure it is high porosity...\nI also have seb derm so I'm following a modified cgm as I need to clarify a bit more often 😅\n\nI'm looking for a routine moisture-protein balanced and I also want to avoid glycerin and humectants (if possible) cause I've read some hair react to It and gets frizzy, I don't know if that's my cases but I'm trying to avoid these just in case.\n\nMy actual routine is:\n - Wash with rituals ayurveda shampoo every 3 days, condition with LOVE Curls + valquer Curls leave In + cantú Custard\n\n - Clarify once a week with Neutrogena clarifying shampoo + ketoconazol shampoo (for seb derm) + Maui Moisture moisturizing mask + cantú Custard\n\n(I've tried devacurl mousse for styling but it definetely doesn't have enough hold and I get some frizzy non-defined waves when I use it.)\n\nAfter doing some research I think I'm going to test these but have you got any feedback or better alternatives for my type of hair?

It’s just that the effects are usually not as durable without formaldehyde. \n\nMany of the ingredients are surfactants, emulsifiers, and oils that likely help the reshaped hair resist ambient humidity.",

AVOID FIRE, FLAME, AND HEAT DURING APPLICATION AND UNTIL HAIR IS FULLY DRY. AVOID SPRAYING IN EYES\"\nI assume it's the alcohol that makes it flammable. Obviously I avoid fire near my hair anyway, but it also says to avoid heat.. and it's a heat protectant.

        "body": "It's a great solvent but it's also is useful when you want something to evaporate quickly. Your hair should never be wet before applying direct heat to it. Having alcohol in a thermal protection product allows it to evaporate more quickly so you don't have to wait as long before using your curling/flat iron. However, since we don't know the percentage of alcohol in this product it does make it difficult to know if that is the intended purpose or not.",

A few weeks ago I used [Overtone Espresso](https://www.reddit.com/r/henna/comments/1gg42bd/before_and_after_espresso_overtone_conditioning/) and this week I used Aura Bold Sonoma red. I've been using these over henna for over two years and they don't seem to affect dye uptake when I eventually henna the roots, but I do clarify with a sulfate shampoo and do hard water treatment before doing henna. The Aura masque certainly added some color and does help the roots blend even if it doesn't fully cover grey. However, it dyes the scalp much worse than Overtone does and overall the color is a bit dull for my taste.

I feel like I have zero way to predict whether my scalp will like a shampoo or not; some with supposedly \"harsher\" ingredients work great for me and others that are \"gentler\" make me super dry and itchy! I have to stick to low-poo because my low-porosity, medium-thickness 2C hair gets weighed down really easily. I desperately want to experiment with new shampoos but I have no way of narrowing down which ones might work for me!!\n\nHere are some of the products I've tried, how my scalp liked them, and their ingredients.\n\nTHE BODY SHOP GINGER SHAMPOO - Somehow? this is the nicest of all the shampoos I've ever tried on my scalp?? I legitimately don't understand why, it's one of the only things that leaves my scalp feeling calm.

There is also some industrial stuff in it, usually cheaper silicone oil just because it is cheaper (it isn't bad for your skin or hair, it just doesn't have any function besides stretching the output) and some stuff like anti-foam, probably to make industrial production easier.  \nThe \"beard oil fad\" is just a group of niche products, which were repurposed for a very niche target group and has a high price as such.

For the last 3 or so weeks, its been unbearable. \n\nI'm not sure how much of this is from the face paint I (stupidly) used on halloween, or the extra dry Colorado air, or both. But, right now my skin feels miserable. I'm re-applying moisturizer 3-4 times a day. My face is constantly itchy. The texture of my skin has changed from being tight without moisturizer to rough and flakey constantly, even on my ears, which did not have any face paint on them. However, the extreme dryness is contained to my face.\n\nMy routine: \n\n**AM - **\nRince with warm water\nMoisturize with **Ren Evercalm Global Protection Day Cream** (I switched to this recently, and it really helps with the redness I have from Exczma - Used 3 months)\nMakeup - I use **Makeup forever Ultra HD foundation.** I was told this was really good for dry skin, and If I have foundation on I can generally go 8 hours with out feeling like I need to re-moisturize. (Used 3 Months)\n\nPM - \nOil cleanse with **Burts Bees Facial Cleansing oil** (used 9 months)\nFollowed with **Simple Micellar water**, because I'm not a fan of the lingering oily feeling (used 9 months)\n**Ren Flash hydro boost instant plumping emulsion** w/ a bit of warm water per the instructions (Used 3 months)\nFollowed by **Boscia Tsubuki Deep Hydration Sleeping Mask** (used 1 year)\n\nI had been using Nip/Fab Gycolic fix, but stopped it back in August. I suspected most of my acne was caused by issues with my moisture barrier, and I was advised here to stop it.\n\nAs of now, anything with moisturizer in it, including my foundation, stings for a few seconds when I fist apply it. I even found a small travel container that I had put First Aid Beauty in, and tried that and it stung. \n\nI also tried a moisturizing and soothing sheet mask from Sephora, but it made me itchy more than anything. I run a cold humidifier at night, to prevent nosebleeds as well as dry cracked hands. \n\n\nThe \"posting guidelines\" suggest ingredients, so here it goes:\n\n**Ren Evercalm Global Protection Day Cream:** Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, Myristyl Myristate, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Glycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Glucoside, Triheptanoin, Oryzanol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Bisabolol, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant) Seed Oil, Carbomer, Hippophae Rhamnoides Fruit Extract, Citrus Nobilis (Mandarin Orange) Peel Oil, Tocopherol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Cinnamomum Camphora Linalloliferum (Ho Wood) Leaf Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Pueraria Lobata (Kudzu) Symbiosome Extract, Cassia Alata Leaf Extract, Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Fragrance, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Citronellol, Geraniol, Limonene, Linalool.\n\n**Facial Cleansing Oil with Coconut & Argan Oils:** Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Crambe Abyssinica Seed Oil, Isoamyl Laurate, Polyglyceryl-2 Sesquioleate, Fragrance*, Polyglyceryl-2 Caprate, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Tocopherol Natural Fragrance.\n\n**Simple Cleansing Micellar Water:** Water (Aqua), Hexylene Glycol,Glycerin, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) FlowerExtract, Panthenol, Niacinamide, Sodium AscorbylPhosphate, Peg-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, DmdmHydantoin, Cetrimonium Chloride, TetrasodiumEdta, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, SodiumChloride, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\n**Ren Flash Hydro-Boost Instant Plumping Emulsion:** Water, Squalane, Glycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Oleyl Alcohol, Arginine, Cetyl Phosphate, Xylitylglucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Myristyl Myristate, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Germ Oil, Anhydroxylitol, Oryzanol, Vaccinium Vitas-Idaea Seed Oil, Yeast Extract, Alcohol, Carbomer, Phospholipids, Xylitol, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Parfum* (Fragrance), Safflower Oil / Palm Oil Aminopropanediol Esters, Sodium Hyaluronate, Soy Amino Acids, Glucose, Glyceryl Laurate, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Ceratonia Siliqua (Carob) Seed Extract, Benzoic Acid, Dehydracetic Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Geraniol, Limonene, Linalool. *100% Natural Fragrance.\n\n**boscia Tsubaki Deep Hydration Sleeping Mask:** Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Dimethicone, Sucrose, Lactobacillus Ferment, Pentylene Glycol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polysorbate 60, Squalane, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Epilobium Angustifolium Extract, Undaria Pinnatifida Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Algae Extract, Althaea Officinalis Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Carbomer, Eugenia Caryophyllus (Clove) Leaf Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol.\n\nAny advice is very appreciated.

Are they drying to the hair in hair care products or am I missing some role they play in the formulation?  \n\n\nFor example Garnier, Fructis, Sleek & Shine, Intensely Smooth Leave-In Conditioning Cream, Frizzy, Dry, Unmanageable Hair, 10.2 fl oz (300 ml). This product lists isopropyl alcohol as the 9th ingredient.  \n\n\nThe complete ingredients is: Water, cetearyl alcohol, amodimethicone, cetyl esters, behentrimonium chloride, parfum/fragrance, phenoxyethanol, pyrus malus fruit extract/apple fruit extract, isopropyl alcohol, trideceth-6, argania spinosa kernel oil, niacinamide, pyridoxine hcl, hexyl cinnamal, chlorhexidine dihydrochloride, citric acid, cetrimonium chloride, saccharum officinarum extract/sugar cane extract, benzyl alcohol, linalool, amyl cinnamal, tocopherol, hydroxypropyltrimonium lemon protein, ci 19140/yellow 5, citrus limon extract/ lemon peel extract, ci 15985/yellow 6, camellia sinensis leaf extract. leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, caprylyl glycol.  \n\n\nAlso I have a question about glycerine, is it bad for damaged hair? I've been hearing water is damaging to the hair, so should an ingredient like glycerine be avoided by someone who has damaged hair due to its ability to hold onto moisture or does it hold onto beneficial ingredients and not water? I would love an explanation to this.  \n\n\nThank you and hopefully one of you are up for answering my questions :)  \n\n\n&#x200B;",

This helps the conditioning agent incorporate into my formula. The isopropyl alcohol represents less than 1% of my overall formula.\n\nThe formula is eventually cooked to 80 degrees Celsius for an extended period of time, so the alcohol evaporates out. Even though isopropyl alcohol is technically no longer in my formula after being cooked out, I am still required to list it in my ingredient list.\n\nSo if you see isopropyl alcohol in a haircare product, chances are it's at a small level that might have been cooked out anyway.",

There are still alcohols and synthetic components in these.\n\nYou’re starting from too complicated of a controlled perspective. You say you wish to determine what ingredients are subjectively preferred by yourself, and I doubt even the most oil-affluent human on the planet would be able to independently judge each of these 10 ingredients in each bottle. Too much combination happening at once. \n\nAdvice:\nIf you can’t pronounce an ingredient, don’t use it. If you were to use your own judgement system and be successful with finding the right oils, you’d be using natural stuff in the end. Save yourself the time now. \n\nIt was said before, but stay simple. Use your classic base oils, a little essential, and added vitamin E if you’d like. Parfume and Fragrance typically refers to alcohol-based, and you don’t want that on your skin or hair. \n\nSpend $50-75 on amazon and you’ll be able to make yourself quality beard oil for at least a few months.",

    "body": "In January 2020, actress and hairstyling enthusiast Taraji P. Henson launched her haircare line, [TPH by Taraji](https://tphbytaraji.com/). The collection is currently sold at Target, both in stores and online. The line contains 18 products that cater to all types of hair. [Five beauty editors at Allure across the curl spectrum](https://www.allure.com/story/tph-hair-taraji-p-henson-review) all had complimentary things to say about how the products worked for their hair type.\n\n## Product Details\n* **Link:** [Glow Up, a pure oil blend](https://tphbytaraji.com/products/glow-up)\n* **Price:** $11.99 + tax for 2 oz. (59 ml)\n* **Hair Type:** All\n* **Appearance:** Yellowish, waxy semi-solid at room temperature\n* **Texture:**  *sticky* \n* **Scent:** suffocatingly intense florals\n* **Marketing Spiel:**  Glow Up instantly transforms your hair from basic to fabulous by enriching hair with a blend of essential, luxe nutrients.  This versatile, no-mess, semi-solid oil can be used all over scalp, hair, and body for brilliant shine. Glow Up helps to protect, seal, smooth, de-frizz, soften, moisturize, AND delivers a high-glimmer, healthy-glow without greasiness-- Can we say hair oil upgrade! \n\n## Ingredients (CG-APPROVED)\nglycine soja (soybean) oil, euphorbia cerifera (candelilla) cera, hydrogenated vegetable oil, fragrance (parfum), olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, carthamus tinctorius (safflower) seed oil, argania spinosa kernel oil, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf oil, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, tocopherol, persea gratissima (avocado) oil, adansonia digitata seed oil, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract, cymbopogon schoenanthus oil, limonene, coumarin, citronellol, geraniol, linalool, benzyl benzoate\n\n##Using the Product\nI squeezed out a small amount of the oil blend (aiming for the size of 1-2 pinheads), rubbed it between my palms to warm it up and thin it out, and then gently spread over hair and finger-combed in.\n\nFrustratingly, the texture of this product changes dramatically even when the indoor temperature has not changed that much. During chilly days in early spring, it was like working with cold butter. In mid-70s °F weather (23°C), the squeeze tube leaks some clear oil-ish stuff for a few seconds before any solid matter emerges. \n\n\n##Results\n* Because the texture has been different (semi-solid vs. liquid) every time, it's damn near impossible to get the right amount of product. \n* No matter how it comes out of the tube, it *always* feels unpleasantly sticky-gross.\n* Super-strong, church-grandma perfume smell that takes a long time to dissipate.\n* The *one* positive note is that because of its sticky nature, it \"glues\" frizzy/crispy ends back together well for Day 2/Day 3 hair. It helps me look a little more polished after detangling slept-on hair.\n\n## Conclusion\nThis product was disappointing to me in most ways. It's too unpredictable, too stinky, and too easy to use too much. \n\nI'll never make it part of my regular routine, but I plan to keep it around for touch-ups.",

I have never tried Kanebo, but I have heard wonderful things in general.

Ok so I'll be honest that its the first time I've ever even heard of stuff like Tocopherol, Limonene, and Glyceryl Dihebenate so I might not be the most informed on those things, but as a general rule of thumb I don't trust things that sound like unnatural chemicals. All of the oils sound fine and the shea butter should be good too, but the rest of it sounds like it might be chemical heavy. Most of them are alcohols which might dry your beard out. Im not saying don't get it, it might be exactly what you want, but I would honestly look for something with all natural ingredients. Try just plain coconut oil, Its not my favorite, but it does the job if you don't have the money for something a little more pricey. If money isn't an issue look at Honest Amish, Beardbrand, and Grave Before Shave products. They have all natural ingredients and work very nicely.",

Looking at the ingredients, it doesn't seem like it should be able to protect your hair from flat ironing. But I messaged Shea Moisture's support team and they assured me that the spray can protect against flat ironing, and still works when sprayed on damp hair that's allowed to air dry. \n\nHere are the ingredients for reference: \n\nWater, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter*, Glyceryl Stearate, Maltodextrin/VP Copolymer, Glycerin (Vegetable), Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Coconut Alkanes, Glyceryl Caprylate, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Annona Cherimola Fruit Extract, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Tocopherol, Althaea Officinalis Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Zea Mays Starch, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Fruit Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Fragrance (Essential Oil Blend), Glyceryl Undecylenate.\n\nHas anyone used any of Shea Moisture's heat protectant products? If so, did you feel like the spray did a good job protecting your hair from heat? I flat iron, so I'm a little worried that this spray still wouldn't do the job (Shea Moisture was vague with what level of protection is provided - they couldn't name a specific degree of heat). I plan to use the spray on my hair when it's damp and then use a flat iron many hours later after my hair has fully dried. \n\nI've also been trying out Eva NYC's Mane Magic 10-in-1 Primer spray. Because two out of the first three ingredients (Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, Decamethylcyclopcntasiloxane, Trimethylsiloxysilicate) are siloxanes though, which are apparently evaporative, I've heard that this spray is only protective when it's sprayed on hair shortly before using heat styling tools. I contacted Eva NYC about this and they were also vague, telling me they can only guarantee protection when the spray is used on hair right before using heat styling tools. I'm not a fan of using this spray on my dry hair because it usually leaves it feeling greasy. I've been looking at other options, but finding something that's cruelty free (non negotiable), fairly cheap (non negotiable), and cg-friendly (not a non negotiable, but would be preferable) is pretty difficult...

    "body": "Hi everyone!\n\nI have Type 3A/3B hair, and I have been so confused with how to fix my technique to avoid a flaking scalp. I have (what seemed like) random bouts of flaking on my scalp, and I couldn't figure out if it was dandruff or dry scalp. I'm leaning towards dry scalp, but would appreciate any input!\n\nTo provide a timeline:\n\n— In fall, I used the **Maui Moisture Weightless Hydration + Hibiscus Water Shampoo & Conditioner**. This worked well for my hair, but then my hair felt very dry, so I shifted to using the [**MagiForet Argan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner Set**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07CCHDPTQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (which is infused with Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Avocado Oil, Jojoba Oil, Camellia Seed Oil, Botanical Keratin, Green Tea). I found my hair to be much softer after using this oil-y shampoo/conditioner and there was no flaking.\n\n— Then, in December, my scalp started to flake out of the blue. I wasn't sure if it was dandruff or dry scalp because a) I had started using oil-based hair products *buuuut* b) the temperature had definitely dropped that week (and would remain at that temperature for the rest of winter).\n\n— So, I switched to using the **Maui Moisture Shampoo** and then double conditioning with the **Maui Moisture Conditioner** and **MagiForet Conditioner** (in that specific order, so that the oil-based conditioner would lock in the hydration from the Maui Moisture). This stopped my scalp from flaking almost immediately (within 2 washes).\n\n— Now, it's February, and the temperature is back up from <20°F to 40-50°F (I'm in the UK). My scalp has started to flake again. I can't figure out what to do now.\n\nIs the double conditioning too much for this weather now? Do I just switch to only using the MagiForet Shampoo+Conditioner? Do I only go back to Maui Moisture? I can't figure out if this is dandruff or dry scalp.\n\n**Any help would be much appreciated!**",
