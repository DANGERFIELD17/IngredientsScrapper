    "body": "Why YSK:\n\nA bit of context for everyone - I’ve had terrible dandruff since I was young; being of South Asian descent my parents tried absolutely everything to resolve it. \n\nWe tried oil treatments, head & shoulders, even the strong T-Gel stuff w/ tar. All of this works for a time, but requires consistent discipline and routine to actually do it’s job.\n\nEventually the dry flaky behavior found its way to other parts of my skin - between my nose and cheeks, near my ears, by my eyebrows. Here too consistent moisturizer kept it at bay, but a missed day would mean a flair up.\n\nWhat I find is that not many people bring it up to their doctor - myself included. I would try many cocktails of fixes and browse the internet for a new method someone swore by. I eventually just came to the conclusion that maybe the climate is just too dry for my skin and I’ve got to deal with it. \n\nHere’s where a lot of ignorance in terms of dandruff comes in - dandruff is not due to the dryness of one’s skin. The flaky nature of the stuff is quite the opposite. When your skin or hair is too oily, it attracts a normal fungus on your skin to have a feast and flair up. Throwing more oils at dandruff does not solve dandruff.\n\nAt the beginning of this year, I mentioned it to my doctor during my physical and he prescribed me a topical cream for my face, and a prescription shampoo for a few times a week. What I was diagnosed with was Seborrheic dermatitis - and it was in fact very treatable.\n\nSkeptical, I applied the cream without any lotion or moisturizer; not thinking it would do a thing. The shampoo as well after a shower.\n\nIt’s gone. All of it. Completely gone. No flakes or problem areas anywhere overnight. It’s so relieving to just have it gone. According to the PCP, it also doesn’t require a refill - once it’s done you’re good to go.\n\nBasically tldr; talk to your Dr about bad dandruff and stop trying a concoction of remedies. It’ll change your life.\n\nEDIT: woah this blew up. My prescription is as follows:\n\n- Topical Ketoconazole 2% cream\n- Ketoconazole 2% shampoo\n\nEDIT 2: A lot of you have pointed out that Head and Shoulders and lots of other shampoos have Ketoconazole as the active ingredient. Unfortunately for whatever reason this did not work for me and I had to get a prescription. Though, I think this is why you should bring it up to your Dr. - if the treatment doesn’t work then your Dr. can help you navigate what will work instead of you searching the internet and trying everything!",

I usually put it on before I shower\n- utilize hydrocortisone cream with the ketocortisone to reduce the redness\n\nIt's a very frustrating condition the key is mitigation. It's very easy to become self conscious with the flaky splotches, but I've come to learn that people understand skin conditions, as it's similar to eczema in its reoccurrence. Just take care of the outbreaks as they occur, control the redness with hydrocortisone, and try to limit new areas it spreads to.\n\nI would love to hear other ideas on how to mitigate the disease. Just know you aren't alone, I've done interviews with a breakout, and it did not effect the situation. Most people are understanding and realize that you cannot do anything about it.\n\nGood luck to any with it, hopefully a better remedy comes soon.",

But it was prescription only.\n\nThen one day they started selling it over the counter and I immediately bought all of it I could carry and poured it over my head. \n\nI followed instructions religiously: several washes a week to start, leaving it on the scalp for several minutes; then weekly maintenance. I have not had any dandruff at all since then.\n\nIt helped that I went on BCP to stem the greasiness at source, but I still needed the Nizoral.\n\nI still had acne on my scalp after that, which I had to figure out by trial and error. Coal tar shampoo was key, and I only knew about it because I randomly heard a character in a sitcom mention coal tar soap and I had already tried everything else. \n\nI started with T-gel. It worked, but it took a few years before I figured out Capasal was what worked best for acne on my scalp. This is an individual thing of course.",

I try eat enough protein but I try stay kind to myself. If I'm having a bad hair day - that's fine.\n\nFor those of us on a curly hair journey - your hair is beautiful no matter what!

    "body": "Last week I picked up a really sad case. He's a 31 year old man paraplegic from a gun shot wound he suffered in 2014. He's poor and black. Most of our patients are wealthy and white. He was admitted almost 8 weeks ago with for acute on chronic sacral osteomyelitis and has been on piperacillin-tazobactam and minocycline basically since then. My first day meeting him we were short staffed due to holiday coverage, and I had 23 patients on my census so I did not have the time to explore his chart. I read through the novella-length progress note written by the previous hospitalist and was able to gather the basics. The plan I inherited was to find an orthopedic surgeon at another institution who'd perform hip disarticulation or possibly hemipelvectomy. The big academic shop in town apparently recently lost their surgeon who did those, and the smaller academic shop has a guy who does it but \"only for oncologic indications\" (???) according to the note. The hospitalists before me had tried a few other centers and identified a list of candidate surgeons, most of whom had declined. The last remaining candidate is a few hours away, and documentation indicates that my colleagues have faxed the records for review and consideration for transfer. The note contains a phone number for me to call and follow up. I call and get a nurse who confirms they have the records but informs me the surgeon is out of town for Christmas but he'll be back Monday (yesterday) so please call back then.\n\nI go meet the patient, a very polite and extremely sarcopenic young man. Always \"Yes, sir,\" and \"No, sir.\" I introduce myself and explain that I'll be picking up where the prior hospitalist left off. I explain that I called the transfer center and we're waiting to hear from a surgeon who's out of town, so please just relax over the holiday weekend and I'll let him know as soon as I hear anything. I examine his wounds and see that our wound care team is doing a great job, everything looks clean and freshly bandaged. He has temporal wasting. His calves are as big around as my wrists. I have difficulty auscultating the chest due to the sunken intercostal spaces. I tell him I'm sorry he'll be spending Christmas in the hospital but that I'll be seeing him each day and I'm happy to help him feel more comfortable in any way I can. He tells me his pain is well controlled.\n\nThe next day is Friday, Christmas Eve. I go in to see him with no updates and start making small talk. Football is on TV. He tells me he's a Tom Brady fan, and I joke that I can forgive him one wrong opinion. I look down at him and imagine our positions are reversed. He's one year younger than I am, slowly rotting to death in a hospital bed on Christmas Eve. I haven't seen a single visitor. He tells me he spoke to his 7 year old daughter on the phone. He tells me her name.\n\n\"Well...Is there anything you can think of that would make your day a little better?\"  \n\"I was hoping to get some of that jambalaya from the cafeteria. Or just something good to eat.\"  \n\"What's your favorite restaurant around here?\"  \n\"I like Papa John's.\"\n\nI ask him what he likes from Papa John's, and he rattles off his usual order complete with the dipping sauce he likes. I can tell he doesn't have much joy in life, and a favorite meal is something he can control and look forward to. A small piece of joy in an otherwise miserable existence, living from dressing change to dressing change. The nurse picks the order up from the front door and gets it to him.\n\nThe next day when I see him, he's eating leftovers and watching TV. He thanks me repeatedly, making eye contact each time so I know he means it. I tell him we're just holding the course until we hear from the medical center and thank him for his patience with me. I start him on topical ketoconazole for the dermatophyte infection on his face. After six weeks of broad spectrum IV antibiotics, and due to his chronic inflammation, he is significantly immunocompromised. He hasn't showered at least since he was admitted, just bed baths from the techs.\n\nFinally Monday rolls around and late in the afternoon I get a call back from the medical center. The orthopedic surgeon tells me this is the first he's hearing of this patient and they have no records, oh and by the way he doesn't do that surgery. He usually sends patients to my city for it.\n\nFuck.\n\nHoliday coverage ends and our staffing improves, so now I'm only following 18 patients and I have a few minutes to make sure I understand his hospitalization. I read that he presented with abdominal pain, and CT showed osteomyelitis of both ischial tuberosities, and of his left proximal femur. He had a left hip fluid collection thought to represent septic arthritis from direct invasion of the joint space by his unmanaged decubitus ulcers. Plastic surgery evaluated him when he came in and said he was not a candidate for sacral flap coverage unless he agreed to diverting colostomy. The patient, presumably dissatisfied with his already cachectic and broken body, was not interested in this idea. Eventually with ongoing pressure from several teams, he agreed to go for it. The plastic surgeon had signed off by that point, so the hospitalist re-consulted him for flap now that the colostomy was in place. Inexplicably, the plastic surgeon says he is not a flap candidate and instead recommends hemipelvectomy or pelvectomy by *someone else.*\n\nI'm reading through all of the above history just moments after getting turned down by the orthopedic surgeon who practices few hours away, and in the back of my mind I'm remembering the questions the patient has been asking me -- \"How is this going to heal?\" It dawns on me that perhaps no one has told this young man that we're working to get him transferred to a place where the plan is to cut one or both of his legs off.\n\nToday I went in to his room and told him we had some things to discuss. I ask him what he understands about our goals in transferring him to another hospital. He believes the idea is to \"fix the bone.\"\n\n\"Did anyone tell you that the plan is to find a surgeon who will cut your leg off?\"\n\nHe immediately starts crying. He is blindsided by this. We talk for 45 minutes. I can tell he is getting upset with me, but really he's upset with the situation. We agree on a new goal which is to try to find a surgeon who will consider him for flap coverage. Today I called every academic medical center within 500 miles. Not only do they not have any beds, they won't even offer wait list placement.\n\nSo tomorrow I'm going into work as a hospitalist. Completely useless to this man who needs a surgical procedure. All my consultants signed off weeks ago after collectively deciding it was someone else's job to give the patient his prognosis and options. I consulted palliative care so at least he can have continuity with someone who will advocate for him after I go off service. When I started telling the story to the palliative care physician, I unexpectedly started crying and could barely steady my voice to give the facts.\n\nI'm angry, I'm sad, I'm useless to my patient. I look at him and I see a society that doesn't give a flying fuck about poor people, black people, or gun violence. Compare him to the 5 wealthy white patients I've had with traumatic paraplegia (and quadriplegia) the last few months. They all survived into their seventies or longer. They all have round-the-clock care. They don't have decubitus ulcers. They're not rotting to death alone in a hospital bed on Christmas while some useless fucking hospitalist like me flails about worthlessly and to no effect.\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for your support and suggestions. I alerted administration of the case and also developed a plan with the patient. Much of our efforts right now are confounded by COVID-19. I hope we have a plan to get him his second opinion. It was my last day on service with him. We hugged.",

Moreover, just how invisible these insurmountable problems become if you have the spare cash to work outside the limitations of the for profit, bloated, obscenely wasteful medical insurance industry. This patient, and thousands like him, might have any number of horrific medical problems; but it's incidental to what's really killing them. Like you said; not only would this be fixable if the patient was rich, they never would have ended up with these problems in the first place.\n\nJust off the top of my head I remember there was an 88 year old woman who broke her hip, and after back and forth the insurance company felt like a reasonable thing to do would be to discharge her back home after less than a week in inpatient rehabilitation. I guess they thought some of her cats could help her through her PT? \n\nHonestly, it's a bit of an extreme position to take, but I just don't see how that's any different than murder. But for some reason we deem it socially acceptable to frown, and wring your hands, and say we tried but insurance won't pay for it, and then turn a blind eye. It makes me physically ill. \n\nWe're doctors, we can only fix medical problems.

Why are they being so picky about which cases they take? One of the hospitals said they were short of beds, so is it the current Omicron surge interfering?  \n\nI keep hearing of specialists refusing patients as outpatients after discharge, despite top-of-the-line insurance, and cooperative vaccinated patients. One patient, a retired MD, was refused by every nephrologist and urologist in the city to be seen as an outpatient, after being admitted in acute kidney failure due to hydropnephrosis brought on by excessive inflammation from immunotherapy. The hospitalist called every nephrologist in the city. Refused. He had to be discharged with no ability to follow up with anyone. He will end up using the ER for routine follow up. These specialists don't seem to want to take on any cases. Are they overworked with too many patients? What is going on? One urologist stated that he was swamped with outpatients because \"so many doctors either died or retired early because of Covid. Or got Covid, became long-haulers and have had to drastically cut back on their work.\"\n\nNot sure that is what is going on with this patient, but the question remains, why don't any of these surgeons want to take on this flap surgery for this man? \n\nAlso, where has he been living that he has gotten in this condition? He may need a lawyer to sue if he has been in a SNF.

I know it’s hard for doctors when you can’t fix something. You got into this business to help people, so it’s natural you feel helpless. But you’re not. For as long as this man is in your care you can continue to treat him with compassion and continue to be honest with him. Do not underestimate the value of those things to a patient with chronic issues. \n\nTrue story, I have 2 providers that I consider to be the best physicians I’ve ever met. One is a neurologist. I’ve seen him once or twice a year for the last 20 years. He doesn’t prescribe me any meds. He doesn’t perform any procedures on me. He keeps a record of my slow decline, helped me get disability, and refers me for things like PT/braces/wheelchairs etc. But, he’s my favorite doctor on this earth because when I met him at age 22 and said I wasn’t ready for AFOs yet he simply said “ok. You’ll let me know when you’re ready.”  He was the first medical provider to indicate that I was in charge of how I would deal with my disease and he would provide insight, experience, expertise, etc but ultimately I had to be the one to understand my goals. You did the same thing for your patient. 20 years later my favorite thing about him is that he knows he can’t fix me, and he’ll readily talk about how much my situation stinks. Just that acknowledgment/compassion coming from a medical provider is so validating. It gives a person the strength to keep going. You’re doing that for your patient. \n\nMy next favorite is my knee ortho. Yes, I love that he’s technically skilled and a great surgeon. That’s key in a person who cuts off parts of you & replaces them with something else. But what makes him outstanding is how deeply he cares about me. Your patient feels how much you care about him. Trust me. He can tell. And because he feels how much you care about him you have already improved his stay in immeasurable ways. \n\nI’m sorry that you’re feeling frustrated by our crappy medical system and our even more frustrating wider social inequality, but I’m so thankful doctors like you exist.

I need some advice for the summer.\n\nI've been letting my hair grow for the past 5 years and while letting it loose looks nice and I could not be more proud, it's not always fun. this is the first summer in my growth journey where I've been finding it really hard to deal with the heat because of my hair.\nI run, and for that, I always just do a braid, quick and easy, also easy to detangle after. I always carry a mini brush in my purse to take care of knots right away. \n\nbut on a day-to-day basis it's been hard to find something that works. I've been wanting to put my hair up more, but if I put it fully up, it really hurts my scalp. it gets very tender and gives me a headache almost right away. I can only ever do half updos or tie my hair near the nape of my neck.\n\nwhat do you do in the summer? do you have go-to hairdos for keeping the hair out of your face/neck? I find that most stuff on pinterest is more geared towards people with finer/less amount of hair than me, so whenever I try to copy what I see there it ends up hurting. I'm really struggling, you guys. last year I could still use claw clips, but this year the sheer weight and volume is driving me nuts. I can't find a really oversized one that could hold my length if my life depended on it.\n\nI'm very frustrated and would appreciate the help!\n\n\nfull routine here:\n- day-to-day: brush before bed. sleep in low bun or braid tied with silk scrunchie. brush every morning with wooden brush. oil length and ends.\n- shower routine: brush with wooden brush before entering shower. use clarifying shampoo twice, then every 3-4 washes (more often if needed) use nizoral/generic ketoconazole shampoo on scalp for 10min. condition the length and brush while rinsing with a curly brush (very spaced out teeth, holes in body - no cushion, very maleable), hair mask whenever I have an extra 5min. 20min airdrop then the rest with hairdryer on low heat. I use all drugstore products.\n- on occasion: search and destroy the split ends. trim 2-3cm whenever the very ends get too thin, maybe every 4 months or so. \n- running: brush, oil, braid. tie with rubber tie so it doesn't slip. as soon as the run is over I untie, let loose and brush. keeping the scalp as dry as I can helps contain my seborrheic dermatitis.\n- absolutely never: sleep with wet hair, keep heat+moisture on scalp for long, brush roughly/aggressively, skip wash day. keeping my scalp dry and clean was key in achieving volume and length for me. I'm at 87cm/just past 34 inches as of today. but over length I prioritize my ends being healthy and full.",

They can get pretty heavy for me too though, the placement of the stick can pull at your scalp. There are tons of different buns you can do with sticks, I love them so much more than hair ties because it feels like the weight is distributed through the stick and not a lot of tension between a hair tie and your head. I’m curious though how you keep your hair from frizzing using a hair dryer? When my hair was waist length I blow dried it every single time and the frizz was negligible, but ever since I got past that length it is crazy how I can’t avoid the frizz.

Sharing my progress and routine after almost 2 years of trying.\n\nSo I just turned 18 a week ago, and I wanted to share my journey with hair loss and how I’ve been slowly turning things around. Hopefully this helps someone out there—especially if you’re starting young like I did.\n\nIt all began in June 2023, when I was 16. I started noticing my hair wasn’t the same—it looked thinner, especially around the hairline. It felt like a mix of stress, acne, and genetics that triggered it. That’s when I realized my hairline is receding and not the same.\n\nIn August 2023, still 16, I got a 6-month supply of minoxidil. I started using it, but I wasn’t consistent. I had periods where I used it and then stopped, and the shedding didn’t really slow down. I also tried things like rosemary oil and other natural methods, but honestly, \nnone of that made a difference and only made it worst—probably because I didn’t have the right knowledge at the time, and I was still young to be on finasteride.\n\n In August 2024, A few months before turning 18, That’s when it got better\n\nstarted using minoxidil daily, (I had on and off periods) \n\nwith tretinoin 0.025%, tretinoin really made me feel like I’m finally started responding to minoxidil properly.\n\n\tMy Hair Routine:\n\t•\tFinasteride 1mg – once daily\n\t•\tTopical Minoxidil – twice a day\n\t•\tMorning: Minoxidil only\n\t•\tNight: Minoxidil \n             (mixed with Tretinoin 0.25%)      \n\t•\tKetoconazole shampoo – 2–3 times a week\n(Has been shown to reduce DHT Levels in the scalp.) And I genuinely feel like this shampoo has made a real difference for my hair.\n\nOn the other days of the week, I use a natural shampoo that’s free of salts, SLS, and parabens.\n\n\t•\tDermarolling, 0.75mm dermaroller \n             used to be with 1.5 also\n– twice a week (I’m not that consistent with it)\n\nI can honestly say this routine is what made me start seeing real improvement,and I’m lucky I caught it early\n\nand especially once I started finasteride 4 months ago, the best decision I’ve made. \n\n",

    "body": "Prior sticky was 6 years old, so it's due for some updated links and more clarified routines.  Here's the 2020 version. I normally do a yearly AMA around the anniversary of starting Fin, but this year that falls right around the time my first child is due, so consider this my 2020 AMA as well! I'll turn this into a sticky after a few days and delete this part about the AMA.\n\nRead the Wiki, There's lots of good info there too: http://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/wiki/index\n\nOn May 12th, 2008 my boss remarked that \"you must have gotten a lot of sun this weekend, I can see you got some sunburn through your thin-spot\". It was a thin-spot I didn't know existed. 2 years prior to all of this I had contemplated Propecia when I noticed a LOT of hair in the shower drain. I did research, and then got scared off by horror stories of side effects. 2 years passed, my boss made the comment, and I instantly knew the risk was worth the reward to me.\n\n12 years ago there was no good resource for dealing with hairloss. I had to find everything scattered across different hairloss forums and other places. About 6 years ago I decided to type up a guide to try and help people out that are starting on the hairloss journey, and this is the updated and cleaned up version of that.\n\n**\"What do I do? Do I have options??\"*** Yes, but you really only have 1 option.....***\"Do 'The Big 3'\"***.\n\n1: Propecia\n\n2: Rogaine\n\n3: Nizoral shampoo\n\n3a: Dermarolling\n\n***\n\n### How do I go about getting these things and how do I use them?\n\n* 1: Propecia\n\nPropecia is the driving force behind everything. Rogaine by itself will most likely not help much. Nizoral shampoo by itself will almost certainly not do anything.  If you have male pattern baldness, DHT is attacking your hair follicles and making them shrink down until they are unable to produce anything more than a baby hair. Propecia will inhibit your DHT levels and give your hair follicles the ability to recover and regrow.\n\nPropecia is just 1mg of Finasteride (Fin), you can get it in generic form and save a ton of money. 6 years ago I advocated for getting an Rx for generic Proscar, 5mg Fin, and quartering them to save money. Since then the price of 1mg Fin tablets has fallen, and you can use GoodRx [to get a 3 months supply for about $30](https://www.goodrx.com/finasteride?label_override=finasteride&form=tablet&dosage=1mg&quantity=180). In my opinion it's easier to not have to spend time quartering pills and then hope that the distribution of the 5mg of Fin was even inside the pill so that you get 1.25mg of Fin a day.\n\nYou can talk to your General Practitioner about getting a script for Fin, or a dermatologist, or you can go to places like keeps.com, hims.com, getroman.com, or other online places that will write you an Rx and sell it to you.  However, they will charge you double what you'd pay with GoodRx and buying it from a pharmacy. It might be worth it for you for the convenience factor, that's up to you.\n\nA lot of people are concerned about side effects once they start Fin.  ***I AM NOT A DOCTOR***, but my advice to people starting Fin is to quarter the pills and start at .25mg every day.  This will still inhibit DHT and give your hair follicles some relief, while also giving your endocrine system a smaller dose to start with.  If everything is good for 3 or 4 months, step it up to .5mg.  Everything still good after another 3 or 4 months? Bump it to the full 1mg a day. Personally I took .5mg for 3 or 4 years to start with and got great results before I decided to just go to 1mg.  A tiered approach like that gives your body time to adjust at lower doses, and gives you clear steps to retreat to if you end up getting side effects at a higher dose.  Anecdotally I have a friend that got full blown sides at 1mg, he stopped, things went back to normal after a few months, then he tried again at .5mg.  Sides again, so he stopped, things went to normal, and he went back on at .25mg.  He's been on it for probably 5 or 6 years at this point at .25mg with no issues and a bit of regrowth too.  He'd be pretty much bald by now if he hadn't taken it at all, so I would say that it's still working even at a lower dose.\n\nThe inhibition curve shows [that even micro-dosing Fin will block DHT, which gives your hair follicles relief](https://i.imgur.com/mIAVCKB.jpg)\n\n* 2: Rogaine\n\nRogaine is just 5% Minoxidil (Minox), you can get it in generic form from Walmart, HyVee, Target, etc etc. Personally I get it off Amazon and usually get GoodSense or Kirkland brand minox foam. 6 bottles for about $55-60.\n\nThere are 2 tyles of Minox, liquid and foam.  The liquid is cheaper, and there are anecdotal reports that it does a slightly better job than foam.  Foam isn't as messy, and is less likely to cause irritation.  I used liquid minox, but it gave me INCREDIBLE scalp itch because of the propylene glycol that it has.  Foam minox uses alcohol as its delivery vehicle and it much less likely to cause irritation.\n\n**I suggest** ***NOT*** **starting Minox and Fin at the same time.** Wait for a year or more until you know what results Fin gets you, then you'll be able to tell if Minox actually helps.  I started both at the same time, so I'm stuck taking them both forever. For all I know Minox might not be doing anything at all, but I can't really risk stopping it because I don't know if it's responsible for 25% of my regrowth and maintenance or 0% of it.\n\nYou should use Minox 2x a day for the best effect. Personally I would just put it on after your morning shower so that it almost acts like mild hair gel or mousse, then the 2nd time before you go to bed.  This way you don't have to worry about it messing with your hairstyle or looking like it makes your hair sticky or \"crunchy\".\n\nMinox works best on the crown of the head, but it can also help on the hairline. You can also help the Minox results by dermarolling. [Here is a guide from this subreddit on dermarolling](https://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/comments/8gmwvo/derma_roller_guide/).\n\n* 3: Nizoral\n\nNizoral is a dandruff shampoo that contains 1% Ketoconazole as the active ingredient. Keto [has been shown to help hairloss](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9669136), although they're not sure why.  [Here's another study where Keto was used](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3964684/)\n\nYou can get Nizoral from Walmart or other stores like that, but for some reason [it's almost always cheaper on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AINMFAC).  I use it 2-3x a week when I wash my hair, but not every time.\n\n* 3.5: Dermarolling\n\nu/RhadTrad has been working on an epic new Dermarolling/microneedling section: https://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/wiki/microneedling\n\nPersonally I don't dermaroll because I have good results with the big 3, but there are PLENTY of reports that this really helps people who maybe had more advanced hairloss than me, or who weren't getting as good of results with Fin+Minox\n\n***\n\nThose are the big 3 (or 4).  Propecia is the biggest, and the others are things that will help promote the hairgrowth.  Think of your scalp like a garden that you're trying to cultivate and grow some plants in.  DHT is rocks, rogaine and niz are fertalizer and nutrients.  Your garden isn't going to do much of anything if it's loaded with rocks, even if you load it up with fertalizer and nutrients. But if you bring in the Fin to get rid of the rocks, now you can help promote the growth of those plants (hair follicles) with Rogain and Nizoral.\n\n* 4: How will I know if it's working?\n\nYou will most likely get a hair shed. It will freak you out at first, but it is almost certainly a positive thing. Your hair will shed and it will regrow and be thicker and stronger.  It is not a scientific approach, but I absolutely recommend getting a hair snare for your shower and putting it down every time you wash your hair.  You need something with very small holes so your hair doesn't slip through them, [this is the one that I use](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000PSDGNA). You don't need to set this down in the drain if you have a flat drain of if it doesn't fit, just flip it over so it's sticking up and the water will still drain and it will still catch your hairs. This is just to monitor the general amount of hair that's lost when you shampoo. ***DO NOT SIT THERE AND COUNT EVERY HAIR***, it will be different every time because there are a ton of factors that would cause more or less hair on a daily basis.  All you're looking for is the general volume of hair that's left after you shower. You should notice it slowing down over the course of many months.  This is a long process, not overnight results, be patient.  When I first started there would be substantial amounts of hair left, but now it's down to maybe 20ish or so.\n\n* 5: How long until I see results?\n\nAt least a year, maybe more.  Again, this takes time, so be patient.  Your follicles will have to shed and regrow a slightly thicker hair several different hair cycles.  Personally it was probably 12 months before I could personally see changes, and probably 18-20 months before the changes were really apparent in pictures.  This is not an overnight fix, it will take time.\n\nYou will also go through shedding phases, try not to freak out.  First time it happened to me I was convinced that maybe the Fin I got was fake and I was losing all my progress.  The shed lasted for 3-4 weeks or so, then the hairfall went back to normal.  I wouldn't have realized any of this if I wasn't using that hair snare and able to monitor what was going on.\n\nHair sheds don't bother me anymore, but it took many years. I would always get stressed out once or twice a year whenever they happened, but the last 4 years or so I just shrug. In fact, I rarely even put the hair catch down anymore because it doesn't really concern me.\n\n***\n\n* 6: My personal shampoo routine\n\nMy shower and shampoo routine uses [Pura D'or shampoo and conditioner](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0716LTV5G).  It claims to help thinning hair, but again, it's not going to do anything by itself.  Personally I use it because I like the way my hair feels and looks when it's done. I also try to use sulphate-free shampoos to help keep my scalp cleaner.\n\nWash your hair with the shampoo, then shampoo with Nizoral.  The Niz needs to stay on your scalp for a bit to work, so I scrub down my body while I let the Niz sit on my head and do its work.  After that, rinse off and use the Pura D'or conditioner.\n\n* 7: How I help my hair volume/looks\n\nObviously this only really goes for the people who are NW3 or better, there's not much you can do if you're super super thin or an NW4+\n\nGet a blow dryer. Use this to dry your hair after you get out of the shower, it will give your hair more volume and make everything look thicker.\n\nDon't be afraid to change up your hairstyle. Like to comb it back or spike it up?  Too bad, it makes the thinning look that much worse. Cut it shorter on the sides and part it towards your weaker temple.  It also acts as a mini combover for your thinner scalp (*speaking from personal experience here*).|\n\nDon't underestimate how much better a professional haircut is. Back in the day I just went to Great Clips for their $12 haircuts. 50% of the time they were ok, 25% of the time I hated them, and 25% of the time the haircut looked good.  Now I go to a salon and pay $25 for a haircut and shampoo that I know will look good every time. Find someone that is good at cutting hair and only schedule cuts with them. This keeps your haircuts consistent and gives you someone that knows your hair and can maybe suggest different cuts and give you feedback.  Don't be bashful about your thinning hair, they've seen it all. \n\nPut some product in your hair. It can help hide the thinning a bit, and will give added texture to it. ***This is my best tip for hair volume***, use [Aveda Thickening Paste for your hair product](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N17SFYB).  Gives you some hold to style it, and makes it look thicker. I can't really stress enough how much better this makes my hair look, and continue to look for a few days after using it. Don't waste your money by getting 5oz of other hair paste from walmart or other brands. $25 isn't cheap, but you don't need to use much of this and it lasts me a LONG time. I last bought some on July 5th, and I probably still have another 2 months or so left. You can usually find it for a bit cheaper if there's a salon that sells Aveda products near you, but I just go for the easy Amazon factor and get it there.\n\nI style my hair by using a hair dryer to dry my hair until it's just barely damp, then I put a pea sized amount of the paste on my palms and spread it across my hands and run them through my hair. Then I hit the hair with the hair dryer for another 10 seconds or so to finish. Hair is fully dry in about 15-20 minutes, and then I take the palm of my hand and just run it lightly over my hair to break up the paste a bit get rid of the gelled look.\n\n\n***\n\nMy own progression/maintenance pictures\n\n[12 years ago](http://i.imgur.com/6uLYZPK.jpg)\n\n[12 years ago with totally dry/no product hair](http://i.imgur.com/79NQlEF.jpg) (\"That's not so bad!!!\" I know, it wasn't THAT bad, but it had gotten to that point in about 2 years, and it was only going to get worse.

        "body": "Ayoooo! Fellow tressless brothers! Glad the sticky is finally getting an update. Cool work Rawtashk, this is a good improvement to the previous guide and much more streamlined. I really like it. Good work!!\n\nI've been fighting hair loss since late 2012 so I'll give some of my experience in case it helps anyone:\n\n-The first thing is do not let the worry of hair loss take over your entire life. I spent every waking hour on hair loss forums and stuff and it's okay if you go through that phase, but KNOW things will get better. Nowadays I don't even think about it for days or even weeks lol.\n\n-By the same token, if you're gonna act, ACT NOW. I'm kindof a firm believer that if you have to ask if you're balding you most likely are. You never thought about asking that question til now so I think in a way a subconscious or conscious part of you is noticing and letting you know. It is really hard to accept at first so don't be too hard on yourself, but know the faster you act the better.\n\n-DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. Guides like these are amazing and you'll get tons of advice, but nothing beats doing your own research and deciding things with the peace of mind that brings. DO NOT stay with just one opinion, try to read as many opinions/studies as you can and then make up your mind.\n\nOn actual products:\n\n**Minoxidil**\n\nMy life saver. Saved my hair all through my twenties since 2013 til now. Advice:\n\n-If you REALLY want to keep your hair do 2x a day or don't waste your time. It makes a difference.\n\n-Make sure you cover the areas that need the most lovin'. I use 0.25 on different sides to really cover everything.\n\n-I swear by the Lipogaine brand but use any brand you like/is within your budget. FWIW I've never tried Rogaine but used Kirkland once. It was kinda bad and slippery but if you can afford it's still minox so keep at it.\n\n-Don't sweat it if you skip a day but try not to do it often. Consistency is the name of the game. In the 7+ years I've been on it I've probably missed less than 200 days. Possibly less than 150.\n\n**Ketoconazole**\n\nBack in the day I found like two studies that indicated that Keto used every other day could give results that are close to minox 5% so I started using it. In my experience if you can afford it without hassle go for it, but it's not make or break. A good support in the fight but not indispensable. I've done just fine without it. Haven't used it in probably a year or two and even then I was never as constant with it as I was with minox. Do NOT use every single day. The stuff is harsh on your hair.\n\n**Finasteride**\n\nI don't use it. My anecdotal experience is that I took a single pill in 2013 and that made my jizz watery and feeling down there SUCK for like 3 or 4 days. That was it for me lol.\n\nFrom everything I've read over the years I can say it DOES work for a good amount of people, maintains for some and doesn't work at all for a small percentage. I don't know the sides percentage but be aware that if you get the infamous \"crash\" you're gonna be in for quite possibly the worst ride of your life. Knock on wood for my fellow brothers in it.\n\nMy honest advice is this: Do your own, THOROUGH, research and then decide if you're willing to take the risk/chance or not. It's a difficult decision no matter what side of the aisle you're on so I think the most important thing is that you can be at peace with yourself and your decision no matter what. Good luck to everyone no matter what decision you made/will make. <3\n\n**Biotin**\n\nI think it might help thicken your hair somewhat but I honestly suspect it gave me gallbladder stones the fucks. I took 5000mg biotin pills (I read that if you take more than the recommended those you just pee it out so you could go as high as you wanted) and it started hurting around that time. I needed surgery for it lol. After the surgery I let some time happen then tried a biotin pill again and I felt kindof the same type of discomfort (Quite possibly in the kidney now). Fuck that. Never again lol.\n\nAnyways, my inbox is open for any questions or whatever. I know how hard the fight is. I was once in the shoes of many people just beginning their journey and I remember being nervous, scared, anxious. My mental state was definitely not good when it all began but I can safely say that I've been living my best life for some years also had some shitty ones (Cause of life not hair lol) and things pretty much stabilized at some point. Just know it gets better, but be dilligent and take action NOW!\n\nGood luck everyone. :) <3",

A year ago I had a full head of hair very dense just the slightest temple recession, but it still looked like a norwood 0 or 1 at worst. Fast forward one year im a norwood 3 and an extremely diffuse thinner. Its getting to the point where im losing hope. If this much happend in 1 year then im doomed in this hair loss battle. I know its genetic even tho literally everyone on both sides of my family has great hair and it probably “skipped a generation with me” but it makes me feel like im ill or sick. I look in the mirror and want to cry at my new appearance. Its overwhelming because it feels like it happened overnight. I dont even know what to do anymore. I would shave it and embrace it but my head shape does not suit bald I would look like an alien. This is so frustrating and depressing to deal with :(",

I've been suffering from hair loss the last few years, used Rogaine maybe for a month or two and stopped (Didn't see results quick and I stopped - Stupid I know). Fast forward to now, I've really lost alot of hair where you can see my scalp now. The hair on my crown is almost gone and it has really taken a toll on me now. I blame myself for letting it go as long as I did, as most dermatologist always told me to use \"Rogaine\" or there isn't anything you can do. I told myself this week that I was going to buckle down and begin researching and getting things in order to help regrow or preserve what I have left. Thank you so much for this guide, I don't know if I would of came across this information had I just searched the web.

While many people do apply tretinoin around their eyes, this can cause permanent damage to the oil glands in the eyes, and can result in permanently dry eyes. Remember that tretinoin travels up to 2\" below the skin, so you'll still get anti-aging benefits even if you don't apply right next to your eyes. Be safe, and protect your eyes: don't apply tretinoin near your eyes or on your eyelids. [Here's what the Mayo Clinic has to say about safe tretinoin application.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/tretinoin-topical-route/proper-use/drg-20066521#:~:text=Do%20not%20use%20this%20medicine,the%20tips%20of%20your%20fingers) (To learn more, search for \"Meibomian gland dysfunction\")\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Not all surgeries use Suggamadex so you should talk with a medical professional about it prior surgery, I'm told. Thanks guys!

    "body": "Hey guys, as the end of 2023 nears, I thought I'd do a post for those coming to this sub in desperate need of help.\n\n*I posted this to* r/tressless *recently and quite a few people reached out asking for me to post it in this sub as well, so here you go. Hope it helps :)*\n\nIn this post I’m going to be talking about the science of hair loss and what to do if you are balding and want to stop it.\n\nI’m a medical student and have donated a lot of my personal time to pharmacology, hormones and hair protocols through research and experimentation. There’s a lot going on here on Reddit, and as a beginner it can be very daunting to decide on what to do. Obviously everything should be discussed with your doctor, but below is my best attempt at a guide to explain a little bit about hair loss:\n\n\\-\n\nI first noticed I was balding around 12 months ago, and rather than get caught up in the genetics of hair loss and trying to figure out whether it was Dad, my Mum’s Dad, my Mum’s Dad’s Dad or the goldfish he owned when he was 10, I thought to myself:\n\n>I can’t change my **genetics**. Whatever my DNA sequencing (genomic regions) has in store for me in regards to balding, that’s pretty much set. The best I can do is fight as long as I can using the highest quality science, products and methodologies to offset it.\n\nAnd that’s what I’ve been doing, with good success, over the past 12 months.\n\nLet’s get into it, and I’m going to do this in order of most important to least (in my opinion).\n\n**Getting to the root cause: DHT**\n\nOkay, so if we look at the entire testosterone/HPT axis pathway, cholesterol is converted to testosterone and some people think that’s the end of the line, but it’s actually not; 5-alpha reductase (5A1/2 in the image **below**) is the enzyme responsible for converting Testosterone (T) to its much more potent form DHT (dihydrotestosterone).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[5-alpha reductase converts Testosterone to DHT, the hair killer.](https://preview.redd.it/n6y4w3vdhy6c1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bdb73986cc2ec66db0b0c603f31a09b0a6533e86)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, interestingly, 5-alpha reductase for whatever reason is very high prevalent in skin tissue - including the human scalp. ***And side note***: this is why guys who take testosterone gel or cream often have very high levels of DHT compared to guys who take injections, because the cream is being converted through the skin into DHT at a much higher rate than injectable esters into muscle bellies. But, basically, it is this 5-alpha reductase activity in the scalp that is converting testosterone to DHT, and DHT through a variety of mechanisms leads to follicular miniaturisation (hair thinning, and eventual loss of your hair follicles).\n\nBut **why**? Well, there are hundreds of factors: hormonal (androgen receptor density & sensitivity to said androgens), physical, genetic, environmental. The list goes on.\n\nNote; [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4174066/) goes into a lot more depth for those of you interested.\n\n*But, how do we actually combat balding?*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Most men tend to lose their hair in patterns as described by the famous Norwood Scale.](https://preview.redd.it/flz77b1ihy6c1.jpg?width=1050&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a280213c646ca2a81008fac2f70a2fb91df53426)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Slowing Down Male Pattern Baldness**\n\n**5-alpha Reductase Inhibitors (Finasteride, Dutasteride):**\n\nWith how much I’ve spoken about 5-alpha reductase and DHT, it seems logical that stopping this conversion of Testosterone to DHT is the absolute first line of defence against hair loss.\n\nTo really, truly combat hair loss, the first mechanism is as follows: **you absolutely need to reduce your hair follicles’ exposure to DHT.**\n\nAnd how do we do this? Well, finasteride is a drug that acts as a **5-alpha reductase inhibitor**. Sold under the name **Propecia**, the molecule is a strong 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, and has been shown to inhibit around 70% of serum (blood) levels of DHT from peak. The usual starting dose is 1mg daily. Dutasteride (sold under the name **Avodart**) is an even more potent inhibitor (usual starting daily dose is 0.5mg), and can block up to 98% of conversion from T to DHT: it is a much more potent inhibitor of the enzyme that converts T to DHT. Dutasteride would be an option if you wanted a nuclear option to block almost all DHT. In fact, one of my favourite [studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15126539/) compared the difference between Finasteride vs. Dutasteride, and as you can see below, the suppression of DHT levels from Dutasteride was significantly more than Finasteride. Not only this, but the half life of Dutasteride is significantly longer than Finasteride (\\~8 hours vs. 5 weeks!), and you can see that in the Dutasteride group after stopping treatment (Follow-up Period), DHT levels remained suppressed for a much longer time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[DHT vs. Finasteride - what a study.](https://preview.redd.it/n4xi7k5khy6c1.jpg?width=902&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=60e4cec6b02d753cfcf88949b6f042e4e01c23c9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSide effects from 5-alpha reductase inhibitors are rare, although we should speak about them. Online, through various forums, Reddit posts, YouTube videos and TikTok’s time and time again I see posts about nasty Finasteride side effects, post-Finasteride syndrome and how Rob can’t get his Johnson hard anymore because of Finasteride, so his girlfriend left him.\n\nNow, don’t get me wrong, side effects have been noted, although current research puts the risk of side effects at around [1-3% of people](https://www.drugwatch.com/propecia/side-effects/), so even though online there is a lot of noise about finasteride and its side effects, I personally don’t think the research supports this scaremongering. There is also going to be a natural selection bias with the stories online, because the guy for whom Finasteride is working well and who is not experiencing any side effects, he isn’t really going to post. Because why would he? He’s doing fine.\n\nHowever, I absolutely sympathise with the people who just cannot tolerate 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. Side effects can be very real, and this is why it is vitally important to always consult with a qualified doctor before deciding on any medication: I’m just presenting the science. Everyone reacts slightly differently, and these can be strong medications - so it's important to be well-informed and sensible with whatever path you and your medical practitioner decide to go down.\n\n**Topical Minoxidil 5% (Rogaine):**\n\nMinoxidil is a compound that has been shown to increase the rate of DNA synthesis in anagen (growth phase) bulbs of hair follicles. Basically minoxidil stimulates hair cells to move from telogen (resting phase) to anagen (growing phase) - so instead of having hair follicles resting, it is telling the body to move them back into a growth phase by shortening the resting phase. The idea here is that you get more ‘regrowth’ of hair follicles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/siqcfdpmhy6c1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac56d4b93fa442dd69e8e528ebccc6ced1d40a12\n\nMinoxidil stimulates hair cells to shorten the resting (telogen) phase and go back into an anagen (growing phase). Often, progress pictures will show significant new regrowth or ‘baby’ hairs growing with minoxidil treatment.\n\nI apply *Rogaine*, a 5% strength Minoxidil foam twice daily in areas that I feel are receding. The nice thing about the foam is that it isn’t super sticky (unlike some people report with the gel), and it also acts as a nice way to hold my hair throughout the day, like hair product.\n\nAs you can see from the photo below, there is a vast difference between telogen (resting phase) and anagen (growing phase), and the idea is that the more hairs you can keep in anagen, the more healthy your hair will be, by limiting the amount of follicles that inevitably go through an anagen restart and die off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Come on little baby hairs! Grow!](https://preview.redd.it/zj94e0xqhy6c1.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3942dea0d9bc60cbc5f686850678e1e93f566876)\n\nThere is also the option of oral minoxidil, which anecdotally at least seems to be very powerful at regenerating ‘baby’ hairs (or, new regrowth). Again, oral minoxidil can have some pretty significant side effects and drug interactions with blood pressure medications, so speaking through with your doctor is key!\n\n**Ketoconazole Shampoo:**\n\nThis shampoo is primarily an anti-dandruff shampoo, but research has shown it may increase the proportion of hairs in anagen phase (growth phase) - resulting in reduced hair shedding. [This study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18498517/) showed that 1% ketoconazole shampoo increased hair diameter over baseline after 6 months of use and reduced shedding. Interestingly, participants’ hair diameter also increased over baseline, showing that it may play a role in creating thicker hair.\n\nNizoral is a common brand here in Australia of 2% strength ketoconazole shampoo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7v1n7jmuhy6c1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe9ce28ca47c63f85e48b2bd7b633304984414c4\n\nWhat is good about ketoconazole, is that it’s also a weak androgen receptor antagonist. What does this mean? It means it competes with DHT and Testosterone for binding to the active binding domain on the human AR (androgen receptor). If a compound can bind to a receptor without influencing its usual effects, it is said to be an **antagonist**. Basically, if ketoconazole can get into an androgen receptor before Testosterone or DHT, it will occupy that site and block T/DHT from binding and starting their usual process of killing off hair follicles (follicular miniaturisation).\n\nGoodbye DHT, nobody wants you here.\n\n**Dermarolling**\n\nDerma-what?\n\nDermarolling is the process of creating micro punctures in the scalp skin to induce a wound healing response, with an array of tiny microneedles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h00i0hnwhy6c1.jpg?width=1082&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0af7396fe22eee3ec5d1fbb7f0a63f340649b71\n\nIn this [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3746236/), the dermarolling + minoxidil treated group was statistically superior to the minoxidil only treated group in promoting hair growth in men with balding patterns, for all primary efficacy measures of hair growth. In fact, the microneedling group outperformed even the minoxidil group in terms of how much hair was regrown after 12 weeks:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mm7v28uyhy6c1.jpg?width=741&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7530984fd25b7987560033104629c678836c6e93\n\nThe mechanism seems to be that continued microtrauma to the scalp skin leads to a release of platelet derived growth factors and other growth factors that are sent to the area of scalp, to aid in the skin wound regeneration. The added benefit is that there seems to be some carry over effect to hair growth, as dermarolling seems to activate stem cells or ‘unspecialised’ cells that are yet to be differentiated, and differentiate them into hair follicle cells, meaning more hair growth. Basically, its a wound healing response that brings growth factors to the area of the scalp to increase hair growth.\n\nI have played around with a few different protocols, but I use a 1.5mm roller and roll horizontally, vertically and diagonally for about 30 seconds in areas where my hairline is thinning or receding. I do this every 10 days. You don’t want to press so hard that you draw blood, but it should also hurt slightly. I mean, putting hundreds of tiny spikes into your scalp isn’t really my idea of Sunday night fun. But hey, if it regrows some hair why not?\n\nThere are also derma-stamps and motorised tools, all of which assist with the end goal: creating a wound healing response to bring growth factors to the scalp, and potentially assist the penetration of Minoxidil deeper into the scalp skin tissue.\n\n**Natural DHT blocking compounds:**\n\nNatural DHT blockers are also options, although obviously the results aren’t going to be nearly as strong as what is mentioned above.\n\nSome people have good results (anecdotally) with rosemary oil applied topically, green tea and saw palmetto are options here. However, the science is very hit and miss, and in any event, I can’t see natural compounds competing against the 'Big 4'.\n\n**RU58841:**\n\nNow, that’s all good, but what if you need a nuclear chemical. Something that would attack the androgen receptor at a direct level in your scalp? Well, that compound is below. But a quick **warning**: I do not recommend this compound. A lot of people use it, but that doesn’t mean it’s safe. There is no (yes, zero) long-term safety data on the compound below, and whether you choose to take a completely untested chemical is up to you. But I don’t recommend it - have I said that enough?\n\nAlright so, apart from sounding like a bunch of random letters because your cat ran over your keyboard, RU58841 is a strong DHT blocker (it has been shown to inhibit around 70% of DHT binding to the androgen receptor), but not in the way that Finasteride or Dutasteride work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The chemical structure of RU58841.](https://preview.redd.it/pjcxd447jy6c1.png?width=1027&format=png&auto=webp&s=883a2d0bbe6744e9c96613e38405883fe99f1c8a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInstead of finasteride and dutasteride which work on inhibiting the 5-alpha reductase enzyme, RU58841 works on the AR itself - occupying the active site, so that when DHT tries to get in and exert its hair destructive effects in the scalp, it can’t, it’s literally ***blocked*** from accessing the active site of the androgen receptor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[RU58841 operates like an androgen receptor antagonist \\(3rd receptor, on the right\\). It binds to the receptor and stops testosterone and DHT from binding, meaning that DHT cannot then exert its hair miniaturisation effects.](https://preview.redd.it/qi851jy8jy6c1.png?width=1213&format=png&auto=webp&s=4242c8ff517eb5525f98e4721318789d0f7600b6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd in [this study](https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-e5b77395-5e0e-3da3-bef2-0eadea69c845), RU58841 was found to inhibit 70% of DHT binding. Combining something like finasteride or dutasteride which attacks 5-alpha reductase converting T to DHT with RU58841 which stops \\~70% of DHT binding to the androgen receptor, and you’d now be attacking hair loss from 2 *vectors*: **T to DHT conversion, as well as at a receptor level**. Now you can start to understand why this is a nuclear option for hair loss, and incredibly powerful.\n\nHowever, despite how good all of that sounds in practice, just remember, RU58841 is completely untested in regards to side effects. There is no long-term safety data on how it may or can impact human health, so what I’m saying (for legal reasons) is don’t use it. Get what I’m saying?\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nAnd, there it is guys. Now, just a quick note, this isn’t a super comprehensive list of all supplements for a hair regrowth/hair protection protocol, but is a solid start.\n\nThere are certainly more ‘niche’ options, or compounds in development now that may be promising (or not, looking at you Phase 3 of Pyrilutamide trials), but this guide was just the bare basics for a beginner to wrap his head around (no pun intended) the science and how to start combatting AGA.\n\nIn particular, if you want to save your hair, it’s going to be the ‘**big 4**’: finasteride (or Dutasteride), Minoxidil, Ketoconazole shampoo and derma-rolling roughly once a week to every 2 weeks.\n\nThis would follow the best possible science that we have at the moment, in terms of targeting as many vectors as possible:\n\n1. T to DHT blockade (5-alpha reductase inhibitors, Fin/Dut)\n2. Anagen/telogen manipulation (Minoxidil)\n3. Localised scalp tissue androgen receptor antagonism (Keto, RU58841)\n4. Wound healing response cascade (physical microneedling/trauma)\n\nHope you enjoyed and got something out of this guide! My social links are on my profile if interested in more.",

    "body": "Picures of before after: [https://imgur.com/a/DfCHQUu](https://imgur.com/a/DfCHQUu)\n\nHello everyone, I've been a long time lurker of this sub & I wanted to start by saying how grateful I am for this community. I am highlighting in every paragraph important element in case you don't feel like reading the whole post.\n\nFirstly, I am incredibly sorry if you’re reading this & find yourself relating. I know how frustrating it is to know something is wrong with your skin & not knowing how to help. Having doctors prescribe the pill, acutane, retinoids, spending thousands on acids, facials, only to realize you don’t even have acne, just a stubborn fungi living rent free on your face. & then having to ditch your beloved products, that work well on others, & spend yet again to buy FA safe products. Being paranoid about touching your face, having to switch pillowcases everyday to not reinfect, i know i know. & don’t even get me started on all the looks you get from family members & people you talk with, it is honestly depressing but just know it gets better. At least you are here, at least you know the source of it all & you can start on fixing it. Thankfully, it’s not a difficult thing to treat, it just requires care, patience & consistence\n\n**My first flair up** was over a year ago. I had a bunch of redness of my face the day before a wedding, & was given the advice of wearing an overnight castor oil mask (yikes). I woke up the next day & every single on of my pores was a white head... I popped them all & applied foundation, attended the wedding & my skin eventually healing a few weeks later.\n\nA few months later, I went to a L'Oréal sale where I bought a bottle of Garnier Ombrelle sunscreen. I also got a lash lift and was scared to damage my lashes so I started applying castor oil overnight. This was **the beginning of my downfall**. During my sleep, the oil would smear on my cheeks & the sunscreen broke me out daily. At first, it was a few pimples on my face. After popping them everyday, I would try to calm my skin down with any oil I had laying around (castor, almond, avocado, grape seed, etc.)\n\nEvery time I would use the oil, the breakout would get worse, but instead of big pimples, it was dozens of tiny white heads. I eventually got really sick of it & went to my doctor. He prescribed Differin & warned me about the dryness, at the same time, I cut out every chemical skincare & resorted to natural products (including oils, lol). So i would apply a thick moisturizer every night & top it up an oil or vaseline. Since it's a retinoid, I also continued using (heavily) the Garnier suncreen... I waited over a month thinking I was just purging until I literally had a mental breakdown one night.\n\nI got really sick & tired of looking this bad, & realized my acne which i had been dealing with for years now (Not fungal at first) was tearing my confidence appart. What is the point of putting on makeup, jewelry, cute clothes & do my hair when my skin looked diseased? Doctors were no help, they put me on Differin & blamed all my pimples on the natural purging of Differin. My acne was keeping me up at night, sometimes it was itchy, the masks made it worse, I could not focus in class, was avoiding my (supportive) boyfriend, made no friends, etc. This is when I started heavily searching the subject. I found out I had Malassezia Follucilitis & Differin was doing absolutely nothing to help that.\n\n**What I wish I knew**:\n\n**fungal acne does not look the same on everyone**, which is a detail that kept me from addressing my own FA for months. The way people were describing it was not what I had exactly & picture never seemed to match. Mine manifested in:\n\n**- dozens of clusters of tiny white heads in all my pores**\n\n**- redness all over my face once the whiteheads disapeared**\n\n**- It was really bad on my chin, cheeks & the middle of my forehead. It never spread all over my cheekbones & side of the forehead.**\n\n**-It was rarely itchy or dry.**\n\n**-It was also very cyclic (which I believe is because I did not use oils everyday & did not apply sunscreen when I had online school).**\n\n**- I also had dandruff in my eyebrows, which is an obvious sign of fungi, but I thought it was the dryness of Differin.**\n\n**- it was stubborn to every product, acide, retinol, retinoid, washes, masks, facials, you name it**\n\n**- you have the feeling it is NOT acne, seriously trust your instincts, you deal with your skin everyday you know more about it than any person (who is not a dermatologist)**\n\nI then discovered **Simple Skincare Science**, my bible. I first used Nizoral & it worked pretty much instantly. I washed my face with it & the next day I woke up with a clear face for the first time in months. Although my face felt very dry, it was healthy at the moment, Nizoral will cause dryness that is normal.\n\nI later read the whole blog of simple science skincare, & realized my sunscreen, lash oil & day moisturizer were the culprit. I stopped using all three (which were garner ombrelle sunscreen, castor oil & The Ordinary moisturizer) & switched to coppertone gel sunscreen & eucerin healing ointment.\n\nFor about a week of this, my skin stayed well behaved & I finally saw the light at the end of the tunnel. Through this treatment, I kept using Differin & would sometimes wash with Panoxyl to make sure normal acne wouldn’t show up.\n\nThen… **I fucked up**. Firstly, the constant use of Nizoral was killing my moisture barrier, & i could tell but I was too stubborn to stop. Then, I committed the terrible mistake of wearing foundation for 2 hours, thinking if i washed it off immediately after, there’s no way it would have time to react. WRONG. I honestly believe I had my foundation on for like 1h30 minutes but i’ll say 2 for good measure. On top of that, I was wearing a mask which basically created a luxury buffet for the fungi to feed on. Upon removing my makeup, everything seemed alright, I washed with Nizoral again just to be safe (lol) & the next day, I woke up with a breakout that reminded me of my era before learning about FA. It was terrible. All over my face again, tiny whiteheads. That same day, I bought CeraVe Baby lotion because I was sick of the thickness of Eucerin & was longing for a normal light moisturizer. I tried to not panic when I woke up & simply did another Nizoral mask (lol again). As soon as I washed it off, my face was super red & tingling. I thought the dryness was causing it, so I applied the CeraVe moisturizer & proceeded to experience what I would describe as lava on my face. The burning was SO bad. The moisturizer is obviously not at fault here, **my moisturize barrier was just officially fucked**.\n\nSo I stopped all treatments & repaired my moisture barrier. It took me a little less than a week which makes me think maybe it wasn't very damaged, thankfully. Despite, the fungal acne was still there. I booked an appointement with my doctor because no dermatologists are available in my city (little tip for you, call it a **fungal INFECTION**. Doctors who are not specialized in skin problems hear the word acne & immediately think BACTERIA. Keep the word acne out of your mouth & you'll get what you need). I was prescribed:\n\n\\- Nizoral in the form of a cream (doesn't dry like the shampoo), so basically **Ketoconazole 2% cream**\n\n\\- **50Mg of Fluconazole** to take in the span of two weeks. He kept the dosage low because it can be damaging for my liver, I need a blood test when I am done with the pills.\n\n**It took two days to completely clear my skin.**\n\n**My routine now**:\n\nAM:\n\n\\-wash face with just cold water\n\n\\-ketoconazol 2% cream\n\n\\-Cerave Baby Lotion\n\n\\-Coppertone gel sunscreen\n\nPM:\n\n\\-wash with Panoxyl\n\n\\-apply Differin\n\n\\-take 50mg of Fluconazole\n\n\\-Eucerin healing ointment\n\nI sometimes use 100% plant-derived squalane oil from The Ordinary to gua sha.\n\n**what to take from this post**:\n\n\\-if you're already in this sub, you're lucky\n\n\\-it gets better\n\n\\-you don't have acne\n\n\\-once it's clear, you are not out of the woods, keep an FA safe routine\n\n\\-if you can't access a dermatologist, you'll be fine",

Let me just say that when you are someone with super dry skin, getting rid of fungal acne is a huge bitch. Over the past 2 years I accidentally ruined my moisture barrier so many times. Now I've finally made a routine that works for me but it was quite troublesome to figure out what does and doesn't work. You really have to get used to watching your skin to notice what it looks like it can or cannot take. I had a hard time with this because despite all this time my skin just is too sensitive to take the use of any kind of actives or other acne treatments more often than every 3 days or so. So, I would keep just drying out my skin too much and making it worse all over again.\n\nMy FA was also mostly in the form of tons of tiny pustules too, though it was basically just in my t-zone, primarily on my forehead. I also had eyebrow dandruff and sometimes scalp dandruff. It's been an annoying road figuring this stuff out, but I am pretty sure that if I didn't have to wear a mask so much my face would be 100% clear.",

    "body": "Warning this will be a long post, it has everything I've learnt in the past couple of years from hair growth, to styling, to weightloss, to nervous system regulation and more.\n\nI'm in my early 30s, I have 3B hair, tall, two years ago I was obese, prediabetic, I had anxiety problems, now I'm just a tall \\[seemingly ;) \\] effortlessly pretty black girl and I want all my beauties on here to have my beauty secrets.\n\nTopics discussed:\n\n* Haircare\n* Style\n* Makeup \n* Teeth\n* Skincare\n* Weight loss vs Fat loss\n* Healthy Fat loss\n* Body Recomposition \n* Inflammation\n* Gut Health\n* How to lower androgen/testosterone levels\n* Nervous System Regulation/Stress Management \n* Tea Cycling\n* Seed Cycling \n\n# Hair\n\nI have PCOS so it affects my hair growth and causes hirsutism, basically male patterened facial hair and male patterned baldness.\n\n**Hair Growth:** Here is the true secret sauce to hair growth, stimulating your scalp. I do daily scalp massages with a bamboo brush (even the bristles are made of rounded bamboo) very gentle. This is the one I use: [Golab Beauty](https://golabbeauty.com/products/organic-bamboo-scalp-massager-hair-brush)  I do short strokes which prevents any tangles. Morning and Night. I then go in with a scalp serum, I use The Oui scalp serum but it costs a pretty penny. In the first yearish I used (The 'Ordinary' Haircare Growth Set Multi-Peptide Serum For Hair Density) which worked wonders and was cost effective. At nights I seal with any scalp oil that has rosemary oil. Sadly Mielle's formula no longer works for me, but As I Am rosemary oil has been working, I also like the Camille Rose Rosemary Oil Strengthening Hair and Scalp Drops. For Washing my hair I suffer from sebaceous dermatitis which causes scaliness. Paradoxically my scalp is so oily which is what triggers the ezcema and develops the dry patches. Reversing my PCOS symptoms fixed this but what also helped was the Nizoral shampoo with 1% Ketoconazole. It's harsh so I do it once to twice a month at most and I always follow up with a moisturizing shampoo, and of course finish with a wash out conditioner & leave in conditioner.\n\n**Hair Retention:** This is the info we all know about preventing breakage but I'll include just in case. Hair growth happens in the scalp like said before but to retain that growth it's important to wear protective hairstyles (especially while asleep), a silk/satin bonnet or wrap, silk/satin pillowcase, do not let your hair air dry at night. There is debate about this but I've seen hair specialists and scientists say our hair is especially fragile when wet (especially curly/kinky hair). Therefore, we are much more prone to snags and breakage while our hair is wet. So going to bed make sure your hair is dried. If you're air drying your hair during the day try not to touch it too much  - as little manipulation as possible. Personally choose to diffuse/blow dry my hair and this has prevented most of the breakage I was previously experiencing. Lastly, moisturize and oil your ends. I won't pretend like I know which order is best or even if it's important but I've found that using hair moisturizer/diluted leave in conditioner then hair oil works best for me.\n\n**Hirsutism/Facial Hair:** Spearmint essential oil. I add 1-2 drops of the oil to my moisturizer each time I put on my moisturizer and it helped A LOT with reducing my facial hair. I also drink a lot of spearmint tea. Spearmint specifically has been proven to lower androgen/testosterone levels which is why it helps. I also took supplements which I'll include at the end because they served multiple purposes. Be sure not to add the oil to the entire bottle because that will ruin your moisturizer's formula. Just add the drops in your palm/finger tips and mix in your face cream each time you moisturize your jawline, chin, underneck. Also, do this after moisturizing the upper part of your face without the oil because it's harsh and the scent can be irritating to your eye area.\n\n**Body hair:** Personally I sugar wax my arms and legs, the hair has grown back so thin now. I make it myself and follow tutorials from abetweene on youtube.\n\n**Hair colour/Hairstyle:** This will depend on your face shape and color season. I'm a dark winter colour season and I have a heart face shape. I used the Dressika app to discover my color season before I could afford to get myself professionally assessed and I got the same results. Just be sure to use natural lighting, like by a window. Once you have your colour season you can choose hair colours that work best for you (although natural almost always works best). For my hairstyle I try to choose styles that compliment my heart shaped face. I used the youtube channel Dear Peachie to help me with figuring this out.\n\n# Style\n\nI think most of us know about **Kibbe and colour seasons.** This was how I upgraded my wardrobe. I'm a soft dramatic so I wear things that work for my tall height and accentuate my waist.\n\nThis was the game changer with colour seasons. Most of us know about our true seasons, but it can get restrictive. Sister seasons and colour dissonance is also helpful to know.\n\nMy colour season is dark winter, so my sister seasons would be dark autumn and true winter. Thid gives me more wiggle room to style myself.\n\n**Dissonance** are colours that are outside your true season and your sister seasons, you sprinke this in to add interest. Think of an outfit that is extremely matchy and cohesive but has that one accessory or item that stands out and adds interest. It's really fun in art and in fashion.\n\nFor my **shoes** I've started wearing dancing heels which help my flat feet lol and look stylish. Heel insoles help too, as well as the product Shoe Gummi. I still can't last more than 2, 3 hours at most but it's definitely bearable compared to before.\n\nMatching pajamas and loungewear. You just feel so luxurious dressing up at home and they can (should) be comfy :)\n\n**Accessories:**\n\n* I wear glasses that work with my heart shaped face.\n* I have a neutral leaning warm undertone so I wear gold jewelry, if I wear pearls or other gem stones I mix in gold to provide more harmony with my skin.\n* Perfume, wear what works with your body chemistry. Some smell delictable on people I know and icky on me, and vice versa. Wear what works for you.\n* Nails, press ons. So convenient, so cheap.\n* Hair accessories, bows, barretes, clips, scrunchies, a ribbon, you could be wearing jeans and a t shirt but a simple hair accessory upgrades the look automatically.\n\n# Makeup\n\nI used the youtube channel Dear Peachie to help me with finding eye looks, brows, blush placement for my face shape\n\nI have a low visual weight face and I am a romantic ingenue, because of this I go for more subtle looks that emphasis two facial features maximum at a time (eyes, lips, cheeks).\n\nDon't get me wrong I love glam bold makeup but soft and subtle makes me glow, I turn heads when my makeup is done like this.\n\n# Teeth\n\n* Wax free floss (Cocofloss $10 expensive but I love it 😅, Burst black floss, Moon graphite floss, Twice floss, Dr. Jen’s silk floss)\n* Oil pulling (coconut oil with clove & tea tree oil, or Guru Nanda oil pulling product)\n* Brush teeth\n* Tongue scraper (not everyday, couple of times a week and not too hard)\n* Alcohol free mouthwash (TheraBreath)\n* More so related to my lip area but I try to use wrinkle preventing straws or when I do use regular straws, I place it on the side of my mouth. The reason this works is because puckering the lips excessively causes smokers lines/wrinkles around the mouth. \n\n# Skin\n\nSkincare. This was something that took me a while to work on because of my PCOS, age, weight and etc.\n\n**Facial Care:** The basics includes chemical exfoliation, retinol, moisturizer/recover. I cycle my nightly skincare routine with this in mind and always keep the same morning routine. Mornings look like this (Jojoba oil to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, vitamin c/peptide serum, moisturizer with a drop or two of glycerin, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, finish with sunscreen).\n\nMy nights I alternate these routines in this order\n\nNight 1 - Chemical Exfoliation (Oil cleanser to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, glycolic/lactic acid, moisturizer with a drop or two of glycerin, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, castor oil on lashes and brows)\n\nNight 2 - Retinol (Oil cleanser to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, retinol, moisturizer, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, castor oil on lashes and brows)\n\nNight 3 - Moisturizer/Recovery (Oil cleanser to help while I use my gua sha, Water based cleanser, eye cream, retinol, moisturizer with a drop or two of glycerin, rosehip oil as sealant on entire face, spearmint oil mixed with face cream on the jawline & neck area, castor oil on lashes and brows)\n\n*Repeat Night 1 - 3 (sometimes I need more days to recover if my skin is sensitive or acting up, do what works for you personally)*\n\nOther things that I've done/used to help: red light therapy (helps with both hair growth, so I use it on my scalp, and with stretch marks so I use it on my face and body), Microcurrent device (helps with collagen production and stretchmarks) - I use the brand NuFace & NuBody, Volufiline (a skin serum I mix with eye cream that helps with hollowness under the eyes, Kigelia Africana Skin Cream (I use the brand Maelys B-Perky which contains this ingredient and helped to tighten my chest area and my loose skin on the area),  face yoga and myo fascia face massage, these help with the tautness of my face (basically everything else helps with wrinkles, these exercises and the microcurrent helps and prevents, sagging especially jowls). I follow tutorials I search for from youtube.\n\n**Body Care:** Similar to facial care body care includes exfoliation, retinol, moisturizer/recover\n\nNight 1 - Physical Exfoliation (Dry brush/Body Scrub, Hydrating lotion with a few drops of glycerin, rosehip oil as sealant on entire body)\n\nNight 2 - Retinol (Jojoba oil to help while I use my gua sha, retinol body wash, retinol body lotion)\n\nNight 3 - Moisturizer/Recovery (Jojoba oil to help while I use my gua sha, Hydrating lotion with a few drops of glycerin, rosehip oil as sealant on entire body)\n\n*Again, repeat Night 1 - 3 use more days for recovery if needed*\n\n**Stretch marks/loose skin:** Whether due to weight gain, pregnancy, etc. we can't ever truly get rid of loose skin or stretch marks but moisturizing the skin and derma rolling can help with the appearance. Especially derma rolling. Do NOT derma roll while pregnant but you can do so after when you’ve recovered and talk to your doctor (if you've had a c section you have to wait before derma rolling). I used this video as motivation [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChG8aSvEU6A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChG8aSvEU6A)\n\nFor the body I never went beyond 1.5mm it worked for my deepest stretch marks. If this is too aggressive 1.0mm still works just as well. Make sure you use 70% alcohol as this is what experts say is better at disinfecting. It has more water, which helps it to dissolve more slowly, penetrate cells, and kill bacteria. The disinfecting power of rubbing alcohol drops at concentrations higher than 80%-85%. Make sure you disinfect the derma roller before and after use, and make sure you disinfect your area of contact before rolling as well. Do not do heavy workouts workout or sweat inducing activities for at least 3 days after and avoid harsh products.\n\nI started derma rolling while working on losing weight (at the beginning of my journey while still obese) and continued a year after losing 130lbs. Derma rolling works by causing micro tears, the skin heals the area and in the process of doing so develops more collagen - leading to thicker skin, lighter stretch marks and tighter skin. Since I did this before losing the weight it helped my skin adapt a lot. I won't pretend like I have 0 loose skin or stretch marks but it's barely visible. Someone has to be intimately close to notice. Obviously genetics, how slowly you lose the weight, diet, and moisturizing the skin helps but my PCOS contributed to low collagen (thin skin) and so the derma rolling really helped.\n\n# Weight loss vs Fat loss\n\n**Tons of info here but I promise if you read through it helps to know this stuff.**\n\nWeightloss comes down to calories in versus calories out. I know that's rudely simpliflied and not that easy, but it truly is the answer to **weightloss** (which may be fat, water, or muscle). This is why people can eat barely nothing, lose weight but their shape stays the same (basically skinny fat). It's also why fasting or going low carb works so fast (water weight is the first to go).\n\nFatloss on the other hand is more complicated. This involves our TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure).\n\nTDEE includes: Resting/Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), Metabolic Equivalent of Task or Exercise activity thermogenesis  (EAT), Non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), Thermic Effect of Food (TEF), and Adaptive Thermogenesis (AT).\n\n**BMR (\\~70% daily energy)** the energy taken to exist, so tasks like breathing. Your sex, body composition (muscle to fat ratio), age, and genetics play a role in this  \n**EAT (\\~5% daily energy)** the energy taken for exercise weight lifting, swimming, high intensity walks, etc.  \n**NEAT (\\~15% daily energy)** the energy taken for non exercise movements like walking, fidgeting, showering, standing, etc  \n**TEF (\\~10% daily energy depending on the macronutrients of your meal)** the energy taken to digest, protein has the highest TEF of all the macronutrients, Carbs have a TEF of around 5-10%, while Fats have the lowest TEF, around 0-3%.\n\n**Adaptive Thermogenesis (AT)** is the changes in energy expenditure (energy used) that occur in response to changes in energy balance. For example when you eat more food than you need, your body may increase energy expenditure to prevent weight gain eg. move more, eat less the next day, etc.. On the other hand, when you eat less food than you need, your body may decrease energy expenditure to conserve energy and prevent weight loss eg. less movement, eat more the next day.\n\nOther things that affect AT include diet composition (eg high/low protein, high/low carb, calorie dense foods, etc), physical activity (eg. weights vs. cardio), and environmental factors such as temperature and altitude.\n\nThings that influence AT can make weight management challenging, as it can lead to plateaus or rebounds in weight loss efforts. This is why lack of sleep, hormonal issues, aging, etc. makes weightloss harder.\n\n*Here is a clearer example of this*\n\nThings that affect calories in:\n\n* 8-9 Hours of sleep (Maintains metabolic homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, hormonal processes). Compromised sleep lead to:\n   * Increased Gherlin (hunger hormone - feeling hungrier & therefor eating more)\n   * Decreased Leptin (sensation of satiety - needing to eat more to feel full)\n* Insulin resistance: This is when the cells in your muscles, fat, and liver don't respond well to insulin and can't easily take up glucose from your blood. This results in excessive sugar in the blood & as a result the body produces more insulin in order to try to help the cells obtain the energy from glucose. This leads to weight gain as the insulin increases hunger. Also, since the body is insulin resistant, the excess glucose is converted to fat for long-term storage.\n   * Things that can cause insulin resistance: PCOS, Inactivity/sedentary lifestyle, family history of diabetes, gestational diabetes, hypertension, alcohol abuse, poor sleep habits, high cholesterol levels, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, high bodyweight, acromegaly\n\nThings that affect calories out:\n\n* Body Composition (Fat to muscle ratio) \n* Gut health\n* Compromised sleep affects our energy levels which leads to\n   * Decreased NEAT (Non exercise activity thermogenesis)\n* Hypothyroidism (lowered levels of T3 and T4)\n   * Thyroid hormones T3 and T4 affects every cell and all the organs in your body by regulating the rate at which your body uses calories/energy which is known as our bmr, meaning this affects your metabolic rate.\n* Too few calories lowers daily NEAT\n   * By eating below your BMI (calories needed to perform basic biological processes), your body makes up for this through energy conservation by lowering your NEAT (non exercise activity thermogenesis). Basically you lack the energy to perform your normal daily activities. This also affects your body composition and cardio health as you become sedentary (stop moving as much).\n\n# Healthy Fat loss\n\nSo to lose fat in a healthy way you need to:\n\n1. Get enough sleep (8-9 hours per night)\n2. **Manage your stress levels/nervous system regulation**\n3. **Look after your gut health**\n4. **Manage inflammation**\n5. Increase your daily steps (8-10k per day)\n6. **Weight lift**\n7. **Eat high protein (protein takes the most amount of energy to digest).**\n8. **Manage your insulin resistence**\n9. **Eat in a caloric deficit (make sure your calories in do not exceed calories out).**\n\nFuther information about the bold items in the list is included below. Also, I know this all seems overwhelming but keep in mind you are creating a lifestyle change. This is not a quick fix. \n\nTo **manage your insulin resistance** (info from the book Glucose Goddess by Jessie Inchauspé):\n\n* Eat within an hour of waking up\n* Protein with breakfast\n* Tablespoon of apple cider vinegar before each meal (diluted in a glass of water)\n* Eat foods in this order, veggies -> protein -> fat -> starches -> carbs -> sugar\n* Never eat sweets/dessert/carbs on an empty stomach (dessert after dinner)\n* Keep refined carbs and added sugar at a minimum.\n* Minimize alcohol intake\n* Try to minimize sodas, fruit juice and sweet drinks (this is because there is no fiber to help with the glucose spike or at least try to have these drinks after eating something fiberous)\n* Only eat fruit whole, not transformed eg. eat the orange instead of having the orange juice, again fiber makes a world of a difference\n* Put clothing on your carbs. Eg. have protein/fats/fiber with your carbs\n* A short walk after carb heavy meals\n* Fasting - this is controversial and I should add a disclaimer, if you in any way shape or form have or had an eating disorder, especially restrictive eating, I highly recommend against fasting. Intermittent fasting has a lot of studies out there that were done on men. The book Fast Like a Girl by Dr. Mindy Pelz includes a nuanced view of fasting that takes into account our hormones and our monthly cycle. She also has a free app 'Fast like a girl', you log your period and it tells you how long to fast. However, bioindividuality is key here, genetics, etc. Please if you are considering fasting make sure you get bloodwork done first. Manage your electrolyte levels, do not neglect iron and protein levels. Personally, I prefer using the other methods since fasting can also inadvertently worsens insulin resistence due to increased stress/cortisol which cause higher hunger cues. Some with insulin resistence found fasting to be helpful. So make sure you do what works for you and always consult your doctor. \n* Supplements:\n   * Vitamin D paired with Vitamin K1 & K2\n   * Magnesium Biglycinate (I take this before bed)\n   * Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n   * Turmeric\n   * Coenzyme 10 (Take with Clomid & Vitamin E)\n   * N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)\n   * Inositol\n   * Zinc (Important to Note: It works inversely with testosterone - raises testosterone if your levels are low and lowers it if your levels are high)\n\nTo eat in a **caloric deficit**, calculate your TDEE and subtract 200-500 calories from that number. I like using this calculator.   \n[https://tdeecalculator.net](https://tdeecalculator.net)\n\nEg. If it's calculated to be 2000 calories, you subtract 200, so 1800 should be your daily calorie intake. For the activity levels make sure you do not oversell yourself. Here is a general guide:\n\n* Sedentary: Office job sat all day or less than 3000 steps per day\n* Lightly Active: Exercise 1-3 times per week or 3-10k steps daily (up to 3-4 miles daily)\n* Moderately Active: Exercise 3-5 times per week or 10-15k steps daily (up to 4-7 miles daily)\n* Highly Active: Hard exercise 6-7 training days per week or 15-20k steps daily (up to 7-10 miles daily)\n* Extremely Active: Intense daily exercise/hard physical labour 7 days a week or 25k+ steps daily (up to 10 miles daily)\n\nAs you lose weight your body adapts so after a while you may need to recalculate your TDEE and deficit. Once you are at your ideal weight, you no longer subtract the 200-500, you simply eat the TDEE amount to maintain but you do this gradually. After I lost the weight I came out of the deficit by adding 50 calories to my daily intake per week, till I was at maintenance/my TDEE. This prevented me from gaining fat or water weight.\n\nLastly, muscle mass (increase in muscle raises your metabolic level, meaning you burn more calories at rest). This is ideal and is also how you'll see someone who is short, seemingly small but weigh more than you imagined. Muscle density weighs more than fat. Think of a 50 pound dumbbell versus 50 pounds of feathers, you would need a whole lot of feathers to match the weight. Same difference, you need a larger volume of fat to equal to the same amount of muscle. Therefore, lifting weights is ideal because you will become more toned, burn more calories at rest, be able to eat more even when you've lost the weight to maintain your phisique, you'll be more insulin sensitive, and you will have stronger and higher bone density (really important for women, we lose up to 5% of muscle mass per decade after the age of 30).\n\n# Body Recompositon: Weightlifting for health (and aesthetics), lose fat & gain muscle\n\nIt is possible to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time. I followed Huskular Goddess and and LexiiGettingFit for inspiration and they were really the ones that opened my eyes to the concept of body recomposition (gain musle while losing fat). \n\nThe benefits of this is as you're getting smaller your TDEE is increasing. This means by the time you lose the weight you'll still be eating an adequate amount. The other benefits include insulin sensitivity versus insulin resistence, higher metabolism, and a improved body composition like I mentioned before in the dummbell versus feather example. The downside is the number on the scale won't have a dramatic shift while your clothes will be fitting looser. Again, weight density plays tricks on us and it's easy to get caught up in body dismorphia but I promise it works. \n\nIn order to sustain and build muscle while losing fat, you need to be consuming enough protein while remaining in a caloric deficit. So 60-80g of protein per day minimum to lose 1-2lbs per week. Ideally it should be 0.8-1g of per pound of lean body mass. Eg, someone is 300lbs and they want to get down to 150lbs. They would eat 120-150g of protein per day. If this is too much, try to get at least 60-80g like I mentioned before. Remember even though 1-2lbs per week sounds small, the changes are significant because of the muscle gained. You will look and feel smaller.  \n\n**Weightlifting for a rounder booty** (I reshaped my glutes by weightlifting. Hormones can actually affect the shape and my PCOS did a number on me. I developed a V shape over the years. Round, square, heart, A shapes are all based on your bone structure and fat placement. Some of us just have those stubborn fat deposits in certain areas that are genetic, even when we lose the weight, it's a smaller version but the same shape. V shape on the other hand is largely seen in older women post menopause and in younger women with hormonal disorders. This is becuase the hormonal imbalances also causes muscle imbalances. Regulating your hormones helps but it won't grow the muscles for you, so I used Fit With Emely's glute guide based on your glute shape (completely free, I watched all her videos to get this info and it took me two years to go from a V shape to a round shape.\n\nHere is the guideline for each shape:\n\n**Glute Maximus** - Everyone should be working on glute maximus. It builds the shelf and overall size. Step ups (all variations), hip thrusts (all variations), lunges, rdl, leg press, all squat variations  \n**Glute Minimus** - (V and Square shapes), this muscle fills in the middle between the top and lower glute. Hip abduction, single leg bridge, Standing hip abduction/cable raises  \n**Gute Medius** - (Heart, Round, and A-shaped) this muscles builds a longer hip for top portion of the glutes. Eg. Single leg squat, Single leg deadlift, Cable clamshells, Reverse lung, step ups  \n**Underbutt** - Everyone should be working on underbutt but this is especially useful for V shaped folks. It works the hamstrings and lower portion of glutes. Good mornings, single leg rdl (also works minimus), single leg hip thrust (also works maximus), hip abductors (also works minimus)\n\nHow to structure workout:\n\n* Warm up/Dynamic Stretches (specific to the muscle group you're working eg. lower body warm up or upper body warm up, etc.)\n* Compound exercises (2-3 exercises eg. single leg rdl, good mornings, leg press - for each exercise you do 3-4 sets, 8-12 reps, with 3-4 minute rest between sets). That probably sounds like a foreign language to some, so for instance:\n   * **Start excercise 1**\n   * Set 1 (repeat exercise 1 - rdl 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 2 (repeat exercise 1 - rdl 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 3 (repeat exercise 1 - rdl 8 times)\n   * **Move on to exercise 2**\n   * Set 1 (repeat exercise 2 - leg press 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 2 (repeat exercise 2 - leg press 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 3 (repeat exercise 2 - leg press 8 times)\n   * **Move on to exercise 3**\n   * Set 1 (repeat exercise 3 - good mornings 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 2 (repeat exercise 3 - good mornings 8 times)\n   * 3 minute rest\n   * Set 3 (repeat exercise 3 - good mornings 8 times)\n* Secondary Workouts (2-3 exercises eg. step ups, bulgarian split squats, lunges - for each exercise you do 3-4 sets, 8-12 reps, with 3-4 minute rest between sets)\n* Isolated/Accessory Movements: these exercises work one part of the muscle more than others, for example an overbias on the underbutt/hamstring like I mentioned before to help with the V shape ( eg. hip abductors, kickbacks, glute bridge, lying leg raises, etc. (1-2 exercises high repetitions, low weight 2-3 sets, 15-20 reps, 1-2 minute rest between sets)\n* Static stretch/cool down (specific to the muscle group you're working eg. lower body cool down or upper body cool down, etc.)\n\nKeep in mind that you only need to work on a muscle group 2-3 times a week. So I only do glutes Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Also keep in mind while I work the lower body I am also working my upper body (eg. while doing rdls I am lifting the weight with my upper body), which is why I don't have tailered upper body days, this is for aesthetic reasons, and because weightlifting more than 3 days per week is not feasible with my PCOS. \n\nMy full routine is:\n\n* Monday- lower body\n* Tuesday - Pilates/core\n* Wednesday - Rest (I still go for walks on these days)\n* Thursday - lower body\n* Friday - Pilates/core\n* Saturday - lower body\n* Sunday - Rest (I still go for walks on these days)\n\nI also used primarily resistance bands in the beginning because gym equipment intimidated me (not anymore :) ). I started with 25lb resistance and went up to 125lbs. I use the product BandBar which allowed me to use the resistance bands like a barbell at home. This isn’t the only option and you can definitely buy resistance bands and do it without the bar. [BandBar](https://shopbandbar.com)\n\nFor the ab separation from being obese, I did this workout 3 times a week (also helpful post pregnancy): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smiGsW-mQX0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smiGsW-mQX0)\n\nFor my chest to help with getting perkier boobs (the derma rolling was what made the biggest difference, but this exercise helped as well though it took 6+ months for the changes to be significant. Women tend to take longer to grow chest muscles): [https://youtu.be/hg7\\_R29jGIE?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/hg7_R29jGIE?feature=shared)\n\nI also did workouts to help with my posture and mobility 3 times a week (any I could find online)\n\nThe last thing I will say is be mindful that you may gain weight initially when you start lifting weights. This is due to slight inflammation/water gain from foreign tension, which will last about a month or two before you adapt BUT your body will adapt, I promise. Keep in mind if it's days before your period or if you are on your period. It's not if, but when, our weight fluctuates. As long as you are in a deficit and doing everything right, the number will go down. Do not get discouraged!!!\n\n***Here is the edit to this post which includes my supplements, how I managed my inflammation, and how I improved my gut health. I also edited the information I shared prior to include a few more tips and lifestyle changes I made, and included a few more details. I also rearranged things so there is a separation between style/hair/skin and health information. The post is getting really long so I may create a separate post for personal development/mindset tips.*** \n\n# Inflammation\n\nIn my case my inflammation was caused by my PCOS, insulin resistence and my obesity, but it can be caused by chronic stress, other autoimmune disorders like IBS, Crohn's disease, etc, smoking/alcohol, age related diseases, environmental toxins, diets high in processed foods, sugars, trans fats & high omega-6 fatty acids. \n\nIn my case the inflammation from the PCOS led to gut inflammation due to the high levels of coritsal (stress hormones) in reaction to the high testosterone and insulin resistence. I also experienced metabolic inflammation (non alcoholic fatty liver disease), skin inflammation (as I mentioned earlier the ezcema on my scalp, alopecia, and hirsutism), adipose tissue inflammation, chronic low grade inflammation (this led to edema or fuid retention -> insulin resistance and my high testosteron/androgen levels also exacerbated this).\n\nTo fix this these were the thin I added to my life:\n\n* Dry brushing 2-3 times a week\n* Body Gua sha\n* Face Gua Sha or Face Yoga or Myofascial Massage \n* Jump Rope\n* Trampoline/Rebounder\n* Vibration Plate (very useful for after a workout or while sitting down)\n* Acupressure mat\n* Arvigo (Mayan Abdominal massage) & Lymphatic drainage massage\n* Leg elevation, I sleep with a pillow under my knees. In the evenings I keep my legs up.\n* Massages\n* Sweat more (exercise/sauna/steam room)\n* Portable Infrared Sauna (reduce cortisol by 25%)\n* Microcurrent\n* Compression socks\n* Castor oil pack 3-4x per week\n* Eliminate inflammatory triggers (mine were gluten & dairy)\n   * Switch to sourdough\n   * Eliminate seed oils\n   * Avoid alcohol & smoking\n* Supplements\n   * Vitamin D paired with Vitamin K1 & K2\n   * Magnesium Biglycinate (I take this before bed)\n   * Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n   * Turmeric\n   * Coenzyme 10 (Take with Clomid & Vitamin E)\n   * N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)\n* Teas that helped\n   * Turmeric\n   * Red Rasberru Leaf Tea\n   * Fennel\n   * Chamomile\n\n# Gut Health \n\nYour microbiota needs the right bacteria in the right amount to perform its hormone regulating functions properly. When the type or number of bacteria gets disturbed by events such as stress, or poor diet, or your gut can no longer accomplish its job meaning you'll have inflammation, increased risk of chronic disease, skin conditions, mental health issues, weakened immune system, nutrient absorprion problems, and weight management challenges.   \n\n\nFor weight loss issues, gut microbiomes influence hormones in producing and signaling leptin and ghrelin (these hormones regulate hunger and fullness signals). Inflammation and insulin resistence is also associated with gut health problems as mentioned before. Energy extraction from foods, certain gut bacteria are more efficient at extracting energy from food, particularly carbohydrates. When there is an imbalance, more calories can be absorbed from food leading to difficulties gaining or losing weight. \n\nThings I did to improve gut health/intestinal permeability:\n\n* Ate foods rich in digestive enzymes (mangoes, pineapple, etc.)\n* Pre and probiotics (incorporate bifidobacterium and lactobacillus)\n   * Favorite brand: Seed Heath Probiotics\n* Pickles (without vinegar): Great source of prebiotics\n* Apple Cider Vinegar/Kimchi/Kombucha/Sauerkraut\n   * Beware of certain types of vinegar contain chemicals which kill bacteria, “the good bacteria”, and leave the yeast Candida albicans alone.\n   * Raw apple cider vinegar contains: Natural probiotics (friendly bacteria), which may help with your immune system and gut health.\n      * Tablespoon of apple cider vinegar (diluted in a glass of water) before each meal\n   * Balsamic vinegar: Acetic acid is the active compound in balsamic vinegar. This acid contains strains of probiotics that aid digestion. The probiotics found in acetic acid can help promote good gut health and digestion while supporting overall immune function.\n* Raw Carrots (has the type of fiber that binds and flushes out toxins in gut, good to have as daily hormone & digestion support)\n* Limit Processed foods and Sugar\n* No drinking or smoking \n* Stress managment (which I'll expand on just below)\n* Increase fiber intake\n* Regularly exercise\n* Supplements\n   * Ginger \n   * L-Glutamine\n   * Olive leaf extract (especially helpful if you have candida overgrowth)\n   * Turmereric \n* Teas\n   * Ginger\n   * Lemon Balm\n\n# Lower androgens/testosterone\n\n* Teas \n   * Nettle Tea\n   * Spearmint tea\n* Spearmint oil topically for hirsutism\n* Supplements\n   * Schisandra (adaptogen - stress management & hormone balance)\n   * Saffron (Also helps reduce testosterone, lower blood pressure and prevents bad cholesterol)\n   * Inositol\n   * Holy Basil\n   * Magnesium Biglycinate (I take this before bed)\n   * Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n   * Coenzyme 10 (Take with Clomid & Vitamin E)\n   * Zinc (Important to Note: It works inversely with testosterone - raises testosterone if your levels are low and lowers it if your levels are high)\n\n# Nervous System Regulation/ Stress Management \n\nStress is one of the things that age us the most, and people with PCOS already have higher levels of cortisol so these are the things I do to manage my stress levels:\n\n* Regulate circadian rhythm, direct sunlight upon waking up. I use a sunrise alarm clock lamp for this\n* Same bedtime everynight (pre midnight)\n* Invert screen colors at bedtime (red filter on screens)\n* Pillow under knees\n* No loud alarms\n* Magnesium biglycinate supplement before bed\n* Regulate circadian rhythm, view the sunset before bed. I use a sunrise alarm clock lamp for this\n* Spend a few minutes breathing through left nostril only\n* Epsom salt foot soak\n* Journal\n* Get back to using my coloring books (I even invested in alcohol based markers it's so fun). Regulates me and gets me in touch with my inner child\n* Time with friends, my puppy, and my family\n* Supplements\n   * Holy Basil (adaptogen - stress management & hormonal balance)\n   * L-Theanine\n   * Magnesium biglycinate \n* Teas\n   * Red raspberry leaf (adaptogen - stress management, also good for menstrual cramps)\n   * Reishi Mushroom\n   * Lemon Balm\n* Night time mocktail (have after dinner and not on an empty stomach due to the sugar levels in the tart cherry)\n   * Teaspoon of tart cherry (high levels of melatonin)\n   * Magnesium biglycinate powder\n   * Probiotic soda (good for gut health)\n\n# Tea cycling\n\n- On your period\n    - Nettle leaf: Increase iron levels\n    - Moringa: Increase iron levels\n    - Red Raspberry leaf: Helps with period cramps (best to drink throughout the month, especially at the end of the luteal phase\n    - Chamomile: Helps with wellness wind down routine when you're feeling extra tired\n- Follicular phase\n    - Focus teas: Peppermint, Spearmint\n    - Adaptogens: Lion's mane, Adaptogen latte, and Chaga mushroom\n    - Detox: Dandelion Root\n- Ovulation phase\n    - Detox: Dandelion root tea\n    - Bloating: turmeric tea latte/golden latte\n    - Estrogen dominance - symptoms (bad hormonal migraines, hot flashes, nausea): Schisandra berry, Lemon balm\n- Luteal phase\n    - PMS symptoms: Raspberry leaf, Schisandra berry, Ginger root (powder or tea)\n\n\nThe best teas for PCOS\n\n- Spearmint\n    - For reducing androgens & lowering hirsutism (facial hair)\n- Cinnamon tea (improves insulin sensitivity)\n- Chamomile tea (Adaptogen)\n- Nettle Tea (reduce androgens)\n- Red raspberry leaf (adaptogen/stress relief, also good for menstrual cramps)\n- Schisandra (adaptogen/stress relief & hormone balance)\n- Saffron (Also helps reduce testosterone, lower blood pressure and prevents bad cholesterol)\n- Ginger (ginger offers anti-inflammatory, fertility and hormone-balancing benefits, aides digestion )\n\n\n# Seed Cycling\n\nWhat is seed cycling? Seed cycling refers to the consumption of specific seeds at different times of the month in order to improve the production and levels of sex hormones, specifically estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone.\n\nSeed cycling divides the female menstrual cycle into two parts:\n\n1. During the first half of the menstrual cycle, or days 1 through 14, seed cycling encourages daily consumption of **flax and pumpkin seeds.**\n2. During the second half of the menstrual cycle, or days 15 through 28, seed cycling encourages daily consumption of **sunflower and sesame seeds**\n\n*Results from seed cycling will not happen overnight. Normally women observe improvements after approximately three months of seed cycling adherence. It took me about 4ish months.*\n\n**The Benefits of Seed Cycling:** Support hormonal balance, alleviate PMS symptoms, decrease hormonal acne, alter irregularity of menstrual cycles, and fight stomach bloating and fatigue.\n\n",

I'm more so winging it and was curious to suggestions aor if you have any tips based on my routine. I currently am almost out of shampoo and conditioner and would love recommendations. I'm still not sure what kind of hair type I have in the 2s. The picture above is on day 2/3. The second picture is day 1 after I do my routine. \n\nShampoo and conditioner twice a week: Marc Anthony strictly curls\n\nApply leave in conditioner and comb through with wide toothed comb: Shea Moisture Manuka Honey and yogurt hydrate repair multi action leave in treatment\n\nScrunch in Curl creme with hand then t shirt leave hair to air dry: briogeo curl charisma leave in defining creme \n\nOnce a week: medicinal ketoconazole shampoo 2\n\nOnce a week hair mask/deep conditioning: manuka honey & yogurt hair mask hydrate +repair protein power treatment \n\nI'd love to get any suggestions, comments, constructive criticism. I have been winging it for too long and would prefer to have nice, healthy hair while I still have it! Thank you! ",

Figuring out your porosity is also helpful for finding products that work best for you.

(Follow up with vaelsine and the perfume I’m wearing and oooof softest beautiful smelling feet ever!!) \n\nI track my hair washing schedule with “hair track” so if I don’t feel like washing my hair I’ll check my app to see when I washed it (I have serb dermatitis on my scalp and my derm wants me wash every other day). I alternate what I shampoo I use. I alternate between a salicylic acid, ketoconazole shampoo, tea tree, moisturizing shampoo and a clarifying shampoo. The salicylic acid and ketoconazole need to be left on a minimum of 5 minutes and if I double cleanse it sucks. But I had a thinning spot and following my methods I’ve grown hair back! I also use glycolic\nAcid on my scalp toooo\n\nI’ll update with the more lazy things I do lmao. \n\nIt’s like a sleep over where we can share :)\n\nEdit: I want to add some more things I do lmao. \n\nMy hair on my thighs are non existent and I shave my legs on Friday so if in a pinch I’ll shave just the bottom half shin area or the lil bit that shows out of my pants. \n\nAlso like in another comment I carry my essence lip and cheek tint that stuff brings me to life.

        "body": "I’ve had depression my whole life so I have loads of these: \n\n- Keep a physical face scrub in the shower. If I’ve been struggling doing my skincare and haven’t been exfoliating then the scrub helps me get an instant polish. I also used to keep a green clay mask stick in the shower too so I could quickly wipe it on and do a quick mask. \n\n- Washing my face using a muslin cloth. I swear by these things. Me and my mum used to use hot cloth cleansers so we ended up with loads of them and now I use them when I oil cleanse and to remove makeup. It’s not super rough but the fine texture also works great to gently physically exfoliate. If works wonders on lips! Better than any lip scrub I’ve ever used. Speaking of lip scrubs… \n\n- DIY lip scrub of honey, Vaseline and sugar. Can also use olive oil with it. Put it in a little pot and keep practically forever! \n\n- I buy cheap empty cuticle pens off Temu and fill them with Jojoba oil. I keep them at every sink in my house and in my bags. \n\n- I have a ‘mini’ makeup kit that just has mini products for when I need to rush off somewhere and need to do my makeup on public transport or in a car etc (I don’t drive). I have even got small pots on Temu and decanted products in there, but I also just collected samples or any small products specifically for that bag. It’s also great if you’re going somewhere for the night - I hate having to unpack when I’m back and this way I don’t have to get my makeup lost and confused. Some of the products are multi use (I keep a brown eyebrow pencil that can double up as an eyeliner and lip liner and lip products that can double as blush and eyeshadow) \n\n- I keep miscellar water and makeup wipes in my room if I don’t have the energy to clean my face \n\n- I haven’t done this in years cause it takes ages but I used to do lash lifts in the summer. With neat brows and the lashes done I almost never wore makeup\n\n- I always have a staple pair of hoop earrings I never take out which reduces the fatigue of choosing some everyday. You also look more put together even when you’re low energy\n\n- I keep a squeeze bottle of hand cream on my key ring. I’m germ vigilant so I sanitise a lot but it dries me out so this helps replace lost moisture and oils \n\n- I have a silicone face mask cover that I put over sheet masks to make them last longer because they don’t dry out, and it also keeps them in place so you can move around more comfortably \n\n- I don’t shave my legs in the winter. Almost never. I live in a cold country so the extra hair provides insulation and my bf quite likes it. \n\n- I apply a roll on and a spray deodorant. I use the roll on first then the spray to ‘set’ it. I apply them at night as it gives more time for the ingredients to work. I apply in the morning again but I find that it works much better throughout the day when applying at night\n\n- I do my nails myself. I’m still learning and experimenting but I bought a cheap polygel kit online with a load of polishes. I can do gel nails quite comfortably but extensions are a bit harder. It takes ages but with a show in the background the time flies\n\n- When I change my sheets I double up on pillowcases on each pillow so I can change them more regularly to maintain good skin and hair. My bedding is annoying to get to so rhis is easier. I use fake satin ones and if I use normal cotton ones I have a satin head wrap I’ll use then instead \n\n- I have this small rectangular water bottle shaped like a notebook that fits into any purse/ handbag so I can still be hydrated but look cute. I drink a lot of water and it always annoyed me that I could never wear handbags because there was no way to fit a water bottle\n\n- I buy tiny bottles to decent body spray and perfume and throw them in my bags \n\nThere are more but my brain has stopped working lol",

    "body": "I had commented on a post here in this subreddit with this before & after picture collage. So many had questions about my routine! I realized I put the wrong year for the before pics. I accidentally had wrote 2021, so l corrected it here to 2022.\n\nI decided to do what I wish someone had done for me- make an in depth post about my current routine that helped my hair grow thicker/fuller!\nFirst off - my first trim in 2022 was probably 3 inches. It felt like a lot and made me want to cry at first.\n\nI continued to keep up with trimming monthly (sometimes skipped it if my ends seemed fine) about 1/4 of an inch each time. I started to see a huge difference in my hair!\n\nHere's my current routine that helped my hair SO MUCH:\nwash my hair every other day (training my hair was a hoax and only made things worse! Do NOT try to train your hair if you have an oily scalp!)\n\n-Do a pre wash oil treatment once per week: massage jojoba oil into my scalp, then use some on my lengths. (I also recently started using some of the Garnier Marvelous oil on my ends in addition to jojoba) The trick is to not overdo the oil! A little goes a long way. Leave in for 1/2 hour to an hour. Then double wash with clarifying shampoo. Condition and use a hair mask as well.\n\n-Only use an old cotton t shirt to dry my hair!\nOther towels (including microfiber) cause major frizz\n\n-Use Anti Dandruff shampoo if you suffer from a flaky scalp! Nizoral is my favorite as it has Ketoconazole as the active ingredient.\n\n-Be very gentle with brushing! Do not rip out any tangles. Use your hands to carefully detangle\n\n*if you have wavy hair* - brush while wet and only use a large tooth comb to brush out your waves once dry! I use the Tresseme air dry cream (only on lengths!!) followed by the Aussie mousse, and the Garnier cream gel. Tiny amounts only, don't go overboard!\n\n-DO NOT use any heat unless you absolutely must. I usually air dry my hair unless for the once every 6 months chance I really must use a blow dryer.\n\n-Braid your hair before bed, and use a satin cap while you sleep! I also have a satin pillow case, just as insurance if my cap were to slip off.\n\n- I love Loriel 8 second wonder water! Only use an old small amount - and don’t use more often than twice per week. \n\n-Make sure you are taking the right vitamins! Have your doctor go over your labs with you and see any you might be deficient in. Also make sure you’re getting plenty of protein in your diet!\n\nHope this helps another fine hair girly like myself who is looking for tips! Let me know if you have any more questions. God bless you all! ❤️",

    "body": "Note https://ketaminetherapyformentalhealth.com is now the home of the guide.  Updates are posted there, and questions can be asked in the site's comments.\n\nThis post originally was a success report but has evolved into a comprehensive guide for therapeutic ketamine users. I strive to reflect current research and cover the therapy fully. Provide feedback if you read conflicts, so I can update if necessary. Please upvote, as I like to track use.\n\nSources: This is a combination of personal experience over 4.5 years on the therapy, hundreds of conversations with others on this sub, and research where it is available.  Without fail there are others that take issue with some of what's said here, so I attempt to call out contrasting viewpoints where criticism has been raised.\n\nI am specialized in AI and cognitive computer architecture based on neurobiology, and my wife is a neuroscientist. My psych is specialized in ketamine therapy, and I've participated in many studies. I've been an active member of this sub for many years.\n\n# -> Symptoms & Result <-\n\nI am BP1, with psychotic features. I struggled with persistent bipolar depression, which did not respond to SSRIs, constant (daily) ideation with extensive planning, and complex psychological issues such as self-persecution complex and complex PTSD.\n\nOne trigger resulted in maladaptive behavior that would trigger another, which then triggered again, so on and so forth, until the first trigger was reached again. Round and round it went. This resulted in significant mood instability, fits of anger at inappropriate times, paranoia, a general suspicion of others being out to get me, inferring hidden agendas, and a feeling of complete hopelessness. Through self-persecution, I undermined my successes because I subconsciously didn't feel I deserved them. \n\nChoosing untrustworthy people to surround me led to lots of traumatic life situations, making it worse and worse over time. I would ruminate on negative thoughts, situations, and feedback, in a cycle of unhealthy self-talk.  I saw the world through a very unhealthy lens that reinforced all the fear and paranoia. I couldn't feel joy, or happiness, for those led to self-defeat, so I was wired completely wrong.\n\nI've been on ketamine for 4.5 years. I have had 100% remission of rumination, depression, ideation, CPTSD, and almost all trigger situations non-stop. Ketamine has rebuilt my healthy synapses and relocated dendrites, so I'm able to cope with life in a healthy way and now view the world through an accurate lens showing love, support, compassion, and acceptance of me and who I am today. \n\nKetamine improves cognition, memory, and mental flexibility, so damage caused by depression has been healed completely. This results in mental clarity, and an overall ‘lighter’ feeling across life. Depression was a heavy blanket that weighed me down, unmotivated. Hard to start, harder to finish. Ketamine made my mind quieter; I no longer cycle on unhealthy thoughts. I am no longer obsessed with suicide. I no longer ruminate.\n\nI love life and live every minute. I feel joy and happiness now, and I'm very content the majority of the time. These past 4.5 years have been the best of my life.\n\nI knew ketamine was working for me with the first dose (no more ideation at all after the first dose). Depression lifted in the first few doses. Once the healthy synapses grew, I reinforced them. As I was triggered, I broke down trauma underneath, and differentiated it from my new reality, rewiring them to no longer fire. 4.5 years in I'm a completely different person that loves life in every way, and ketamine has been so successful I don't feel like any other treatment is needed to feel better.\n\nBeing bipolar I continue to maintain a mood stabilizer, antipsychotic, stimulant, and sleep med, but I no longer need recreationals and several prescriptions I used to take.\n\nIt takes ketamine time to rebuild damaged synapses depression and maladaptation create. So, like many, I did feel worse before I felt better. Emotional processing is difficult, especially before the depression lifted and the new synapses developed and grew strong. They're like muscles, they need exercise to grow strong. So, the therapy is hard at first, and I cried a lot.\n\nIn summary, ketamine lifts rumination, depression, and ideation completely, and words can’t really describe how good that feels. Incredible feeling. It also restructured my brain to appreciate these things, and to come to the world in a healthy way. \n\nI'm so happy now, consistently happy, and healthy. \n\nIt's why I wrote the guide. Ketamine made such a difference for me I'm getting the word out to everyone it can help.\n\nBelow I address questions that come up here, for those exploring, beginning, or looking to get more out of their treatment. I edit the guide with things I learn. We're a community, so speak up, ask questions, and respond.  By all means, let me know if you think something needs to be added here or amended. I'm open to all suggestions and questions, and DMs are welcome.\n\nI highly recommend listening to this audio from a leading scientist in the field as a primer for what I'll cover in the remainder of this post. It's less than 4 minutes.\n\n[How Ketamine Solves Depression by Increasing Spines in the Prefrontal Cortex](https://podclips.com/c/ketamine-offsets-depressive-symptoms-by-increasing-spines-on-prefrontal-cortex-neurons?ss=r&ss2=therapeuticketamine&2022-04-22&m=true)\n\n# -> Diagnosis <-\n\nKetamine is indicated for the treatment of rumination, anhedonia, depression (such as in bipolar or major depressive disorder), PTSD & CPTSD, substance abuse, persistent anxiety, intrusive thoughts, impulsivity, and OCD.  Most of the benefits are reported by patients and doctors, so few studies exist to prove out benefits. Spravato has been proven effective for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) only (in clinical trials).  \n\nThe chronic pain I don't cover.\n\nKetamine is not the first line of defense, so guidance is to try mainstream antidepressants first. Given how effective ketamine is, I would use it as the first option, but the medical community is conservative. If other antidepressants haven't worked or cause unwanted sexual side effects (which is common), or you want to go straight to the best option IMHO, explore ketamine. \n\n# -> Treatment Center <-\n\nTreatment is done via ketamine clinic often, and telemedicine is an alternative. There are practices everywhere that specialize in ketamine.\n\nSearch google for 'ketamine providers near me', or 'kletamine telemedicine providers'.\n\nWith a clinic, expect a $350ish consult fee. Most do IVs, often $300ish each, and standard practice is 6 IVs administered over two weeks. Telemedicine and some clinics also do troches (sublingual lozenges), as is my preference over IV. Troches by comparison are $75-$90 for the equivalent of 4 IVs.\n\n# -> Administration <-\n\nThe clinic can administer ketamine using varied methods. Most often used are IVs, but there are IM injections, nasal spray, troches (aka lozenges), pills, suppositories, and rapid dissolve tablets. Telemedicine often uses troches or rapid dissolve tablets as they ship better.\n\n[Graph of dose type vs. time of effect](https://i.redd.it/dpbm1sgal2791.jpg)\n\nTypically, an IV series is done over a two-week period, with injections Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, over two successive weeks for example. \n\nI started with troches, did them for 2 months, then did my IV series of 6. I use a local provider overseen by a psych specialized in ketamine.  I know many choose telemedicine and there are several viable alternatives, however, do your research as several get many bad reviews for poor support during the treatments. \n\nIn my treatment, I find troches preferable to IV. No injection is involved. I can do them as I see fit, go as deep for as long as I like, and have a quiet, safe space for the experience. It's important to be in a safe space with limited (no) interruptions (outside of a friend/therapist perhaps) but while you're under the influence you're vulnerable and it's important to avoid trauma (I'll go into that more below).\n \nDo not mix ketamine with water, like a bathtub, hot tub, or pool. Cognition can take a break while under ketamine, and drowning is a risk. Instead find a comfy recliner, couch, or bed.\n\nAnother reason I prefer troches is IV clinics do o2 stats and blood pressure checks which interrupt the experience - so you'll be knees deep in childhood trauma and a nurse will bug you. Not ideal. If this is their practice, ask them to limit their interactions to prior to and after the dose is administered and has been completed. My practice changed its SOP for everyone upon this request.\n\nIn the IV series, dosages are increased over the series, to promote higher dissociation. This can be done with troches. Please read carefully about the dosing below though, because more is not always better.\n\nWith IV administration you can request magnesium alongside which increases the effect. \n\nKetamine can cause nausea in some people, so they can administer an antinausea drug as well.\n\nWhen using troches or other non-IV methods you can supplement with magnesium glycinate. It is highly bioavailable and comes without the laxative effect of magnesium l-threonine. 400mg the morning of a dose is recommended, although it's good to take daily, at 400mg a day.\n\nThere are reports of Capsaicin increasing absorption of rapid dissolve and troches (that which is absorbed via oral mucosa), so if you swish some then spit, followed by dose you may find an increased effect. Capsaicin info courtesy u/Pinbacked11.\n\n# -> Experience <-\n\nReports of experience range from little effect to profound insight into trauma and unhealthy mental patterns, to complete in-situ deaths and reincarnations (rebirths), to communing with higher consciousnesses and a complete loss of comprehension/cognition. Some report reality collapsing to a single infinite point, then rebuilding based on Mandelbrot fractals. This is dose related. There are benefits to varied states of dosing, which I cover next.\n\nTo start, ketamine disables the perineuronal net, a protective system in the brain dealing with trauma. This is one of its greatest strengths, as by disabling the net the mind becomes adaptable to the way trauma is stored and the stimulus-response patterns of triggers. This comes with some risk though, as when new trauma occurs within the window wherein the net is down, the trauma won't be processed normally, and the effects are unknown. Due to this, my advice is to avoid traumatizing yourself with the experience itself. \n\nDisassociation itself is accomplishable via a moderate dose, so there is no need to wipe out your cognition (anesthetic dose) or to 'ego-die/khole'. Some report therapeutic value in ego-death levels and some research indicates reset of brain circuits and neural networks that occur at those doses can be therapeutic as well. I have dosed to high levels and found benefit in understanding myself spiritually as a result. Know, however, that those doses are not required for ketamine to be effective, and they can be traumatic if you aren't prepared for them. \n\nAgain, my guidance is to start low and work up. Trauma processing is best when your ego is present and lucid, which is lower doses than ego death. Start low and work up to it if you want to go so far as ego death.  As you'll see below many of ketamine's therapeutic aspects do not require this though,\n\nKetamine at high doses recycles neural networks/resets brain circuits (aka neural fragmentation), so you'll be out of it for a bit. Do not let concern you — it’s a natural part and is transient. Try not to go this high as a general rule, but know it happens, and nothing to worry about. For more about this, you can read this [Sheep on K](https://www.inverse.com/science/sheeps-minds-on-ketamine) for a good study. Research has shown the human brain doesn't behave in exactly the same way, but it should give you the gist.\n\nSee even more [Ketamine's Action in the Brain](https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/what-does-ketamine-do-to-your-brain-depression-treatment).\n\nAgain, trauma processing only requires a moderate disassociated dose. This keeps you mentally intact, but still opens up the memories from suppressed traumas and will surface the issues your mind needs help with. At these doses, ketamine exposes suppressed memories, triggers (stimulus/response), traumas, and thought patterns for modification. This is how it most effectively treats PTSD & CPTSD. At these doses recall on ketamine will be near perfect.\n\nDissociation provides new perspectives on problems, memories, and triggers — and each time you take ketamine the perspective differs. This will give you a lot to think about, and things to work on.\n\nDo not try to make your mind focus, it will prove difficult. Trauma is processed in the background; you need not work it consciously. You can, though, and as you understand triggers better you can target them consciously and rewire them to not inappropriately fire.\n\nKetamine collapses neural networks/brain circuitry and some brainwaves in no particular order, and to varying degrees while enhancing other neural networks/brain circuits/brainwaves. This is a very active field of study, with imaging of all nature being produced and the terms are broad because there isn't consensus on the exact mechanisms here.\n\nAs a result, ketamine is kind of unpredictable, in that the same two doses will rarely have the same effects. Each time you take ketamine the subjective experience will vary, as well as the nature of the trip - some trips will be stronger and deeper, while others may not even induce visuals or any mental effects. Each time you take ketamine results in a new point of view, however and part of that variability is thought to stem from the variations in these collapses and resets. Again, theoretical.\n\nLike many, I did feel worse before I felt better. Processing trauma was hard, I cried pretty much non-stop for a couple of days after each dosing for the first 8 or so. \n\nBy starting with troches, I had already begun the formation of the new synapses and dendrites found in a healthy brain and had pre-processed a lot already going into the IVs, so my IV series was anti-depressive and healing. \n\nThose starting with IVs start building the new synapses and dendrites with the first dose, and the growth happens 12-48 hours after a dose. In the beginning, the newly formed structures are weak and in need of a lot of reinforcement. The series of 6 IVs gives them lots of time to build out, and what you do during your series can affect how well they build-out, and like a muscle, they need exercise. Do everything you can to be healthy. Therapy, yoga, walks, meditating, bonding with loved ones, processing the emotions, letting them come, letting them go. Learn mindfulness, this is key, being present in the moment is what gets rid of triggers. \n\nNow is different than then. Always remember that.\n\nOften people who are in the first few IVs wonder \"is this even working for me\", \"I'm really discouraged, this is my last hope and I really need it to work for me\", and \"am I doing it wrong?\". No, you're not. It takes time for regrowth and time to adapt to using the new neural networks. You can't force it, and there are no 'mistakes' you can make that will change the course of action.\n\nIn the first few doses a lot of pent-up emotion is released, and you don't really have healthy neurons online to cope quite yet. So, it's kind of discouraging for some. They are processing a bunch of emotions, are still depressed, and wonder if they should continue therapy. After all, it's expensive and making them feel like crap, so why keep doing it?  That is when you need to keep going, because your brain is still healing, and the depression hasn't lifted yet. Keep with it, and as your mind recovers, you'll feel better. At a minimum do the first 6, but it might take more, and in my case, I went to monthly boosters and have been doing that for 3 years to reinforce the synapses and to continue to open myself up for processing.\n\nKnow that even though the first few doses may be difficult emotionally, your ideation (should you have any) will be removed with the first dose, so you won't want to end your life.  If you continue to ideate after the first dose (which happens rarely) it's a sign of cyclic ideation caused by depression and may take a while longer to resolve as your networks build.\n\n# -> Dosing <-\n\nDosing is particular to the individual, so please talk with your provider about low, intermediate, and high doses for your body weight. I will not share my dosing as I do not want it to be generally applied.\n\n[Quick Dosing Levels and Effects](https://psychedelictimes.com/a-dosing-guide-for-using-ketamine-for-psychedelic-therapy/)\n\nOverall, though, I’m an advocate for higher dosing up to a point — near the top end of dosing you become somewhat incoherent and can khole, which is ego death. This I don’t think is productive, and it can be traumatic, which should be avoided.\n\nBelow this, however, is coherent dissociation, which I find most therapeutic. This level kind of separates my mind from my body and lets me analyze my memories and stimulus-response patterns very fully.\n\nThere is controversy in research around therapeutic doses. Some research indicates there is therapeutic value in going through a 'k-hole' experience, while other research has shown therapeutic value without that being necessary.\n\nIn some research, it shows ketamine disconnects a hyperconnected default mode network that ruminates, and it's not yet clear what dose is required to do that. \n\nThere is also the formation of new synapses and dendric spines in areas damaged by depression, 12-48 hours after dosing, which is hypothesized to also create some of the therapeutic effects - and in that case, it's not required to wipe your cognition, ego die or 'k-hole'.\n\nSo, while I think moderate doses to promote disassociation are helpful from a PTSD perspective (untangling triggers and divorcing the mind from the stimulus-response) it isn't clear how high a dose is required to solve depression and regrow the synapses damaged by depression and maladaptation. \n\nAgain, studies have shown that ketamine takes down the perineuronal network, which is what protects the brain against trauma. Knowing this, it's important to ensure that the ketamine experience itself doesn't traumatize you. At high doses, especially without any prior experience with ketamine, a khole (ego death) can be traumatizing. The lack of coherent thought and inability to remember yourself or aspects of your life can be scary.\n\nFor this reason, I recommend you start low and slowly work your way up in dosing ensuring you stay within your comfort zone throughout the course of treatment. This may result in smaller increases in doses than might be recommended, or additional doses to reach the level of disassociation you find therapeutic. Many people have reported (and research is showing) that moderate dosing is very effective. \n\nMake sure you communicate with your provider actively while undergoing the experience. They can vary it as you go, by speeding or slowing the drip, or increasing or decreasing the total dose. If you feel concerned, anxious, or start to panic reach out to them immediately so they can slow it down for you. Do not traumatize yourself - as you work up in doses the anxiety around the experience will lessen, so you can work up to the higher intensity if you wish but go there on your terms. If you find yourself in a place you aren't comfortable, speak up - you are in complete control.\n\nHere is an excerpt of a conversation I had with u/awkwardflea who advocates for comfortable, mid-level dosing so you can get an idea of what it looks like.\n\n\"I started at 0.5mg/kg but decided to try upping the dose a little because I was getting emotionally overwhelmed. It was like exploring an inner dreamscape, but I didn't have the emotional regulation skills to process everything that was coming up, and someone on here suggested that I might be a little more comfortable with a little more distance. I still found 0.5mg/kg helpful as far as gaining insights and processing trauma, however. I felt amazing afterward, though. Happy and grounded after the first infusion.\n\nAt first, I tried upping it to 0.6mg/kg, and that was a disaster. It got more and more intense and turned into a giant looping flashback of a really traumatic event. At the lower dose, I had enough control to bring in a friend or affect my experience. At 0.6mg/kg, I was just stuck. I didn't get the same insights or symptom relief as I did at 0.5mg/kg.\n\nMy most helpful infusions (at 0.55mg/kg with magnesium over 40 min) were like exploring an inner dreamscape with safety and perspective. It wasn't exactly revisiting past trauma but more like metaphorical visuals that gave me insights (watching my father drift away on a raft, seeing my mother frozen in time, passing through a portal, and turning into a bird with metal wings). It all made sense to me either during the infusions or the integration work a few hours later. It was trippy but specific to my situation. I sobbed through most of my infusions and did a lot of emotional processing. And the insights (e.g., I am more than what was done to me) felt like a light bulb turning on, like flipping a switch in my brain. I didn't have to struggle to accept things that I'd been working on in therapy forever; they just became true. I can still open my eyes and communicate at 0.55mg/kg; I just don't.\"\n\nJust be careful not to traumatize yourself, as with the perineuronal network being down, those traumas are potentially serious.\n\n# -> Spravato vs. Racemic Ketamine <-\n\nSpravato is esketamine aka the s-anomer of ketamine. Racemic ketamine is a mix of both r and s isomers, so it targets more receptors. \n\nAdvantages of Spravato:\n- Clinically proven to treat treatment-resistant depression\n- Approved by the FDA and VA for TRD treatment\n- Can be cheaper than IV ketamine treatments\n- Is often covered by insurance\n- For some may be the only option - and it's better than nothing\n- Stronger disassociation than ketamine at equivalent doses\n\nDisadvantages of Spravato:\n- Not shown to improve cognition in limited testing\n- Limited potential for dissociation\n- Can be more expensive than ketamine troche, rapid dissolve\n- Limited dosing options per manufacturer recommendations\n- Not shown effective, either clinically or anecdotally for other mental illnesses than TRD.\n- Nasal spray only\n- Only approved to treat depression\n\n\nAdvantages of Racemic Ketamine:\n- Flexible in form and dosage\n- Generally available in more treatment centers\n- No upper limit to disassociation dosages (can be dosed more strongly)\n- Cognitive benefits shown via correlated studies\n- Treats a wider array of mental illnesses\n- Some methods of administration are cheaper than Spravato\n\nDisadvantages of Racemic Ketamine:\n- Few clinical trials. Benefits are primarily shown through psychological tests, and lots of patient and doctor reports.\n- Limited backing studies\n- Little FDA rigor\n- IVs can be more expensive than Spravato\n\n\nNote, there have been dozens of people who have done both ketamine proper and Spravato, and they universally report that ketamine is far more effective across a wide spectrum of mental illnesses. There are also a few (and clinical studies show) that report Spravato is effective against TRD regardless of the cognitive or dissociative benefits. So far, only one person has reported Spravato being equally effective. Generally speaking, my recommendation is to definitely give ketamine a try if you have the option between ketamine proper and Spravato, ketamine will likely be cheaper, more flexible to dose, and by many reports more effective across the board when people have taken both.  Admittedly largely anecdotal.\n\nAs studies proceed, I will add more info here. Spravato shows potential, however, and clinical evidence is sparse on the efficacy of racemic ketamine where spravato has more clinical evidence. If you wish for a more reported effective path then racemic ketamine has more of a track record and shows solid consistent results for most across a wide variety of mental illnesses, whereas Spravato has only been clinically proven for TRD and has far fewer anecdotal reports.\n\nNote that by way of comparison between IV ketamine and Spravato, especially if you have limited insurance coverage or are restricted by the VA, then Spravato may well be the better choice, and potentially cheaper.  Choose your administration method carefully, as the costs vary, and Spravato is more expensive than some ketamine administration methods. Most insurance regularly covers both, and if you wish a recommendation to a company specializing in ketamine treatment reimbursement (for all administration methods) contact me via DM.\n\nSome of this info is credited to u/WillemPenn and u/Temptazn.\n\n# -> Cognition <-\n\nKetamine has been shown to improve cognition (memory, processing speed, and cognitive flexibility) across correlated studies. For 24-48 hours after a dose, there may be reductions in cognition - however, after 7 days there are marked, measurable improvements.\n\n- [Correlated Studies](https://www.newswise.com/articles/no-adverse-cognitive-effects-of-ketamine-or-esketamine-for-treatment-resistant-depression)\n- [Neural Growth](https://cen.acs.org/biological-chemistry/biochemistry/Ketamine-helps-neurons-regrow-lost/97/i15)\n- [More Info](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/07/210706115323.htm)\n\nNote that Spravato has not shown the same effect. Again, implies not rebuilding synapses as effectively, but speculative, and not proven through research.\n\nOne of the leading theories in Alzheimer's is that the dendric spines become complex and as a result require expensive metabolic processing. Ketamine reforms dendric spines, making them leaner and more efficient, and attaching them to new locations on the synapses. This reduces the metabolic expense of the dendrite and acts as a precognitive agent against Alzheimer's. I'll add more info here as studies proceed.\n\n# -> Maintenance <-\n\nI treat myself roughly one week out of every five weeks. I do this to prevent bladder damage, allowing 4 weeks for healing. I also don’t want to be on ketamine all the time. I work in a highly intellectual field and cannot have neural networks offline routinely.\n\nI take high doses every other night, the equivalent of 4 IV experiences. I use troches and administer half the dose at first, then an hour later ¼, then an hour later ¼.\n\nThe weeks in between treatments are with 100% remission. The main reason I treat monthly is to address trigger formation and continually work through them, as I have a lot from an abusive upbringing.\n\n# -> Ketamine as a Cure <-\n\nThere are those that report 'graduating' from needing regular boosters, and I have a theory about that. As ketamine builds the new healthy brain networks by adding synapses and dendrites, they start out weak. They need use in everyday life and need nourishment with repeated doses to grow out fully. Like muscles, you need to hit the mental gym to strengthen. With practice, healthy networks get enough reinforcement, they become the dominant networks and replace maladaptive ones which then atrophy out. \n\nIt stands to reason that when the healthy brain network is dominant, the need for continued boosters becomes less necessary. There still might be the occasional trigger, or you may want to 'prune' your brain periodically to prevent Alzheimer's, but monthly dosing is likely no longer necessary. You could, in theory, spot treat. At 3 years in, and having looked over my last year, I believe I am at the point where my healthy brain networks are dominant, so I am going to stop my monthly boosters and go to every 3-months, 6-months, or a year between to test if the depression and ideation remain gone. I'll post updates here as I learn more through the experiment.\n\n# -> Ketamine and THC <-\n\nTHC during ketamine therapy is a controversial topic. A lot of us, myself included, self-treated with THC prior to ketamine.\n\nPersonally, I feel ketamine and THC do interfere with each other, if not pharmacology then mentally.\n\nOne of the biggest factors in ketamine therapy is the formation of new healthy brain networks through the growth of synapses and dendrite spines. In order for those to grow properly, you need to train them and reinforce them. This needs to be done with as healthy a mind as is possible for the best long-term effects.\n\nIf you're under the influence of another drug, especially chronically then those networks form maladaptive and could make chemical dependency worse because they were trained like that. What should be a healthy brain network grows to be a chemically dependent one.\n\nSo, a lot of providers recommend (and test) that THC not be present during the course of treatment, so those networks grow properly. I believe this is the right approach. Doesn't mean you can't imbibe some once you've grown out of the healthy net (mostly there after the series of 6 and a few boosters) but don't train your new, healthy mind to be habituated on a drug.\n\nThere is good news here though, ketamine makes it very very easy to quit. It's almost like it wants to. With one dose you can just stop, easy peasy. With the window of neural plasticity, you can simply decide to change a habit like that and poof, almost like magic it changes.\n\nI know that's probably not what some wanted to hear, and if they ask around, I'm sure they'll find some in support of THC who support it while using ketamine, like I said its controversial.\n\nI quit THC personally, and now that my brain is healthy and reinforced, I also stopped drinking, LSD, THC, caffeine, and several prescriptions that I no longer need. Turns out baseline me is the version of me I like best. That's a personal choice of course, and I still occasionally imbibe in mushrooms due to their antidepressant effect, but the other stuff I just don't feel like I want. My healthy mind is preferable to most other altered states.\n\n# -> Recommendations <-\n\n### Music\n\nPlay instrumental music. Part of this is you want to let your mind wander, to freely associate and disassociate. Music with words prevents this because it constrains you to the topic it’s about.\n\n- ‘Ketamine Saved Me’ on Spotify\n- Enigma\n- Subnautica Below Zero Soundtrack\n\n### Eye Mask\n\n- You’re going to want to maximize your mind’s eye. Block light so you can see mental imagery better.\n\n### Headset\n\n- Ideally something noise-canceling. Note at times ketamine music can become atonal. Not unusual.\n\n### Itchy Eyes\n\nIf you have red or itchy eyes afterward, use antihistamine eyedrops.\n\n# -> Therapy <-\n\nWhen I’m at a therapeutic dose, whether IV or troches, I can be uncommunicative. I have a therapist trained in ketamine therapy that I worked with but ultimately decided to work with her in sessions separate from the ketamine.\n\nTo be fair, ketamine is drug therapy. It opens you up to yourself in unexpected ways. Part of my root issue was that I was beaten senselessly as a child. At a young age, I internalized that I was evil incarnate as it must be my very existence itself that I was being punished for.\n\nOut of this came a self-persecution complex I recognized and overcame.\n\nBottom line, though, I’m not even certain a therapist could have ever gotten to the root of that. Ketamine opened myself up to myself so that I could find it.\n\nMy therapist did teach me to name my minds, as I could define them and encourage the healthy ones and discourage the unhealthy ones. Observe the observer, etc.\n\nI have had times where I've been on lower doses of ketamine and talked through problems/traumas/events as they've come up, and interactively resolving the issues while on ketamine can be really effective.\n\nLots of people have benefited from working with therapists alongside ketamine therapy. u/awkwardflea said \"I got a ton out of doing integration work a few hours AFTER infusions. I know there's at least one other person with CPTSD on here who also found that beneficial and an infusion doc who supports the post-infusion integration work approach.\n\nI never tried ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAP), but based on my experience with infusions, I don't think I'd find it beneficial. Even with the lower dose, my experience is very internal. I just think I would lose a ton trying to talk to someone during it. My ego is still intact, but it takes a backseat and lets my subconscious steer, if that makes sense, unless I open my eyes and try to fight the treatment.\"\n\nI agree with u/awkwardflea in terms of KAP, even when coherent states my mind is working so quickly and associating so many disparate thoughts with each other, and delving into all the associations that underlie triggers, having to talk through it would just get in the way - and that's if I could hold my train of thought long enough to carry on a conversation.\n\nMindfulness is a useful approach in addition to therapy. Do a body scan several times per day, walk your senses, and take in the now as fully as you can. What does it feel like on your feet, how about the temperature on your skin, can you hear anything?  Your heartbeat?  Can you see anything?  The wind on the leaves?  Soak in your surroundings and wire up those new synapses and dendrite spines to your senses as fully as you can. You're rebuilding a healthy brain network and the more use, connection, and reinforcement you can give it; the better effects will be long term.\n\nFor an entertaining quick view of mindfulness and how to go about it watch this short video. \n\n- [Short Mindfulness Video](https://youtu.be/w6T02g5hnT4)\n\n# -> Disclaimer <-\n\nKetamine therapy can, at times, be difficult. Ketamine is not euphoric. Sometimes the subjective experience with ketamine isn’t fun. Those sessions can be the most therapeutic, though. Regardless — a positive or negative experience, it’s beneficial to your psyche. The regrowth of healthy new synapses and dendrite spines will happen no matter the subjective experience.\n\nKetamine yields no results in 20% of people. I have read firsthand accounts of it not working. For me, though, it worked great, and 80% of people respond well.\n\n# -> Contraindications <-\n\n### Serotonin Syndrome\n\nVery little on it, but in a singular case study, it was correlated with concurrent administration of fluoxetine. Extremely rare but be aware of this medication contraindication.\n\n\"For Ms. O, we suspected that administration of ketamine in conjunction with\nfluoxetine, 40 mg/d, led to serotonin syndrome. \"\n\n- [Contraindication](https://cdn.mdedge.com/files/s3fs-public/CP01903e1.PDF)\n\nThanks to u/birbal1 for bringing this to my attention.\n\n### Lamictal and Risperidone\n\nBoth potentially reduce the effectiveness of ketamine, according to this study: [Ketamine and other depression meds](https://academic.oup.com/ijnp/article/24/10/808/6309481).\n\nI take both and still worked 100% but need higher doses than some others.\n\n### Gabapentin\n\nKetamine operates against the GABA receptors, as does Gabapentin, so there is overlap that could conflict.\n\n### Grapefruit Juice\n\nThere are reported interactions (as is common with grapefruit juice and other meds) but what the exact effect caused is unclear.\n\n### Liver Interaction\n- Rifampin, a tuberculosis drug that decreases ketamine\n- St John’s Wort, is a popular supplement for a variety of conditions that decreases ketamine\n- Ketoconazole, an anti-fungal drug that increases ketamine\n- Cimetidine (Tagamet), an acid reducer for heartburn and peptic ulcers that theoretically increases ketamine\n- Orphenadrine (Norflex), a muscle relaxant, inhibits CYP2B6 and slows the breakdown of ketamine which increases the amount of ketamine in the body\n- Dexamethasone, a common steroid, actually induces CYP2B6 and speeds up the breakdown of ketamine. This decreases the amount of ketamine left in your system to work\n\n# -> Ketamine and Psychosis <-\n\nWhile ketamine works very well in bipolar patients, those with psychotic features must maintain their antipsychotic while undergoing ketamine therapy.\n\nKetamine does nothing to solve psychosis and mania, so keep using a mood stabilizer such as Lamictal, and an antipsychotic such as risperidone.\n\n# -> Bladder Harm <-\n\nNote, like much around ketamine therapy, this section is controversial, and the most often criticized section here.  Do your own research and know my guidance is quite conservative according to many. The way I see it since the risk here is long-term damage to the body, it is much better to be safe than sorry, so I am conservative intentionally.\n\nMost chronic bladder damages were seen with ketamine results from abuse in recreational users.\n\nBladder damage potentially occurs from chronic exposure to ketamine metabolites, which damage the inner mucosa lining of the bladder. There may also be damage to interstitial tissue, microvascular changes, and autoimmune responses. It's hypothesized that chronic contact with metabolites will result in submucosal edema, vascular ectasia, detrusor muscle inflammation, and fibrosis. Collectively this is called ketamine cystitis (KC). The incidence of lower urinary tract symptoms was found in around 30% of ketamine abusers.\n\nI'm told dosing at 200 mg a day, and lower has been shown to result in very low (no) incidents of KC. If your dose is beyond 200 mg in a day, for more than a few days, consider a break to allow the bladder's mucosal layer to heal. \n\nThis damage can be monitored interactively - signs of progression toward KC are bloody urine, cloudy urine, increased urinary frequency, urge incontinence, bladder pain, and dysuria (burning). If you find these early signs it's safest to take a break. It is thought the bladder can heal itself completely early on, so those symptoms should clear up within a month if caught early.\n\nOutside of active bladder harm management, it's generally recommended that you drink a lot of water diluting the ketamine metabolites reducing potential damage.\n\n- [More Info](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879522614001122)\n- [More Info](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4544277/pdf/bcr-2012-007244.pdf)\n\nAdditionally, even though KC is not well understood, potential treatment programs may be available, research in this area shows the potential to reverse chronic long-term symptoms.\n\n\"Treatment with the antifibrotic compound N-acetylcysteine alleviated the symptoms and pathological characteristics of KC, indicating that the antifibrotic capacity of MSC therapy underlies its benefits. Thus, this study for the first time shows that MSC therapy might help to cure KC by protecting against tissue fibrosis in a KC animal model and provides a foundation for clinical trials of MSC therapy.\"\n\n- [More Info](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep30881)\n\n# -> Important <-\n\nI am not a doctor, and this is not medical advice.

I obviously knew this wasn’t true when I came to, but it was unsettling enough that I stopped. I recently started treatment again via injection and was enjoying the treatments much more until my third one yesterday, when I again suddenly had an experience completely out of left field that was unsettling. This time I was a spider and always had been. I suspect the idea came from a novel I’d read recently (Children of Time by A. Tchaikovsky) and I tried to shrug it off and refocus but ended up spending the entire session wondering how I’d ever thought I was a human and contemplating my spiderness and the knowledge my ancestor-spiders passed to me. Honestly it seemed beyond absurd. Am I possibly over-dosed for internal reflection? It seems like it’s around dose 3 or 4 that things are going off the rails (unless I’m really an alien spider?).",

    "body": "After the horror that was teen acne, I started noticing that my face, especially my nose and chin, often seemed dry and scaly. I figured my toner was too harsh, so I stopped. Maybe my cleanser was too strong, so I switched. And switched. Switched again. New makeup. Another differently textured makeup. Fresh makeup sponges. No sponges. Disposable tissue as sponges. Exfoliant. New exfoliant. Different moisturizer. Again. Repeat. Start over with all of it again. I figured it was normal, expected, everyone deals with it occasionally.\n\nEvery few weeks, the scaly skin would get so bad that my scratching, brushing it off, moisturizing wouldn't fix it, and I'd have to go nuclear. Spinning brush thing! Harsh scrub! Actual granulated sugar, in a pinch!\n\nSo this cycle of skin flaking and drying, product changing, and exfoliating continued unabated for the next...30 years.\n\nIn the beginning of those same 30 years, in my early teens, I noticed my scalp having this thick white weirdness in patches. Around age 14 or so, I used T-gel shampoo at a relative's house, and the weird stuff went away. So I used that every few washes, and the buildup stayed to a minimum.\n\nFast forward 15+ years. My kid was born with **awful** cradle cap. I noticed as it brushed off, their hair finally began trying to grow. The doc said use selsen blue to get rid of cradle cap. Said it was seborrheic dermatitis. At some point, kid got a weird rash, got a referral to dermatology, the SD was confirmed (I mention I'd had buildup as a teen, the dermatologist said it was likely the same issue for me) and kidlet got a prescription for ketoconazole shampoo.\n\nGreat. Fast forward **8 MORE YEARS**. I read a reddit post from someone who describes their flaky, furry, gross facial skin, and I'm like, yep yep, same. Then another commenter says, \"sounds like seborrheic dermatitis. Use hydrocortisone cream to help.\"\n\nOMG, the facepalm. Literally years of my life and hundreds if not thousands spent on lotions, cleansers, wipes, creams, special makeup. And the solution was in my medicine cabinet the whole time.\n\nIt's been a week since I started washing my face with ketoconazole and using the hydrocortisone occasionally. My skin finally looks normal. I'm glad I found a solution, wish it would've occurred to me 30 years ago to ask a dermatologist. Or, you know, *any other time in the intervening 3 decades.*\n\nHoping at the very least this serves as a PSA to people assuming they've just got to live with their weird skin stuff. Go see a dermatologist!\n\nTLDR: spent 30 years assuming that my dry, flaky face was normal, an expected nuisance, and totally unrelated to my scalp condition. Started treating it differently after a reddit comment, turns out my skin is completely normal. ETA: completely normal once my condition is treated!",

Personally, having a moderate amount of healthy carbs in my diet improves my hair shedding. I shed so much hair when I was on a low carb diet. My detailed hair growth routine is here:*** [***https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/173ktba/how\\_i\\_have\\_successfully\\_grown\\_my\\_hair\\_back/***](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/173ktba/how_i_have_successfully_grown_my_hair_back/)\n* **Scalp conditions: healthy white scalp, no itchiness, no flakes**\n* **Shampoo routine: shampooing every other day, using Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair every  7-10 days, Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo for the rest of the week.**\n* **Diet and Lifestyle: Mediterranean diet; go to bed before 12; 7-8 hours of sleep everyday;**\n* **Stress management: don't give a shit about things that used to bother me, overall better mood**\n\nHi there, I've benefitted a lot from this community, so I'd like to make some contributions. I was losing an average of 200-300 hairs everyday at the onset of my sebderm. After two months, I'm now only shedding about 90 hairs daily, which is within the normal range. I know that clinically speaking there is no cure to sebderm and it may come back later, but I'm just happy that it's at least under control now. So I want to share this as my SOS protocol. As for long-term maintenance, I'm still learning so much about it from this community.\n\nBackground:\n\n\\- suffered from dry dandruff (large and white flakes) for more than 12 years but never experienced any hair loss\n\n\\- Because of COVID, I developed a bad habit of only shampooing 1-2 times a week (I have an oily scalp and straight hair). On non-wash days, I used a lot of hair products to keep my scalp feeling clean, e.g. scalp serum and dry shampoo. I only found out later that they contained denatured alcohol, which can destroy our skin barrier.\n\n\\- In late Aug, I experienced increased hair shedding of a daily average of 200-300 strands when I usually only shed a maximum of 30-60 strands a day. At the worst point, I was losing 500 hairs when I was shampooing one day. And I almost passed out.\n\n\\- My scalp was tingling, burning, and sore.\n\n\\- I went to a dermatologist in early Sept. He diagnosed me with severe sebderm and folliculitis on my scalp. He said I needed to get my sebderm under control before he could treat my hair loss\n\n\\- My before and after pics (warning: my sebderm was really bad on my scalp): [https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i](https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSebderm and hair loss:\n\n\\- I was very anxious and depressed about my hair loss because I've always had thick and healthy hair. People always give me compliments on how my hair looks. The point is that I was feeling so much pain mentally.\n\n\\- I consulted other dermatologists. Some said sebderm could cause telogen effluvium because my condition was so severe that it shocked my hair. Some said even though sebderm could cause increased hair shedding, mine was too serious to be caused by sebderm alone. There might be other causes.\n\n\\- But from Dr. Donovan's blog, there is a study that revealed that the more seborrheic dermaitits a person has, the more shedding (telogen effluvium) a person will experience. This tells us that individuals with severe seborrheic dermatitis are likely to have a severe telogen effluvium.\n\n\\- I still went to my family doctor and a naturopath to get blood tests done just to be sure what we're dealing with here. Everything was normal, so I focused on getting my sebderm under control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow I got the situation under control:\n\n\\- My dermatologist prescribed me with clobetasol solution and ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo.\n\n\\- At first, I was reluctant to use steroid. However, the longer my scalp stays inflamed, the more possible damage will be caused to my hair follicles, so I followed my derm's instructions and applied clobetasol to the affected areas daily for 21 days. My scalp was less red but I was still shedding 150-200 hairs a day.\n\n\\- Using the ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo (every other day for 8 weeks, as instructed by my dermatologist) was not very helpful. After much research, I came up with my own protocol that has really helped me get my sebderm under control.\n\n**- What I found is key is that the protocol needs to consist of three components: 1) destroy the biofilm, 2) kill malassezia, and 3) rebuild skin barrier. For each component, there are numerous ingredients/products available.**\n\n**- You can do all three components on a particular day or scatter them around throughout the week, depending on whatever suits your schedule and skin needs. Experiment and observe what suits your skin the best.**\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **on a given shampoo day**: 5% xylitol solution on the affected areas to be left on for at least an hour --> wash it off with an antifungal shampoo --> apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **in a particular week** (this is what I'm doing now): biofilm shampoo on day 1 and day 3 of the week followed by ciclopirox shampoo on day 5 and day 7. Each time after shampooing, apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 1) destroying the biofilm: xylitol, ACV, and selenium sulfide, MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 2) killing malassezia: ciclopirox, ketoconazole, coal tar, zinc pyrithione, and MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 3) rebuilding skin barrier: panthenol (vitamin B5), niacinamide (vitamin B3), glycerin, and aloe vera\n\n\\- Salicylic acid is not anti fungal per se, but it's great at removing the scales, regulating sebum production, and calming down inflammation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy detailed protocol:\n\n**-  I shampoo four times a week: Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide --> Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide OR T/Sal --> Ciclopirox 1.5% Shampoo --> T/Sal (I only use Selsun Blue twice a week for 2 weeks when things are bad because it is very strong)**\n\n**- This protocol is for short-term ONLY, e.g. 2-6 weeks! To get things under control first.**\n\n**- (updated on 4 Jan 2022) As my sebderm is getting much better, I have switched to this gentler protocol, which again incorporates all the essential components, for long-term maintenance. I'm rotating three different shampoos: Neutrogena T/Sal, DermaKB Scalp Detoxifier (biofilm disrupter), and Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Shampoo (contains an antifungal Piroctone Olamine). To hydrate my scalp, I've been using a DIY niacinamide and panthenol spray.**\n\n\\- Selenium Sulfide 2.5% is a game changer for me!! The dandruff/biofilm was finally coming off after 1-2 uses. Antifungals cannot get to the malassezia to do their job if the biofilm is present.\n\n\\- After shampooing, ~~I apply a DIY 3% panthenol aloe vera gel to my scalp.~~ I'm now using this DIY 2% glycerin, 2% panthenol, and 4% niacinamide in water spray.\n\n\\- Avoid ANY ingredient that may feed malassezia (I use a website called Sezia. Simple Skincare Science is also a very good source).\n\n\\- Even though I don't suffer sebderm on any other area, I switch all of my skincare products to seb-derm safe products because my skincare may transfer to my pillow.\n\n\\- I use a silk pillow case to reduce the friction (I can't afford to lose even one more hair).\n\n\\- I change my pillow case every 2-3 days and wash my pillow every week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct recommendations:\n\n\\- What is weird is that a lot of the products that are supposed to be formulated for people with sebderm are not sebderm friendly. They contain ingredients that feed malassezia. There is a useful website called Sezia that I use to check whether a product is safe (not affiliated). This is also the reason I need to DIY the panthenol and aloe scalp treatment.\n\n\\- Products that I like: Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide Shampoo, Neutrogena T/Sal, Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Scalp, dermaKB Biofilm Scalp Detoxifier, Philosophy B5 powder, the Ordinary 100% niacinamide powder,\n\n\\- Products that made my situation worse: Head and Shoulders Royal Oils Scalp Elixir, Inkey List Salicylic Acid Scalp Treatment, Head and Shoulders Clinical Strength 1% Selenium Sulfide\n\n~~- I will be experimenting with a DIY niacinamide and panthenol toner (for rebuilding skin barrier and calming inflammation) and 5% xylitol solution (for destroying the biofilm) and will keep this community updated of my results.~~ After much trial and error, I settle on this DIY scalp toner (2% glycerin, 2% panthenol, and 4% niacinamide in distilled water, which I think is really helpful for calming my scalp.\n\n**- Neutrogena T/Sal shampoo may be too harsh for people with a dry/sensitive scalp, but my oily scalp loves it!!! It helps get rid of the oily buildup and flakes on my scalp while also regulating my sebum production. My scalp is definitely less oily. And malassezia loves an oily scalp because they also feed on our natural sebum.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDiet and supplements (Please see here for a detailed wholistic approach to tacking sebderm: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/rggsrj/a\\_novelwholistic\\_evidenceinspired\\_approach\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/rggsrj/a_novelwholistic_evidenceinspired_approach_to/)):\n\n\\- Daily: Vitamin D3+K2, cod liver oil, ~~reishi, homemade kefir~~, nutritional yeast, ~~MCT oil~~\n\n\\- 2-3 times a week: zinc, magnesium glycinate, and collagen powder\n\n**- What I would recommend for almost everyone: vitamin D3+K2, magnesium, and fish oil.**\n\n\\- Around 60-70% of people in North America are deficient in vitamin D. There are also studies that point to an association between vitamin D deficiency and inflammatory skin conditions such as sebderm. Although this does not mean a causal relationship, taking vitamin D3 overall can help regulate our hormones and immune system. Magnesium and vitamin K2 should be supplemented with vitamin D3. This combo also help me better deal with stress, which is also a trigger of sebderm.\n\n\\- Fish oil supplement helps the body repair the skin barrier. It is also highly anti-inflammatory. But remember to choose a reliable brand. Many of the fish oil supplements on the market are contaminated. Brands I love that are also third-party tested: Nordic Naturals, Natural Factors Pharmaceutical Grade Fish Oil, and InnovixLab.\n\n\\- Probiotics that I've tried and quite like: Garden of Life Dr Formulated, Seed, and Visbiome (not affiliated in any sense; purchased all products with my own money)\n\n\\- Garlic powder supplement and oregano oil capsules daily for 1 week for killing the bad bacteria in my gut\n\n\\- Homemade bone broth for repairing my gut\n\n\\- Gluten-free\n\n\\- No refined carbs at all\n\n\\- No sugar\n\n\\- No dairy ~~except kefir~~\n\n\\- Lots of greens with some meat each meal\n\n\\- Berries everyday (there is a study that revealed a correlation between low fruit intake and sebderm in women). Plus, berries are anti-inflammatory\n\n\\- Avoid using vegetable oil in cooking. Opt for more heat-stable oils that are also low in omega-6s, e.g. extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, ghee, and butter.\n\n\\- To sum up, the key is to incorporate as much anti-inflammatory food as possible. Some further examples are turmeric and ginger.\n\n\\- What I usually eat: [https://imgur.com/a/nr1JKne](https://imgur.com/a/nr1JKne)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummary of helpful resources/research:\n\n\\- Simple Skincare Science website\n\n\\- Sezia Website\n\n\\- Dandruff Deconstructed Website\n\n\\- Dr. Donovan's blog (He has recently published quite a number of articles on sebderm)\n\n\\- Ceramide insufficiency in sebderm patients ( [https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(07)01771-9/fulltext#relatedArticles](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(07)01771-9/fulltext#relatedArticles)) ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12115025/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12115025/))\n\n\\- Niacinamide increases ceramide production ([http://fagron.lookhere-dev.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Atopic-Dermatitis\\_Nicotinamide-Tanno-O-2000-BJD.pdf](http://fagron.lookhere-dev.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Atopic-Dermatitis_Nicotinamide-Tanno-O-2000-BJD.pdf))\n\n\\- Caprylic and Polygalacturonic Acid Combinations for Eradication of Microbial Organisms Embedded in Biofilm ([https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01999/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01999/full))\n\n\\- Topical nicotinamide \\[i.e. niacinamide\\] for seborrheic dermatitis: an open randomized study ([https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/55117499.pdf](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/55117499.pdf))\n\n\\- Skin moisturizing effects of panthenol-based formulations ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21982351/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21982351/))\n\nFinally, I want to say that there is still hope. Don't give up. I will pray for everyone in this community to regain their health soon!\n\nEdit: I will continue to edit this and add on to it based on my ongoing research and trial and error. And also to add the things that I forgot to mentionEdit: Added some before and after pics and meal idea pics.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have any questions\n\nEdit on 19 Jan 2022: Now my scalp is free from dandruff with very mild redness, itch is very neglectable like only very mild itch every 5-6 days, and I'm shedding an average of 70 strands of hair daily, which is within the normal range of 50-100 hairs daily as advised by most dermatologists. This is my latest weekly routine (I shampoo four times a week): Neutrogena T/Sal Shampoo --> Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Scalp (start with as little shampoo as possible because it lathers very well; too much lather can be irritating to the scalp) --> Phillip Adam Apple Cider Vinegar Shampoo (Fragrance Free) --> Ciclopirox 1.5% Shampoo (available by prescription only; alternatives are ketoconazole shampoo and selenium sulfide). ~~Each time after shampooing, I apply the DIY hydrating scalp spray containing 2% panthenol, 2% glycerin, and 4% niacinamide.~~ No longer using the toner as the shampoos I'm using now are very hydrating and gentle.\n\nEdit on 23 Jan 2022:  I've just stumbled across some substitutes for this DIY spray from a brand called COSRX. Although they are not hair products, the ingredient lists seem pretty good. This toner ([https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/centella-water-alcohol-free-toner](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/centella-water-alcohol-free-toner)) contains panthenol and sodium hyaluronate, which are both good hydrating ingredients. This one ([https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/bha-blackhead-power-liquid](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/bha-blackhead-power-liquid)) contains salicylic acid, niacinamide, and panthenol. I'm probably going to try these out soon as I sometimes don't have the time to make the DIY spray. BIG **DISCLAIMER: These are not products formulated for the scalp. Use at your own discretion.**\n\nUpdates on 15 Mar 2022: I'm now using a routine targeted at healing my skin barrier because my scalp is now flake-free but mildly red. Shampooing every other day: ciclopirox shampoo once a week and Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo (if you have a really oily scalp, Briogeo Be Gentle Be Kind Matcha Shampoo may be a better alternative) for the rest of the week. Each time after shampooing, I apply some diluted niacinamide serum from The Ordinary because the original 10% may be too irritating. The study that suggested niacinamide as a potential treatment for sebderm used a concentration of 4%. I also added some panthenol powder to the mixture (at a concentration of about 1.5%), which is completely optional. I'm now shedding about 50 hairs daily.\n\nThe new HA hydrating serum by The Ordinary did not work for me. I tested it on my hairline, then the sebderm migrated to my hairline while my scalp, luckily, is still clear.\n\nUpdates on 12 May 2022: Shampooing every 2-3 days because my scalp is less oily and less itchy. Not using any topical hydrating product because I think my skin has healed so much. Now I'm using ciclopirox shampoo (by prescription only) once a week, and Bioderma Node A Shampoo for the rest of the days\n\nUpdates on 7 July 2022: Shampooing every other day; Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair once a week and Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for sensitive scalp for the rest of the week; taking anti-inflammatory herbs prescribed by a licensed Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner (TCM); shedding 40-50 hairs daily; scalp pretty healthy; incorporated more carbs in my diet because realized a low-carb diet makes me shed more hair\n\nUpdates on 28 Aug 2022: Shampooing every other day; Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair every 10 days and Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo for the rest of the week; been taking the herbs for almost 2 months now. Noticed my scalp is less oily, zero itch now, no flakes, and redness almost gone. There are some days where I'm shedding only 20-30 hairs daily, which is my pre-sebderm level. But I DON'T recommend visiting a TCM practitioner in western countries. Most of them have no idea what they're doing, and the herbs, if not prescribed properly, can cause damage to the liver and kidney. They are also not well-regulated under the law. My diet is lots of cooked vegetables, some berries, some carbs, and some meat. My TCM doctor told me to avoid seafood (except some fish) and beef.",

First off, I just want to say how grateful I am for this subreddit, I genuinely don’t think I would’ve had the courage or inspiration to start this journey without it.\n\nSome background: I’m 24F, and my hair loss started in 2020. Things progressively got worse and really hit a low point in late 2024. I think it was due to a bunch of issues of issues: I had COVID early on (which definitely kicked off the hair-loss), Long-term vitamin D deficiency and iron levels always on the low end (on and off since 2018), weight loss (especially in 2024, I lost 40 lbs), zero understanding of how to care for my wavy/curly hair, and I was just *constantly* stressed out.\n\nI started to realize just how bad it was getting mid 2024. I ordered some 5% minoxidil foam but hesitated for months. I had a hard time accepting that starting minoxidil could mean shedding the little hair I had left before it MIGHT get better, hated the idea of being on it “forever,” and was nervous about the risk to my cats.\n\nBut after seeing those first two photos of my scalp, I finally bit the bullet in Sept 2024. As scared as I was about starting minoxidil, the state of my hair terrified me even more. I started applying men's 5% foam minoxidil every night (sometimes twice a day but I couldn't stick to this routine). I started seeing a little bit of progress, baby hairs growing in, sparsity was less noticeable, but nothing crazy. I also did not have a shedding period, and if I did then I didn't notice, as I was already constantly shedding crazy amount of hair.\n\nDecember 2024: I tried to get a derm appointment. My primary doctor referred me, but the request was denied (apparently my case wasn’t “severe enough” 🦅). However, even though I wasn't able to get an appointment, a dermatologist looked at my medical history and diagnosed me with TE, which allowed my doctor to prescribe me oral minoxidil. I started at 0.625mg and bumped to 1.25mg after a month because I wasn’t experiencing any side effects, while still applying the foam every night.\n\nOther changes I made since then:\n\n* Got a silk pillowcase and started using a silk bonnet.\n* Switched to washing my hair more often (used to be every 3–4 days, now it’s every 1–2).\n* Ditched gentle non-sulfate shampoos and switched to harsher shampoos, my main ones are: Pantene Volume & Body, Pantene Miracles Infinite Lengths, Nizoral Ketoconazole.\n* Switched conditioners to Dove Conditioner Intensive Repair and Nioxin System 3 Conditioner.\n* Religiously taking vitamins:\n   * Iron, vitamin D, women’s multivitamin (Costco)\n   * Also: pumpkin seed oil, fish oil, and Nature’s Bounty Hair, Skin & Nails 1–2x/week (too much biotin breaks me out)\n* I try to eat more protein.\n* Stopped heat styling (I used to straighten my hair 5x/week)\n* Started using products to keep the hair I already have healthy. I hate how pricey these products are but Olaplex No.7 and Kerastase 8H night serum have been great for my super fine hair.\n* This one hurts...I gave up black box dye\n* No more ponytails, I try to keep it down as much as possible, otherwise claw clip.\n\nThings I tried but could not keep up consistently:\n\n* Red light therapy. I got a reasonably priced red light cap, but I couldn't keep up with it for long enough to say whether it helped at all. I hated the sweaty/hot feeling on my scalp.\n* Derma stamping. I only managed to do this 4–5 times in a month, but I swear I saw progress. Will revisit this.\n* Scalp serums. They make my scalp feel great but I can't justify the cost for the small return I've observed.\n* Reducing my stress. I just don't think it's possible while I remain in the corporate hell hole so it is what it is. \n\nNow it's been 9 months on foam, and 6 months on oral. I’m using both nightly.\n\nI didn't experience too many symptoms with the foam, I recall there being a short adjustment period where my performance at the gym took a small dip, but that's pretty much it.\n\nI didn't experience any symptoms when I started oral 0.625mg.\n\nWith oral (1.25mg):\n\n* Faster body/facial hair growth (need to dermaplane/shave weekly now)\n* Water retention/bloating after salty meals (only I notice, plus the scale)\n* Resting heart rate went up by \\~10 bpm (was low to begin with)\n* Early on, I had nights where my heartbeat felt stronger than normal, but that faded\n\n**TL;DR**: 9 months on minoxidil. Big lifestyle and haircare changes. Learned not to completely abuse my hair. No magic fix, but progress is happening.",

    "body": "Hi everyone. Hope this post comes out succinct despite how tired I am. Toko is 17 (dachshund/beagle/terrier) and has had skin allergies half his life. They used to be manageable and always went away when the weather cooled. Been to 3 different vets. One said Malassezia. The others just said it was from a fungal infection and environment. He was usually prescribed Simplicef (antibiotic) and Apoquel (anti itch). I read sketchy things about Apoquel and he hasn't gotten it since. Instead he got Cytopoint many times. He's also  been presrcibed Ketoconazole (antifungal). I have all the shampoos in the book and I've tried every homeopathic remedy. Coconut, castor, and neem oil offer great relief. But none of the previous combos are keeping it at bay and he's more uncomfortable than he's ever been. It's breaking my heart. He winces in his sleep. I don't want to prolong his pain but I know he's fighting hard and not ready to go yet. He eats with great appetite; home cooked super healthy meals. His bloodwork is healthy for his age. Recently on a pee stick test (?) he had high ketone levels and glucose. He has slight dementia/sundowners on and off. He still has pep in his step but he's not having fun! I'd like to hear from anyone who has experience with this. All input is welcome! Thank you (normally I'd edit a post 5x but I'm sending it/I am so tired. Plz help)",

We have some medical experience (wife and I) and we requested to start at the safest but highest dose and titrate down… it really worked… we had to stick with it but by the the 3-4 shot… even on 1-2 there were noticeable changes and improvements. \n\nWe stay away from Apoquel. \n\nAlso… too many baths can be irritating to the skin. We use goats milk soap… it’s called Caeden’s choice. We get it from www.basilwoodfarm.com the lady who owns the company started it due to her son’s skin issues.  She adv. this was the bar that started it all and really helped her son and his skin issues… we tried and have had good results. It is pricey but if you use it once a month and it will last a yr. If not close to it. Remove it from wet areas when not using to make it last. We bathe no more than once a month and at times longer… our guys are mostly indoors. \n\nHydrocortisone wipes, cream or spray… our vet advised safe in moderation. I find it easier and less risky of getting kicked off if I apply(I like the wipes) before eating something they like, before bed and or light play time… they get so distracted they sorta forget allowing it enough time to dry. \n\nAlso.. I believe I commented before… maybe a different post but check out Bernie’s perfect poop… it is a probiotic, prebiotic, enzymes and fiber all in one.. it’s the consistency of like crumbles… small. The first 1-2 weeks we mixed a sprinkle in cottage cheese with 2 meals daily and massive improvements… I know Amazon has it and so does Chewys.\n\nBe stern with the vet when you go again… be direct! Say, I need you to help me figure out how to treat this. What do and don’t I do. Ask for pain meds, antibiotic, anti fungal cream… anything he or she can offer. Tell them you want him out of pain and you want to see improvement.\n\nMaybe keep a log of when you see good and bad… what was different on those days. Log if certain foods cause flare ups. \n\nI really swear by… not saying it is the fix for this babe but Cytopoint is not a steroid… doesn’t impact labs and fights food and environmental allergies. \n\nDoes ur guy have ear infections? That would be indicative of food allergies. \n\nFresh aloe? \n\nI hate to recommend fats/ dairy for smaller dogs specifically just cause it can be hard on the organs and cause pancreas and gallbladder issues easily but maybe a lil Salmon oil. \n\nPositive vibes and sorry so long. Praying for you and the lil one.",

Your story is SO similar to mine so this brought tears to my eyes, although I admit I’m still crying daily for my Oscar.\n\nOscar was 17.8 years old when I lost him.  Like Toko, he had skin sensitivities as well (he was a dachshund).  Almost died at six months due to a bee sting, but got him to the vet in time.  About three years ago, he started having allergies & skin infections.  He’d get so itchy that he’d bite to the point where he’d bleed.  We had him on monthly shots of Cytopoint, which I wasn’t totally convinced helped him 100%, but it lessened his itch.  About six months ago, it got worse so he did Simplicef and Apoquel - was hopeful bc had heard so much good stuff about it.  He was prescribed a medicated shampoo to be used once or twice a week.  Tried Ketoconazole, but he had bad diarrhea and was so lethargic so we stopped it.  \n\nOn top of all that, he received Librela for arthritis, which was his secondary diagnosis.  Tramadol was initially prescribed, but he hated it - threw it up, cheeked it, he hated it.  \n\nBut the skin infection continued and his hair fell out in clumps.  He looked like Toko…dry skin at the base of his fur, itching still, and tufts of hair fell out.  It began to spread to his ears even.  The area would turn black and then fur would fall out.  One night, he barely slept (he slept with me, I didn’t care about his flakes) because he was so itchy.\n\nTried CBD, tried oatmeal baths.  He still was so miserable.  Weekly visits to the vet and even they couldn’t figure it out; there’s no dermatologist vet in our area either.\n\nIn the end, my Oscar was too frail, too tired to fight the infection.  He let me know…and I gave him permission to go to the bridge.  I miss him every single minute of every single day, but his beautiful personality and character were snuffed out by these ailments.\n\nI pray hard to Toko will be able to overcome his infections and recover.  I just wanted to share our story because I wanted you to know that I’ve had to deal with the very same issue and I know how perplexing and frustrating this can be.  Toko - be the warrior and fight!  \n\nPlease DM me and I’ll share pictures of my boy’s condition and please let me know how Toko is doing.  I wish you both well 🙏🏼",

She was so cute and still is… in an so ugly it’s cute way..\nI know some pups can go threw a balding phase but I noticed that she had some cystic acne like bumps. I took her to the vet already and they seemed relatively unconcerned and gave me ketoconazole/chlorhexidine wipes to wipe her face. They said puppies sometimes get minor skin conditions that they grow out of, but her balding is getting progressively worse. Is this something more serious or will it actually go away on its own? ",

    "body": "I, currently M 22 was having very bad hairfall starting from 2018 when I started JEE prep, and dandruff was just as bad. I shaved my head twice, tried homeopathy(the doctor told me it was psoriasis and do not eat eggs), then multiple shampoos and hair creams, but I was still losing 100-200 hairs a day and too much dandruff. If I ate hot or spicy things, my scalp started to sweat and itch badly.   \nI went to BHU in the  start of 2021 when I already lost 70% of hair density(it was even loss from everywhere, not any pattern). The doctor gave me minoxidil 5% (2x per day) and Ketoconazole shampoo(2x per week). I have been using it as said for 4 years. The hairfall reduced but did not vanish, same for dandruff. But slowly I was regaining my hair density. I tried many home remedies in between but nothing worked. And if I stopped minoxidil or shampoo, the problem got worse,,e so I used it continuously for 4 years.  \nFast forward to Jan 2025 after many experiments, my mom gave me juice of only 1 amla in water to drink in the morning and applied juice of 1 fresh amla on my head. In just 5 days, seriously, my dandruff vanished like it never existed and in 10 days my hairfall completely reduced to under 10. It was unbelievable. (I have attached the images, that even when using ketoconazole my scalp looked infested, and In five days, minimal dandruff remained.)\n\n  \nBut soon I came back to college and there was no amla to apply and I got busy with studies, the hairfall and dandruff came back. For 2 months I beared with it, but then I had a thought to try lemon since my mess served it.   \nHere came the turning point, every night, after dinner, I squeezed 1/4th of lemon in 1 glass water and drank it, in 14 days, my hairfall came under normal level. There was still dandruff though, then I used 1 lemon to mix in 10 ml water and applied to my scalp every alternate day and wash when it dries. And here it is, in 2 weeks, my dandruff vanished too. I am neither using minoxidil nor ketoconazole and there is no rebound of dandruff or hairfall in these 2 weeks.   \nI used to think that I have to use the minoxidil for life but looks like I overcame that hurdle. Lemons are much cheaper than minoxidil and do not cause any itching in my scalp after applying. I am really happy and I wanted to share to you guys that maybe amla won't work for you, lemon won't work for you, but keep experimenting, one day you will find your golden remedy to cure your hair problems. Just keep trying and don't ignore hairfall. I have 70% of my hair density now compared to class 10th days. Hope it gets up to 80%.\n\nSummary- Had serious Hairfall and dandruff for 5 years, used minoxidil and ketoconazole for 4 years but they were temporary measures and problem still persisted and rebounded after stopping. Tried many things at the end amla worked, but it wasn't available in college, so drank 1/4 lemon+water in dinner daily and applied 1 lemon + 10 ml water on scalp and wash after drying. And the problem vanished. I will continue to use lemon for some years which is much more convenient and cheaper. So guys, try some home remedies and something will work, do not leave everything to fate.",

        "body": "😂 Did the same for years, and now I regret it daily…\n\nNot sure if you know or not, but the powder-like flakes you see in your hair are not the actual dandruff itself but rather the visible symptom of dandruff. So, the visible things like flakes and uneven skin, like in your image are not actually dandruff, they are just dead skin. Dandruff itself is not visible to us, and you can’t see ketoconazole’s action with your eyes, you only feel its effect over time.\n\nThose flakes are just already dead skin caused by dandruff. Dandruff is actually a type of yeast-like fungus that naturally lives on the scalp. In some people, this fungus overgrows and irritates the scalp, leading to increased skin cell turnover. This causes dead skin cells to clump together and shed as white flakes.\n\n\n\nI know lemon might seem like a natural alternative to medicated shampoos, but trust me, it’s not. The negatives of lemon outweigh the positives. From my experience, I suggest you stick with ketoconazole instead of lemon. Ketoconazole works much better. The real work needs to be done on the scalp by controlling the fungus, which you can’t see, so don’t fall for the lemon trick.\n\nAlso, don’t try to remove flakes with your hands or nails. Those flakes are just dead skin, and leaving them there won’t harm you. But if you scratch or pick at them, you might pull out hair or even damage your scalp, which is definitely not good. If you want to remove them, use a comb or just wash it out. Don’t try to forcefully remove those dead scalp from your head.\n\n\n\nUltimately, scalp health is important, so take care of it properly!",

    "body": "Hey guys, as the end of 2023 nears, I thought I'd do a post for those coming to this sub in desperate need of help.\n\nIn this post I’m going to be talking about the science of hair loss and what to do if you are balding and want to stop it.\n\nI’m a medical student and have donated a lot of my personal time to pharmacology, hormones and hair protocols through research and experimentation. There’s a lot going on here on Reddit, and as a beginner it can be very daunting to decide on what to do. Obviously everything should be discussed with your doctor, but below is my best attempt at a guide to explain a little bit about hair loss:\n\n\\-\n\nI first noticed I was balding around 12 months ago, and rather than get caught up in the genetics of hair loss and trying to figure out whether it was Dad, my Mum’s Dad, my Mum’s Dad’s Dad or the goldfish he owned when he was 10, I thought to myself:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I can’t change my **genetics**. Whatever my DNA sequencing (genomic regions) has in store for me in regards to balding, that’s pretty much set. The best I can do is fight as long as I can using the highest quality science, products and methodologies to offset it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd that’s what I’ve been doing, with good success, over the past 12 months.\n\nLet’s get into it, and I’m going to do this in order of most important to least (in my opinion).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Getting to the root cause: DHT**\n\nOkay, so if we look at the entire testosterone/HPT axis pathway, cholesterol is converted to testosterone and some people think that’s the end of the line, but it’s actually not; 5-alpha reductase (5A1/2 in the image **below**) is the enzyme responsible for converting Testosterone (T) to its much more potent form DHT (dihydrotestosterone).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[5-alpha reductase converts Testosterone to DHT, the hair killer.](https://preview.redd.it/8w41inr0id6c1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5c3fa6ef959d1d758c7bd324d0f62191f88d558)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, interestingly, 5-alpha reductase for whatever reason is very high prevalent in skin tissue - including the human scalp. ***And side note***: this is why guys who take testosterone gel or cream often have very high levels of DHT compared to guys who take injections, because the cream is being converted through the skin into DHT at a much higher rate than injectable esters into muscle bellies. But, basically, it is this 5-alpha reductase activity in the scalp that is converting testosterone to DHT, and DHT through a variety of mechanisms leads to follicular miniaturisation (hair thinning, and eventual loss of your hair follicles).\n\nBut **why**? Well, there are hundreds of factors: hormonal (androgen receptor density & sensitivity to said androgens), physical, genetic, environmental. The list goes on.\n\nNote; [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4174066/) goes into a lot more depth for those of you interested.\n\n*But, how do we actually combat balding?*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Most men tend to lose their hair in patterns as described by the famous Norwood Scale.](https://preview.redd.it/6m5v2i0fid6c1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=02c45568c3b5427759c449bcd87197502fe2ac8f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Slowing Down Male Pattern Baldness**\n\n**5-alpha Reductase Inhibitors (Finasteride, Dutasteride):**\n\nWith how much I’ve spoken about 5-alpha reductase and DHT, it seems logical that stopping this conversion of Testosterone to DHT is the absolute first line of defence against hair loss.\n\nTo really, truly combat hair loss, the first mechanism is as follows: **you absolutely need to reduce your hair follicles’ exposure to DHT.**\n\nAnd how do we do this? Well, finasteride is a drug that acts as a **5-alpha reductase inhibitor**. Sold under the name **Propecia**, the molecule is a strong 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, and has been shown to inhibit around 70% of serum (blood) levels of DHT from peak. The usual starting dose is 1mg daily. Dutasteride (sold under the name **Avodart**) is an even more potent inhibitor (usual starting daily dose is 0.5mg), and can block up to 98% of conversion from T to DHT: it is a much more potent inhibitor of the enzyme that converts T to DHT. Dutasteride would be an option if you wanted a nuclear option to block almost all DHT. In fact, one of my favourite [studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15126539/) compared the difference between Finasteride vs. Dutasteride, and as you can see below, the suppression of DHT levels from Dutasteride was significantly more than Finasteride. Not only this, but the half life of Dutasteride is significantly longer than Finasteride (\\~8 hours vs. 5 weeks!), and you can see that in the Dutasteride group after stopping treatment (Follow-up Period), DHT levels remained suppressed for a much longer time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[DHT vs. Finasteride - what a study.](https://preview.redd.it/51ro95jxid6c1.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1d5c0bb87f58a95ce410a464e59b989bece00fd)\n\nSide effects from 5-alpha reductase inhibitors are rare, although we should speak about them. Online, through various forums, Reddit posts, YouTube videos and TikTok’s time and time again I see posts about nasty Finasteride side effects, post-Finasteride syndrome and how Rob can’t get his Johnson hard anymore because of Finasteride, so his girlfriend left him.\n\nNow, don’t get me wrong, side effects have been noted, although current research puts the risk of side effects at around [1-3% of people](https://www.drugwatch.com/propecia/side-effects/), so even though online there is a lot of noise about finasteride and its side effects, I personally don’t think the research supports this scaremongering. There is also going to be a natural selection bias with the stories online, because the guy for whom Finasteride is working well and who is not experiencing any side effects, he isn’t really going to post. Because why would he? He’s doing fine.\n\nHowever, I absolutely sympathise with the people who just cannot tolerate 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. Side effects can be very real, and this is why it is vitally important to always consult with a qualified doctor before deciding on any medication: I’m just presenting the science. Everyone reacts slightly differently, and these can be strong medications - so it's important to be well-informed and sensible with whatever path you and your medical practitioner decide to go down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Topical Minoxidil 5% (Rogaine):**\n\nMinoxidil is a compound that has been shown to increase the rate of DNA synthesis in anagen (growth phase) bulbs of hair follicles. Basically minoxidil stimulates hair cells to move from telogen (resting phase) to anagen (growing phase) - so instead of having hair follicles resting, it is telling the body to move them back into a growth phase by shortening the resting phase. The idea here is that you get more ‘regrowth’ of hair follicles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dy63jn3tjd6c1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8670dd032a79aadd7c39bd9df62a0cc89baa2202\n\nMinoxidil stimulates hair cells to shorten the resting (telogen) phase and go back into an anagen (growing phase). Often, progress pictures will show significant new regrowth or ‘baby’ hairs growing with minoxidil treatment.\n\nI apply *Rogaine*, a 5% strength Minoxidil foam twice daily in areas that I feel are receding. The nice thing about the foam is that it isn’t super sticky (unlike some people report with the gel), and it also acts as a nice way to hold my hair throughout the day, like hair product.\n\nAs you can see from the photo below, there is a vast difference between telogen (resting phase) and anagen (growing phase), and the idea is that the more hairs you can keep in anagen, the more healthy your hair will be, by limiting the amount of follicles that inevitably go through an anagen restart and die off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/da6m3qh4kd6c1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=a818ded76fe7f0da40b073a78427c5ebef169bcf\n\nThere is also the option of oral minoxidil, which anecdotally at least seems to be very powerful at regenerating ‘baby’ hairs (or, new regrowth). Again, oral minoxidil can have some pretty significant side effects and drug interactions with blood pressure medications, so speaking through with your doctor is key!\n\n**Ketoconazole Shampoo:**\n\nThis shampoo is primarily an anti-dandruff shampoo, but research has shown it may increase the proportion of hairs in anagen phase (growth phase) - resulting in reduced hair shedding. [This study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18498517/) showed that 1% ketoconazole shampoo increased hair diameter over baseline after 6 months of use and reduced shedding. Interestingly, participants’ hair diameter also increased over baseline, showing that it may play a role in creating thicker hair.\n\nNizoral is a common brand here in Australia of 2% strength ketoconazole shampoo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/22hcla2ckd6c1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=556a6c320e825bb32c4776c01ec9a9156fcab0b6\n\nWhat is good about ketoconazole, is that it’s also a weak androgen receptor antagonist. What does this mean? It means it competes with DHT and Testosterone for binding to the active binding domain on the human AR (androgen receptor). If a compound can bind to a receptor without influencing its usual effects, it is said to be an **antagonist**. Basically, if ketoconazole can get into an androgen receptor before Testosterone or DHT, it will occupy that site and block T/DHT from binding and starting their usual process of killing off hair follicles (follicular miniaturisation). \n\nGoodbye DHT, nobody wants you here.\n\n**Dermarolling**\n\nDerma-what?\n\nDermarolling is the process of creating micro punctures in the scalp skin to induce a wound healing response, with an array of tiny microneedles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6yjwpgfekd6c1.png?width=1082&format=png&auto=webp&s=39e971f4128c1463f139069e8cb1042ae2a82a8c\n\nIn this [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3746236/), the dermarolling + minoxidil treated group was statistically superior to the minoxidil only treated group in promoting hair growth in men with balding patterns, for all primary efficacy measures of hair growth. In fact, the microneedling group outperformed even the minoxidil group in terms of how much hair was regrown after 12 weeks:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pzoc53hgkd6c1.jpg?width=741&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0635770d6ffdbf90ead61f6404ed4405b635fd2\n\nThe mechanism seems to be that continued microtrauma to the scalp skin leads to a release of platelet derived growth factors and other growth factors that are sent to the area of scalp, to aid in the skin wound regeneration. The added benefit is that there seems to be some carry over effect to hair growth, as dermarolling seems to activate stem cells or ‘unspecialised’ cells that are yet to be differentiated, and differentiate them into hair follicle cells, meaning more hair growth. Basically, its a wound healing response that brings growth factors to the area of the scalp to increase hair growth.\n\nI have played around with a few different protocols, but I use a 1.5mm roller and roll horizontally, vertically and diagonally for about 30 seconds in areas where my hairline is thinning or receding. I do this every 10 days. You don’t want to press so hard that you draw blood, but it should also hurt slightly. I mean, putting hundreds of tiny spikes into your scalp isn’t really my idea of Sunday night fun. But hey, if it regrows some hair why not?\n\nThere are also derma-stamps and motorised tools, all of which assist with the end goal: creating a wound healing response to bring growth factors to the scalp, and potentially assist the penetration of Minoxidil deeper into the scalp skin tissue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Natural DHT blocking compounds:**\n\nNatural DHT blockers are also options, although obviously the results aren’t going to be nearly as strong as what is mentioned above.\n\nSome people have good results (anecdotally) with rosemary oil applied topically, green tea and saw palmetto are options here. However, the science is very hit and miss, and in any event, I can’t see natural compounds competing against the 'Big 4'.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**RU58841:**\n\nNow, that’s all good, but what if you need a nuclear chemical. Something that would attack the androgen receptor at a direct level in your scalp? Well, that compound is below. But a quick **warning**: I do not recommend this compound. A lot of people use it, but that doesn’t mean it’s safe. There is no (yes, zero) long-term safety data on the compound below, and whether you choose to take a completely untested chemical is up to you. But I don’t recommend it - have I said that enough?\n\nAlright so, apart from sounding like a bunch of random letters because your cat ran over your keyboard, RU58841 is a strong DHT blocker (it has been shown to inhibit around 70% of DHT binding to the androgen receptor), but not in the way that Finasteride or Dutasteride work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The chemical structure of RU58841.](https://preview.redd.it/stsr6jgmkd6c1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=afe9a816b81618f35f54a5dfeb846ef9385c4f17)\n\nInstead of finasteride and dutasteride which work on inhibiting the 5-alpha reductase enzyme, RU58841 works on the AR itself - occupying the active site, so that when DHT tries to get in and exert its hair destructive effects in the scalp, it can’t, it’s literally ***blocked*** from accessing the active site of the androgen receptor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[RU58841 operates like an androgen receptor antagonist \\(3rd receptor, on the right\\). It binds to the receptor and stops testosterone and DHT from binding, meaning that DHT cannot then exert its hair miniaturisation effects.](https://preview.redd.it/nw42b51xkd6c1.png?width=943&format=png&auto=webp&s=36e4592b66d0108e9a24189d3b8e76f6aa407a02)\n\nAnd in [this study](https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-e5b77395-5e0e-3da3-bef2-0eadea69c845), RU58841 was found to inhibit 70% of DHT binding. Combining something like finasteride or dutasteride which attacks 5-alpha reductase converting T to DHT with RU58841 which stops \\~70% of DHT binding to the androgen receptor, and you’d now be attacking hair loss from 2 *vectors*: **T to DHT conversion, as well as at a receptor level**. Now you can start to understand why this is a nuclear option for hair loss, and incredibly powerful.\n\nHowever, despite how good all of that sounds in practice, just remember, RU58841 is completely untested in regards to side effects. There is no long-term safety data on how it may or can impact human health, so what I’m saying (for legal reasons) is don’t use it. Get what I’m saying?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nAnd, there it is guys. Now, just a quick note, this isn’t a super comprehensive list of all supplements for a hair regrowth/hair protection protocol, but is a solid start.\n\nThere are certainly more ‘niche’ options, or compounds in development now that may be promising (or not, looking at you Phase 3 of Pyrilutamide trials), but this guide was just the bare basics for a beginner to wrap his head around (no pun intended) the science and how to start combatting AGA.\n\nIn particular, if you want to save your hair, it’s going to be the ‘**big 4**’: finasteride (or Dutasteride), Minoxidil, Ketoconazole shampoo and derma-rolling roughly once a week to every 2 weeks.\n\nThis would follow the best possible science that we have at the moment, in terms of targeting as many vectors as possible:\n\n1. T to DHT blockade (5-alpha reductase inhibitors, Fin/Dut)\n2. Anagen/telogen manipulation (Minoxidil)\n3. Localised scalp tissue androgen receptor antagonism (Keto, RU58841)\n4. Wound healing response cascade (physical microneedling/trauma)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope you enjoyed and got something out of this guide! My social links are on my profile if interested in more.",

It's what I've been looking for, and you did an excellent job making things easier to understand for beginners like me.\n\nI have a question, I've dealt with thinning hair and receeding hairline since I was 17, I'm 23 now, and from what I've identified -- with the help of my bald brother -- I now have a Norwood 1 - 1.5, not too much ig? I also don't know if the progress of my MPB is fast or slow, I don't have anything to compare to.\n\nAnyway, enough rambling, what I want to ask is, is Minoxidil plus derma rolling enough for me to further slow the baldness? Or even enough to almost completely stop it? I'm planning to start to combat my mpb, and I don't know if it's okay for me to just do Minox only even for the first few years.\n\nI'm also considering using fin, but I'm scared of the side effects because I've already experienced sexual problems due to SSRIs, I've stopped using them for this reason so I'm scared if it's going to happen again.\n\nAdditionally, I'm a combat sports athlete who takes his strength training seriously. Does finasteride directly affect my testosterone levels? My muscle growth? My athleticism? Will it result on me being feminized? \n\nThank you for your time reading this.",

Hopefully this story fits your criteria!\n—\n\nI do not work for a human pharmacy, but work in a veterinary hospital where we dispense our own medications and also, as needed, call in prescription authorizations to various human pharmacies when a patient would (legally) benefit from a human med that we don’t carry. In this particular instance, we called in Ketoconazole to a local compounding pharmacy for one of our canine patients since our hospital cannot compound drugs in-house. That should of been the end of things...however:\n\n\n*phone rings*\nMe: Thank you for calling [Generic Veterinary Hospital Name], this is Luthury, how may I help you today?\n\nUpset Customer, crying over the phone: Hello? I just wanted to call to lodge a complaint?\n\nMe, taken aback: Oh I’m so sorry. Can I get your name and your pet’s name?\n*pulling up the proper record*\n\nMe: What seems to be the issue?\n\nUpset Customer, still distraught: Yeah, earlier today you guys called in Fluffy’s Ketoconazole to [Local Compounding Pharmacy]. But when I went there to pick it up, it wasn’t ready.\n\nMe: Okay, well, it seems that we did call that medication in at ~11am today. (it was roughly noon at this point) Did [Local Compounding Pharmacy] call you to tell you the drug was ready for pickup?\n\nUpset Customer, increasingly distraught: No, no one called me. And when I arrived, the medication wasn’t ready!\n\nMe: M’am, I’m sorry if no one informed you of this, but after we call in a prescription, [Local Compounding Pharmacy] will call you when the prescription is ready for pickup.\n\nUpset Customer, switching from sad to angry: Yes, I KNOW THAT. But they DIDN’T call me, and when I drove all the way over there, the medication WASN’T READY.\n\nMe: ...\n\nUpset Customer: I DROVE 30 MINUTES TO GET THERE\n\nMe: M’am, I’m terribly sorry. But unfortunately it does take time to compound medications. I’m confident they will have that med ready for you as soon as they are able. In the meantime, is there anything *I* can help you with today?\n\nUpset Customer: No. I just wanted to call and let you know how upset I am with their horrible service. I’m not mad at [Veterinary Hospital], but I just wanted to share my experience with you in case this changes your mind on which pharmacies you choose to partner with in the future.\n\nMe: ....thanks have a wonderful rest of your day\n\n\n\nLike, geez. Sorry m’am that you can’t follow instructions. No, we will NOT be discontinuing our partnership with the compounding pharmacy anytime soon- they are wonderful people with great product. To all you pharmacists and techs out there, hang in there. You’re doing great.",

Corporate picks those and we use whatever gets sent to us. And they like to change manufacturers fairly often. \n\nSo, anyway, this girl came in one evening to pick up her rizatriptan for her migraines. I checked her out with no problems and she left. A few minutes later she comes rushing back in, waving me down. I asked her if there was a problem and she said yes, this isn’t the right medication. I have a mini heart attack and look through everything. Turns out, we gave her beige tabs that are in a clear blister pack. She’s previously gotten white tabs in an opaque blister pack. I tell her it’s the same meds but a different manufacturer. She left but seemed hesitant about it, like she didn’t believe me or something. \n\nGuess who called me later that evening? Same girl and she starts going on about how this manufacturer isn’t working for her and she needs the one she’s previously used. She’s telling me the opaque blisters aren’t exposed to sunlight therefore they’re more potent (nevermind the clear blisters are stored in a box) and we should be more concerned about this problem because she doesn’t want this to happen to other people, blah blah blah. I just told her again, sorry, we don’t have the old ones you were getting, but it’s the same drug. That didn’t appease her, but whatever. \n\nFast forward to a month-ish later and I get a phone call. Patient asks me what is the color of our rizatriptan and what kind of blister packs do they come in. I immediately remembered who it is but humored her anyway. Went and checked the shelf and of course it’s not the kind she wants. So I tell her the same thing I’ve already told her. And she goes on the same spiel, telling us we really shouldn’t carry that manufacturer and can’t believe we’re not more concerned about this. \n\nA bit later that day, another pharmacy called and transferred her out.

(Everyday sometimes 2x)\nDermarolling 1mm (3x/wk first 3 months) now .5MM(everyday or other day)\nAlso using a 17 mineral hair serum \nFor washing I use a mix of Ketoconazole shampoo and folligain shampo \n\nI was convinced I was going to lose it and there was nothing I can do, so I decided to throw the kitchen sink at it, and it worked lol. \n\nI’m trying to get it to be where I’ll be happy with the fullness and volume, then I’ll dial back on some of the things I’m doing. But the Dutasteride and minoxidil is now a lifetime commitment for sure, and that’s ok with me…",

    "body": "*AGA = Androgenetic Alopecia (male or female pattern baldness caused by a genetic sensitivity to DHT in the scalp hair follciles that ultimately cause hair thinning and hair loss)*\n\n\nScalp Microbiome and Sebum Composition in AGA\n\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/9/10/2132\n\nIn \"Scalp Microbiome and Sebum Composition in Japanese Male Individuals with and without Androgenetic Alopecia\" (Suzuki et al., Microorganisms, 2021), researchers compared the scalp microbiome and sebum composition in Japanese men with and without AGA. \n\nThey found that AGA patients had elevated levels of triglycerides and palmitic acid in their sebum. Notably, Malassezia restricta: a lipophilic fungus that consumes palmitic acid and it was more abundant in AGA scalps. \n\nBacterial changes were also observed: AGA scalps had more Cutibacterium and less Corynebacterium.\n\nhttps://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/fulltext/S1931-3128(20)30358-9\n\nCorynebacterium plays a protective role in skin health. According to Bomar et al. (Cell Host & Microbe, 2020), C. pseudodiphtheriticum interferes with S. aureus virulence, and C. accolens inhibits S. pneumoniae via free fatty acid production. \n\nThis shift in bacterial populations, referred to as scalp dysbiosis, might interact with changes in sebum composition to influence the progression of AGA. The study hypothesizes that alterations in the scalp's microbiome and sebum could contribute to inflammatory processes that are already implicated in AGA.\n\nThis is pretty important as it suggests that both microbial and biochemical changes on the scalp, such as variations in sebum fatty acids like palmitic acid and microbial shifts, play roles in the pathogenesis of AGA. \n\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21165-staph-infection-staphylococcus-infection \n\n\nA shift away from Corynebacterium may weaken scalp defenses, contributing to AGA-related inflammation conditions especially those that we refer to as the \"DHT Itch\". \n\n*So, keeping this microbiome in mind, AGA scalps are more likely to have microbial life that cause inflammatory issues due to poor sebum quality that feeds the more harmful microbes: DHT tips the balance in favor of specific microbes and lipids that when in abundance causes problems*\n\n\nSebaceous Gland Changes in AGA\n\nhttps://www.tesble.com/10.1111/jocd.12153 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26147300/)\n\n\nIn \"Changes in the sebaceous gland in patients with male pattern hair loss (androgenic alopecia)\" (Kure, Isago, Hirayama; Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology), 23 longitudinal scalp sections from 250 patients revealed that AGA patients had more sebaceous gland lobules, although individual gland size remained unchanged. This suggests amplified sebum production in AGA without gland hypertrophy.\n\nImmunohistochemical analysis showed preservation of bulge-region stem cells, indicating that despite increased sebum and sebaceous gland enlargement, critical hair follicle stem cell populations remain intact—offering potential for regenerative therapies.\n\n\nSebum Level and AGA Severity Correlation\n\nhttps://www.courage-khazaka.com/en/scientific-products/occupational-health/occupational-health/151-sebumeter-e \n\n\nTambunan et al. (Bali Medical Journal, 2023) investigated sebum output in 50 men with AGA using the Sebumeter® SM 815. Their results showed a strong positive correlation (r=0.94) between sebum level and AGA severity. DHT likely drives this sebum overproduction in predisposed individuals. These findings suggest that oily scalps may worsen AGA or invite overlapping inflammatory conditions like seborrheic dermatitis (sebderm).\n\nThis raises questions about placebo effects in topical AGA trials—could the antiseptic action of alcohol-based vehicles temporarily reduce yeast overgrowth, boosting hair counts in control groups?\n\n\nLipotoxicity, Yeast, and Sebaceous Gland Destruction in LPP\n\nhttps://balimedicaljournal.ejournals.ca/index.php/bmj/article/download/4084/2775/20085 \n\nhttps://sci-hub.arizonastockbroker.com/10.1016/j.jaad.2010.09.774  (https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S019096221002027X) \n\n\nLichen planopilaris (LPP) and similar scarring alopecias often begin with sebaceous gland destruction. \n\nIn \"Histologic absence of yeast as a clue for classic lichen planopilaris...\" (Williams et al., JAAD International), loss of Malassezia species was linked with gland loss. \n\nThese findings suggest that lipid-rich sebum normally supports yeast populations—and their absence may signal gland destruction.\n\nPPAR-gamma dysfunction has been implicated in this process, leading to lipotoxicity, immune response, and follicle damage. In \"Lichen Planopilaris in the Androgenetic Alopecia Area: A Pitfall for Hair Transplantation\", histology shows lymphocytic infiltrates attacking follicular structures, especially sebaceous glands.\n\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4857822/\n\nEnlarged sebaceous glands and lipid shifts may promote inflammation and follicle miniaturization in AGA. \n\nHowever, preserved stem cells suggest regenerative therapies remain viable. Excessive sebum can worsen inflammatory scalp conditions, highlighting the need for routine microbial management—especially in overlapping cases of AGA and sebderm.\n\n\nhttps://sci-hub.arizonastockbroker.com/10.1080/16537150601092944\n\nFor scalp seborrheic dermatitis, I’ve replaced ketoconazole 2% shampoos—too drying for me—with 1% Ciclopirox, which is gentler and requires less frequent use. In \"Clinical efficacies of shampoos containing ciclopirox olamine (1.5%) and ketoconazole (2.0%)...\" (Ratnavel et al.), a randomized study of 350 patients showed Ciclopirox to be at least as effective, if not better, than ketoconazole in reducing sebderm symptoms, with higher patient satisfaction.\n\n\n\n\nMy Full Regimen for Sebderm and Folliculitis\n\nShampoos: Ciclopirox 1% (2x/week) for sebderm, Benzoyl Peroxide 10% for folliculitis (caution: bleaches fabrics), and Nizoral’s Psoriasis Shampoo & Conditioner as an auxiliary.\n\nTopicals: Clobetasol Propionate 0.05% for inflammation, Calcipotriol 0.005% to maintain sebaceous gland function and prevent steroid-induced thinning. Supported by Norsgaard et al. (Dermatology, 2014) and Ramsay et al. (British Journal of Dermatology, 1994).\n\nAntibiotics: 1% Clindamycin gel applied 1–2x/week based on MERCK Manual and the study by Armillei et al. (Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology, 2024).\n\n\nMy notes: \n\nFor managing seborrheic dermatitis, I've switched from using ketoconazole 2% shampoos, which I found too drying, to Ciclopirox 1% shampoo. \nMy decision was influenced by studies like the one led by Ravi C. Ratnavel, which demonstrated that ciclopirox olamine shampoo is as effective, if not more, than ketoconazole in treating scalp conditions, and importantly, it's less drying. This change has significantly improved my scalp's condition without the associated dryness that I experienced with ketoconazole.\n\nAdditionally, I use a regimen that includes Clobetasol Propionate 0.05% solution for severe inflammation and Calcipotriol 0.005%, a topical vitamin D analogue, to help maintain healthy sebaceous gland activity and prevent the excessive dryness and thinning of the skin that can occur with long-term topical steroid use.Calcipotriol has proven to be an excellent anti-inflammatory and is safe for long-term use, which is supported by various studies cited in dermatological literature mostly relevant to psoriasis and eczema.  \n\nThis understanding is supported by the study titled, “Calcipotriol counteracts betamethasone-induced decrease in extracellular matrix components related to skin atrophy” by Hanne Norsgaard et al, “Long-term use of topical calcipotriol in chronic plaque psoriasis”, by C A Ramsay et al, \n\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4168021/ \nhttps://sci-hub.arizonastockbroker.com/10.1159/000246851 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7949479/)\n\nFor treatment and maintenance of scalp pimples and folliculitis, I incorporate a shampoo routine that includes a 10% Benzoyl Peroxide shampoo and 1% Ciclopirox shampoo. Benzoyl Peroxide is effective but can bleach clothing, so careful rinsing is necessary. I also use 1% Topical Clindamycin gel on a dry scalp once or twice a week. \n\nI inform myself using the MERCK treatment manual of folliculitis as well as the paper titled, “Scientific Rationale and Clinical Basis for Clindamycin Use in the Treatment of Dermatologic Disease” by Maria K Armillei et al. \n\nhttps://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/dermatologic-disorders/bacterial-skin-infections/folliculitis. \nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10967556/ \n\n\nCiclopirox, again, proves useful not just for its antifungal properties but also because it is gentler compared to other options like Ketconzole either from the official over the counter Nizoral brand at 1% or the 2% medicated shampoo. \n\nBut, I actually make use of Nizoral’s Psoriasis Shampoo & Conditioner from their line, to ensure comprehensive care.\n\nI apply these shampoos at the same time twice a week mostly to wet scalp/hair and lather it in for 5 minutes and then wash my scalp and hair out and follow with a conditioner of my choice. \n\n\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590097824000090#fig2 \n\nThis should help with recurrent folliculitis along with some lifestyle changes. Some people could benefit from a course of doxycycline 200 mg once or twice a day for 1 month to 3 months if it is severe all while using the shampoos. And the shampoos may be done for maintenance for life. Yes. Because you probably have these conditions for life or a life long propensity. \n\n\nApremilast has also been noted to help people recover their hair and scalp from folliculitis and folliculitis decalvans We can see this in the case report titled, “Successful treatment of refractory folliculitis decalvans with apremilast” by Mirjam Fässler et al. The treatment used was oral apremilast, not topical. \n\n\nThe patient took oral apremilast (PDE4 inhibitor) as a monotherapy, without any additional systemic or topical medications other than 2% chlorhexidine shampoo, which was used at the patient's discretion. The marker that helped the patient  in the study was the rapid suppression of neutrophilic inflammation, as evidenced by the resolution of erythema, follicular pustules, crusting, and hair tufting on the scalp. The treatment led to a nearly complete remission of folliculitis decalvans within three weeks, which was confirmed by trichoscopy findings showing the abolition of follicular hyperkeratosis and perifollicular erythema.\n\n\nI did an interview with someone who actually recovered from folliculitis decalvans, so you guys should check it out! \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSiP6f4evfA&list=PLU1CrF6x3RzugS0GqL4j7DqmOi3G40H-F&index=12&t=3060s \n\n\n\n\nSTOP MICRONEEDLING NOW!!!!!\n\nIt is only making these issues worse and it isn’t needed. No evidence proves it works on its own and all it does is increase topical products’ absorption which isn’t always a good thing. So stop. At least that’s my view, talk to a doctor of course as I am not one. \n\n",

    "body": "I’ve struggled with dandruff for more than a decade and it’s been an intense source of insecurity. Not to be gross, but I could shake out my hair and my arms would get tired long before the flaking stopped. Recently it seemed to take a turn for the worse and I vaguely assumed that my issue was a dehydrated scalp because it felt itchy and irritated. \n\n\nIn addition to just using head and shoulders I’ve tried using stronger versions of these shampoos, shampooing more often, less often, washing my hair every day, less than every day, just using conditioner, silicon scrubs to help work in shampoo, cleaning my pillow case more often, and even a scalp pick to try and get rid of the build-up manually. All of these methods yielded little to no result, and I eventually had to try to stop thinking about it because I’d get so frustrated it would derail my day. I generally try to be a very hygienic person, and this felt like I was somehow doing something wrong but I couldn’t figure out what it was and it was driving me mad. \n\n(TW: slight grossness) \n\nI then stumbled on a r/YSK post that talked about how dandruff, in some cases, isn’t caused by dehydration, but by a kind of fungus that lives on the scalp. It isn’t obviously visible, so I hadn’t had reason to suspect something like that. \n\nNot only does the fungus like water, dehydrating your scalp indirectly, but in response the rate at which your scalp sheds its skin goes into overdrive to try and get rid of it. There’s a specific kind of medicated shampoo with an ingredient that directly addresses this issue. (~~This isn’t an ad or something so I won’t mention it here, but if you have the same problem and suspect it might be same issue you can DM me if you’d like~~). \n\nI started feeling hopeful because this was a possible cause of the issue I hadn’t been aware of before and that I could try to address. I ordered the shampoo, used it for the first time yesterday, left in the lather for several minutes, washed, and repeated, and I could almost cry. \n\nI’m almost certain that this fungal thing was the issue because this shampoo basically nuked my dandruff, almost over night. I know it’s a little early to be celebrating as if the problem is over, but this is far and away the most dramatic effect of any of my attempts, and I’m optimistic that I’ve finally identified the issue and have an accessible solution.\n\nEDIT: \n\nThere was WAY more interest in the shampoo brand than I initially anticipated, I’ve gotten two dozen DMs or so over the last hour alone, glad to know I’m not the only one with this problem \n\nThe shampoo brand was nizoral and the active ingredient is Ketoconazole. The shampoo was a bit expensive for what turned out to be a much smaller bottle than I was expecting, but I think it’s fair given that this it actually did something for my problem when literally everything else I tried failed \n\nI promise I’m not a guerilla marketer or a psy-op or whatever though lol you might be able to find a cheaper alternative with the same active ingredient that has the same effect \n\nFor others with this issue, hopefully you haven’t tried it already and this could be your  solution-at-long-last like it was for me! \n\nCheers\n\nSECOND EDIT:\n\nLinking nizoral’s website turned my post’s top banner into a preview for the site, basically a billboard for that company lol didn’t know it did that. Removed the link, not trying to advertise a specific brand, use anything that works",

I was remarking about being jealous of her hair once and she was like 'your hair is great, thick, but ya...a little dry. What is your routine?'\n\n'uhhh...routine?'\n\nI was totally one of those guy memes that used something labeled 'soap' and something labeled 'shampoo' whatever was cheapest and had the least words on it.\n\nSo I told her I washed it every day basically, like my parents always taught me growing up.\n\nBut my hair is very different from the rest of my family's. Rather obvious just looking at us. My sisters' hair basically takes after our norse side and I seem to take after the Eastern European side...much darker, thicker.\n\nTurns out, I only need to wash my hair once a week-ish.

    "body": "**If you don't want to read this story, there's a TL;DR at the end**\n\nSo I've been battling with seborrheic dermatitis since I was a little girl. Long story short, my younger brother threw some of our mother's fragrances and essential oils into my scalp (and his own). This was when I was around 8 or 9. I'm 21 now.\n\nMy mother always combated it my mixing some Nizoral (ketoconazole 1% OTC shampoo) with regular kids shampoo. If it was really bad, she'd use the Nizoral whole. She'd use regular products to style my hair (edge control, Luster's Pink Olive Oil, etc) and I'd be good to go. I could use anything on my scalp without issue. As I got older, I used the Nizoral less and less because my scalp was nice and healthy.\n\nThen by the time I hit 16/17, my seborrheic dermatitis started flaring up like hell. I'd wash it like usual and it'll flake up within two or three day of washing. At the worst points, it'll start flaking as soon as my scalp dried.\n\nI tried all the common dandruff shampoos on the market. Head and Shoulders (zinc pyrithione), T Gel (coal tar), T Sal (salicylic acid), and Nizoral. I used each one alone for several months, then tried to alternate between them. I left them on from 5-10 minutes before rinsing. I'd double wash.\n\nI switched to a SLS free shampoo (Cantu Sulfate-Free Cleansing Cream Shampoo). I used a clarifying shampoo (Suave Daily Clarifying). I used all of these shampoos in various combinations.\n\nI went no shampoo; I'd only \"wash\" with water. I tried different water temperatures. I tried filtered, distilled, spring water. Then, I went to using ACV (apple cider vinegar) as shampoo. I tried ACV and baking soda. During senior year of high school, I went to my graduation rehearsal smelling like ketchup because I'd washed my hair with ACV that morning. \n\nI tried washing my hair every day. It would keep the flakes at bay, but it was a tedious process to wash my hair every day and wait for it to dry. It also stripped the hell outta my hair. It wasn't practical. Sometimes I'd have to go to sleep with wet hair. Then, I switched to only washing in the morning.\n\nI tried hot oil treatments: olive oil, coconut oil, mineral oil,  and castor oil either by themselves or in various mixes. I tried to leave in the hot oil treatments, I tried them before washing, I tried them after washing.\n\nI scrubbed my scalp with tea tree oil. I tried various \"dandruff\" shampoos and conditioners. \n\nThen, I finally went to to the dermatologist this year. I was prescribed 2% Ketoconazole shampoo and 0.01% fluocinolone acetonide oil. I used them as prescribed (leave the shampoo on for 5 minutes, wash every 3 days, use the oil after washing). My dandruff got better. I thought it was fixed after I finished the bottle. I switched back to the otc ketoconazole shampoo, and the dandruff returned. I was damned. \n\n*Cue MCT oil*\n\nMCT oil (Medium-chain triglyceride) is derived from coconut oil. *Wait a minute*, you're probably thinking. *Isn't coconut oil bad for dandruff? Won't it only feed the yeast?* Not MCT oil! Sciency science has shown that malassezia  yeast (what causes seborrheic dermatitis) can't metabolize the fatty acids in medium-chain triglycerides. [Basically, we're in the clear to use MCT oil](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10507598)\n\nSo, after washing my hair with the Nizoral, I apply MCT oil to my entire scalp. I hadn't washed my hair in about two weeks, and I noticed only minimal flaking. As in, I only noticed one flake large enough to pick off, and then a few sparse flakes if I scratched hard enough.\n\n**td;lr**\n\n**MCT oil has fixed my dandruff.**\n\n**I tried a lot of methods to fix this issue. Now, I just wash my hair with Nizoral and oil my scalp with MCT oil afterwards. I'm good to go.**",

        "body": "THANK YOU FOR THIS! I've been suffering from SD for the past 4-5 years, went for a Brazilian keratin treatment and the hairdresser applied it onto my scalp :-|\nIt tingled, but I have high pain tolerance, so I wasn't too bothered.\nThat was until I started becoming allergic to shampoo, and my scalp had acne on it, small to medium sized burning bumps.\n\nLike you, I've also tried 'organic all-natural' shampoos (Moroccan Method, Himalaya, Dermaveen, Dr.Bronner's baby, Burt's bees baby shampoo, Aubrey Organics, god knows what else. FYI I was aware that I'm allergic to fragrance, so most of the stuff I tried were fragrance free and I also tried to avoid essential oils), ACV rinse, JUST WATER, Free & Clear shampoo, coconut oil scalp masks, black soap, and when one day my scalp was actually warm to the touch and burning on the inside, I finally went to the dermatologist. She prescribed me Polytar, which didn't really work for the dandruff, but it calmed my scalp. Did a patch test which shows that I'm allergic to formaldehyde!!! I did read that the Brazilian keratin treatment had formaldehyde in it. (I was also prescribed a scalp lotion called Elosone, which was nice but too lazy to put it on, and a shitload of strong antihistamines which made me very very depressed, so I stopped taking it)\n\nPolytar stopped production about a year I was into it, and I've tried pine tar and other types of coal tar shampoos since. I've been on the routine of alternating between [DHS zinc shampoo](https://www.amazon.com/DHS-300960729165-Zinc-Shampoo-16oz/dp/B0046JOT4O?th=1) and [MG 217 shampoo](https://www.amazon.com/MG217-Psoriasis-Medicated-Conditioning-Formula/dp/B009ZBMVHU) a couple of years ago, this reduced my dandruff about 70%. I only feel the bumps 10% of the time now and it's *nowhere* near as painful as it was. \n\nThat said, I've also been taking [turmeric pills](http://www.vitahealth.com.my/product/proddetail.aspx?act=PI&PID=86) which helps A LOT. I'm usually very sceptical, but my doctor-surgeon parents prescribed it to my sister who has RA, and tried to cook more turmeric-based meals due to the anti-inflammatory property, so I thought I had nothing to lose anyway. WHOO HEY side effects: skin cleared up, no more scalp burning and acne, and 95% dandruff gone (the dandruff is back because I switched to a lower dosage turmeric pill -____-)\n\nCan't wait to get my hands on MCT oil! Coconut oil doesn't even penetrate into my hair and skin so I had a bad impression on it. *continues thanking profusely*\n\nEdit: Fixed abbreviation",

ACV soaks before medicated shampoos can greatly improve their effectiveness. UVB exposure is really effective and probably the most effective IMO. Supplementation with Vitamin D is vital. Dosage is 1,000 IU's per 25lbs of bodyweight. Vitamin D can reduce the over proliferation and turnover of skin cells. Sulfur and selenium are very effective topically as well as internally. Thyroid glandular supplementation or T3 if TSH is over 3. So many things can be done to win the battle of Seb derm. and psoriasis. Having adequate water and lower inflammatory foods is always the best prevention, of course. The nuke that I've found is topical DMSO(50-90%) if it's malassezia overgrowth.

I started getting fades at the barber and the sides of my head cleared up. When stay at home orders went into effect I decided to shave all of my hair off. \n\n\nBeing bald was amazing, no itch, no flakes, nothing to pick at. I've since let my hair grow and it feels worse than ever! Went to the doctor three separate times, first I was prescribed a sulphur scented creamy orange like shampoo. It dries my hair out and didn't help the issue. Went back again and was prescribed a different shampoo, ketoconazole, still nothing. The third time was a new doctor and she brushed me off saying that it can be cured in men but not women. Women with long hair cannot cure this unless they shave their head. \n\n\nI am completely willing to shave my head if it means I have a shot at curing this. She shook her head no, asked me why I would shave my head, then told me I'm still young and don't realize it won't grow back the same way. \n\n\nSo I'm shaving my head and want to know the best course of action. The ONLY time my scalp feels healthy is when Im bald. It only acts up as soon as my hair gets or 1-2 cm long. Is it possible to completely rid myself of this infection? I have defaulted to using shampoo again and I'm so upset that my curls have completely gone flat. My usual routine is curly girl friendly with ACV rinses every month or so. I avoid using products outside of ECO gel. \n\nI'm very anxious because I know I have terrible scabs and flaky patches all over my head. I'm off for the next few days then plan on getting a hat or something for work until the patches disappear.\n\n\n**EDIT**\n\nI have seen confusion on this but the doctors were all my Primary Care Providers. I have NOT seen a Dermatologist.\n\nI live in the United States, switching doctors isn't easy. I go to a community clinic and don't have much of a choice on who I get to see. Getting a general appointment in the first place takes WEEKS. Every specialist or appointment outside of that clinic must be APPROVED by my insurance which my Doctor would have to negotiate for.\n\nI already use Apple Cider Vinegar and silicone scalp scrubbers.\n\nI don't believe my doctor about hair growing back differently. I have not shaved my head yet but I wouldn't mind doing that in the first place. I've kept my hair short for years. It just sucks losing my curls and I feel embarrassed.\n\nThank you for all of the wonderful advice! I understand that this could be a number of problems. At my next follow up appointment I will push my doctor to properly examine my scalp and do whatever tests are in her power to do. Then I will push for a dermatologist ASAP",

I use any shampoo for the first wash to get the base of oils and gunk off (probably not as necessary for you with little to no hair) and then do the second wash with head and shoulders. The key for me is letting the head and shoulders sit on my scalp for at least 5 minutes. I think the zinc helps destroy the fungus or something. This method has kept me flake free for years. I also think blow drying my hair/scalp helps a lot too.  \n\nGood luck!!",

I say that all the time with most diseases. Most doctors suck and don't do any effort because they aren't allowed to by insurance. So... Here is the thing. Vitamin B deficiency causes dermatitis. A yeast overgrowtg causes fungal infections. A bad immune system too. Look into all these things and make a list of all your other symptoms because you might be in need of an antifungal medicine or more nutrients that ward off fungi.",

Having it shaved did help but he likes to grow his hair out longer too so I took it as a personal challenge to find products to help him. He has curly hair from being Hispanic so I wanted to find products that keep hair hair great too. \n\nI found these products between Sally's, Target, and Walmart. They're also affordable because I don't have budget or even desire to buy expensive hair care, especially for him since he's ambivalent about keeping his curls popping even though they're gorgeous.\n\nThe As I Am Dry & Itchy line has been magic. The shampoo has 1% zinc pyrithione and is labeled as good for dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. He uses their scalp oil whenever his scalp is being feisty and it makes a huge difference. I got him the matching conditioner which also has zinc pyrithione in it. It does a decent job of keeping his hair moisturized and soft. The oil has 1.8% salicylic acid. I've tried to get him to use it as a pre-wash oil (like put it in for at least a couple hours before) but he's not that motivated with his hair lol. \n\nThere's also a leave-in conditioner as well as cowash in the line. He hasn't tried those so I can't speak to them. Other products he has tried and we both liked:\n- Aunt Jackie's Aloe & Mint Hydrate Me! Conditioning Crème Leave In. He still uses this. It smells minty and fresh and makes his hair super soft.\n- Aunt Jackie's Aloe & Mint Flawless Pattern Perfecting Pudding. Same smell as the leave in. Makes his curls pop while still being soft whenever I can persuade him to use it.\n- Aunt Jackie's Aloe & Mint Cool It Stimulating Moisturizing Conditioner. This is the first conditioner I got him to use with the shampoo and I think it like it slightly better for how it made his hair feel so I'll probably be switching him back to it.",

I understand that doing a wash n go everyday might be annoying, but at the very core of seb derm/reoccurring dandruff is a genetic predisposition that we have to this issue. Essentially, you might be able to clear it temporarily, but for most it will come back again and again so we have to learn the best routines to keep it under control.

Somehow my hair ends up softer too.\nPlease be careful when you're trying such things out and always do a spot test on the inside of your arm to see if you react badly to the antiseptic.

    "body": "I am a dermatology resident so I could speak to things like 1) core components of an inpatient dermatologic consult, 2) approach to fever and rash 3) what constitutes a dermatologic emergency, 4) our approach to things like hair loss, acne, eczema. Whatever people are interested. I imagine other specialties could offer similar guidance.\n\n**Edit 1**. Appears there is sufficient interest. Will update post to include more content when I get off work. \n\nCalling a dermatology consult (or how to make the cute derm resident fall in love with you because you make her job so much easier)\n\n1. identifying information: name, MRN, location. We usually don’t know the hospital well because we spend 90% of our time in clinic. \n\n2. Reason for consult AKA what is your clinical question. Their past medical history of CHF, gout, depression, usually doesn’t concern us and just detracts from the bottom line: why are you calling us? Examples include: 75 yo recently started allopurinol concern for Steven Johnson or 44 yo M with lymphoma with diffuse blisters please r/o paraneoplastic pemphigus. Past dermatologic history like psoriasis and eczema and immunosuppression risk factors helps us a lot. \n\n3. Acuity. We are specifically concerned about mucous membrane involvement (oral lesions/pain, pain when urinating, vision changes), blisters, and skin sloughing/desquamation. Febrile neutropenia with a new rash or lesion is always worthy of a derm consult. We also tend to prioritize pregnant woman, neonates, and children so even banal stuff is worth running by us.\n\n4. How long has the complaint been present for and is it keeping the patient in the hospital. Most things that predate the hospitalization and are not serious can been seen as an outpatient. \n\n5. if concerned about a drug reaction, please tell us any new drugs in the last 2-3 months. It’s extremely rare for chronic medications to cause the things we’re worried about. \n\n6. please do your best to describe the lesions. It doesn’t have to be perfect but it really helps. Photos are always highly appreciated. \n\n7. Most derm residents are pretty nerdy and love to teach. We’d love to walk you through our thought process, you can come down with us to the lab to look at path specimens, etc. However, nothing is more annoying then getting a “ID wants you to get a biopsy” call. Give us the respect of actively involving us in your patients medical care if you consult us. \n\nThat’s it! If you include the above you will be better than 90% of the consults I’ve got this month. :)\n\n**Edit 2**. Appropriate dermatologic consults (or how to avoid a lot of unnecessary sass and pushback).\n\nSome of this stuff was covered above but in general high quality consults come in a few flavors: 1) new, serious dermatologic findings (mucous membrane involvement, skin sloughing, blisters, erythroderma) 2) serious acute or chronic skin problem preventing discharge (exacerbation of psoriasis for example) 3) new dermatologic finding in a patient with serious systemic illness (immunosuppressed state, fever of unknown origin, unexplained eosinophilia etc). Regarding this point, we love to play detective and we can contribute a lot because while you are writing discharge summaries we are reading for hours about the skin manifestations of Stills disease or lupus, and 4) institution specific bullshit (inpatient full body skin exam in a patient awaiting transplant for example). The vast majority of other things can be curb sided with outpatient follow up. We understand if your attending insists on it to cover their ass but an inappropriate consult is still very annoying.\n\n**Edit 3**. Approach to hair loss (or the Dermatologist’s fibromyalgia)\n\nHair is like money, you can never have enough. It is normal to lose up to 100 hairs a day. We all get hair thinning as we get older. Some degree of androgenic alopecia affects pretty much everyone. That being said there are some pearls I’ve picked up:\n\n1) divide hair loss into scarring and non scarring. We can intervene (read regrow hair) in non scaring alopecia (androgenetic, alopecia areata) but can do nothing other than prevent progression in scarring alopecia (discoid lupus, lichen planopilaris). If the scalp is focally white, shiny, and thick that hair is gone. Refer to derm for work up and systemic immunomodulators. \n\n2) the vast majority of hair loss in an otherwise well patient without other skin or nail findings is androgenetic alopecia or telogen effluvium. In African American woman I would add traction alopecia and centripetal cicatrical alopecia. For children and psych patients add  trichotillomania. They will tell you a million stories about how theirs is unique but take it from a person who’s seen dozens and dozens of scalp biopsies. \n\n3) telogen effluvium almost always has a positive pull test (you can pull out a bunch of hairs easily). The hair will almost always grow back but sometimes thinner than before. Androgenetic alopecia responds moderately well to finasteride + midoxinil extra strength. You can use the 5% formulation of midoxinil in both men and women and it works better. Augmentation with ketoconazole shampoo has anecdotal benefit (it also inhibits DHT). If your patient stops using midoxinil the hair immediately falls out. Both are better for preventing hair loss than regrowing hair.\n\n4) the basic laboratory work up for female hair loss is: free testosterone, DHEAS, TSH, CBC, ferritin, TIBC.\n\n5) platelet rich plasma is not total pseudoscience and there are randomized control trials supporting its use in a wide range of hair loss conditions. Same for low intensity laser therapy. \n\n**Edit 4**. Acne pearls. So many pearls you could make a necklace. \n\n1) acne should be divided into comedonal and non-comedonal (inflammatory). Most of our therapies work equally well for both but some do not. I also grade it mild, moderate, and severe (which includes face, back, and chest) based on my gestalt, which guides therapy. \n\n2) If there is any amount of scarring involved, I treat it as severe acne. Scarring is permanent and although as a dermatologist I will be benefit from acne scarring when they come in for the rest of their lives for laser treatments and peels, neither work that well and it pains me that all this could have been prevented. I suffer from some acne scarring from pussy-footing dermatologists in my youth so I'm passionate about this issue. \n\n3) Skin of color patients care more about the dark spots (post inflammatory pigmentation) than the red bumps and comedones. They are afraid its permanent and its what keeps them up at night. \n\n3) Mild acne can be treated with benzoyl peroxide +/- clindamycin soln in the morning and tretinoin at night. Almost every non-pregnant patient should get a retinoid. They are incredibly effective for inflammatory papules and comedones, dark spots, and help improve the appearance of pre-existing scars. They also prevent fine lines and wrinkles in RCTs\n\n4) use tretinoin. it works better than adapalene (OTC) and is less aggressive than tazorac. start at 0.025 but get them up to 0.05 as quickly as possible. Pea sized amount to the whole face. Expect your skin to get worse for a week or two and then really start seeingthe effects 6-8 weeks later. It works by turning over the epidermis and normalizing differentiation. \n\n5) The above + doxycycline 100 mg BID or minocycline 75 mg BID for moderate acne. We prefer mino because it has anti-inflammatory effects in addition to antibiotic effects and is more fat soluble (gets into the sebaceous skin easier).\n\n6) If they fail 3 months of oral antibiotic + topicals, PLEASE SEND THEM TO DERM FOR ACCUTANE. Do not waste their time with more courses of antibiotics.\n\n7) There is a second peak of acne for women in their mid 20s. It is almost always hormonal, flares with menses, and responds extremely well to spironolactone and an estrogen containing birth control + topicals. \n\n8) Sulfacetamide wash works great for acne/rosacea overlap\n\n9) If the \"acne\" is mostly around the mouth or eyes, its not acne. Its perioral dermatitis and responds really well to metronidazole cream.\n\n**Edit 5** Cosmetics for the general practitioner \n\n1) A daily sunscreen with SPF 30 or greater used religiously is the best \"anti-aging\" cream that exists. We always tell patients the best sunscreen is the one you use; that being said physical blockers are better then chemical ones at the expense of being more messy. There are a lot of moisturizer/sunscreen combos available so they should find one that works for them and USE IT EVERY DAY NO MATTER WHAT. \n\n2) Tretinoin 0.05% cream nightly is proven in RCTs to improve the appearance of and prevent fine lines and wrinkles, dark spots, and textural abnormalities. It should be used nightly and takes 6 months to 1 year to see a real effect. \n\n3) A superficial or medium depth chemical peel is actually incredibly easy to do and there are multiple head to head studies showing that if done correctly they are as effective and SO MUCH CHEAPER than laser resurfacing for things like melasma, acne scarring, textural abnormalities, etc. I like 15-20% TCA for my superficial peel and 30% for medium depth. Always err on the side of caution for skin of color patients to prevent hyperpigmentation but 15-20% is almost always safe. You can do a superficial peel monthly and a medium depth peel every 3-6 months. It works better if the patient uses tretinoin every night because the stratum corneum is thinner and it penetrates deeper. You can watch some videos on YouTube or take a 1 day course and you can been peeling next week if you want to. Its crazy easy to do and the results look great.\n\n\n\nPlease suggest other topics you may be interested in!",

    "body": "Now before I began if your notice anything wrong with your hair whether it seems like it is thinning, receding, very itchy, brittle, or whatever it is always a good idea to go see a doctor (preferably a dermatologist) and make sure you're adequately treated for your issue\\*\\*. It is best not to self-diagnose yourself based on what some random guy says on Reddit. Please consult with a medically trained professional before you do anything in this guide.\\*\\* Hair issues are not always the result of male pattern baldness(MPB) and it could be something totally unrelated.\n\n**My story-**\n\nBack in 2018 I distinctively remember styling my hair in the bathroom and while I was combing my hair I noticed there was a lot less hair on both sides of my temples. Upon closure inspection, I realized that my hairline was becoming more of an M shape and that my overall hair was a little fine/brittle. I went to the doctor to get checked out hoping for her to just tell me that it was like a maturing hairline or something, but to my shock, she told me that I had early signs of male pattern baldness. I thought that balding was not even something to start even worrying about until I was at least in my 40s and boy was I wrong. From that day forward I dedicated a lot of my time to talking with dermatologists, analyzing medical reports, reading people's testimonials, and surfing the forms of different reddits for the answers on saving my hair. Hopefully, this guide helps simplify hair loss for newbies just starting out and provide additional solutions to those who are on treatment that are still struggling.\n\n**Beginners starting out-**\n\nIn the world of hair loss, there is a ton of information out there and it can be extremely difficult to figure out what products you truly need versus the heavily advertised \"snake oil\" products that you don't need. If you have read any of the Reddit forms on r/tressless or other hair loss resources you might have heard people say ***\"Do The Big 3''***. The big three consist of the following products-\n\n1. Finasteride (also known as Propecia)\n2. 5% Topical Minoxidil (also known as Rogaine)\n3. 1% or 2% Ketoconazole shampoo (Nizoral)\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# What do they do, how to get them, how to use them, where to buy them, and other tips/facts that will be useful to know.\n\n1. **Finasteride (Propecia)**\n\n**Finasteride** is the absolute first line of defense to protecting your hair and without it, you won't be able to target the root cause of your hair loss. From what we know DHT which is a byproduct of testosterone is targeting/killing your hair follicles by forcing them to shrink down until they are unable to produce any noticeable hair. Finasteride is an **FDA-approved** 5 alpha reductase inhibitor that is in charge of preventing the testosterone from converting into DHT at up to **70%** effectively. As a result, this should halt further progression of male pattern baldness and you might gain some hair back so long as you keep taking the pill. For application, all you have to do is take one pill a day and make sure to take it consistently. The most common dose for finasteride is 1mg, but some people take 0.25, 0.5 mg, and 1.25mg as well. In order to get this medication, you have to get it prescribed by your doctor, but more preferably dermatologist (since they specialize in hair loss). As far as if you should go to a local dermatologist or online, the choice is really up to you. On one hand, having a dermatologist nearby to treat you/do medical procedures is useful, but it comes at the cost of waiting for an appointment and traveling over to the office. On the other hand, an online dermatologist is fast/convenient since you can do it all from the comfort of your own home. However, it comes at the cost of potentially higher prices (Hims and keeps and getroman ) and dermatologists being limited to only prescribing medications and providing advice. The cheapest way I have found to get finasteride is to get the generic version of (Propecia) prescribed in person or by a normal dermatologist online **(not Hims and keeps or getroman)** and use Good RX at your local pharmacy. The cost was around $11 bucks a month for 30 tablets for me.\n\nIf you have done any research about finasteride, you most likely came across warnings about side effects or people's horror stories about their bodies reacting negatively to finasteride. Just like any other medication, there are always going to be some people who do not react favorably to certain drugs or medications. Fortunately, based on all studies we have, the percentage of men who experience any negative side effect was around 2.1% to 3.8%. **WHILE I AM NOT A DOCTOR**, if you do get bad side effects it would be a wise idea to maybe lower the dose from 1mg to 0.5 mg or 0.25 to see if your body reacts to it better. Another route you can take is to get finasteride in a different form such as the topical version where you apply the liquid to the head instead of taking the oral pill.\n\nThe last thing to mention about finasteride is that you have to be patient with it in order to see results. With the exception of a fake wig or a good hair transplant, it takes time/ consistency to see results from finasteride. As far as how long until you start seeing results, for some, it can be 4 months and for others, it can be as long as 2 years to start seeing results. It all depends on how good of a responder you are to the drug, so just be patient.\n\n**2. Topical Minoxidil 5% (Rogaine)**\n\nTopical minoxidil is an FDA-approved growth stimulant that works by shortening the telogen (resting) phase of your hair growth cycle and moving your hairs into the anagen (active growth) phase. A great way to think about this is a seed being given water to help it grow. Topical Minoxidil comes in two different forms, liquid and foam. The liquid is the cheapest of the two, however, it is known to be messy and irritating for quite a few people's scalps. Foam is more expensive however it is not anywhere as messy and is less likely to cause irritation to the scalp.\n\nFor application, you should apply Minoxidil two times a day to get the best results. The liquid version of the minoxidil is known to make your hair a bit greasy and also make your hair kinda clump together. As a result, this can kinda make the appearance that you are thinning/ balding more than you actually are. I would use a good quick dry foam version of minoxidil in the morning to keep your hair looking great and use the cheap liquid version before you go to bed at night. Maybe your hair does not do that but if it does that is a little trick you can try. As far as side effects other than it irritating some people's scalps there were really no common side effects that are reported by the vast majority of users. Unlike finasteride, you do not need to get a prescription for the doctor for the 5% version of topical minoxidil. You can buy it OTC (over the counter) at pretty much any store that carries simple medications.\n\n**(Keynote) There is a chance that you won't respond to Minoxidil, so in the second half, I explain 3 different ways to become more of an effective responder to Minoxidil.**\n\nThe cheapest I have found for a 6-month supply liquid version was a tie between either Sam's Club/ Costco at around $18 bucks. If you don't have a membership the second place I found was a tie between Walmart/Amazon for around $23 bucks. If your looking for a basic foam version 6-month supply, Walmart and Costco are the cheapest at both around $50 bucks.\n\nEven on the foam version, some people can not tolerate the minoxidil at all but luckily there are some other alternatives you can try instead. Some other options to look into are Rosemary oil, castor oil, and possibly oral minoxidil ( talk about the last treatment more in the second half).\n\n**(Keynote) It is not recommended to start both Finasteride and Topical minoxidil treatments at the same time since we won't know which treatment is actually working. I would start Finasteride first and wait around a year or so to see if any results come up then you will know if the Topical minoxidil is helping at all**\n\n**3. 1% or 2% Ketoconazole shampoo (Nizoral)**\n\nOut of all the other shampoos that claim to \"restore\" hair loss Ketoconazole shampoo is the best in terms of the limited number of studies available on it. How it \"claims\" to work is it decreases the production of testosterone on the scalp which is known to convert into the byproduct DHT. With lower levels of testosterone available to create DHT, the hair follicles are a little bit healthier, denser, and fuller. The shampoo comes in either 1% or 2% and as for how to get them, both versions will be different. The 1% called (Nizoral) can be bought over the counter at pretty much any main steam store. However, the 2% version has to be prescribed by a dermatologist. It is not clear whether the 2% is more effective than the 1%, however, it is worth pointing out that the studies used 2% Ketoconazole shampoo in the testing. while Ketoconazole shampoo sounds great in theory, it is either a hit or miss product for most people. Some people get decent results with it, while other people find it not really doing much for them. I say it is at least worth trying out since a 7-ounce bottle on amazon costs around only $15 bucks.\n\nMost users recommend that you use Ketoconazole shampoo 2 to 3 times a week and leave it on your hair for 5 to 10 min so that it can soak into your scalp. Some users use their own personal shampoo after applying Ketoconazole, but most would agree to apply conditioner after to make sure your hair does not dry up.\n\nI have to give credit to u/Rawtashk on his 2020 updated guide hair guide for explaining everything extremely well, but most importantly for explaining to the new users \"How will I know if it's working?\" and \"How long until I see results?\". I won't really be able to explain it much better than Rawtashk did so ill be pasting his response here as well as a link to his guide at the end.\n\nfrom u/Rawtashk\n\n\" How will I know if it's working?\n\nYou will most likely get a hair shed. It will freak you out at first, but it is almost certainly a positive thing. Your hair will shed and it will regrow and be thicker and stronger. It is not a scientific approach, but I absolutely recommend getting a hair snare for your shower and putting it down every time you wash your hair. You need something with very small holes so your hair doesn't slip through them,[ this is the one that I use](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000PSDGNA)\n\nYou don't need to set this down in the drain if you have a flat drain of if it doesn't fit, just flip it over so it's sticking up and the water will still drain and it will still catch your hairs. This is just to monitor the general amount of hair that's lost when you shampoo. ***DO NOT SIT THERE AND COUNT EVERY HAIR***, it will be different every time because there are a ton of factors that would cause more or less hair on a daily basis. All you're looking for is the general volume of hair that's left after you shower. You should notice it slowing down over the course of many months. This is a long process, not overnight results, be patient. When I first started there would be substantial amounts of hair left, but now it's down to maybe 20ish or so.\"\n\n\" How long until I see results?\n\nAt least a year, maybe more. Again, this takes time, so be patient. Your follicles will have to shed and regrow a slightly thicker hair several different hair cycles. Personally it was probably 12 months before I could personally see changes, and probably 18-20 months before the changes were really apparent in pictures. This is not an overnight fix, it will take time.\n\nYou will also go through shedding phases, try not to freak out. First time it happened to me I was convinced that maybe the Fin I got was fake and I was losing all my progress. The shed lasted for 3-4 weeks or so, then the hairfall went back to normal. I wouldn't have realized any of this if I wasn't using that hair snare and able to monitor what was going on.\n\nHair sheds don't bother me anymore, but it took many years. I would always get stressed out once or twice a year whenever they happened, but the last 4 years or so I just shrug. In fact, I rarely even put the hair catch down anymore because it doesn't really concern me.\"\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Now onto the second half - Those who are on the big 3 protocol, yet still experiencing (MLB) or are not satisfied with the results they got.\n\nMale pattern baldness is a tricky beast to tame because certain medications may work better for some people, but may not work at all for other people. In order for some individuals to combat their hair loss, they will need to do more treatments, upgrade to stronger medications, and add more protocols to their routine/stack. Now the goal is not to use every single possible treatment for hair loss known in the medical literature, but to use enough to be able to get back our hair and see the results we want. The good news is beyond \"The Big Three\" there are many other treatment options that may be worth trying out, but the bad news is it's a game of trial/error and patience.\n\n1. **Dutasteride**\n\nFor those who have been on Finasteride for a while (1.5 years or more) you are probably wondering why you are still thinning/receding/balding even though this drug is supposed to work wonders with protecting your hair. As great as Finasteride is, it has its shortcomings due to the amount maximum amount of DHT it can block. Studies show that Finasteride can block **up to 70%** of the DHT and while that's great there is 30% or more DHT still in your system. Unfournalty even though you have gotten rid of well over half of the DHT in your body, the remaining DHT is still attacking your hair. Dutasteride is another 5 alpha reductase inhibitor approved for hair loss in both South Korea and Japan. What makes Dutasteride different from Finasteride is that it blocks **90% or more** of the DHT which makes it a more effective/potent solution to halt the (MPB). In order to get this medication, you have to get prescribed by your dermatologist. Because this drug is not approved by the FDA in the U.S.(other countries as well) and it is not as well known as Finasteride your dermatologist may not be too keen on prescribing it to you. Personally, I had to go to 3 different dermatologists before one was willing to prescribe me it. Maybe it was just bad luck for me, but just know that it might be harder to get Dutasteride. The application is the same as Finasteride, and it either comes in a tablet or a capsule at a **0.5 mg dose**. Due to the drug not being FDA (yet), a lot of the online dermatology companies (including Hims, keeps, and getroman) do not offer Dutasteride as an option. The only two ways that I know of are to either to see a dermatologist in person or online and speak with a regular online dermatologist. The cheapest I found for getting Dutasteride was the exact same method I did for Finasteride. The price for me was around $14 bucks at my local pharmacy using good RX.\n\nAs far as any negative side effects it is pretty much the same as Finasteride, but since it is more potent, the chances of negative side effects go up a little. If you are getting bad side effects from the Dutasteride pill there is a topical version that you can use that users have said give them fewer side effects, but again everyone reacts differently.\n\n**(Keynote) There are some pharmacies out there that can take the different topical medications and combine them together so that it makes applying topically less of a hassle. Examples that you may find are Finasteride+minoxidil, Dutasteride+minoxidil, Finasteride+minoxidil+tretinoin, etc.**\n\nJust like I mentioned with Finasteride, your going to have to be patient with Dutasteride to do its job. Although since it is a more powerful medication you might see results faster than you would have seen with Finasteride.\n\n2. **Topical Minoxidil 5% with Mirconeedling and Tretinoin.**\n\nTopical minoxidil is one of the safest and most effective treatments we have as a growth stimulant. However, studies on its efficacy showed that **only 40% to 60% respond positively** (depending on which study you look at) to the treatment. Now the question is why is it that around half of the users are unsuccessful with the medication? Well, we think it has to do with if you have enough of the sulfotransferase enzymes in the scalp. Half of the people do not have enough of the needed enzymes in order for the minoxidil to do its job. Now there are two ways to help people to become better responders to topical minoxidil that are backed up by studies.\n\n**Micro needling for hair loss** is the process of puncturing small holes into the scalp in order to encourage the body to heal/grow new hairs and to allow for better absorption of topical medications. There are three different types of micro needling derives you can use- (derma pen) (derma roller) and (derma stamp). The vast majority of users recommend the derma pen since it is a motorized pen machine that punctures needles precisely to the depth you want in the scalp. The most common protocol is to microneedle once every 1 to 2 weeks at a 1.5-millimeter depth. Yes, there are many different protocols out there that have different frequencies and needle depth lengths, your just going to have to find one that works best for you. As far as what is the best best \"derma pen\" out there the 2 big ones you hear about in the Reddit forms are (Dr pen) and (derminator 2). I think they both do great, it's just a matter of preference of what you think is best for you. There are a bunch of different Dr pen's out there such as the M8, A6, and N2, you just have to find one that fits your budget. They cost anywhere from $35 bucks to $180 bucks depending on what accessories you get and where you buy them from. Do not buy them for Dr.pen..com, Dr.penUSA..com, and maybe Amazon (their prices are stupid high. People who have bought pens from the first two websites mentioned have had scamming issues, faulty products, poor customer service, and a host of other issues. The best place to buy Dr. pens from is going to be eBay since they have a great customer protection/return policy and decent delivery times. Aliexpress is another place that other Reddit users have said is a good place to buy as well, however, it takes a long time for it to get delivered but the prices are a bit better than eBays. The derminator 2 can only be bought from vaughter wellness..com and the cost is going to be around $200.\n\n**Tretinoin** is a medication that is used to help fight acne and other skin problems. However, there were multiple studies showing that a small amount of tretinoin that was applied to the hair or mixed with other topicals, helped aid in hair growth. It is important to note that just like Ketoconazole shampoo, tretinoin is a hit more miss for people that use it for hair loss. There is a debate about whether or not it actually helps versus whether it is doing more harm than good. Some people say that adding tretinoin helps them grow back their hair while others said that it made it worse. I would encourage you to do more research on your own and decide for yourself if you think the benefits outweigh the potential cons. Tretinoin has to be prescribed by a doctor or dermatologist. Not sure how much it costs but other users have said it really cheap to get.\n\n**2A. Oral minoxidil**\n\nA lot of people don't like the idea of applying topical minoxidil and having to deal with all the hassle that comes with it. So Minoxidil can come in the form of a pill like oral Finasteride or Dutasteride. Because it is not being applied to the scalp area, the oral minoxidil runs through your body systemically. Studies have shown that people respond to oral minoxidil better than topical since the process of where the enzymes are being converted is happening in the liver instead of the scalp. More of the needed sulfotransferase enzymes are found in higher concentrations in the liver so because of that it works better to grow more hairs.\n\nNow if oral minoxidil is so effective, why isn't it marketed/ recommended by dermatologists more? Well because the minoxidil is running systemically through your body and not just applied to your head so the chances of negative/unwanted side effects goes up. Most people experience Hypertrichosis (excessive hair growth) but there are some that get negative side effects like low blood pressure, heart irregularities, and headaches. So it is important to make sure that you are using the daily recommended amount that your dermatologist sets for you. If you do get bad side effects, like Finasteride you can reduce the dosage to reduce the negative effects. Unlike topical minoxidil, the oral version has to be prescribed by your dermatologist. Because of the uptick in potential negative side effects/ not being FDA approved for hair loss, not all dermatologists will prescribe it to you. If you are not a good responder to the topical minoxidil even with micro needling/ tretinoin added or you don't want to go through all the hassle, oral minoxidil may be a good option for you. The cheapest way I found to get it will be the same way as Finasteride and Dutasteride.\n\n**3. Hair Transplant**\n\nA good/successful hair transplant is one of the most effective treatments that you can do fix your hair loss. Now in order for a person to be a good candidate for a hair transplant procedure an honest/ reputable dermatologist will have to examine several things. The first thing to know is **a hair transplant does not cure hair loss** and if you haven't stabilized your thinning, receding, or balding, you won't have a long-lasting set of hair complete hair. While The newly transplanted hairs are not vulnerable to the (MPB), the original remaining hairs still are. So until you have halted the (MPB) process you will continue to recede in the original hair areas. The dermatologist won't want to perform the procedure until they have a good idea of where the receding is going to end and that is why the mentioned medications/protocols above are critical for long-lasting hair. The second thing to know is you have to have enough healthy \"donor's hairs\" in order to be able to have a transplant. Hair transplant surgeons like using the hairs from the back/ sides of the head since they are more DHT proof and have the best success rate of having a good hair transplant.\n\nThe cost of a hair transplant is substantially higher than the other medications/protocols mentioned above. The cost can be anywhere from $2,000 bucks all the way up to past $15,000 bucks. When it comes to how much should you spend, this is not something to shop around for the best price but to find a reputable hair transplant surgeon. The number of donor hairs you have available is not unlimited, so the procedure needs to be done right the first time so that you don't exhaust additional donor hairs to fix cheap hair transplant mistakes. The cost to do a transplant is very high in the U.S and the UK so countries like Turkey and South Korea have become popular destinations due to the costs of hair transplants being much lower. Wherever you choose to go you need to do your research and make sure that they have your best interest at heart. There need to be a clear understanding and communication happening so that you are happy with the results you get. Hair transplants take around 6 to 12 months for transplanted hairs to start regrowing and act like normal hair.\n\nThere are so many other options that I have not talked about, but if you want to look into other potential hair loss treatments/helpers here are some others to look into-\n\n**Low Lazer Light Therapy, Platelet-rich plasma injections, Topical dutasteride, Topical finasteride Rosemary oil, castor oil, ru58841, vitamin D supplements, saw palmetto, realistic toupee/wigs, and micro pigmentation surgery.**\n\nHere are **youtube channels** that are well worth looking at that go deeper into each other the medications/ treatments/ protocols/ procedures that I talk about in the guide.\n\n\\-**Derek More Plates More Dates**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/c/MorePlatesMoreDates](https://www.youtube.com/c/MorePlatesMoreDates)\n\n\\-**The Hairloss show**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/c/TheHairLossShow](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheHairLossShow)\n\n\\- **Dr. Gary Linkov**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXHS7RSRMGcVp4-MMbEDW6g](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXHS7RSRMGcVp4-MMbEDW6g)\n\n**-Dr. Dray**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/c/DrDrayzday](https://www.youtube.com/c/DrDrayzday)\n\n**-Hair Gaurd**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/c/Hairguard](https://www.youtube.com/c/Hairguard)\n\n**- HAIRLICIOUSLY**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/c/hairliciously](https://www.youtube.com/c/hairliciously)\n\nHere is a link to u/Rawtashk 2020 hair loss guide-[ https://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/comments/f5wvdn/2020\\_updated\\_guide\\_for\\_im\\_losing\\_my\\_hair\\_what\\_do/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/comments/f5wvdn/2020_updated_guide_for_im_losing_my_hair_what_do/)\n\nHere is a link to the u/tressless Wiki index, I goes deep into all the hair loss treatments known in this subreddit:[ http://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/wiki/index](http://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/wiki/index)",

Not knocking anyone who chose otherwise, it was the choice i've carefully made after weighing out the downsides and upsides.\n\nMy protocol was the following:\n\nIn the morning, washing the scalp with 2%ketoconazole shampoo (every other day) // some ginger hair soap in the day not using the ketoconazole shampoo. After 15 mins use 70 mg RU58841 solution\n\nAt night, 2 ml 5% topical minoxidil\n\nOnce a week, 1.5mm microneedling with a derma pen. I DIDN'T USE minoxidil only after ~24h after microneedling, and I DIDN'T USE RU only after ~34h after microneedling.\n\nTime between the photos: 3 months +- a week \n\nHair was about the same length, maybe a little more grown in the after, didn't bother all that much, as the improvement was noticed by everyone in my life, even by my therapist and barber, all without telling anyone what i'm doing.\n\nI am also taking a lot of supplement/vitamins but i was taking them even before starting, so i don't think they're worth mentioning. If anyone's curious, i could reveal my whole stack\n\nGood luck to you all",

I know what the damn study says, and all I can is that some people are different than others. I was a hyper responder to creatine in that way.  This is why I'm doing this stupid stuff to begin with.

I've struggled with dandruff off and on my whole life\n\n2. Oiliness. My scalp gets oily incredibly fast. \n\n3. Dry, itchy skin. Along with the dandruff I would get dry, itchy, peeling patches every so often. It was miserable. \n\nNothing seemed to work. I could get my hair clean, but then it was dull and sad. I could make it shiny and bouncy but then it was oily in a day. If I tried to use products to reduce oiliness, my scalp would become dry and irritated.\n\nI tried every OTC shampoo. Head and shoulders, T-sal, Nizoral, organic ones from Lush, detox shampoos, Verb Ghost, every commonly recommended brand. I barely saw results with any, or I was getting one of the outcomes I listed above: fix one thing and get another. I even tried prescription Ketoconazole \n\nI tried these things for months and even years in some cases. I switched to silk pillowcases, got a soft water filter, a special shower head, stopped conditioning my scalp (and tried conditioning my scalp), air dried, heat dried, wet to dry brushes over regular ones, hair towels, dry shampoo hacks, and a shampoo scrubber thing (the rubber massagers). \n\nNone of these made any dramatic difference, nor did the length of my hair or frequency of haircuts.\n\nJust a bit more than 6 months ago I switched to the Ouai Fine Hair shampoo and conditioner, and every 3 washes I use their detox shampoo. \n\nI am now having the best hair of my life, my scalp is the healthiest it's ever been, my hair is growing so fast and strong, and my mental health has improved now that I have more free time since I'm not having to schedule a hair wash every 48 hours (lol). \n\nI am not one to ever call a product a \"holy grail\", but y'all. I don't think I can ever go back to another shampoo again. ",

    "body": "TLDR: Hair loss recovery is highly YMMV, but possible. Here is my recovery before and after HRT which I started 5/2023, and some tips based on my experience.\n \nHair loss is my greatest source of dysphoria, and it almost kept me from pursuing transition. I remember the hope I experienced after seeing other MTF woman with hair recovery, even if examples were few and far between and it felt woefully improbable that I would experience anything similar. Really good recovery from HRT alone is rare, and seems to favor the very young, and I started in my late 30s with a long history of hair loss. My hope is that someone can benefit from my research and experience, but this is the ultimate YMMV. Genetic factors, age, duration and degree of hair loss, scalp thinning, factors completely out of anyone’s control will likely influence your results far more than mild differences in your treatment regimen. I’m merely sharing my own story. Full disclaimer, I am not an expert, and you should consult with your own doctor before trying anything I mention here- wink. Also, my hair is far from perfect… I had straight, fine, and relatively modest density hair when I was young. By the time I started my HRT about 1.5 years ago, I was still very thin up top but my scalp was mostly covered when dry and combed forward. Even with all my recovery to date, my hair is still thin, with a high hairline and recession, with a covered but thin crown. It would be challenging to have an attractive long hairstyle, but with it short I no longer appear bald or balding! As a NB MTF, I’m starting to accept it and growing more comfortable with it. I may still get a hair transplant in the future, but I’m in a much better starting place now than I was.\n\nI started noticing a receding hairline in my twenties. By 29, I was getting to a Norwood 4 with thinning at the crown. I started 1 mg oral finasteride and had some improvement, and my hair mostly stabilized until I started having more noticeable progression around 5 years ago in my later 30s. In 2021, my hair loss was significant, and I added treatments that had at least some clinical evidence of benefit in studies. The downside is that there are not many studies that look at combinations of therapies, since researchers are usually funded and interested in looking for the benefit of a single treatment. Although tempting, if you go scorched earth with 20 treatments all at once, you’ll never know if any one therapy is beneficial. Some may even be harmful. As there’s really is no magic treatment for hair loss for most people, I focused on maximizing my regimen with different therapy modalities if they worked for me, adding them in a stepwise fashion. I won’t go into a detailed timeline, but I will list what I currently use and my notes for each. I would guess that I got 60% of recovery pre-HRT, and 40% post-HRT.\n \nFinasteride 1 mg oral tablet: This is a DHT blocker. Highly recommend to anyone pre-HRT, and consider it even on HRT. There is also Dutasteride, which is more potent. I won’t go into a lot of detail about this here, but a DHT blocker is essential to prevent miniaturization and thinning of hair follicles. I suspect it may have helped me save some follicles from complete loss over the decade I was on it before HRT. One could argue it’s unnecessary while on HRT if your T is well controlled, but I’m still on it after 1.5 yrs of HRT.\n \nMinoxidil: I started the 5% topical foam in late 2021, consistently in early 2022, then added oral minoxidil at 1.25 mg twice daily (prescribed, please don’t drink topical minoxidil – yes people do this). It was initially developed as a hypertension blood pressure medication, and was found to have a side effect of hypertrichosis, increased hair growth, which led to the development of the topical formulation Rogaine. It’s effect is routinely attributed to increased blood flow, but evidence suggests it affects follicular cells including increasing the anagen growth phase of hair growth, increasing vascular endothelial growth factor, stimulating prostaglandin production, etc. I noticed my hair shafts thickened and darkened, to the point some people thought I was dying my hair darker, and density improved on topical alone. I definitely noted a benefit to oral minoxidil beyond topical alone. There is a risk for increasing body and beard hair with the oral formulation (FTMs know all about this I’m sure – haha). I already had body laser therapy in the past (a huge source of dysphoria as well), and was well into finishing my facial laser, so I didn’t notice this. My eyelashes are amazing and my brows improved though.  It definitely can have a lot of side effects. I noticed facial edema (swelling) and dry skin if I tried to increase my dose beyond 1.25 mg. The topical foam works for me, but I get a dermatitis reaction to the liquid formula (I happen to like using the foam, letting it dry my hair in a spikey way, and then I use my LLLT cap after). Minoxidil may also affect collagen production. This is not to mention that it is again a blood pressure medication, and although fairly safe at low doses, it can have significant potential adverse cardiovascular effects. I get mine as a prescription from my doctor, and I’d recommend anyone pursuing oral therapy to do the same.  Just do your research.\n \nMicroneedling: It is suspected that microneedling can cause micro injury, thereby stimulating healing, increasing local growth factors, and stimulating stem cell activation in the follicle, increasing overall thickness of hairs, causing more villus/fine hairs to potentially become more terminal hairs.  Additionally, it is likely it helps the effectiveness of topical minoxidil. One of the issues with it is the lack of a clear effective regimen. No one knows what the ideal depth or frequency of use is. This is a complicated topic, and unlike medications or topicals which can be used consistently between people, needling is a procedure and there are a wide variety of devices, depths, frequency of use, etc. Going too deep, too often, with a poor quality dull needle, are all dangerous and can lead to scarring and other complications. I would caution that there is a big difference between a true dermapen and a manual stamp or god forbid a cheap roller or repurposed permanent makeup device. I bought a derminator 2 from Vaughter Wellness, and it has been fantastic. I have the same machine I first bought and it works just like it’s brand new. When you factor in the savings over time, it’s a good option compared to disposables and much higher quality. They do sell some manual devices too. I always use a new needle cartridge, I like the 9 needle ones. I prep with 70% isopropyl alcohol and then follow up after the session with an application of their hyaluronic acid they sell.  In my research and experience, 1.5 mm for my scalp was the sweet spot for me, causing mild to moderate redness with occasional pinpoint bleeding, though I usually don’t have much at all. The scalp thins with androgenic alopecia, so the same depth isn’t right for everyone. I was using it every 3 weeks, but got behind for a while and went 4-5 weeks between treatments for 3 months or so and noticed worsening thinning in those areas. I decided to try every 2 weeks recently for several months and really saw improvement. I found this particular video by Dr. Gary Linkov out of New Yourk, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thQ1taoKoo4, to be helpful to understand it better. Be careful with this one. It has a lot of potential, but it can also go wrong.\n \nLow Level Laser Therapy (LLLT): I added LLLT with a mid range Capillus system in July of 2022. The one I use has 202 laser diodes (vs 112 or 272 at the time). It is believed to act on mitochondria, stimulating cytochrome c oxidase, increasing ATP synthesis which is the main energy source in cells. I use it 6 mins per day after my minoxidil application has dried. Although it’s the most expensive up front cost of any of my treatments, I’m still using the same one over 2 years later and have had no issues. I noticed most of the effect by about a year in. If you sign up for a newsletter, they send sales offers often, 30-40% off sales are not infrequent.\n \nHonorable Mentions:\nNizoral Ketoconazole 1% Shampoo: I started this in 2023. Mostly, I am prone to a drier scalp and dandruff, and this helps to mitigate that for me. It is believed to help clear away skin (dandruff aspect) and possibly some DHT blocking effect. The evidence is sparse at best. I use it several times a week.\n \nHair, skin, and nails biotin supplement: I do notice my hair and nails seemed to grow a bit faster when taking this. It’s a supplement, probably not harmful. Contains Biotin, Vit A, Vit C, Vit D, Vit E, Thiamin - B1, Riboflavin - B2, Pyridoxine HCl - B6, Cyanocobalamin - B12, and Folate.\n \nI found the topical minoxidil and the Biotin supplement are cheapest and best quality through Costco. I think they occasionally sell a capillus there too, but I bet their sales, including refurbished ones, might be cheaper. These therapies can cause shedding, especially common with the minoxidil though I noted it after my LLLT too. This isn’t necessarily bad, in fact it can be a sign that things are working. Lots of information on this in other forums.\n \nI hope this helped someone out there!!",

I personally think if someone is transitioning and has hair loss they should consider finasteride instead of relying on T suppression alone.  While it does help, serum DHT =/= Scalp DHT and that's the dark nature of DHT.  It's in higher concentrations in certain areas of the body, and unfortunately, the scalp is one of the highest. This is most likely why Dutasteride, which kills over 99% of serum DHT, doesn't magically cure hairloss.  I've seen people who had years into their transition start finasteride and miraculously regain some lost ground which could suggest that the small amounts remaining have a significant impact, that's anecdotal though.",

But I felt obliged to because I similar to many of you have found this skin condition to be a real challenge to manage. It is incredibly disappointing to find so little evidenced based research on this topic. \n\nI have had dandruff since my teens but have been able to manage it with head and shoulders. About 2 years ago, I noticed a rash developing on my nasolabial fold but didn't think too much of it. I was to consumed with my work and didn't really pay attention.\n\nFast forward to this year and the rash progressed to my forehead and was far more noticeable. I self diagnosed myself with sebderm and followed the NICE guidelines (link below)\n\n [Scenario: Seborrhoeic dermatitis - face and body | Management | Seborrhoeic dermatitis | CKS | NICE](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/seborrhoeic-dermatitis/management/seborrhoeic-dermatitis-face-body/) \n\nI used ketoconazole and hydrocortisone to little effect for around 4 weeks. At this point, I decided to get a private dermatologists opinion on the rash. They concurred that it was indeed sebderm and prescribed additional ketoconazole and a tacrolimus ointment. \n\nThe tacrolimus cream was very effective. The rash after 2 weeks was barely noticeable. After a 6 week course however it gradually started to return. I decided to use the tacrolimus cream twice a week for maintenance. But about two months ago I decided that I didn't want to become dependent on it. I think many patients share the same stance. \n\nThese last three months I have tried a range of products. I attempted using salicylic acid, sebclair cream, zinc pyrithione and miconazole. Tried spending an hour or so outside in the sun (30C). I even tried using manuka honey as many have suggested. Not all at once of course. Nothing worked despite giving each treatment option a decent length of time. \n\n3 days ago, I got myself a bottle of MCT. I would say that for me, the results are comparable to using the tacrolimus cream.  I hope that it continues to work in the long run. I use nothing else but a cetaphil moisturizer. \n\nAs many of you know, there is a very limited understanding of this disease. I find it mind-boggling that certain treatment options are excluded, because there is no evidence for their efficacy when nobody's actually bothered to hold a trial. \n\nDoes diet play a role? Dermatologists don't seem to think so. Based on what? \n\nI intended to post this, just to share my frustration with the community. I don't intend to provide any medical advice from this post.",

SO, I came here and made a bunch of posts loll  \n\nIn my desperation I used white vinegar a few nights ago (apparently a day ago, but I've done it twice and not washed it for today) instead of shampoo.

Currently I am managing it with T/Gel 1% which I apply daily to my scalp and face. I leave it on for my entire shower then rinse it off at the end and while doing so I rub my t-zone with my fingertips rather vigorously to loosen up the flakes, avoiding scratching with my nails. This usually handles most of the problem, then if I still have some flaking in that area, I apply Vaseline petroleum jelly and rub it in. I have tried most of the topical ointments recommended, both prescribed and otc. None of them were long lasting or without some side effect which was typically a burning sensation that would only tend to irritate the skin more.\n\nI do find the possibility of correlated symptoms rather intriguing. Like many, I also suffer from allergic rhinitis, but I have also been diagnosed with CF (cystic fibrosis) which has a long list of potential symptoms, many of which mimic IBS and COPD. I haven't seen any possible correlation between CF mutations and SD though. There is also CF related diabetes, which I currently do not have, but is always a concern.\n\nAt the age of 17 I was also diagnosed with AS (ankylosing spondylitis), though it has either somehow gone into remission or I was misdiagnosed. I do however, have scoliosis and frequent sciatica.\n\nNot sure if any of this is even relevant or useful, but I figure I will toss it all out there if someone wants to dive down the rabbit hole of inflammatory diseasees.",

    "body": "Thought I would share my story, because while I was going through this I would scour depths of Google I didn't know existed, LiveJournal posts from 20 years ago, anything I could get my eyes on looking for someone that I could relate my story to. \n\nIt all started when I had unprotected sex with someone I had never slept with before on September 17th. I woke up the next day and felt out of sorts, but also immensely hungover. I gave it a day and was still not feeling right. I thought okay, I definitely have a UTI. I called my doctor and begged for meds and to not make me come in, I was on the UTI meds for about two days before I decided to look down there and lo and behold, I had a raging yeast infection. I was prescribed 1 Diflucan. I took the pill with no relief. Oh, did I mention that while I was trying to look at the inside of my vagina on my mirrored closet wall, I tore my meniscus? That was a very fun cherry on top of what I didn't know would be months of agony. Let me stop all the readers right here, if you have never had a yeast infection, an itch, or an urge to take a mirror to your lady parts, DO SO TONIGHT. I had NO IDEA what was normal, what my discharge looked like, what was not typical  because I DIDN'T THINK TO LOOK UNTIL I WAS ALREADY OUT OF SORTS. \n\nFor the next 3 weeks I was back and forth between the gyno and those immediate walk in medical places. I was on Diflucan, I was on Terconazole, I supplemented with Monistat and I could not get rid of this. I then went to the walk in medical place and begged for Flagyl, I was convinced I had a bacterial infection. The doctor swabbed me and put me on it, but alas the results said I didn't have a bacterial infection. During this time, surgery was scheduled for my torn meniscus. I was feeling pretty crappy and immobile and dealing with a vagina that would not stop secreting discharge. After I got better I got to doing my own research and came across the most frightening thing I could read, \"Chronic yeast infections are a symptom of HIV\". I couldn't believe my eyes, in my head, I thought \"I had sex with this random guy, unprotected, and now I cant kick this yeast infection. I have HIV\" How will I tell my parents. I was so depressed, so nervous, so suicidal I could barely function in everyday life. My friends BEGGED me to go get tested because they all thought I was insane, and of COURSE I didn't contract this disease. While my parents knew at the time my yeast infection issues, they really just said oh its no big deal, it will get better, stop worrying. Finally in December I broke down and told them my fears, and we went that night to get tested. \n\nIT WAS THE LONGEST THREE NIGHTS OF MY LIFE. And I came back negative for every STD, the sigh of relief was unparalleled to anything I had ever experienced in my life. Waiting outside the bathroom of my office, calling, listening to the hold music, praying for the nurse on the other end to tell me this was all negative. I was over the moon and so much of my anxiety subsided, but I still had this underlying issue- I could NOT kick this yeast infection.\n\nI started working with a new gyno at my practice.I would find relief from the diflucan but like clock work, after a few days of it leaving my system, I was back to discharge all over my clothes and my vaginal lips. I tried everything on Google, coconut oil, inserting cloves of garlic into my vagina, not wearing underwear, wearing underwear, buying any pill online (Yeast Fighters comes to mind), changing my toilet paper brand, not ever using soap near my vagina, cutting out sugars, trying not to drink beer, putting yogurt into my vagina, EVERYTHING short of buying boric acid and putting it inside of me. This effected me in every aspect of my life, it was always on my mind. I would go out with friends and be happy for a bit, but then revert back to the anxiety and worry that this would never go away. Finally, I started losing a bit of weight and my doctor prescribed me Ketoconazole 3x a day for 30 days, I changed my shower head to one that was removable . And that was it. In May of the following year I was finally free. I am not even sure if it was definitely the prescription, if it was me eating healthier, if my body was finally done, but it is 9 months later, proportionately almost the amount of time I suffered from this, and I rarely think about it anymore. I wanted to post this to anyone else that's suffering like I was and looking for ANYONE that could relate to what they were going through, because I would have appreciate reading anyone else's journey to know I was not alone during mine.",

        "body": "Hey! This was pretty much my story last year! Before all of it started I had never had a yeast infection, never had BV, nothing like that. It has also been... almost a year since it's been treated and I hardly think about it but I know I also get slightly more paranoid if anything just feels off down there though there hasn't been any problems since. \n\nBasically it all started when I went on 2 courses of fairly intense antibiotics within a couple weeks (for unrelated infection) + working as a lifeguard in 90 degree weather. I never had an infection before so I just bought the monistat and that's where I think it went wrong.. not sure. But I definitely had a bad reaction to the monistat. A few weeks went by and I went back to college and still didn't feel normal down there so I went to the doctor because I had gotten an abscess (from the monistat) that they gave me a steroid cream to treat it with. Also still had a yeast infection which they gave me diflucan. Also tested for STDs all of which came back negative.\n\nANYWAY. Another few weeks go by and I decide I need to go to an actual gyno. At this point I'm also paranoid I must've gotten HIV somehow because I spent a lot of time researching why I have this yeast infection that wouldn't go away... despite the fact that I was already tested. I did everything you tried - all the home remedies, switched underwear, etc. I was taking like 4 probiotic pills a day. I made the gyno test me again... still negative. This time they prescribed me 2 weeks of boric acid. Still didn't get rid of it. It was so frustrating. Finally after all the research I put in I demanded they do a culture and figure out what exactly it was. Most people get candida albicans.. but turns out I had the more rare strain candida glabrata which is extremely resistant to the common antifungals. So I did more research until I found a study where women were treated with flucytosine AND IT WORKED. I was so desperate so I told my doctor I needed this and he wrote the prescription. It was so ridiculously expensive. It had to be specially compounded and I paid 1000 for it with insurance... But at this point it had been 7 months of an ongoing yeast infection and I was in pain so. It was worth it to me. \n\nAnyway, you're not alone! And also for any future people who may be at their wits end and looking for anyone who has this experience and desperately researching like I was - there's a cure. My doctor didn't know the answer, I had to figure it out myself. Sometimes you just have to keep pressing until you find it. It's been nearly a year and apart from occasional anxiety that I get that it's somehow going to come back, I haven't had a single issue. \n\nEdit: Also was on terconazole, didn't work.",

It came back just as strong once the meds had left my system.\n\nIt's gone away in the last couple of years, though. I don't know whether it was just luck or something else.

The recurrent bv/yeast specialist at my obgyn office was baffled at my issues!\n\nI am not sure what ended up working for me. I have been clear for a little less than a year now. I have a few theories: 1.) I stopped using the pill and went on an IUD 1.5 years ago. I believe this helped somewhat (lower hormone dose). 2.) I don't wear underwear at night, and sleep without shorts/pants. 3.) I just rinse with water in the shower and use only coconut oil to shave. 4.) I use an AWESOME organic water-based lube that is pH balanced (the company UK based by the name of YES). 5.) Before bed I rinse my vulva/vag off with warm water using a \"perrineal bottle\", which is basically a squirt bottle. 6.) When I get a uti, I buy d-mannose, and add it to my water. I have cured several utis using this. D-mannose is a special sugar that clings to e-coli in the urinary tract/bladder and flushes it out when you pee. I swear it works just as well as antibiotics. You have to make sure you take the right dosage. Some supplements just provide a dose enough to prevent but not cure utis. I was skeptical at first, but it is something I wish I knew about earlier.

I stopped taking maintenance doses of fluconazole and only used it when I had an active infection. Over the course of 2.5 years, I probably got more than 30-40 infections.  \n\nEdit: I also use this to test if I have bv or yeast: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B005FYGXUC/ref=sxts1?ie=UTF8&qid=1484881069&sr=1&pi=AC_SX236_SY340_FMwebp_QL65\n\nNormal vaginal ph is between 3.8-4.5.

So I’m now trying the boric acid suppositories and going to see if that helps . I’ve also noticed that too much sugar can throw off the pH balance in the vaginal area. Also too much coffee too much spicy foods has an effect on that area to. Also, some may have a sensitive bladder, which means when they wipe themselves with certain toilet paper can irritate it more.

    "body": "**UPDATE**\nI got a lot of comments saying this is seborrheic dermatitis. **What I had was NOT Seborrheic dermatitis.** SB takes a long time to heal and almost never goes away. It is difficult to treat. What I had went away in ~6 shampoos and has never come back. It was a yeast infection, just as the dermatologist diagnosed. Just wanted to clarify.\n\n---\n\nIf you have dry flaky skin, and maybe some dry flaky scalp, you might actually have the yeast infection known as dandruff! The dermatologist examined my skin (dry and flaky, prone to breakouts) and scalp (slightly flaky, but not that bad: nothing I would have sought treatment for independently). She noted the extra flakes on my forehead (where my hair touches my skin) and in my nose creases, and the fact that no amount of moisturizing has made any difference for me, and prescribed a dandruff shampoo that I would also use as a facewash. Apparently dandruff is actually a type of yeast infection!\n\n**Background:**\n\nI've been a member of this subreddit for about a year, self-identified as having \"dry\" skin with some flakes. My skin generally feels dull and listless, and I struggle with little acne breakouts all the time.\n\nI started with the Beginner's Routine, and slowly added products (patch-testing, of course) until I had this routine:\n\nMorning:\n\n* Splash with water\n* Paula's Choice BHA (~2x a week, waiting 30 mins before proceeding))\n* Moisturizer CeraVe in the tub (sometimes)\n* Elta MD 46 facial sunscreen (everyday)\n\nEvening:\n\n* OCM w/ jojoba oil (most nights)\n* CeraVe foaming cleanser (other nights)\n* If I washed with CeraVe I would use St. Ives' AHA pads, waiting 30 mins before proceeding)\n* Moisturizer CeraVe in the tub\n* Petroleum jelly\n\nNo matter what my routine was, my skin really never changed: it was always dry-feeling, dull, listless, flaky, and prone to breakouts.\n\n\n**Now**:\n\nI've only used the shampoo once (she told me to wash my face with it too), but my skin already feels soft and supple instead of dry and flaky - it feels... almost wet and sticky to me now, but in a good way. Like how the rest of my skin feels - no longer grainy, dry and flaky!\n\nWe'll see how it goes long-term, but thought I'd mention the concept of dandruff as yeast infection for others!\n\n**EDIT:**\nThe active ingredient in the shampoo is 2% ketoconazole. The prescription version of the shampoo cost $7 (it's the generic version, I don't think the price had anything to do with my not-so-great insurance). It's called \"Perrigo\". Here's the full ingredient list:\n\n* ketoconazole 2%\n* coconut fatty acid diethanolamide\n* disodium laureth sulfosuccinate\n* FD & C Red No. 40\n* hydrochloric acid\n* imidurea\n* laurdimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed collagen\n* PEG-120 methyl glucose dioleate\n* purified water\n* sodium chloride \n* sodium hydroxide\n* sodium lauryl ether sulfate",

I started oil cleansing every night, slugging it up with Aquaphor, and signed up with Pockederm.  \n\nWithin a few weeks, my face was a NIGHTMARE. It was constantly red, inflamed, itchy, and the mild flaky spots had taken over my entire face. I finally went to see a dermatologist and she diagnosed me with sebhorreic dermatitis and informed me that all of the oil and petroleum I had been smothering on my face every night was actually making my condition worse.

Starting in the middle, I apply a thin trail of foam, tap it in, and section my hair every 2-3 inches until I reach my ear. I repeat this on the other side. Afterward, I use a wooden massage tool to massage my scalp for 2 minutes. Finally, I sanitize the area with 70% isopropyl alcohol, wash my hands twice, and I’m done!\n\nAdditional treatment: I use Nizoral (ketoconazole) shampoo twice a week to reduce hair shedding — it’s helped a lot! Once a week, I start with a clarifying shampoo, then apply Nizoral and let it sit for about 3 minutes while I wash my body. Letting it sit is key for it to work effectively! ",

    "body": "Recently joined Reddit and have been trying to give back a lot of information I've collected over the years. Hoping it will help others as I see a lot of people looking for answers. I'm no Dr, but I think this can at least give people things to think about, and can do more research on their own. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Many dermatologists know little about hair loss and general practitioners know nearly nothing. Many good hair restoration surgeons are also board certified dermatologist. Check out doctors like John Cole, Dr. Bauman, McGrath and others that specialize in non-surgical treatments and are part of the IRHS. \n2. Don't cut pills. Instead, consider taking them in a different frequency. so 1 mg pill every other day could be similar to .5 mg daily. Also, only pills with a line in them are meant to be cut. That's because the active ingredient (finasteride for example) isn't evenly distributed through the pill. \n3. Go name brand if you can.  when a pill is generic it only needs to have the same active ingredient. All the other \"filler\" ingredients can be different and they are not tested. There is a general belief that these ingredients can interact over time and would affect potency.  I was told this from someone who works for a pharma company who's job it is to test pills every year to ensure efficacy. Also, don't store pills in a hot car or anywhere where the temp is too high or low. This also affects the pills.\n4. Minox can be used once a day. Apparently, the studies were only done twice a day, so that's how they need to market it. However, many people only use it at night and get great results. just make sure it absorbs before you wash. 30min or longer. \n5. Minox and Propecia work in different ways. One blocks DHT and the other is less understood. However, it's believed it increases blood flow and increases the life cycle of the follicle. If you start both and stop one, then you'll lose the benefit of the one. \n6. If you're unsure if you have hair loss, you could buy a USB microscope and check for miniaturization.  I use one called \"plugable\" and use a mole or spot on your head to monitor loss or progress. \n7. There are alternatives to Nizoral. Nizoral is drying and is hard to use frequently. I use a shampoo from Regenepure. it's expensive but it a better shampoo. At the end of the day, you want the 1% ketoconazole. \n8. Hairloss runs in some basic patterns. the Norwood scale is most known. That is where the vertex and corners thin. You can also be a diffuse thinner where the whole head thins on top. Hopwver, less common thinning is DUPA (where the whole head thins) or retrograde alopecia where the nape of the neck thins upwards and sides move back. The big difference between retrograde and DUPA is the back of the head remains intact. Most aggressive hair loss comes with retrograde.  They say Propecia doesn't work well with DUPA. \n9. Many people get the hair loss itch. This is believed to be inflammation from DHT. The way I've battled it is to avoid hot showers and drink plenty of water. Inflammation is bad. It's why you see a lot of people also complaining about dandruff or other skin conditions that come with hair loss. ketoconazole shampoo helps with this. \n10. Hair loss has nothing to do with how much DHT you have on your head, but how sensitive you are to it. So let's say you have a DHT level of 10, but your sensitivity is a 5. You'll then lose hair. Propecia might lower it to a 4 and you'll be good. However, as we age our sensitivity might go up to a 6 and we'll start losing again. Albeit slower. That's why many people think Propecia isn't working anymore and then stop to disastrous results. The medicine is still supressing the DHT, but you're more sensitive. \n11. Finasteride could be topical. Some doctors like Dr. Cole in Atlanta and Baumann will give you a topical mix of minox and finasteride. It is believed that this will help you avoid sides. The mix can be foam or liquid and is sent to a compounding pharmacy. \n12. A slightly thin head of hair at 19 is an amazing head of hair at 40. Don't be the guy that fills in some temple recession at 20 and then has the plug look when you're 50 and you lose hair behind the implants. You will still care about how you look at 40 and 50, but you'll be more realistic.\n13. I tapered on Propecia to avoid sides. 1 every 3 days, then 1 every 2, then once a day. I did it and it worked. No science behind this, but it made sense to me since it's done with other drugs.\n14. When you lose hair in the shower, you'll notice that some hairs will be thinner in diameter. That's a sign of hair loss. \n15. Concealers like Toppik and Dermatch work really well. Dermatch is water-resistant. However, both should be used sparingly. They create a matted look and may look unnatural if used too much or if you eliminate your part. \n16. In 20 years I've only gotten comments from other guys. In my experience, only other guys notice or care. Usually, because they're insecure about their own appearance. \n17. I believe microneedling pens are superior to rollers as rollers cause tears in the skin. If had temple recession only, that's where I'd start. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's all I could think of for now. Hope it helps. Happy to answer any questions.",

    "body": "Hi everyone, I have been on here in the past because I’ve been struggling with hair loss for about 2 years now. It started getting very bad after starting birth control and then stopping after a month due to depressive symptoms (I have OCD, and recurrent MDD). Most of the hair from my temples had fallen out (visibly) and my crown. However, hair was coming out in large quantities all over my head. I also lost my period for 8 months, had lost 10 lbs (was at 95lbs) and was severely depressed. Basically my hormones were everywhere. I went to 2 derms, a pcp, a gynecologist, endocrinologist and 2 integrative health doctors trying to figure out what the heck was going on inside my body. What was causing weight loss, hair loss, skin issues, fatigue, loss of period, and SEVERE mental health challenges. I had so much blood drawn and most doctors wrote me off and told me it was TE and just stress. One told me to even go to tj maxx and buy some candles as treatment. I was so lost, depressed, and OBSESSED with my hair. To the point where I counted every hair that came out of my head and that decided how my day would go. I was self diagnosing myself left and right. I thought I had pcos, some severe autoimmune disorder, thyroid issues, gut issues, etc. I was so miserable. My labs all came back clinically fine. So they thought it was all stress and mental health issues (I’d like to state that I was not on any psychiatric medication at this time due to fear of it causing the hair loss to worsen). So what started my journey to heal? \n\nWell first I saw a specific integrative care doctor who ordered a LOT of labs (if anyone is interested in which ones message me!) and she looked at things sub clinically. I was deficient in almost every vitamin which led to the fact that I wasn’t eating enough (I was 100lbs, I’m 5 2) she gave me a vitamin d3+k2 supplement, multivitamin, and a cortisol manager supplement. Almost immediately my periods came back. They have remained regular to this day which I have never experienced in my life. Although this helped my hair still wasn’t growing much and I still had bald spots. However, my hair had a reduction in shedding. \n\nSPIRONOLACTONE EXPERIENCE\nFast forward a few months I had been doing a lot of research on hair loss and was terrified I had AGA. I would count all the miniaturized hairs that fell out and compare them to how much regular hair came out. I could not accept that I may have AGA. It felt like a death sentence. Like I was doomed. Which is something a lot of women and men feel. Regardless, I thought I’d try spironolactone per my integrative doctors recommendation (because of acne). I thought maybe this is the light at the end of the tunnel, maybe this will be the miracle drug everyone says it is. I had a lot of hope and I am aware that this works for a lot of people. However, I’d like to shed light on the minority of people who unfortunately have a bad reaction (Jeff Donovan talks about this in some articles)! For some people spiro causes a TE that may actually speed up the underlying AGA. And in my case, unfortunately, this is what happened. I tried it for 2 months at 25mg a day and I lost around 700 hairs a day. That was unlike any shedding I’ve ever seen. I ended up stopping it but I continued to shed. This caused me to be in a very dark place. I needed to do something about this so I decided to look everywhere for a dermatologist that knew something about hair loss. \n\nDERMATOLOGIST, MINOXIDIL, PUMPKIN SEED OIL, 2% KETOCONAZOLE SHAMPOO\nI ended up finding one and going in. For the first time a doctor actually LOOKED at my scalp and the areas I was concerned about. He took a dermascope and looked up close to determine miniaturization. He diagnosed me with AGA and TE. This was very hard for me to hear but part of me felt relieved. For the first time I had an answer, I didn’t have to feel like I was insane anymore. He told me to start minoxidil 5% and pumpkin seed oil (a good source of omega 3s (helps inflammation, and blocks Dht), and to wash my hair with 2% keto shampoo 2 times a week. I have been doing these things for about 4.5 months only and this is the results. I put my hair in a ponytail today for the first time in 2 years and I don’t feel insecure and less than. I am so beyond happy and proud of myself. I would also like to mention that my TE from spiro did resolve after 3-4 months (it needs to run its course) I didn’t really notice too bad of a minoxidil shed because I was already shedding. But I shed less than 100 a day now. \n\nOTHER THINGS THAT HAVE HELPED\nI truly believe that although the things previously mentioned helped majorly, these things I think had contributing factors. I restarted my antidepressants and anxiety medication (once it built up it made a big difference in my everyday functioning while going through this), I also started to eat better and more (I am now 108lbs and so confident), I continue with my vitamin regimen from my integrative health doctor, and I also moved out of my toxic/abusive parents house and joined a sorority at my college (I live in the house) I have a family here and I am no longer alone or isolating myself. I am so beyond proud of myself for getting myself through this (some days are still hard but I power through) I am all the more stronger and beautiful.\n\nPlease message me if you have any questions! I am not a doctor but the amount of research I’ve done on things and experience I have…I may be able to offer insight. NEVER GIVE UP HOPE. YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL. \n",

Frontal hairline has some growth but not much.\nSide effect: first 3 months foggy head and low libido, BUT in the last 3 months I’ve noticed that I’m back to normal. Strong as a bull and sharp mind.\n\nSo it was tough at the beginning but I guess my body has adjusted to the medication and the new DHT levels.\n\nI’m still not satisfied with the results because my hair is still weak and hairline is awful, but I have some hope that at the 12 month mark I’ll look better, but I’m not sure.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Any advice on how to accelerate this? Not a big fan of essential oils (rosemary). I am a big time traveler and it’s so annoying and embarrassing to carry my hair kit (I hide in the hotel bathroom from my girlfriend when i do the routine).\n\nShould I add something else to my routine to speed up? I hate my frontal hairline but I don’t want a transplant. Any advice or suggestion would be appreciated.\nCheers",

    "body": "Dear gals and guys, \n\n—-TLDR at bottom—\n\nI fell for it too… the idea that i must purge, toil and boil, cry and scream, etc, in order to finally have good skin. I want you to know— i went through HELL. I lurked in this sub, i obsessively watched Dr. Dray, and lurked on random skincare subreddits.. based on the advice i tried sandwiching, then use every week, use every three days, use every day, i switched to cerave, then vaseline, then to cetaphil, then acne.org, then micellar water, I ate nothing but broth and stopped eating sugar, i ate kimchi, etc all in an attempt to figure out how to mitigate the purge. hell, I looked through legit research studies to try to pull myself through this… to no avail… until… I FOUND MY PANACEA! So instead of ditching this subreddit that gave me the motivation to keep going, I wanted to share my story and leave it at that, because I suspect this will help a poor soul like me who felt lost and isolated with their skin and no where to turn. \n\nI started my journey with tretinoin like many— I saw ads in FB and tiktok with before and afters, and I thought i’d try apostrophe to start because it seemed relatively safe and recommended. I also used eucerin cream to moisturize extra to prevent what i thought would be very drying. after about 2 weeks of tret formula use every other night, i developed a bunch if tiny white bumps all over my face and neck. Some call them “grains of sand”. I thought the purge had begun… but this period alone lasted for 3 months. I felt nervous, so i did more research on apostrophe and found that their formulas are not lab tested for every batch for clean and clear formulas and i also learned that compounded forms of tretinoin can be ineffective or irritating. So after those three months of what i’d call mild-to slightly more frequent purging, I decided to get a script for .025 tret through Nurx. \n\nThis is where it all went to shit. After 2 -3 weeks my skin had gotten notably worse. what used to be mild texture and closed comedones became cystic, papule-covered, and angry as hell. I was panicking but watched more youtube videos to remind myself about the necessity of the purge. I reached out to my nurx provider to question the efficacy of this purge and what to do. I got no response for 2 weeks and was eventually told that the purge is normal and the formula is fine. spoiler alert- the formula was in fact not fine for my skin. \n\nafter purging horribly for ~10 more weeks i stopped tret, went to an esthetician and sobbed about how bad my skin had gotten. She took pity on me did a face mask and tried to sell me $200 worth of skincare products that would fix my skin. She admitted she never had a reaction to tret like i did and always had good skin, but she was hopeful she could help me get clear skin in 6-12 months. I politely declined to buy the products and knew in my heart that there was another quicker solution. I went back to reddit and scoured and scoured and finally found my holy grail. Simple Skincare Science. a blog created by a reddit user who suffered horrible skin for years. i obsessively researched the blog and realized that i have (and many of us purgers have) skin that is prone to both bacterial acne and fungal acne (malessezia  \npityposporum). i told my esthetician i thought my acne may be fungal and she said, no i dont think so! i disagreed and took matters into my own hands.\n\nI began my investigation and got a black light on amazon. Woods lamps are used by derms to diagnose fungal or bacterial acne. if you see yellowish, green, and even blue.. then you know you have fungi on a surface including your skin. If you see coral, pink or red then you are seeing bacteria. well can you guess what i saw when i looked? green and yellow and blue… everywhere. \n\nI then checked all the ingredients in my makeup & skincare and found that many of them have fungal acne triggers and even feeders (fungus loves fatty lipids, oils ~except caprylic~ and esters). i had to throw away most of the expensive shit i had just purchased to save myself. this includes sunscreen and face wash and blush etc. \n\nI then purchased (and yes, i spent way too much but those of you going through this know what it’s like to be in this state) fungal acne safe products both makeup and skincare. The beauty of FA safe though is that your options become severely limited and you end up saving the money you would have spent on $$$$ experimental and luxury products later down the road. my holy grail product is now a sulphur mask i buy for $6 on amazon. Lol \n\nMy fungal acne fighting products were: Happy cappy zinc shampoo, nizoral (only used about 3 x its strong) and 10-30 min sulphur masks. building up the time i wore them. I knew then that this was fungal because my face got angry as fuck and red. The acne was dying off quickly and this, I could tell, was a real purge. It was so so challenging. but i stuck with it because i knew and could feel it had figured it out once and for all and now it was just a matter of waiting for my skin to cleanse itself and heal. \n\ni eventually went to a dermatologist and told him my findings and asked for diflucan (an oral antifungal)— just in case. Because i had also been on antibiotics for a month back in the fall before starting tret, so wanted to make sure it wasn’t also internal. He agreed and said it seemed like i knew my shit Lol. \n\nDuring that time my skincare involved a transitionary period as I purchased the Malezia brand of everything and shipping times were delayed. So in the meantime i used cerave foaming cleanser, acne.org benzoyl peroxide, and urea moisturizer from hado labo. then i switched to all malezia brand. i also used stridex pads alternating or throughout the day. I eventually added Paulas choice 8% AHA GEL (not liquid as it has FA triggers). And in a matter of a month my skin stopped producing new acne and began to just have scarring. for another 2.5 months i used paulas choice, still adding in sulphur masks weekly and my skin made more progress. \n\nThen, when my skin was clear and scarring was faded a lot more, i SLOWLY checked out altreno- a micro-ionized form of tretinoin with no known fungal acne triggers. but i used it incredibly slowly for 1-2 months; every 3-4 days and less than a pea size. i noticed some dryness and a little but of tiny red spots where black heads or cc’s— this was the type of purging you are meant to have on tret/exfoliants if you have no active acne. I could slow down and begin my basic FA safe routine. \n\nIt turns out those itnital “grains of sand” that popped up everywhere were actually the fungal acne on my skin starting to react to FA triggers in apostrophe (which may have been whatever their moisturizer was) and then again to the isopropyl myristate in the nurx. the thing with tret is that it increases skin turnover rapidly and therefore can allow fungal acne to grow rapidly too… this is what I suspect is happening to us poor souls who have terrible “purges”.\n\nso know this... You WILL have clear skin but you need to check your current tret, maybe even pause tret altogether, and ditch other products that are exacerbating your “purge. Go back to basics. YOU WILL SAVE MONEY LONG TERM. I can't even believe this but I now really only wash my face once a day!!! In the am I used a stridex pad or use hyloronic cleanser if I feel like it, benzoyl peroxide and sunscreen. then at night I use my hyolornic acid cleanser and altreno or BP/stridex if I want an off-night. I never thought my skin would be back and BETTER than it started! \n\nand when/if you want to try tret again… though for anyone who thinks they might be prone to it, i would fix your skincare and product lineup for at least a month and THEN try it. I waited until i had no active acne and until my scarring faded significantly before trying it again because i wanted to know if it was just tret or if it was my overall skincare. \n\nGo find a micro-ionized one (for me altreno is well worth the cost) with no known FA triggers. You need to overhaul your skincare and get rid of anything with FA triggers. \n\nmy skin is totally clear now and by golly i just want to hug myself back then and say it will be okay you will get through this. because man do i empathize with you folks struggling right now. \n\nAnd in fact, I may be down voted for calling the “necessary” purge a myth..  however… the proof is in the muhfuggin pudding baby!!!! i brought my skin through the depths of hell and back, not only lived to tell the tale, but got sustainably clearer skin in the process.\n\n\nTLDR; i believe the terrible purge is a myth and is a result of many tret users having fungal acne and using poorly formulated tret. get rid of all fungal acne triggering products including sunscreen and makeup, get your skin right again and then try tret again if you want using a micro-ionized formula. \n\n-----------\nEDIT: I'm getting some questions about routine, products, etc. So I'll link those here. someone also mentioned shampoo/conditioner being a culprit and YES! I have had seborrheic dermatitis/ itchiness/ orange colored dandruff on my scalp before using products with essential oils, shae butter, things they say are natural... For FA skin, natural AINT IT!! We must get chemical ;) Lol. When I started treating my FA, I went fully clean of anything that could trigger it. I washed my pillow case every other day, slept on my back so it wouldn't spread to my pillow, cleaned all brushes i used, tried to avoid makeup if I could. Please check out this man's blog, it's a goldmine... and if you need help just DM me <3 https://simpleskincarescience.com/ \n \nPRODUCTS: \n* The light I used: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091CXT2Q9?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details (if you wash your face before using this, it might change what shows up... and i initially didn't think what i saw was fungal but it turns out it was, so know that YMMV. Also do not buy a UV light by accident like i did, get this one hehe.) \n\n* The Zinc Shampoo mask I used (about once every 3-4 days, based on how my skin responded. I will still occassionally use this on my scalp and body and face in the shower and leave it on there for like 2-5 mins if I notice some reactions): https://happycappyshampoo.com/product/shampoo-for-cradle-cap-and-seborrheic-dermatitis/ \n* Nizoral mask (I kept this on for about 20 mins, which is intense, but i really wanted to kill the Mf'ers. I used this about 2-3 times total in the very begining. It is very drying heads up. It's also not totally FA safe in ingredients, so don't rely too heavily on this one, but it will give the FA a big kick due to the ketaconozole) https://www.amazon.com/Nizoral-Anti-Dandruff-Shampoo-Ketoconazole-Dandruff/dp/B00AINMFAC \n* MY HOLY GRAIL MASK I USED DAILY AND WOULD MARRY IF I COULD: DE LA CRUZ SULFUR!!!!! I wore the masks for 10 mins to start then upped it to 30-60 mins. Don't waste your money buying some 30$ spot treatment from an esthy which is a marked up and worse version.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WP6KK7B?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details\n\n* Face washes that I used: Cetaphil Foaming Cleanser: https://www.amazon.com/Gentle-Foaming-Cleanser-Pack-Fragrance/dp/B077FJJDVD/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1UCOL7Q6RRLFT&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.cxMRnJFjMDE-9MbJX5M42iXhjLASy_X6zZcSDyQa3HFzNO_BQsyX39dt4pPApcNQdcV0usGUPRl1C1yyMOUaQHOJt6w4DjIqh2e0YbBRE-U8tXBYoIHMZKySexP84LzZDkPF2dS7zTspK2WQpwm2OUYQW1oCjcMGTv7-Afq3IJMhFUm3UkyCZKAUIx9wfdRV9iN4vgVT8FX2c_A8oTxvWGzznjXQhrgpq63acG_OMqG3stH_kQBZrqy4U21izZlsKTGsPCcfedHbz_h50auO3lvfWYQ9Ax55X9iSmHpe_1g.t3XYnyIxSEeYJp0_OgOxo-YGlY1Az9VVmcfASGRwLdk&dib_tag=se&keywords=cetaphil+foaming+facial+cleanser&qid=1723819503&s=beauty&sprefix=cetaphil+foaming+facial+cleanser%2Cbeauty%2C86&sr=1-2 \n\n--> OR go the Malezia route, I really enjoy their stuff. Sacylic acid cleanser + caprylic acid cleanser alternating days, followed by a hyaluronic acid cleanser: https://malezia.com/pages/regimen-guide \n\n*I used stridex saylic acid pads sometimes AFTER the BP or randomly during the day if I felt anxious and like I wanted to do something. It I watched my skin for irritation, so just be careful. https://www.amazon.com/Stridex-Strength-Medicated-Maximum-Count/dp/B000O1KP1O/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2VLASQO6AL63K&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ZwT5w7Gg9tdnB5UZat90YMHqZVwbK2dqCquQ9pLIOlSltxokPs5RC5GEWyDlF1GnvSF6Fz-iaS1MPmZPn4znN0o9w3krUAMAM-wQeV6hNBItYGKafiGM3SiSvsoPELASjiIAAY55DEwKWZLBw6I6xwnvIm0xSoEfRB6bxqPTYdg4eGjzrF-BfkpvD6PhWkUAFuLcUE9GQ6nFVWoHIIEEkOKCrnWDWhw-5lslcM0ov_c9WMrgJIUi9Zu8RzHRADNtpuK-GjTX3hzc_BdL3Mr9Fv4yjQtN3XrfUnLDhNuzWcY.jFqXPKzHJO99h4K02ZVGuo0h-gvw1FynFd1C_1UwFLY&dib_tag=se&keywords=stridex&qid=1723819595&rdc=1&s=beauty&sprefix=stridex%2Cbeauty%2C89&sr=1-1 \n\n* Benzoyl Peroxide: I used acne.org or Malezia brand (which I now prefer). link to Acne.org https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00164FVH6?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details \n* Followed with an FA safe moisturizeer with Urea.

Link to Hado Labo: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I4BUBN8?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details \n* After some time doing basics, I added in an exfoliant (perhaps the only FA safe one I know of before the moisturizer). Paula's choice 8% AHA gel: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00949CO66?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details \n\nTHE SUNSCREENS I USE! \n* HADA LABO UV Perfect Gel SPF50+ 90g (I now use this in the AM as my last step to replace moisturizer) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07M9GYH6Y?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details \n* COTZ Face Prime & Protect Tinted Mineral Sunscreen and Facial Primer Broad Spectrum SPF 40  (A bit drying on face, so use under moisturizer. but its great for days where i want extra coverage or don't want to wear makeup) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0073P01RC?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details \n\nMY CURRENT ROUTINE:\nAM- use a stridex pad or 2 to wipe down my face OR wash face with Malezia Hyaloronic Acid Cleanser\nMalezia Benjoyl peroxide\nHado Labo Sunscreen \nthen apply Makeup \nOR I apply malezia urea moisturizer then COTZ sunscreen if I don't plan on wearing makeup\n\nPM-\nCaprylic Acid Cleanser to wash off makeup\nHyaloronic acid cleanser\nAltreno Tretinoin or if my skin needs some treatment i will instead use Paula's Choice AHA gel followed by urea moisturizer (urea is mildly exfoliating so do not use with tret)\n\nI've built myself to this simplified routine, and I will occassionally add in a sulfur face mask or wash with happy cappy zinc to bolster my FA safe routine and treat anything that pops up. \n\nI also triple check all my ingredients using Sezia, Foliculitis Scout & skinsort\n- https://www.sezia.co/\n- https://folliculitisscout.com/ \n- https://skinsort.com/fungal-acne-checker \n\nI have pictures all through out the entire process, before and after my tret, FA, treatment journey... I wonder how i could share those so you all can see how intense it got. Before this, I had one long 2 year bought of bad acne that i treated with acne.org, but now looking back i realize it was totally moderate fungal acne, whereas this was SEVERE. Before starting tret i had bad skin texture and lots of CC's (but were actually fungal acne not CC's). So this is why my skin actually looks way better now. :) \n\n-----\nTLDR again; i believe the terrible purge is a myth (aka not necessary at all if your skin wasn't severe to start with) and is a result of many tret users having fungal acne and using poorly formulated tret. get rid of all fungal acne triggering products including sunscreen and makeup, get your skin right again and then try tret again if you want using a micro-ionized formula. I have linked my routine and products above. \n",

        "body": "Just want to add to this: For like two years, my forehead and temples kept breaking out, no matter what I tried. So I treated it like fungal acne, and that didn’t help.  They were these tiny closed comedones that just would not go away.  But in the morning, they’d be invisible and by evening, they’d show up again.  My derm said just keep using the tret and Aza.  \n\nThen, one day, I went online to repurchase my leave-in conditioner, and I noticed they updated the ingredients to list out ingredients that make up the “fragrance.”  And I realized it had linalool, limonene, citronell, and geraniol, which are phototoxic ingredients and can cause a rash or bumps in uv light.  In 2023, Biden signed a bill that forces cosmetics makers to list those ingredients instead of just lumping them under “fragrance.”  They are common allergens.  \n\nSo I dropped the leave-in, and my forehead and temple bumps started clearing up immediately.  I switched it out for vanicream free and clear conditioner.  Now, they are gone completely for about a year.  So, if you try treating for fungal acne, and that doesn’t work, maybe consider the fragrant ingredients in your hair and skin products.  The breakouts look just like fungal acne.  There is a list of common contact allergens you can check for in your products:  https://www.cosmeticscare.eu/en/new-allergens/\n\nJust wanted to toss that in there for anyone dealing with anything that looks like fungal acne. And these ingredients do NOT just affect people with sensitive skin or allergies.  They can cause a reaction in anyone if these ingredients come into contact with uv light.",

        "body": "Oh my gosh!!  You’re an angel sister!! I had no idea about fungal acne. I had started Tretinoin and successfully went through the ‘purge’ phase or so I thought. Somewhere along the way I developed a really irritated hairline/brows/bridge of nose. And nothing, nothing at all made it go away. Eventually my whole head was always itchy, flakey, irritated, and no amount of anti dandruff shampoo was helping. I stopped every skincare and haurcare product. A friend suggested Nizoral and it helped but only temporarily. I did a deep dive on the internet and through pure chance came across some products which are formulated for malesezzia and finally had some relief. But I never figured out what triggered the reaction in the first place. Reading your post made me realized that it could have been the Tretinoin that started this all. This makes so much sense.

And since the products are new, they don't know anything about fungal acne, breakouts, comedogenic ingredients, or ingredients that work well with their skin. Which is why the recommended products to use with tret are the ones with very minimal ingredients, so you can easily pinpoint which ingredients are in sync with your skin or not.\n\nWhich is why when people on this sub ask help about their acne, I ask about their products, their routine, how often they use tret and since when have they been using the products. Because there's always a chance, like you said, the products are the ones that cause the breakouts and not the tret itself.",

They usually prescribe you different solutions along with tret.\n\nTret is a “if you can’t figure out who is messing up the house, just have someone clear the house daily and put in new furniture” kinda solution. Can’t have cobwebs(acne) if the place gets rapidly cleaned and turned over daily. \n\n\nYour issue has been the same issue I see on here. You watch a ton of vidros thinking you’re educating yourself, especially since a dermatologist is telling you.\n\nYou don’t realise that derm and everyone else is just actively feeding each other the same bull everyone tells each other on here. \n\nYour main culprit was sandwiching method for tret not working. The core reason for your acne aside of course.\n\nLong story short, actually get an understanding how tret works(why does it stop acne, why does it make your skin dry, how can irritation get worse, thus, what would be the ways to stop it, etc), \n\nthen review how sandwiching is supposed to work(if my skin gets dry because of X[hint, tret isn’t drying your skin the moment it is in contact with it], then can moisturizing it at the same time work? What about the fact that the cream had to pass clinical trials for them to be able to sell it, those trials proving the drug gets into your skin at the right rate, how does the moisturizer affect this, especially since you’re likely just using a random one they never tested it with, especially when you aren’t even measuring the moisturizer, etc)\n\n\nAnother hint? Many of the derms that speak about sandwiching and tret DO NOT HAVE ACNE PROBLEMS. They use tret for anti-aging. You can get those results long term on any strength of tretinoin. So what they say works for them? Doesn’t necessarily work for you. You need your skin to rapidly catch up to the right turn over rate so it is pretty much unable to make acne. You are trying to achieve this while getting used to tretinoin so you don’t get way too irritated.\n\nThey? They can go as slow as they want with increasing their turn over rate.",

    "body": "Initial disclaimer: I have zero ties to any of these products. I have spent YEARS and $$$$ attempting to get rid of Tinea Versicolor. Selsun, pills, anti-fungal creams-- you name it, I've done it. I developed the infection as a by-product of intensive beach volleyball training between the ages of 16 and 28. My solution outlined below is the result of years of tinkering.\n\nMy condition: I had diagnosed TV all over my back and chest to the point where the entirety of my chest and back skin was one large block of light-colored, flaky, TV. It worked its way up my neck and down my arms to my wrists and also down to my groin. It embedded itself on the entirety of my scalp, hidden by my hair, and caused terrible flaking and itchiness. It was BAD. I recently stumbled on the solution and am putting it here for the internet to know. Feel free to spread and share or ask questions. I am not a doctor.\n\nPrecursors: Be prepared to spend $200-$300 to rid yourself of this completely. A smaller instance may be solvable with $100-$150. This takes dedication, but I can assure you it is possible without prescriptions. What you save in doctor copays, prescriptions costs, etc will make this a cost savings in the end.\n\nTHE PROCESS--------------------------\n\nStep 1: You must shower a minimum of once per day, you can NEVER miss a day - Shower at the same time each day, and set aside 20 minutes for this required \"ritual\".\n\nStep 2: Wet you hair & skin and then turn the showerhead away from you. Lather into your hair any (generic is OK) anti-dandruff shampoo containing zinc pyrithione. Do not allow this to drip down your forehead as it will need to stay on your scalp here until you reach the rinse (step 5) and you do not want it getting in your eyes. This step is first and necessary because it is the only way to treat your scalp which can harbor TV and allow it to come back even when your skin appears clear.\n\nStep 3: Using a 10% sulfur soap bar, and a maximum strength neem oil soap bar (two separate bars, source wherever you want to) lather your entire body (focusing on affected areas) in soap. Don't forget your neck, and lower face. NOTE: the shower is NOT rinsing your skin right now. You are adding soap to the skin and letting it sit there. NOTE2: sometimes the sulfur soap bar will develop one sandpaper-like side. Use the smooth side, don't destroy your skin.\n\nStep 4: Wait 3 minutes. This feels like an eternity. It isn't. I promise.\n\nStep 5: Rinse completely. Do NOT use conditioner. Do NOT use any other soaps. Step's 2 & 3 strip your skin and prepare it for Step 7.\n\nStep 6: Once you are done rinsing, dry yourself completely... COMPLETELY. (During weeks 1-4 you can NEVER reuse a towel-- one towel per day. It hurts but its the truth, believe me... towels are vectors for reinfection).\n\nStep 7: This is the only product placement here. I do not have any connection with this product, but for better or for worse its the only one that works. Get yourself a 4oz for minimal infection, 8oz for bad infection, 2x8oz was needed to completely clear me up. On Etsy, search for \"Tinea Versicolor treatment\" made by the vendor \"PurePresence\". Mist yourself (a roommate/partner will have to help with your back) on affected areas (light misting OK) and let dry before putting on a shirt. No lotion allowed for weeks 1-4 (your skin will be dry, this is unavoidable but NOWHERE near as dry as with Selsun or prescriptions).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNOTE ON HAIR & GENERAL DRYNESS: Your hair will be dry in the first few weeks. My best guess is that this is due to modern reliance on conditioner. It will pass. Keep your water consumption up and your hair will find a way in the new conditions to be OK.\n\nNOTE ON DIET: I have not had to adjust my diet for this, although I'm sure it would help to eat more \"cleanly\" if you wanted to.\n\nComplete this process for 8-10 weeks until you run out of the spray. I would recommend continuing to wash with these soap bars 4 weeks after the infection is gone. I will likely wash with these bars for 12 months as they are cheaper than the spray and therefore a cheaper maintenance solution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am now over a month completely free of TV for the first time in over a decade (2023 update: I am 3+ years TV free, still using both soap bars when I shower). This process is slow and difficult but I promise that it is better than second-degree burns from Selsun or liver damage from pills. Also, prescriptions like Ketoconazole are far too expensive and only treat small areas. Feel free to ask questions or DM with questions. Best of luck to you!",

I didn’t suffer at all through this process. This is what I personally did and it is of course hard to say what helped and what was unnecessary and overkill in the process, but this is my journey to get rid of it.\r  \n\r  \nFirst of all, a bit of a background: I am 34 years old, white male with a somewhat drier skin. I live in NYC but grew up in Scandinavia. I am relatively fit and work out 4-5 days a week at the gym. My dad has pretty severe psoriasis, so my first instinct when I saw the tinea versicolor on me was that I got psoriasis. I saw those red little bumps on my stomach first, and then it started to flare up on my back. I wish I had a photo of it, but my lower, mid and upper back / shoulders was covered. It was pretty bad but it didn’t itch or hurt at all. I just didn’t like the look of it. \r  \n\r  \nI went on a vacation to Puerto Rico for a week where I was exposed to the sun and humid weather. I got a tan, but the areas with the tinea versicolor didn’t get tanned, and this is when I finally went to the dermatologist to understand what it was. The dermatologist prescribed me itraconazole that I took for 7 days. I also got the 2% Ketoconazole shampoo to lather my body with every day plus the Ketoconazole cream to use twice a day. \r  \n\r  \nI followed all these steps every single day, which honestly wasn’t hard for me at all. Taking the pill in the morning right after breakfast. Taking a shower and put this shampoo on my body and let it sit for 5 minutes wasn’t hard. Putting the creme on wasn’t hard either, it’s just something that needed to be done (trust this process). Along with this, I ate very healthy and tried to avoid alcohol and junk and processed food. To be honest, I don’t know if this matters, but remember that TV is a fungus, so it would make sense to eat clean and avoid sugar and carbs to kill the fungus. I also think that eating healthy and drinking plenty of water is great for your overall health, so it won’t hurt to do this so your body can repair itself properly. \r  \n\r  \nSecondly what I did was to wear clean clothes every day. I think this should be common sense even when we are not exposed to TV. I am fortunate to have a washer and drier in my apartment, so I also made sure that I washed my towels and only used my towel once before wash. This might be a bit overkill, but I thought why not. Lastly, the bedding!! Remember that we sleep 8 hours every night, so sleeping in clean sheets won’t hurt. I changed mine twice a week, just to be on the safe side. I would personally recommend changing your sheets at least once a week. I also got a horsehair mattress which is extremely breathable and all natural with only horsehair, cotton and wool. \r  \n\r  \nThis was something I’ve been wanting for a very long time, so I pulled the trigger during this time. They are unfortunately quite pricey, but I got a very good help from a gentleman here in NYC to figure this out. I learned that sleeping on latex and foam is extremely toxic for our skin and it traps heat which again makes the TV flare and grow.\r  \n\r  \nAfter 6 weeks, the TV was completely gone and it hasn’t returned since (6 months now). I was in Miami a few weeks ago for 2 weeks and got a tan and the TV didn’t show up at all. I still try to eat healthy 90% of the time and still change my sheets and wear clean clothes and shower every day etc. I don’t know if that helps to keep it away, but this is part of my daily routine anyway.\r  \n\r  \nAgain, I just wanted to share my story since I was able to get rid of it pretty quickly. I was worried that I was going to have to struggle with this for months and months. Fingers crossed that I won’t come back. I will keep you all posted if it does.",

        "body": "Just wanted to leave a comment here that I bought the spray this user mentioned and it was the first thing I've used that has worked for my tinnea! \n\nSome backstory, I've had tinnea bad for the past 3 years (before that I had it on and off for maybe 6 years) mainly by my sternum down my stomach just past my belly button. Also on my back and it has spread pretty badly in patches all over. I've had almost every pill and cream for it and nothing the doctor has prescribed has helped. I've used the spray for 9 days while I've been on a tropical vacation and I was prepared for the skin to not tan. After the second day of spraying 3 times a day I noticed peeling in the spots I was spraying (mainly on my stomach). On the fifth day of vacation I noticed in spots where I was highly concentrating the spray my skin was quite red. Keep in mind I've been in the sun tanning and I've been applying 60spf to the areas without tinnea and 15-30spf with tinnea.   \n\n\nNow I am back from my vacation and the tinnea on my stomach officially tanned however it is still not as dark as the rest of my skin. I am fair skinned but I do tan so I know the tinnea is getting killed off as the tinnea spots are darker than my skin not shown to the sun.   \n\n\nSome tips I wish I did: the areas of tinnea that are almost matching the rest of my skin I sprayed a lot in those areas and then rubbed into others so make sure you concentrate on each spot. I should have had someone spray my back because my stomach looks better but my back doesn't. Also, if you are spraying after being in the sun it will burn as the skin there is quite tender since it hasnt had sun in almost 6 years. Also I did not do the other tips this user recommended I simply just used the spray.  \n\n\nOverall, it was expensive to buy (about $130 CAD) but I would HIGHLY recommend trying because nothing has helped.",

You will have to fight this for the rest of your life to keep spot free.  That's just reality.  Nobody's body is suddenly producing the protein that fights these spores.  Just so we're clear, getting rid of the spots is not being \"cured\".\n\nOne thing the OP didn't really emphasis - clean cloths and bedding are very important.

Before everything, i want you to know that everything on this post is based on MY experience and what my derma told me on what to do in MY situtation. I suggest that you go to a derma first before you start to copy my routine so that a medical professional can tell you every detail that you need to know or want to know about YOUR situation.\n\n\nPS. Since i can't edit this post (i don't know why), i will just put a comment below that i will edit and update as i go if i forget to include anything. I suggest you upvote it so that it will be the first comment to show up so that fellow redditors can easily see it for convenience. A good chunk of the details in this post are actually from my comment on my previous post but did not gain any traction so it was buried deep within other comments.\n\n\n\nWarning: Long Post Ahead.\n\n\n\n\nMy Complete Routine:\n\n[Dosage] [Generic Name] [Brand Name] - [X Per Day] - [Monthly Cost]\n\n\n1mg ORAL Finasteride Propecia - Once a day - 2475 Pesos\n\n\n5mg ORAL Minoxidil Loxidil - Once a day - 510 Pesos\n\n\n6% TOPICAL Minoxidil Imixia - Once in the evening - 1500 Pesos\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionals:\n\n1% Ketoconazole Nizoral Shampoo - 3 times a week - 1400 Pesos\n\n\nHawthorne Thickening Shampoo - 4 times a week - 850 Pesos\n\n\n\n\n\nQ & A:\n\nWhat is my race/nationality? Im an Asian/Filipino.\n\n\nHow old am i? 24 years old\n\n\nWhy not shave it bald instead? I did, for about half a year. Which made me avoid looking at myself in the mirror because of how bad i looked until i said \"fuck it\" and went to a derma when i had the money for it because that time it was exactly when i was fortunate enough to get a better paying job which made me able to afford the meds/routine.\n\n\nAny side effects from Finasteride? None at all\n\n\nAny side effects from Minoxidil? Just an increased thickness of hair all over my body which I don't mind\n\n\nDo i intend to mislead others because I didn't put Topical Minoxidil in the title of my last post? No\n\n\nWhy did i not put Topical Minoxidil in the title of my last post? I didn't put it in the title because the title says 13 months. I only started using topical Minoxidil at my 6th month, hence, it's not the bread and butter of my routine. And embarrassingly, i sometimes forget to use it.\n\n\nHow much is the total monthly cost of my routine? 6735 Pesos\n\n\nDo i derma-roll? No\n\n\nDo i use micro-needling? Yes, for 3 months but i got lazy and stopped doing it\n\n\nWhere do i get my Oral Finasteride? I buy them at Mercury Drugstore which requires you to have a prescription. But if you don't have a prescription, you can instead buy at TGP (The Generics Pharmacy)\n\n\nWhere do i get my Oral Minoxidil? I buy them directly from my dermatologist\n\n\nWhere do i get my Topical Minoxidil? I buy them directly from my derma. But you can also buy it from Mercury Drugstore or Watson's Pharmacy\n\n\nWhere do i get my Nizoral Shampoo? I buy it from Amazon US\n\n\nWhere do i get my Hawthorne Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner? I buy it from Amazon US\n\n\nWhen did i started seeing results? On my 3rd month\n\n\nDo i have shedding previously? Yes, i shed atleast every 4-5 months. The early sheddings were really bad, compared to now that it's not that bad and i immediately recover.\n\n\nWhat would happen if i stopped using meds? Hair will probably go back to how it was before i started the routine.\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Why don't i tell all of you where my derma is? Am i gatekeeping? Kinda, in a way, yes. Although i am willing to recommend you to my derma, i am only doing it thru DMs after i ask you what part of the Philippines are you in and if you are near my derma, because you have to understand that the clinic that i go to is not that big. I actually sometimes have to wait for a week just to get my supply of Oral Minoxidil because it's out of stock. So imagine how much longer i would wait just to get my meds if i tell all of you where my derma is.\n\n\nAlso, the derma i go to is not the only derma that supplies oral Minoxidil in the Philippines. And I'm pretty sure that if you are not near the derma i go to then it's better for you to find one that's near to you since a derma being able to examine you personally and upclose is much better and more convenient.\n\n\nSo, if you wanna know the exact derma i go to, then just DM me what part of the Philippines are you in and I'll tell you if you are near.",

It was prescribed by my derma when i had a bad shedding on my 6th month, to try to atleast help ease out on the shedding, which it did.\n\n\nWhy is my routine so cheap? It is cheap if you convert my cost into USD and you are living in a first world country. In my case, living in a third world country, if i was a minimum wage worker, my routine would eat more than half of my monthly salary. And then i have to budget for food, water, electricity, transportation, etc on what's left of my monthly salary, which is very impossible to do.",

    "body": "Foreword: I'm making this post because I commented in a thread a while ago about how I had low-grade, super stubborn fungal acne for a long time and a lot of users replied that they may have it as well (based on symptoms) and it never before occurred to them that it was a fungal, and not bacterial, infection. So, I'm trying to include as much info as possible to help people that may be in the situation that I was before. I apologize in advance that I don't have before and after pics, but I'll link to a blog that does. Please let me know if I've forgotten anything or made any mistakes, and feel free to share your fungal acne stories!\n\nObviously I'm not a doctor so if your symptoms are getting worse or you're in pain or you have anything else that should be sending you to the doctor JUST GET OFF THE INTERNET AND GO TO THE DOCTOR\n\nFirst of all, having fungus on your skin is totally normal (as gross as it sounds) as it is part of the natural flora of your skin composition. The most common type of skin fungus is of course yeast, and as you know (since I think this sub is mainly women) when it grows out of control it can cause a yeast infection, typically in the vagina, where it is warm and moist. The type of fungus that most commonly results in acne-like pustules on your skin is called *Malassezia* and the resulting infection is known as *Pityrosporum folliculitis*. \n\nThe reason why we get yeast infections is because there is not enough \"good\" bacteria present to use up the resources that both bacteria and yeast utilize, so when yeast out-competes \"good\" bacteria, it takes over and wreaks havoc ranging from low-grade irritation all the way to something as severe as seborrheic dermatitis. Other fungal infections you may be familiar with include athletes foot/jock itch, ringworm and tinea versicolor.  \n\n**How can you tell if you have it?**\n\nIf you're willing to go to the doctor/derm, there are tests they can run using live cultures generated from your skin swab. This is the most sure-fire way to get a diagnosis as well as potent prescription anti-fungals. \n\nIf you are an armchair physician like me and don't care about experimenting with OTC creams on your face, you can grab some at-home treatments (listed below) to see if your skin improves.\n\n**Some of the associated symptoms with *Malassezia* overgrowth include:**\n\n* Small pimple-like bumps that have small whiteheads which small amounts of pus will come out of (AFAIK cystic acne is less common but still possible with this type of infection). They typically occur in your T-zone but can appear on cheeks as well and are usually clustered together and around follicles. i.e. it's damn hard to differentiate it between regular acne, and the differences are quite subtle.\n* Rash/pain/tenderness/itching/burning sensation - can lead to seborrheic dermatitis - these are some symptoms that should be sending you to the doctor anyway.\n* Redness\n* Closed comedomes that don't turn into open comedomes and will just crust over if you pick at them.\n* Pimples that don't respond to traditional acne treatment i.e. benzoyl peroxide, and take a long time to disappear.\n\n**What not to use if you suspect fungal acne**\n\nMalassezia and other strains of fungus typically [feed on oils with a fatty acid chain length of 11-24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1198797/pdf/biochemj00724-0062.pdf). This is also why fungal acne often appears in areas where sebum production is higher than other parts of the body. So, obviously avoid using oils that are in this range - [here is a somewhat reliable chart (the URL kinda sketches me out but it seems accurate, but do some more digging if you're not convinced)](http://www.scientificpsychic.com/fitness/fattyacids.html). FWIW coconut oil has a very long chain length and is considered safe for fungus treatment. \n\nEdit: From /u/SnailsonAcid It helps to look up images of the chemical structures of the ingredients in potential products, and counting the number of carbons in a carbon chain. For example, if an ingredient has a carbon chain length of 7, the chemical structure will have something that looks like this VVV. Skin prone to fungal infections have sebum deficient in ceramides. I can't use most bb creams as they often have ingredients with long carbon chains, but have had some success with Liole triple the solution.\n\nAnother thing to avoid is creating an extremely moist environment on your face (which I know goes against everything this sub stands for, but if you want to get rid of fungus you're going to have to be a bit drier than normal for at least a month). This means no occlusives, mainly. You can use a hydrating toner before treatments, but **avoid toners/essences with ferments in them**. Even though it's a ferment filtrate, it can still activate specific receptors on yeast cells that will trigger the growth of more yeast.\n\nAvoid anything containing any types of sugars since yeast eats sugar. I know honey is a potent anti-microbial but I think the amount of sugar in it would negate those effects. \n\nAntibiotics will also increase your risk of getting fungal acne. I strongly believe these are what caused my bout of fungal acne, but sometimes they are an unavoidable part of life. Just be wary that if you do have to take antibiotics, future fungal infections are more likely. \n\n**What to rub all over your face when you have fungal acne**\n\n(obviously **patch test** these things if you haven't used them before because they can induce an allergic reaction or worse. Also, a lot of this is anecdotal and worked for me during my struggle with fungal acne so obviously YMMV.) These are all OTC.\n\n* Aloe (science doesn't know why, but somehow aloe breaks down the protective biofilm of fungus)\n* Plain yoghurt (use as a wash-off mask)\n* Turmeric\n* Zinc (I used The Ordinary niacinamide + zinc, niacinamide won't trigger fungal growth AFAIK. Anything containing zinc is usually good, but check for other fungal triggers in the product)\n* Tea tree oil (general antimicrobial, dilute in a carrier oil)\n* Diluted apple cider vinegar (yeast doesn't do well in an acidic environment, they prefer pH 4-8)\n* Sulphur (I used a zinc/sulphur soap on my face alternately with ketoconazole wash)\n* Ketoconazole (a.k.a. Nizoral shampoo)\n* Clotrimazole 1%\n* Tolnaftate 1%\n* Salicylic acid \n* Tretinoin (I used Maxipeel 0.025%)\n\nEdit: from /u/SnailsonAcid\n\n* albolene (non-AB)\n* BR P50\n* shark sauce (contains ferment)\n* snowbang\n* Benton snail bee high content skin\n* eltamd am\n\nFrom /u/microcosmologies\n\n* Head and Shoulders shampoo as a face wash\n\nFrom /u/faerygrrrl22 \n\n* Neem and MCT oil\n\nFrom /u/sadstarfish\n\n* 50mg doxycycline (antibiotic) 2x a day for 6 months - prescribed first by my Curology derm, then my GP\n* Curology - 1% clindamycin, 8% Azelaic Acid, 1% Zinc pyrithione (started on the basic 4/1/4 formula and changed to this)\n* 8 week course of Fluconazole (anti-fungal pills, prescribed by my Curology derm) - not sure if this did anything bc I started it around the same time as the tret, but my acne hasn't come back since I finished the course, even when I didn't use tretinoin or any other acne treatments for a week while traveling\n\nI'll keep updating the list if you all think of other things that worked for you. I also use Selsun Blue alternately with Head and Shoulders as regular shampoos to make sure the yeast infection isn't spreading to my scalp and hanging out there, only to re-infect my face. \n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is to make sure you wash your towels and pillowcases regularly so you don't give the fungus another place to live. Drying your clothing in a dryer on \"high\" and disinfecting as much of your skin care bottles and tools with alcohol is also another way to help prevent re-infection.\n\nHere's a link to a blog where a woman had a pervasive and relatively severe fungal acne infection, she has some before pictures that are similar to what I had (although mine didn't get quite that bad). http://longhairedatheart.blogspot.ca/2013/11/yeast-had-caused-my-bad-skin.html",

        "body": "This was me just this past September. Mine started on my jawline and temples then moved to my neck, chest and upper back. I don't have terribly reactive or acne-prone skin so it was weird to see (especially my neck). The itchiness was my tip off that something was up and different from the pimples I've had before. I sort of diagnosed myself but did see my derm who wasn't positive what it was and when I told him my suspicion he agreed it could be. He gave me a script for Diflucan and said to keep up with everything I was trying. \nI did quite a bit of research, more than I would have had I not gotten involved in this sub (Thank You!!!) which sparked a desire for knowledge of ingredients and such. I found quite a lot on the internet that I didn't really understand but was able to piece some stuff together & just started trying different products/ingredients. \nHead & Shoulders, Selsun Blue & Nizoral: the H&S seemed to work the best for me. I tried them all on my face but also switched using them as body washes. I switched them up because I read the yeast can build a tolerance to things. \n\nSulphur: I found a bar soap, Sal 3, and also a mask (Dr. Gross Collidal Sulpur). Both of these I still use & they work great! (I think the soap has some salicylic acid in it too)\n\nNeem oil & MCT oil: both of these do not have long chains. What I found suggested staying away from all oils that had long chains which includes coconut oil & tea tree oil. The yeast feeds on it as well as fatty alcohol. I still use a diy mixture of these two as my oil cleanser and sometimes I use a few drops towards the end of my routine if my skin is feeling dry. The smell of neem is very strong and very earthy. I'm used to it now but I had to start with a tiny bit mixed with the MCT and just build up to more. I love these and have a hard time seeing myself not using them. \n\nSalicylic acid: great product that I believe helped quite a bit too. I ended up trying a product of my bf and saw a difference. Bought some for myself to put in a spray bottle for my chest & upper back. That's when those little bastards finally started going away!\n\nOnce I realized it was starting to subside I slowly introduced different products back in, partly to see if I would have a flair up and partly because I desperately needed hydration in my skin! So much of the above is quite drying, which really is what I was going for! Dry out the \"food\" for the yeast and get it back to a normal level. I'm still playing around with actives in my routine because of the over-drying I did. If I use them too often I seem to get extra dry & flaky. I did recently see someone post about buffering actives & that is definitely helping.",

I'm not sure if it was a combination of things, one particular thing, or if it was just mere coincidence, but here's what I did (in chronological order):  \n\n- 50mg doxycycline (antibiotic) 2x a day for 6 months - prescribed first by my Curology derm, then my GP  \n- Curology - 1% clindamycin, 8% Azelaic Acid, **1% Zinc pyrithione** (started on the basic 4/1/4 formula and changed to this)  \n- Head & Shoulders Shampoo (**1% zinc pyrithione**) & Nizoral Shampoo (**1% Ketoconazole**) alternating, follow with regular 2nd cleanser - also use on scalp & hairline in the shower. Do not underestimate these guys - they are actually kind of lovely, non-drying cleansers for the face XD    \n- Deciem The Ordinary 10% Niacinamide, **1% Zinc PCA**  \n- **Tretoin 0.025%** Cream 4x a week (prescribed by my GP) - I believe this was doing the bulk of the work as I started to see drastic improvement immediately  \n- 8 week course of Fluconazole (anti-fungal pills, prescribed by my Curology derm) - not sure if this did anything bc I started it around the same time as the tret, but my acne hasn't come back since I finished the course, even when I didn't use tretinoin or any other acne treatments for a week while traveling  \n\nAnother important thing was that I stopped using all other acne treatments, masks, and sheet masks during this time, aside from the occasional use of a pink powder (sulphur) spot treatment for particularly bad breakouts. My derm recommended I stay away from otc treatments like salicylic acid, retinol, etc. because they may cause more irritation than improvement, which turned out to be the case for me. I cut down to a very minimal routine, aside from the listed above - Re:cipe Slowganic Cleanser > Thayer's Toner > Cerave PM > Cosrx Aloe sunscreen. No oil cleanser, just micellar water to remove makeup. I've also been avoiding oils and alcohol like the plague, as this can aggravate or \"feed\" fungal acne. I've also tried Noble Soap, which was recommended by my Curology derm, but it broke me out in cc's so didn't work for me. I much prefer Head & Shoulders & Nizoral for this.    \n\nAnother important thing that has really been a game changer is to **tie your hair while you sleep** (I do a top bun bc it's more comfortable) - this minimizes the oils from your hair getting on your face during the night, and of course changing/flipping your pillowcases often is important too. This has really helped clear/prevent breakouts on the sides of my face.    \n\nHope this is helpful to somebody!",

        "body": "Thank you for this post! Sometimes I feel so alone when it comes to fungal acne.  I've been dealing with severely dehydrated skin for 9 months now.  My damaged moisture barrier has resulted in me experiencing fungal acne for 4 months now. I find that Nizoral shampoo along with an anti-jock cream like canesten has really helped when I get flare ups, but I don't want to have to rely on these for the rest of my life.  I've also read that resistance can be built up against the active ingredient which would be Ketoconazole and that's worrying to me.\n\nI'm trying to repair my damaged moisture barrier, but I'm really not having luck.  Like you said, ceramides are deficient in the sebum when you're prone to fungal issues so I'm trying to load up on my ceramides. I currently use clinique ddmg, but my skin dries up so quickly after that.  I recently introduced a hyaluronic acid serum that has ceramides from GOW that contains a preservative \"lactobicillus ferment\".  Does anyone know if this will trigger the fungal acne? \n\nI'm also looking at purchasing Meishoku Ceracolla Perfect Gel and ElsaGusa Ceramide Moist Essence.  Anyone with fungal acne used these products before?  It doesn't look like there's ferment in the ingredients, but I could be wrong.  I'll list the ingredients at the bottom of this comment if anyone wants to take a look. It's incredibly frustrating to have to deal with severely dehydrated skin and fungal acne.  One needs a ton of moisture to resolve it and the other one wants none of it.  I have no idea how to approach my problem.  I'm only 23, but my pores look incredibly massive, I have deep wrinkles on my forehead and under my eyes, my skin gets tight and feels like paper immediately after moisturizing, and itches like crazy all due to my dehydration.  Not to mention, I have regular acne as well to deal with. \n\nI would more than appreciate any advice or words of comfort.

However, we ran into some problems after her first grooming appointment.\nWhen she was six months old, we took her to the groomer for the first time. I explicitly told the groomer not to cut her hair in any way, shape, or form. Despite this, when I picked her up, my heart sank. Her hair had been significantly cut. I was devastated by the damage and nearly confronted the groomer on the spot. It was such a disappointing and emotional experience...\nA few weeks later, we noticed her hair wasn't growing back.\nIn fact, it seemed to be getting worse. She started developing bald spots around her body, so we took her to the vet about a month later. After testing, the vet diagnosed her with a staph skin infection, likely from the grooming session. The groomer had also used Furminator deshedding products, which I suspect were too harsh for her delicate skin and coat.\nThe vet prescribed a month-long course of antibiotics and a ketoconazole-chlorhexidine wash every other day for 10 days. While the infection cleared up, her coat didn't recover.\nFast forward to today (about six months later): her hair has continued to deteriorate. The texture has completely changed, it now feels dry and cottony, almost like sheep's wool. Her chest area is noticeably balding, and her skin looks dry and scaly. I've been doing everything I can to support her hair regrowth. I started cooking for her and giving her supplements to encourage healthy skin and coat, including fish oil and melatonin 2.5mg every night (which she's been on for two months with no noticeable improvement). I recently purchased the Pomeranian Beauty hair care products and would love to hear your thoughts—has anyone used them? Do they work?\nHere's the homemade recipe l've been feeding her. \n\nPlease let me know if you think it needs modifications:\n• Turkey breast: 400 g \n• Beef liver: 60 g\n• Cooked quinoa: 185 g \n• Veggie blend (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots): 120 g \n• Pumpkin (cooked or pureed): 30 g\n• Shiitake mushrooms (cooked): 10 g\n• Oyster mushrooms (cooked): 10 g\n• Bone marrow: 20-25 g \n• Eggs: 2 large, boiled (~100 g) \n• Plain unsweetened yogurt: 60 g \n• Fish oil: 15g\n• Ginger fiber: 1-2 g\n• Native Pet multivitamin: 0.85 g per day\n\nI'm desperate for advice or suggestions on how to help her coat recover. If anyone has experience with similar issues or recommendations, please share. I appreciate any input you can give! Below l'm attaching pictures before and after her grooming appointment and what she currently looks like.",

It can damage the top coat and guard hairs that protect your pom from UV and they can develop alopecia. As the infection was treated 6 months ago, maybe ask the advice of your vets, to see if its this? Googling it showed there could be a few causes for long term hair loss, and there are different treatments depending on what the cause is.",

Then their solution is to keep them short when they look patchy then act all confused when bald spots happen. It happened to my pom Leo too. Melatonin really helped him get most of his coat back. Took about 6 months but it worked great, his skin would always get so dry when he had bald spots.\n\nAlso I home cooked dog food is usually very hard to meet their nutritional needs. I feed Leo fresh food from The Farmer's Dog where they add supplements to it. I would suggest you do a lot more research, to feed them healthy with fresh food you need a rotating menu too.",

I ordered some Salmon Oil and will take it to my vet appt to make sure I get the green light to give it to him.   My puppy did have Giardia when he was younger and I had bought shampoo with Chlorhexidine to kill any parasites on his fur.   My vet told me not to use it often as it will dry out his fur and skin.   I'm wondering since your vet told you to use it every so many days,  if it dried out your babies fur too much??  I've read a lot of people use Dermagic or Dermacton shampoo and lotion for Alopecia and it helps tremendously.   I might try that also after I speak with my vet.  I'm going to try the Dermacton first but I'm in the US, so I'll have to wait a bit for shipping since it's from the UK.  Hopefully it will work and if it doesn't,  I'm not gonna stress about it so long as he's healthy.  He's a tiny little guy at 4.2 oz so he's really gonna look small if he loses his fur. 😖",

It’s a little pricey but it’s absolutely worth it. It does take time to work and not an immediate fix but way healthier than chemicals in my opinion. ❤️",

    "body": "After 3 years I decided to get a hair transplant. I was diagnosed with aga and successfully was able to gain a lot of hair back; through starting birth control, supplementation (Vitamin D, B, prenatal, magnesium, mayo & D-chiro inositol, and beef liver) less processed foods diet and spearmint tea and weight lifting for exercise to help with androgens. I use ketoconazole shampoo, I have had 9 sessions of PRP and now do maintain e sessions 1-2 times a year.  \n\nI tried minoxidil for 2 years, however, I didn’t respond well to it. Decided it wasn’t worth the dandruff and itchy dry scalp for the few hairs it helped me with. I saw a lot of improvement when I started really focusing on my stress levels and getting the negative people out of my life. \nBut I’m still not happy with the one spot near my hairline as well as my corners. So I decided it was just time. My hair is no longer getting worse, because of all the steps I am taking to maintain it, but this is how good it’s gonna get for me. I don’t think there is anything left I can do to try and make it become more dense. \n\nIm tired of trying and people telling me it doesn’t look that bad and I shouldnt get a hair transplant, but to me it does look bad still. I want to wear my hair down the part and I want to put my hair up in a bun without feeling self conscious. I want my self confidence back and I want to feel beautiful. \n\nBut no one in my life supported me when I told them about wanting a hair transplant. My fiancé said I didn’t need it because I’m already beautiful and my family wasn’t very supportive either. They just mentioned costs…but it’s my money so like why would that matter?? I decided to just block out the negativity and do it by myself without telling anyone. \n\nI attached pictures. \n\n\nUnfortunately I was so embarrassed of how my hair looked at its worse I deleted majority of the pictures from 2-3 years ago. So the ones included are growth progress after all my other interventions without surgery and then the last 2 pics is are day 1 after my hair transplant. \n\nHas anyone else decided to just get a hair transplant and weren’t supported? How did you navigate those feelings. Did you end up telling people afterwards or did you just maintain the secret? I don’t live with my fiancé or family so theoretically no one would have to know, but it sucks that something so important to me no one understands. \nAdditionally if anyone else has had a hair transplant at what month did you start seeing the results?

    "body": "Hello everyone I posted back in February of 2024 and wanted to give an update to everyone. \nI started finasteride on September 1st of 2023. I was 23 and I was starting to notice some thinning/ corners receding and my dad is very bald. So naturally I did some research and found finasteride. I started to take it and still do to this day and I am 25 now. I had little success from September- February of 2024. Things were getting worse so I decided to try topical minoxidil and a 1.5 mm dermaroller. I started those in March and then quickly saw results as you can see. I continued the regimen of minoxidil at night every day, derma about every week or so and finasteride every day. Things certainly started to look good again. I unfortunately had to take a 3.5 week absence from all treatment due to a surgery in September. I started up again about the 3rd week of September and things still seemed normal. I since then have started to thin again and recede as you can see. I’m assuming that 3.5 week break was probably enough to derail everything and unfortunately back to square one. On top of that my scalp has been dryer / flakey than ever so I was prescribed ketoconazole shampoo by my dermatologist in December. The topical minoxidil seemingly makes it so dry too. So now I’m navigating dry scalp which doesn’t seem to help. I also have now started reservatol plus since I cannot take oral minoxidil due to a heart condition. \n\n\nWould love some thoughts or input on everything. Just wanted to share my experience and I will be continuing finasteride for the time being. Thanks y’all. ",

It might be then that the finasteride doesn’t block enough dht for you. Like just enough to slow it down and then that the minoxidil can cover up the miniaturization of the follicles a bit. I’d highly recommend switching to dut to see how that will hold up for you. You’ll most likely see more shedding when you get on dut. This will be because then there will be enough dht blocked for your hair follicles to stop miniaturizing, allowing them to return in a proper, healthy manner (but unfortunately that does require a shedding period)",

Was also thinking of adding minox but really wanted to figure out the potential of fin only for at least a year. It’s giving me some hope bcs you started in march what is kind of weird to me how fast your hairline came back. I also was messing around with doses. As of today I am on the full 1 mg a day in one single tablet and I had definitely more problems when I cut the 5 mg or 1mg pills, thinking of it may make a difference in terms of absorbing fin faster = more sides when I cut the pills? Could that be possible? Ordering 1mg pills to Austria is pretty expensive. Anyways, thanks for your good documented progress and all the best bro!",

I would just like to remind anyone who'd read this: there're two main types of scalp flakiness:\n\n- the seborrheic dermatitis type: due to fungal infection, associated with oily scalp and dandruff-like flakes.\n\n- the psoriasis type: very dry, red (sometimes with thickened and cracking plaques) and itchy scalp with psoriasis-like flakes\n\nWhat helps one can worsen the other. Do not use drying shampoos nor ketoconazole (or other anti-fungal) on psoriasis type.",

My scalp began to clear up within a day or two.  I couldn't keep up with drinking the oil, so I bought the tablets with the highest mg count I could find:  1400.  I take four of those per day and I am so pleased with the improvement.  It is not as dramatic as it was when I drank the oil - I guess I was able to get more of it into my system that way, but I'm pleased enough.  Maybe I'll work my way up to six or more tablets and see if I can duplicate those original results.\n\nSeriously, this works better than anything prescribed by dermatologists.

Some of the common signs are itchiness and inflammation but they are not usually painful. Some individuals do not experience itchiness. That heavily depends on your skin and how your immune system reacts to yeast overgrowth. \r  \n\r  \n“Fungal nail conditions are notoriously hard to treat. Is fungal acne the same?”\r  \nNot really. Once you know you have fungal acne the treatment is fairly easy. An antidandruff shampoo with antifungals such as ketoconazole or zinc pyrithione usually works in getting rid of the fungal breakouts. The only problem is that the antidandruff shampoo treatment tends to be quite drying on the skin, especially if you are trying to treat fungal acne on the face. That is why it is recommended to use a fungal acne-safe skincare.\r  \n\r  \n“Doxycycline was a miracle treatment for me and OTC options.” \r  \n \r  \nDoxycycline is an antibiotic used to treat acne vulgaris, commonly known as topical acne. It will not treat fungal acne, it might actually make it worse. Sadly, there are no substitutions that could be found OTC, at least not in America. The best OTC treatment that might help will be sulfur or tea tree oil. However, the effectiveness of the treatment might be reduced since you will be changing from an oral medication to an over-the-counter topical treatment.  \r  \n\r  \n“Does candida albicans play a role in fungal acne?” \r  \n\r  \nWhen we talk about fungal acne we are talking about a folliculitis (a hair follicle infection) caused by the yeast Malassezia. This tends to look similar to topical acne, hence the name. On the other hand, a candida infection, rather than acne-like bumps, looks more like a rash which can include blisters. We call a candida infection on the skin “cutaneos candidiasis”. Although candida can also be found within the skin microbiome, when we talk about fungal acne or pityrosporum folliculitis we refer to those pimples and breakouts that look like acne but no acne treatment can seem to help, which are caused by an overgrowth of Malassezia. \r  \n\r  \n“What is fungal acne? Is it a ploy of skincare brands to sell more products?”\r  \n\r  \nPityrosporum folliculitis, commonly known as fungal acne, is a yeast infection caused by a yeast called Malassezia. It commonly appears as small clusters of pimples and bumps on the face, chest, and back. Is it a real thing? Sadly, yes and ironically the increment in cases have been attributed to the excessive utilization of ingredients containing fatty acids. \r  \n",

I currently have my back and chest under control by using a sulfur soap daily in the shower, and occasional mandelic acid or zinc pyrithione masks, but these are too harsh for my face. I am trying to protect my skin barrier and avoid these products, so my question is is it better to use an antifungal cream that has unsafe ingredients in it or to only use a FA trigger free routine? My derm gave me ciclopirox olamine but it has some triggers in it. The rest of my products are FA safe.",

My skin has always been clear and I was prescribed Diflucan 1x a week for 4 weeks (I’ve done it for 6 weeks actually because I had extra refills and after 1 it helps but by the next time the flare ups come back). Planning to go back to the derm but this time in person. What other treatment do you know of? Not necessarily holidtic or natural, because I’ve tried them too. Also, Nizoral just made my skin barrier go haywire. I had to rebalance for like 2 weeks after that. \n\nI use Azelaic Acid at night and niacinamide with 2% zinc in the am after cleansing with happy cappy ( works pretty well). I use “La Theorie” gel moisturizer and this does not trigger my flare ups. I also use ketoconazole that was prescribed. However if I have a sweet or pastry or a drink…the next few days there’s a flare up 🥲. I was wondering what other treatments have people done or do you know of? Oral or invasive treatments? I’m willing to undergo anything at this point. I’ve switched out all stuff that goes on my face but I have expensive makeup I wanna wear again 🥲",

This one is over the counter, and admittedly a little pricey (at 15$) but I’ve been using it for about 6 months now and I’m barely losing any hair in the shower! From the first moment I tried it I noticed I lost significantly less hair from my wash! It’s my holy grail and I had to share! Unfortunately they don’t have a conditioner but I don’t think that’s a deal breaker. Let me know if y’all try it! ",

    "body": "I am seeing a lot of posts here about treatment recommendations and products but frankly missing the mark. I want to show some recent studies (2-3 years) that are changing the way we approach the treatment of SebDerm. \n\nFirst thing first, your skin is the largest [organ](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/10978-skin) of your body. (Yes it is an organ, like your kidney, liver and lungs). On that organ lives microorganisms much like the microbiome of your stomach. \n\nSebhorreic Dermatitis (SD) is a type of chronic inflammatory dermatitis that effects at least 50 million Americans, and $300 million are spent on Over-the-Counter products every year (aka you're not alone and this sub should be millions more strong!). \n\nFor the past century, it is thought that Malassezia yeast colonization of the skin surface in lipid-rich areas leads to an inflammatory response due to the secretion of free-fatty-acids (FFA) and lipid peroxides on the skin. Your immune system generates selected cytokines (e.g., interleukins (IL): IL-1, IL-2, L-4, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, TNC-alpha) that stimulates keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. Soon, the skin barrier is disrupted and shows in visible forms like erythema, pruritus, and scaling. Of the 21 species of Malassezia, *Malassezia restricta (M. restricta)* and *Malassezia globosa (M. globosa)*, *M. arunalkei*, *M. sympodialis* are associated with the majority of SDs. \n\nThe type of Malassezia you get is different by geographic location and age, but all that is important here is that the agreed model of pathway for the development of SebDerm is (1) skin instability - > (2) skin becomes less selective for microbial growth -> (3) dysbiosis (worsens abnormal immune response) -> (4) skin barrier disruption -> (5) symptoms. The condition is chronic because steps 1, 2, 3 are cyclical. This means that if we don't address the root cause, Malassezia will continue to colonize and recolonize areas with lipid-secretion  (i.e., your sebaceous glands, which is most abundant on your face and scalp).   \n\nIn short, SebDerm is a chronic inflammation of your biggest organ, and the inflammation is caused by your immune system oversecreting cytokines in a response to the \"poops\" of Malassezia, who happens to love eating fat. However, nobody in the scientific community has ever confidently said \"Malassezia yeasts cause Seb Derm and if we eliminate Malassezia we can cure Seb Derm\", because Malassezia has lived with us harmoniously for as long as humans exist. Instead, scientific literature conservatively say \"treatment should manage to reduce the colonization of Malassezia, then apply medications that regulate sebaceous gland activity, and restore epidermal barrier function\". That is because the etiopathogenesis (the cause and development of a disease of abnormal condition) has *never* been established [Wilkramanayak et al, 2019] (https://europepmc.org/article/med/31310695)\n\nIn recent years, we find an old friend - *Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)*, more specifically, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) - a difficult to treat Gram-positive bacteria that causes severe infections in humans - as one of the precursors to Malassezia overgrowth. \n\nDisclaimer: S. aureus lives in 20-30% of all humans, in healthy humans it doesn't cause harm, and it contributes to things like pimples and cellulitis but nothing of major concern. However, once a person is sick or immunicompromised, those with S. aureus find it harder to fight off infections, have more chances of dying due to pneumonia, toxic shock syndrome, endocarditis, etc. S. *Aureus of any kind is something you don't want, but it's everywhere and gets passed around by skin-contact*. This is why in infection management, hospital scrubs are not supposed to be worn outside of the hospital to prevent the spread of hospital-acquired MRSA among the general population. \n\nWhat is the significance of this exciting finding? This means that we may have found the root cause to SebDerm. Removing S. aureus (where it shouldn't be) may prevent the destabilization of skin barriers and reduce colonization of Malassezia, thereby reducing the skin's inflammation (aka SebDerm).  \n\nThere are many in-vivo, ex-vivo, and prospective observational studies registered and underway to examine the effects of S. aureus on all sorts of dermatitis, including Seb Derm. I mean, how could we have overlooked this important and nasty bacteria which we have known all along to cause all sorts of skin problems? Read last paragraph. \n\nWhat are the implications for treatment of SD in the future? First, corticosteroids will be off the table. (Remember just 100 years ago, what we consider were absurd practices like using cocaine to treat alcoholism, arsenic for syphilis, and smoking for asthma were common place). Second, physicians may resort to examining the skin microbiome, swabbing the skin to detect S. aureus, MRSA, and Malassezia to determine treatment plans. Third, a prescription of antifungal and antibacterial will be used while focusing on restoring epidermal homeostasis. \n\nWhat are some current treatment that works? \nAntibiotics like fluroquinolone antibiotics (e.g., ciproflaxocin), mitronidazole, cefalexin, etc, can kill off S. aureus. Antifungals like ketoconazole (topical), itraconazole (oral), bifonazole (oral), allylamines (terbinafine), the benzylamines (butenafine), and the hydroxypyridones (ciclopirox) have also shown to be affective. More studies are now testing cosmetics containing a combination of ingredients to inhibit S. aureus growth: combination 1: hydroxyacetophenone,phenylpropanol, propanediol, caprylyl glycol, tocopherol), Combination 2: hydroxyacetophenone,phenylpropanol, propanediol, caprylyl glycol, tocopherol, and tetrasodium glutamate diacetate. [Pinto et al, 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-88072-3) \n\nTo all the people who got treated with corticosteroids, your outdated physicians are performing outdated practices. By outdated I mean that if the physician graduated from medical school even just 5 years ago, he/she would not have been equipt with the information dermatologists in training would have now. That is because the research into human microbiome and its effects on skin diseases were restricted by limitations in computational capacities in genetic sequencing and culture-dependent methods. In the last 5 years, non-culture-based studies allow us to study bacteria that were previously culture- dependently (on a plate), and more sophisticated computational techniques allow us to combine and mix-and-match samples to observe the pathogenesis of the microbiome and diseases in a complexity like never before, reducing the effect of heterogeneity of individuals. \n\nTL;DR: The etiopathogenesis of SebDerm has never been formally established, the new working hypothesis in the last 4 years is that Staphylococcus Aureus (and more specifically, MRSA) is the culprit, leading to skin barrier dysfunction and opportunistic colonization of Malassezia yeasts which induces inflammatory responses clinically representing as SD. Treatment guidelines may soon change to exclude corticosteroids and focus on antifungal and antibiotics to rid of S. Aureus; many labs have taken to explore cosmetics and applications of a combinant of ingredients to inhibit bacterial growth after the restoration of skin barrier and modulation of the sebaceous gland to prevent recurrence.

I think this makes as little sense as certain microbes of the malassezia yeast genus being the origin of this disease.  \nIf that were the case then how is it that this disease is not contagious? As you rightly pointed out, these microbes usually are commensal. Essentially wiping out these microbes 24/7 doesn't work, because the overgrowth is a symptom and not the cause.   \nPersonally, I'm leaning more towards either a) the immune system becomes sensitized to a certain kind of microbe, kicking off a vicous cycle or b) genetic barrier defect, that either causes the skin to become inefficient at keeping the microflora in check or the compromised barrier allowing the immune system to get into greater contact with certain microbes than usual.\n\nedit: grammar",

If I follow correctly, the idea is that we used to think SD was caused by a fungus that's prevalent, but only causes this issue in certain people, and now we think it's caused by a bacteria that's sort of prevalent, but only causes this issue in certain people. So we've substituted S. Aureus for Malassezia, but no hypothesis as to why my spouse, who's face is in daily contact with my face and thus is exposed to the same microbiome, doesn't have SD, yet I do.\n\n\\>Third, a prescription of antifungal and antibacterial will be used while focusing on restoring epidermal homeostasis.\n\nSeems to me that the crucial issue is restoring epidermal homeostasis. How is that done? If you wipe out the bacteria, what happens when it returns?",

That also explains why it would have come back.  I kinda agree that it makes sense the immune system is responding to an irritant within the skin.  Sounds also likely this irritant is produced by or promoted by Malassthesia.   \n\nNo matter what you do, Staph/ Malassthesia will recolonize on your skin, as it is basically part of normal skin flora.  This is also probably one of the reasons SD keeps coming back and so hard to treat.\n\nYou’re not actually fighting a bug or fungus, you’re fighting the immune system’s response to it.  The immune response is enhanced by recurrent exposure so this is also one of the reasons it’s so hard to fight.\n\nNizoral is basically Ketoconazole which is also anti inflammatory as well as a mild topical antifungal.  \n\nAnti-inflammatory in this case, is akin to suppressing the localized immune response.\n\nDefinitely keep oils off your skin and keep those areas clean. Steroids can only be used for short periods but makes sense they will work especially for bad flare ups.  I’m not sure what else will help though I’m guessing the sunlight idea is probably one of the best suggestions.",

    "body": "A lot of people seem to have trouble with dandruff and fungal acne that don't improve significantly even with treatment, and I find (like with a lot of skin-related issues) TECHNIQUE counts for a lot more than we realize. So, this is the method that showed results for me, regardless of whether I used Head & Shoulders or Ketoconazole shampoo or whatever. It's the TECHNIQUE 😤 \n\n⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** please, do not use anti-fungal ingredients like ketoconazole without doctor's orders and supervision. Those ingredients are to be used for a specific duration, and you will meed medical guidance to use them safely, or risk anti-fungal resistance, aka it stops working and now that ingredient itself doesn't work for you at all. OR stick to OTC products with ingredients like zinc pyrithione, like Heads and shoulders, etc.\n\n\nSimply washing your scalp or face once with the shampoo will show almost zero improvement in most cases. A \"double cleanse\" is NECESSARY, because the fungus creates a coating, or \"biofilm\", to protect itself and stay on the skin. We have to chemically dissolve that biofilm first, for the active ingredient to actually penetrate and treat the infected skin 🧐\n\n\nThe \"method\" is simple, and I call it a double cleanse, because it's the same principle as a double cleanse for your face. The first wash is to remove dirt, oils, buildup, sweat, etc. The first step is cleaning. The second wash is to LEAVE ON, so the skin is saturated with the active antifungal ingredient. This is the actual treatment. \n\n\n#1. Cleanse\n\nWash your scalp thoroughly. You can use ANYTHING for this. Any shampoo will do. Even soap works, arguably better, because the alkalinity really breaks up the biofilm of the fungus. I used a tiny bit of soap for my fungal acne (face and chest) initially, just to make sure my skin was \"stripped\". I now use Head and Shoulders (the silky black variant, which is their \"plain\" option). \n\n\nThis is sort of like when dermatologists \"degrease\" your face with alcohol or acetone before a chemical peel. It removes any oils that can block the treatment, and dehydrates the skin slightly, so it absorbs it even deeper. \n\n\n#2. Treat\n\nTake a 50 paisa coin-sized amount (if you remember how big that was 😂 Half the size of a rupee coin!) of your dandruff shampoo and lather it up well, between your palms. Spread it on your scalp (or face) thoroughly. If you have longer hair, you may have to section it a bit to access your scalp properly. Remember, you're only treating your SCALP, not your hair. \n\n\nOnce it's applied all over, wet your fingers if you need to, or put a little water on your scalp, and MASSAGE thoroughly. You have to keep the skin WET. If it dries out, it's not penetrating properly. Once the lather is massaged in well, leave it on for however long the bottle suggests. I did ten minutes initially, now I do five. Depends on the severity of your condition. \n\nWash it off with cold water for best results. This way the treatment, which penetrates the top layer of the skin, STAYS on the skin. Hot water would wash it out somewhat. And heat in general really encourages the fungus, so avoid hot showers, if possible. Keep it coool! 😌❤\n\n\n#3. Condition\n\n+ **Using conditioner** - If you have dandruff, it's easiest to skip conditioner entirely. Almost all of them have ingredients that will feed the fungus. If your hair is long, and you have to condition it, only do the ENDS. Whatever you apply to the ends WILL TRAVEL up the wet hair shaft through capillary action, and it shouldn't touch the roots and scalp. So do the ends of your hair, up to chin level and no further. If you have frizzy hair higher than that, use a bit of gel (aloe gel works, so do hair gels) when your hair is dry, but AVOID THE SCALP 😡\n\n+ **The totally fungal-safe option** that has worked very well for my curly, frizz-prone hair for over two years now, is to take a few drops of fungal-safe oil (MCT oil, C8 oil, or mineral oil, like Johnson's Baby Oil), rub between the palms, and apply to WET hair, right after washing. Start from the roots, go up the lengths, avoid the scalp. The wetness allows the oil to spread evenly in a thin layer... instead of just creating oily patches in your hair 😅 It leaves the hair soft and smooth, since it seals in moisture, and the emollience of the oils works to smooth down the cuticle. \n\nI prefer this method over using conditioner, and would recommend even those who don't have dandruff to give it a try 🤷🏽‍♀️ It's simple and very effective. \n\n\n+ If you have fungal acne on your face, follow up with a fungal-safe skincare routine ([my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) here was about this) and be careful not to over-moisturize your skin. If your skin gets dehydrated, it needs more water, not oil - try a hydrating step, like serum, toner or mist. \n\n\n# My experience\n\nIt took about a month for this technique to show significant results for me, but you might see faster improvement. \n\nSCALP: The first week, I washed my hair alternate days, then afterwards settled into a maintenance of twice weekly washes, that still continues to be my routine to this day 😌\n\nFACE: I used this technique every day for three or four days (at night) then did alternate nights for a week or two. Then did once a week, or as needed through observing my skin. Following a fungal-safe routine was key to resolve and maintain my skin health. At this point, I don't have to use this treatment on my face anymore, I just stick to fungal-safe products and have no issues ☺ \n\nI hope this clarified things! It's worked really well for me, and I hope it's useful to y'all, too. \n\nEDIT: Super happy to share [this post by u/owlet09](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/j2q4rr/appreciation_post/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) who cleared up her chronic dandruff using this method! 😆\n\n2022 EDIT: Having gotten my dandruff under control to my derm's satisfaction, I still felt that my scalp health was iffy, and came to the conclusion that my scalp was being repeatedly dehydrated and therefore overproducing oil. Like my own teenage self with acne! 😂\n\nWhat I do now is - after every wash, I mix a generous amount of aloe gel with a dash of glycerin and five or six drops of MCT oil. I apply it on my scalp for the most part, using a comb bottle, and put the excess on my lengths (all on very damp, unfortunately stripped and squeaky hair). I let it sit under a shower cap (so it won't dy out) for at least ten minutes, then rinse. \n\nKind of a gel scalp and hair pack ☺ It's reduced the oiliness of my scalp, and I don't get itchy around my next wash day any more! 😆🙏🏽 My lengths are also well conditioned this way, without feeding the fungus.\n\nApril 2022 EDIT: A wonderful addition to my routine - I oil my scalp with MCT oil and hour or so before shampooing. I use a dropper to get it onto my scalp, massage the leftovers on my ends (short hair) and shampoo as described above. \n\n... I think the oiling also works to dislodge dead skin and loosen everything up. Basically like oil cleansing, a deeper cleanse 🤔 Afterwards, I use the aloe gel and five drops MCT oil on wet scalp and ends. I don't feel the need to add glycerine or rinse it out, so it's like, a leave in conditioner with very light hold. Nice soft results, and I'm very happy ☺\n\n⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** Since making this post, I've learned some new information that has changed my perception and usage of the term \"fungal-safe\". I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️",

It lead me to also not take care of myself in other ways too — such as having a bad diet, lack of motivation, etc. I tried Rogaine/Minoxidil but I was highly allergic to it. Got itches all over my body.\n\nSo, Finasteride was my last resort.\n\nI didn't see a lick of results for a good 3 months. Some of the old pics are from either 1 1/2 years ago, or as long as 3 years ago. I recently added the iRestore Laser Cap to my regimen about 6 months ago. I had great results before I had it, but now I do notice even more thickening.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My regimen:**\n\n1. 1mg of Finasteride **daily**\n2. 5000mcg of Biotin **daily**\n3. Nizoral Shampoo 1% Ketoconazole massaged in thoroughly **3 times a week** (leave in hair for 5 minutes then rinse)\n4. OGX Biotin & Collagen Shampoo **every day you don't use Nizoral** (leave in hair for 5 minutes then rinse)\n5. iRestore Laser Cap **every other day** for 25 minutes\n6. Drink plenty of water, get enough protein in your diet\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's it folks! Here's to more success, I hope you all are finding success in your hair growth journey's as well. Would love to answer questions if you have any.\n\n**OGX Shampoo:** [OGX Shampoo](https://www.amazon.com/OGX-Shampoo-Thick-Biotin-Collagen/dp/B00ADRH2OM/ref=sr_1_10?crid=28HEF52NF6CYP&keywords=ogx%2Bshampoo%2Band%2Bconditioner%2Bbiotin%2Band%2Bcollagen&qid=1551661639&s=beauty&sprefix=ogx%2Bshampoo%2Band%2Bconditioner%2Bbi%2Caudible%2C223&sr=1-10&th=1)\n\n**Nizoral Shampoo:** [Nizoral Shampoo](https://www.amazon.com/Nizoral-Anti-Dandruff-Shampoo-Ketoconazole-Dandruff/dp/B00AINMFAC/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=nizoral&qid=1551663134&s=beauty&sr=1-1-spons&psc=1)\n\nI removed pics due to people recognizing me too often 🤣",

I ask this question because of synchronized growth and shedding cycles for follicles affected by fin. \n\nI'm currently on my 7th month of fin and while I've gotten very positive results (considerable regrowth on my hairline and thickening of hair in general), I'm facing sporadic shedding and receding of my hairline. The weird thing is that I also have vellus hair follicles growing at my hairline so I don't think that there's anything wrong with the long-term efficacy of the treatment, rather just natural progression of the treatment. \n\nHave you had a similar experience?",

TWO HOURS. when the other seems spent a max 10 minutes after waiting for an hour just to give me the standard. \nListening to everything. Asking details about everything. Analyzing all the pictures and all the timeline. Analyzing my face and my scalp.\nOne thing that I thought was interesting is she scratched my arm and my skin reacted a lot and raised a lot, which turned out to be a part of the problem. \nWithout me even saying my prior diagnosis she said that I have:\n\n1. Pityrusporum folliculitis\n2. Sensitive dermatitis\n3. Periorbital dermatitis \n4. Seb derm on my scalp  \n5. Histaminosis \n6. Maybe a minor minor case of pp rosacea\n\nShe then spent an extra 30 minutes completely looking through all my current products and reading all the ingredients, asking me to discontinue anything that could lead to the problem, asking me if I was sensitive to any ingredients, which I am, and substituting current products for others that fit my skin needs. \n\nI had completely lost hope that maybe I had an incurable rosacea but this is the first time in a year that I feel hopeful that I might get a handle on this. \nThis is what she prescribed:\n\n1. Stop my current moisturizer, switch to maleszia (which she had at her office and gave to me for free)\n2. Ketoconazole shampoo/facewash and zinc pyrithione shampoo/face wash to use AM mon/wed/fri, 2x the zinc and 1x the keto \n3. A mixture of ivermectin, metronidazole and niacinimide for AM\n4. A mixture of azelaic acid and niacinimide for PM\n5. This foam thing to put along my hairline and eyebrows to help with inflammation and yeast overgrowth \n6. A new sunscreen \n7. A round of itriconazole (anti fungal), 100mg 2x a day for 2 weeks\n8. Levocetirizine 5mg to take daily for 3 months to make sure my histamine doesn’t act up and create inflammation while we’re treating this\n\nShe said my case was very complex and had many moving parts and that she is treating me while making sure the diagnosis is correct. \n\nAnyway moral here is, trust your gut. I knew it wasn’t just rosacea but was accepting it because so many dermatologists had told me. I am so incredibly happy I found my new dermatologist. Here’s to hoping I finally get this under control! ",

I know it seems trivial, but the management is different, and the difference is pretty easy to medical students, let alone practicing dermatologists\n2.\tNP misdiagnosed a congenital skin condition as a keloid and had been injecting it with steroids for months before referring to our keloid clinic. We needed to biopsy since the patient had some severe issues in that leg, and their care was delayed because this NP somehow thought a huge growth on someone’s leg was a keloid since birth. \n3.\tNP diagnoses patient with sudden nummular eczema starting over the course of one day some time after a URI. Patient doesn’t feel better so she comes in, we instantly recognized pityriasis rosea. Even the medical student recognized it. \n\nThis was all the same day by the way.

Parts of the back of my head are extremely red, and parts are extremely flaky. One derm said it was definitely psoriasis, another derm said it was definitely seborrheic dermatitis, and a third derm said it was definitely sebo-psoriasis. That said, because none of those derms took a biopsy, my new GP referred me to another derm that will, so I'll be seeing her in the coming months.\n\nI've tried all the typical recommendations: OTC and Rx ketoconazole, sulfate/paraben free (disastrous), coal tar, t-sal, and Rx clobetasol (steroids). None really did much. My doctor suspects that whatever it is likely needs a very different treatment approach (she suspects a topical immunomodulator would be the best next step, but said the derm will know better than her, which makes sense).\n\nBut whenever I look for anything non-Rx to try to at least somewhat alleviate the flaking and pain and is specifically targeted towards people with dandruff, it has coconut oil. My understanding of coconut oil is that it is the correct fatty acid chain length to be an ideal food for the scalp yeast that causes seborrheic dermatitis to begin with, so... why? Just this morning I saw a product that had pyrithione zinc (standard seborrheic dermatotis treatment ingredient) AND coconut oil, and idk,maybe i'm missing slmething but I can't for the life of me understand why those two ingredients would be in the same product. Am I missing something?\n\nInterestingly, in my early 20s I was able to put straight coconut oil into my hair. I washed it 2-3x per week, had no flakes, had super hydrated bouncy curly hair, etc. That's not an option at all anymore, I have to wash daily.",

        "body": "Luckily there's lots of studies on yeast metabolism (partially because of the alcohol industry 😂). While there are many species of yeast they have similar needs. Sugar is their source of energy, but they also need fatty acids to build the cell membranes. They can make these themselves or get them from their environment. The fatty acids they use are mostly unsaturated long chain fatty acids though. Coconut oil contains mostly short to medium saturated fatty acids. Several studies have actually demonstrated that coconut oil actually has antifungal properties. Although coconut oil isn't strong enough to be considered an antifungal treatment on it's own, I doubt it would have negative effects on a topical fungal issue. You've probably heard warnings against using coconut oil because some people have tried to use it to treat vaginal yeast infections because of it's antifungal properties. This is a very different environment however so the coconut oil can end up making things worse. On topical fungal issues it shouldn't have that same negative effect. If anything I'd stay away from palm oil because it has high concentrations of palmitic acid that yeast do actually enjoy. I would also suggest seeing an allergist/immunologist instead of a dermatologist if possible. Both psoriasis and SD are technically immune system issues. All the symptoms caused by SD are actually your immune system's negative response to the fungi, not the fungi itself.",

We went to do a blood test and the results showed that her liver hasn’t been affected after about two years of taking the medication. She’s 6 years old, a Boxer, she has been spayed, and she’s about 70 pounds. Before the medication, which is called Ketoconazole, she weighed 50 pounds and this is with a healthy schedule of walking and running throughout her life. She developed the chronic skin allergy when she was around 2 years old.\n\nShe ate a lot less before the meds and was practically furless because of how much she scratched. It was really hard watching her live her life constantly scratching and we tried everything we could, medicated shampoo, diet plans, and even medicated sprays—and nothing worked, if anything sometimes it felt it made it worse. She was a depressed dog and it was hard to try to get her to play and exercise because she just wanted to sleep all day.\n\nShe consistently made herself bleed from how bad she would chew and scratch at herself and she would let off a horrible scent. Sometimes, I would find a weird slime forming behind her ears and in her underarms, even with her showering every week. \n\nThe vets, despite visiting many, never could find anything wrong with her. Eventually, we went to an emergency center and the Vet there told me that it was a chronic skin allergy that she would basically have to live with for the rest of her life. He prescribed Ketoconazole and it was an immediate affect, it was like she was a new dog. She became energetic, playful, she grew a bright and silky coat, and all of her callouses from scratching softened into skin. She smelt less horrible and finally smelt like a natural dog and this was because we played it safe with the medication by spacing it out for longer, aware that meds affect the liver. \n\nThen, the vet we went to changed workplaces without us knowing and when we went back for her checkup the vet was not okay with the meds prescribed. They gave us a hard time, but we fought and the meds were prescribed again. This repeated three times, and so far she’s been taking the meds since 2021. \n\nWell, suddenly this year despite the blood test results coming out to show that her liver is still healthy and unaffected by the meds, they told me that they will no longer be prescribing because they said they don’t want to keep her on it for the rest of her life. They want to put her on a food diet that not only doesn’t agree with my income but also is something that most likely won’t work as I’ve tried to do the same method of treatment before and it showed no result. \n\nI don’t get this, the doctor said she’s chronic which means it literally is for the rest of her life, and they are aware of this as I’ve said this to them before. I’ve even showed them pictures of what she looked like before taking the Ketoconazole. They don’t seem to care.\n\nWithout the medication I can see she is becoming desperate again, she’s starting to smell awful again and is scratching a lot. She made herself bleed for the first time yesterday. \n\nI need advice, how do I deal with this? What should I say to convince the vet to continue prescribing the medication? Please help me, I don’t want to watch my dog suffer again.\n\nEdit 1: \nForgot to mention, the doctor that prescribed the medication said that whatever chronic skin allergy she had was likely because of yeast.",

(Updated Version with feedback from readers)**\n\nSEBO= Seborrheic Dermatitis\n\nTo all my beautiful people struggling with this condition, this is an update of what I've learned from hundreds of people giving their feedback of what has worked from my old post and what doesn't work. \n\n**I will make this fast yet informative**. I've had SEBO for more than 18 years from taking antibiotics (damaging my gut) and using skin products (damaging my skin barrier)\n\nBoth played a big part for me and when I fixed both, my SEBO went away. Think of it this way, the skin is mirroring what's going on in your gut. (There's a science to that)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How to fix the gut:** (The most important step that's most people often overlook)\n\nI started by taking 2 teaspoons of MCT oil with water first thing in the mornings on an empty stomach, MCT oil passes through digestive system killing bad bacteria and unwanted yeast.  You will have urgency to poop within an hour while you get used to the MCT oil, so I usually eat probiotic rich food right after the hour of taking MCT Oil which consists of Greek Yogurt with no sugar (for probiotics), Honey (for antibacterial) and frozen Blueberries (for fiber, which feeds good bacteria). I also started eating whole foods, no fast foods, sodas, or any foods with preservatives or antibiotics, etc. (I'll have a cheat day here and there). But most people have foods that don't do well with them so try to figure out what foods trigger you (for was corn and gluten) but as I fixed my gut health, I've been able to eat more of that. Healing the gut can take months so be patient.\n\nOne way to figure out what foods trigger you, start with a **carnivorous diet** and add food slowly to see what triggers digestive issues. Also, **FODMAP diet** is a great way to find out what foods trigger you.\n\n**Extra tips:**\n\nI also took **papaya seeds** which are known to be great for gut health, (they taste horrible) but the results are great.\n\n**Bone broth**: heals the gut lining.\n\n**Sauerkraut:** Great for probiotics\n\n**Best probiotic supplements:**  Lactobacillus Rhamnosus GG\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How to fix your skin barrier (including the scalp):**\n\n**What doesn’t work:**\n\n**DO NOT USE** moisturizers! Moisturizers feed the leftover yeast and allows them grow and thrive again. Also **DO NOT USE** Hydrocortisone which not only feeds the yeast, but it also damages the skin barrier. There are many products, including women's skin care or make-up that feeds this yeast and also damages skin barrier. (Always check the chemicals you put on your face/skin and do a quick search on google to see if **Malassezia yeast** thrives with it, AI helps me a lot with finding out that information)\n\n**What works:**\n\nSEBO can be confused with having a **Demodex Mite Infestation**. Many people who think they might have SEBO in fact have Demodex infestation or both. This will help both conditions.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Wash skin with **Nizoral shampoo or any yeast killing** shampoo/soap that contains **Ketoconazole** to kill the yeast as much as possible, **this shampoo won't kill the Demodex Mites.**\n2. Dry skin and apply **tea tree oil** (to kill yeast and Demodex Mites) don't wash it off. Dilute tea tree oil with MCT OI.  It will burn the first few times as your skin barrier is damaged. As the barrier gets better it won't burn as much. Do a 50:50 mix with MCT oil and tea tree oil, so it doesn't burn as much you can also do a 75:25 ratio. Tea tree oil will only be needed for about a month as you kill all of the yeast and all the Demodex mites, **please don't stop using tea tree oil as the mites leave eggs behind and you need to make sure you kill those as well when they hatch.**\n3. MCT oil **(SUPER IMPORTANT)** \\- make sure you get the one with **Capric and Caprylic Acid** also known as **C8 and C10**, **don't use it if it has C12** (I use Bulletproof with the green label). The other MCT oils with C12 will feed the yeast giving you problems again. I applied this after letting the undiluted Tea Tree oil sit for about 15 minutes. The first few times I washed the tea tree oil off as it burned too much, but as days passed, I was able to leave it on throughout the day with MCT oil over it.\n4. If you wear glasses, make sure you clean them with dish soap at least once every 2 days. The dead skin that's on the frames allow these little creatures to live and thrive if they are not regularly cleaned and once you put them on, they transfer back on your face. (Many people told me this worked for them)\n\nSteps after fixing gut and skin barrier:\n\nI still shower with **Nizoral shampoo** but now I only put MCT oil on my skin and scalp to moisturize after the shower. I don’t use Tea Tree Oil anymore as my skin can now fight the mites and the yeast. I still watch over what I eat and try to keep my gut healthy, remember your skin is just showing you what really is going on inside your gut. The key is consistency and patience.\n\nIf you are worried about tea tree oil spiking estrogen, please keep in mind that it is only one study, also the tree oil is only used daily for about a month or until the skin barrier heals. And also, I rather deal with taking vitamins to keep my hormone levels good, than having itchy irritated skin most of my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo more itchy skin and no more dandruff in my life for 2 years and counting!\n\nHope this helps and any feedback is always welcome.",

The burning is you damaging your skin further - essential oils have to be diluted to be used safely. The burning is NOT good. You can’t completely kill off malassezia furfur, our skin actually needs it as part of the microbiome to keep the skin healthy. Malassezia feeds off of our waste products - without it, there could be bigger problems with waste like sebum & sweat causing infections or bad build-up/irritation if the waste isn’t removed promptly. \n\nHow can you claim that MCT oil isn’t digested? It’s full of fatty acids that are necessary for good health. Cite sources that support your claim. \n\nSome people NEED moisturizers. Don’t demonize them. Yes, some ingredients in them can feed malassezia, but this is why ingredient checkers exist - so people can screen their products before buying to ensure they won’t cause or contribute to a flare-up.",

        "body": "I’ve had Seb Derm since like the age of 25, and I’m now 31. I didn’t notice it at first because it was mild and only in my hair. I believe it started to get worse from me not allowing my hair to completely dry before putting on a head scarf at night. \n\nHere’s what I usually do:   \nDuring Covid I tried to do an all natural candida cleanse and I believe my skin started to purge. One time it was so bad that it was all over my face and my family thought something was seriously wrong. Because my skin is brown the spots were light and very noticeable. \n\nI wanted to continue the cleanse but my face looked so bad that I began getting afraid. So I called my doctor and let him know that I believed that what was on my face was candida related so he prescribed me Diflucan. It got better within days.\n\nTo fix the gut I started on probiotics and acv shots once sometimes twice a day. I also cut out a lot of sugars. No processed snacks. White bread, white rice, and potato chips…I cut it all out because it breaks down to sugar further feeding the candida. No soda or unnatural juices.  I also started a vitamin D supplement. \n\nThe next thing that I did that is a game changer is that I started washing my hair once a week with a Ketoconazole based shampoo. It’s called Nizarol and I found it at Walmart. But here’s the key, when I washed my hair I would put the shampoo in my hair and also put it all over my face and let it sit for 2-4 minutes. While my face was broken out I also used this same shampoo (just on my face) day and night and let it sit 2-4 minutes and rinsed it off then used and anti fungal cream once I washed it off before bed. Dont use regular moisturizer during this time. Give your skin a chance to heal and keep it dry. If you wear makeup, wash your makeup brushes with this shampoo as well and let them completely dry. Don’t wear makeup during this time either. \n\nI’m writing this because this was really a big and embarrassing scary thing for me. I see some of you here saying that you’ve been dealing with this problem for years and it makes me sad because I know the feeling. Because it isn’t life threatening many don’t take it seriously and because of this it seems like you’re being a hypochondriac when you talk to some doctors about it. \n\nSo to conclude this:\nIf you don’t mind western medicine and want to clear this up fast CUT OUT SUGAR, then ask your doctor for Diflucan, start on a probiotic, buy Ketaconozole, and wash your hair often. Stay healthy and keep hope!",

I could sleep all day and I didn’t even care about it.\n\nThe dermatologist I saw, one of Mumbai’s most respected and experienced, told me he has NOTHING else to prescribe. And that folks gradually need steroids because anti histamines are easy to get used to after a few YEARS on it.\n\nI said, BYE.\n\nMarched off to Rishikesh, reconnected with an Ayurvedic doctor I had met years ago, admitted myself in his hospital and he cured me in 15 days. His diagnosis was severe acidity on the stomach, which travels to the skin to be emptied out, just like sweat and faeces, skin outbreaks caused by heat are a function of the body cleaning itself. I was given enemas and purgatory kadhas. \n\nI actually saw, stinking and rancid acids come out from my empty morning stomach. It took 3 purgings to empty it. \n\nUrticaria is described as an inflammatory issue and connected to the immune system when as severe as it was in my case.\n\nThat does not mean that the Ayurvedic part of it is in conflict. Acids are inflammatory. They inflame whatever they touch, by their very nature. Instead of mocking age old beliefs around skincare and health, it’s only rational to give them a chance, given they are the result of millenia of observation and understanding.",

I've had an oily, itchy scalp that starts to smell bad 12 hours after washing and always thought this was normal. I tried all sorts of things - tea tree oil shampoos, apple cider vinegar rinses, making sure my hair was dry before going to bed, and while I was living in the UK, Head and Shoulders. Nothing worked, scalp was always problematic.\n\nI moved to the US, and bought Head and Shoulders because it was the only shampoo available at my grocery store at the time. After about a week of use, I noticed my scalp wasn't as itchy and my hair didn't smell bad even after 24 hours and felt more voluminous. Turns out the US version of Head and Shoulders contains zinc pyrithione, and ingredient which is banned in the EU and UK. This ingredient is an antifungal and antimicrobial, perhaps that explains why my scalp doesn't smell anywhere near as bad now. I'm happy I've finally found something that works, is cheap and is easily available at most stores. I haven't tried other options like ketoconazole or coal tar and perhaps they would have worked. Also I'm not a H&S salesperson, just want to share what's worked for me.\n\nTldr: If you have an itchy smelly scalp, try a shampoo that contains zinc pyrithione. Head and Shoulders in the US contains this ingredient.",

Mainly because they either don’t wash their scalp properly or use too much product without ever washing properly in between.

    "body": "So I have been in this sub since it had 2k followers and I have seen and enjoyed the growth of this sub . But every now and then , someone asks for a product recommendations for acne or dandruff ,and many users are recommending antibiotics (clindamycin ) and antifungals(ketoconazole based products) left and right . STOP DOING THAT. You have no idea what the consequences of this is . \n\nUnsupervised use of antimicrobials(even antifungals comes under this broad classification) , can lead to antibiotic resistance among various microbes ,which can cross the species barrier and spread rampantly among bacteria of all genus and species . And we haven't been discovering or inventing antibiotics as we used to . We haven't invented an antibiotic in almost 3 decades(it was 1987 since the last successful antibiotic was discovered) , and simultaneously we are making the bacteria resistant to the existing antibiotics , if this continues there will be no saving us. We will be pushed back to pre-penicillin era , where people died from common treatable infections . We have already created superbugs , that are resistant to almost every antibiotic in the books, one or two antibiotics are working on them . I don't even want to imagine what a microbe resistant to every antibiotic in existence will do to us . SO KINDLY STOP RECOMMENDING ANTIBIOTICS (AND ANTIFUNGALS) to anyone who has a skin /hair issue.  And ALSO USE THE ANTIBIOTICS PRESCRIBED ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTORS INSTRUCTIONS AND FOR RECOMMENDED PERIODS ONLY(NOT MORE NOT LESS) .\n\nPS: teixobactin a newer gen antibiotic was discovered in 2015 , it broke the antibiotic void of 27 years . But that is being used for MRSA (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus) the bap of superbugs , and tb(not approved in india yet) . So they are reserving this antibiotic for the cases where no other antibiotic works . And this doesn't justfy us using antibiotics left and right . \n\nAnd  People , please don't take antibiotic for common cold (which is a viral illness) ,until your phlem turns yellow/green ,only that indicates there is secondary bacterial infection and only then antibiotics work.",

It is not a prescription drug and can be used for treating dandruff long term. It may actually be needed to be used long term to maintain the results. \n\nIn India you cannot advertise regulated drugs, only otc drugs can be advertised in media, and I agree even otc drugs need to be used with caution, but ketoconazole is a drug that has been advertised in media, for its anti dandruff properties. (just refer all those ketomac shampoo ads). So if a product can be advertised in mass media, it can be recommended in the sub. It can actually be helpful to people, even long term if they use the products according to the instructions on the pack. \n\nAgain, I’m talking only regarding to it’s use for dandruff and not anything else.\n\n\nEdit- I understand your frustrations OP, I’ve been here since late 2019 (I’ve deleted my old account😅); and since the size of the sub has grown it has been difficult for mods to monitor such recommendations and many people slip by. I remember the tranexamic acid post from a few days ago and knew there will be someone who will try this out without a supervision.",

Salicytic acid topical, useless for it. Isotretinoin, enflamed it even worse. Sulfur masks, barely made a dent. Doxycycline oral, obviously useless. BUT the 1% ketoconazole anti fungal/anti dandruff shampoo by Nizoral..holy shit. After about 2 weeks of applying a quarter sized amount as a face mask on dry skin (every other day, leaving on for 10 minutes), my fungal acne texture issues are nearly completely resolved. Since it is a shampoo with surfactants, it can be a little drying but no more than your typically acne solution. HIGHLY recommend giving this a go if you have atypical fungal acne that traditional solutions arent rectifying.",

During treatment you need to run (cardio), weight lifting/leg exercises 2-3 times a week. Immediately after training, you need to take a cold shower on your head or exercise during a cold time. The intensity of aerobic exercise, exposure to cold (piloerection, goose bumps) time spent and the age of the person determine the rate of regrowth. For more piloerection  u can eat  hot spicy food (contained (Capsacin)** ***red chilly and black pepper mixed,garlic, wasabi) and use*** **menthol ointment (or oral mint extracts).**\n\nIf you're reading this, you've probably read the weird, crazy comments on r/tressless posts.\n\nThe essence of my AGA (androgenetic allopecia) treatment method is to do the following during the period of using FDA-recognized medications for androgenetic alopecia (finasteride 0.25-1.25 mg everyday, minoxidil 5% topical 2ml or(and) oral minoxidil 2.5-5 mg everyday) physiotherapeutic actions:\n\n1. Do jogging, running, jump rope, running uphill, cycling, sports (football, etc.), swimming, weightlifting (squats, deadlift), calf raise, leg press and leg extension. You need to exercise in such a way that you experience failure, heavy and rapid breathing, muscle pain, and sweating. You need to work out intensively. It is enough to use different exercises 2-3 times a week, avoiding injuries and overtraining.\n2. On exercise days it is necessary to use cold stress i.e. Exposure to uncomfortable temperatures may include:\n\nA) Performing exercises (working outside, sport, run, hike) in temperatures of -10 to +15 Celsius.\n\nB) Use of a cold shower on the whole body and always on the hair (thermal effect with cold water from +5 to +15 Celsius. Possible dousing with water from a bucket or tap. The effect is short, 10-20 seconds.\n\n**B1)Update of the new method of exposure to cold:** It is necessary to treat the follicle muscle as a biceps or triceps or any other muscle. Therefore, you need to take a tap with cold water (or a bucket of cold water, you can with ice so that it is less than +15C, the less the better). Pour water on the scalp for 5 seconds, then 20-30 seconds of rest. Repeat 6-12 times in one approach. So we repeat the muscle training as in the gym, and if there is even vellus hair, it gets wet and the weight of the water is used as the weight of dumbbells or a barbell. Piloerection is actually an exercise for the hair muscle (APM). From this point of view, the \"thicker\" and heavier the water, the better. The density of water can be increased if you cool it to +4С and increase the salinity, salty cold water is heavier than usual. Moreover table salt in water could influence on Na+ channels of cold receptors.\n\nC) Drying the body without a towel in a room with a temperature of +18 to +22 degrees Celsius, preferably in a draft or outside in the wind. It is advisable to see traces of piloerection (raising of hair on the skin) and goosebumps on the body, this means that everything is correct. After partial drying and feeling cold, you can dry yourself with a towel as usual, the main thing is to feel the cold from drying in order to activate natural heat regulation.\n\nTo enhance the effect of piloerection (for TRPA1 receptors), you can use (eat) hot spicy soup of the Kim Chi, hot dishes with wasabi and mustard, other hot dishes with red chili pepper and black pepper, garlic for better cold reaction. According to the author’s experience, this affects the piloerection on the top of the head even without cold. To enhance the effect of piloerection for TRPM8 cold receptors, you can use a menthol ointment (levomenthol) .Menthol works better on the front line of the hair.\n\nIncrease of shedding (hair loss) is normal state of being in this method. Shedding could be more then 150 hairs per day (even 500) at start.  Intensive shedding term - \\~3 month at norwood 4-5. More deminiaturization area more shedding. If stop exercise shedding will be stop after 10 days of sedative lifestyle. More shedding more regrow.  Shedding from exercise (muscle stress) without antiandrogen and minoxidil - way to accelerate balding (negative shedding).\n\nIf there is no time, money, or opportunity for treatment, then use at least minoxidil, a virtual (imaginary) jump rope (or 10+ min treadmill 7km/h) to failure, and immediately after finishing the exercise, wash your hair with cold water (+10 to +15 C) or a cold shower with natural drying of the body.\n\nThe essence of the method is to increase the metabolism (anabolism) of your body to the maximum and reducing the androgenic effect taking minoxidil and finasteride. At the same time, exercise maximizes the effects of minoxidil, and since androgens no longer harm the follicle, a growth window appears. When performing exercises and during the period of muscle recovery, many unique anabolic effects appear in the human body: activation of stem cells, improvement of fat metabolism, gene emission, emission of unique proteins, the appearance of growth and regeneration factors. Without training large muscle groups, such effects will not occur in the body of a person who does not exercise and leads a sedative lifestyle. Main pathways of muscle stress: SHH, sympathetic nerves, Foxp1, Fgf18, Adrb2, APM hypertrophy, CXCL12, FGF21, BNDF, Hedgehog-SCUBE3-TGF-β, COL17A1, Lipid metabolic acceleration, SULT1A1, IGFBP-rP1, JNK-1( cold), JAK, Interleukin-15, TLR2. Also, leg exercises from weightlifting (squats, deadlifts), which have a high androgenic potential, help combat the side effects of finasteride.\n\nAt the same time, the activation by cold of the piloerection mechanism and goose bumps as part of the thermoregulation mechanism gives a signal to the follicle and the muscle of the follicle to raise the hair, if it is not there, then the body reacts accordingly, taking into account the absence of obstacles to hair growth (DHT). Cold relief has an anabolic effect and a mobilization effect on cells and the nervous system, enhancing the effects of muscle stress. Pathways of cold exposure: SHH, sympathetic nerves, Lipid metabolism acceleration, JNK-1. Hair muscle training (pump) in cold condition with piloerection and goosbumps and in this time big muscle stress influence to arrector pilli muscle (APM) to grow.\n\nMore serious and difficult explanation of how exercise and cold influence on hair here - [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QY7XLn1jrqXIayUp\\_QeS8ijWC3KdbBNI/edit?usp=drive\\_link&ouid=101849866862702522207&rtpof=true&sd=true](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QY7XLn1jrqXIayUp_QeS8ijWC3KdbBNI/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=101849866862702522207&rtpof=true&sd=true)  . Its a part of my research of h-responders of Reddit, and very compressed (20 pages).\n\nTable of relationship between exercises and hair regrow here - [https://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/comments/1fwmlr7/table\\_of\\_the\\_relationship\\_between\\_physical/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/comments/1fwmlr7/table_of_the_relationship_between_physical/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nMore about cold pathway - [https://www.reddit.com/r/HairlossResearch/comments/1h81bat/physiometabolic\\_method\\_of\\_treating\\_androgenic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HairlossResearch/comments/1h81bat/physiometabolic_method_of_treating_androgenic/)\n\nThe method should work quickly and have an effect in 1-3 months. The method was developed based on personal experience, taking into account the analysis of hyperresponse r/tressless, analysis of a large number of scientific papers from around the world. When analyzing hyperresponders, it turned out that they used finasteride and minoxidil, and also played sports indoors or outdoors, responders usually used their leg muscles. The best results were published when therapy took place during the colder months of the year. In fact, h-responders experienced similar levels of stress to the lives of the Amish and the homeless, who are famous for their hair cause hair its natural thermoregulation mechanism for bad weather environment (not for beauty). Amish and homeless both use leg muscle stress to survive.  Previously, I thought that the main thing was muscle stress, but I did not take into account temperature stress. All this makes hyperresponding a unique and rare phenomenon. Moreover, the method has a huge anti-aging effect and helps in mewing.\n\nThe method should help most AGA patients achieve the hyperresponder effect. Try this!\n\nData table of TOP hyperresponders:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HNW7X3hp0aKy3mVGlv2FM-DI4PfrFRCA4aW6Hn3RQlc/edit#gid=1215548399\n\nAdditions:\n\n1. Intense anaerobic and aerobic leg exercises accelerate negative shedding in AGA patients without the use of antiandrogen and minoxidil.\n\nWhen applying the physio-metabolic protocol - shedding is positive and sign of deminiturization of the follicle.\n\n2. The physio-metabolic protocol can help both AGA patients and those who have other causes of baldness, including those of unknown etymology. Therefore, the use of muscle stress and cold helps with the use of minoxidil and some natural traditional ones (the use of plants and their flavonoids and styrenes).\n\n3. The use of proteins, BCAA, omega3, L-carnetine, multivitamins can improve and speed up the result, because they enhance anabolic processes.\n\n4. Fasting in addition to the protocol can also speed up the effect because it also affects fat metabolism, which is also enhanced by cold and exercise. Fasting probably also has an androgenic effect, so it is not recommended to fast in AGA without the use of an antiandrogen.\n\n5. Muscle stress influence positively on minoxidil treatment cause of improvement pathway:SULT, Nitric Oxid,K+, ATP, metahondrial chanel open. The author's experience suggests that topical minoxidil and oral minoxidil probably have different metabolisms, oral in the liver, and topical more in the scalp and follicles. Therefore, it is better to use two types of minxidil at once: topical and oral. Oral minoxidil is directly more dependent on muscle stress and its effectiveness is directly proportional to the amount of muscle stress. The author also noted from an assessment of the cases of hyperresponders that topical minoxidil has a greater effect on the crown, and oral minoxidil on the hairline from the front and sides.\n\n6. This protocol helps women as well as men, there is no difference. Women can often get results even using minoxidil alone. However, for women it is better to take spironolactone 50-100mg daily or palmetto saw 500mg daily as a atiandrogen. In this case, it is better to abandon contraceptives (especially long-term implants). Mostly hyperresponsive women use only minoxidil, sometimes adding shampoo with ketoconazole.\n\n7. If you have dandruff, you need to use shampoo with ketoconazole; besides, ketoconazole has antiandrogenic properties. For scalp diseases, it is advisable to use oral minoxidil. More minoxidil is better than less.\n\n8. The best timing for cold stress is within 2 hours after leg exercise during the metabolic window. It is better to use cold stress immediately after stress from leg exercises. Ran - straight into the cold.\n\n9. In order to massively enhance metabolism and improve athletic performance, it makes sense to sleep only on the floor or a hard bed - the harder the better (granite, tiles). There are a few cotton fabrics to spread, and in winter the skin with fur (sheep, wolf). Place a cotton cloth or a small arthopedic roller under your head. Adaptation occurs within 3-7 days, after which there will be no discomfort. Spartan conditions will increase metabolism, will improve resistance to mental stress. No matter what modern orthopedists (who help sales) say, sleeping on a hard base means treating scoliosis, stomach and respiratory diseases.\n\n10. Increasingly, information began to come that some hyperresponders used a sauna (hot bath) during the training period. The effect of the sauna is that when the body is accustomed to an elevated temperature (for example, if you sit in the sauna for 10 minutes or more) and if you leave the sauna, you will not be able to immediately adapt to normal room temperature and for some time the person experiences cold stress (piloerection, goosebumps, feeling cold after leaving a hot and humid room). This is the secret of saunas for hyper responders.\n\n11. Internet have many extream video about training with exercise and cold. This type of activity with antiandrogen and minoxidil give positive results to treatment (anaerobic, aerobic and cold): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnLZyyuEwX4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnLZyyuEwX4)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaA-HAFDwyc&t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaA-HAFDwyc&t=1s)  . And you could got same effect coincidentally after running exercise and sit under air conditioner and got cold. Muscle stress and cold stress are relative - start with small. If you don't leave the house, start walking outside for at least an hour and rinsing your hair with cold water.\n\n12. The author recommends using sources of infrared thermal radiation (650-1400 nm) such as incandescent lamps, galvanic and ceramic heaters, infrared heaters during the treatment of allopecia. This radiation can also help achieve results faster, while LLLT is more accessible and much more powerful. 2 hours of heat exposure from a heater can already provide certain advantages, especially in winter it can be used without any time constraints.\n\n13.Alcohol intake (drink vodka/whisky 30-40ml per day) could give more results cause of different effects on liver, thermoregulation, vessels and mental state.\n\nThoughts on thermoregulation, adaptation, and benefits for the treatment of alopecia here -\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/user/MagicBold/comments/1dgcnau/hair\\_as\\_a\\_tool\\_for\\_adaptation\\_to\\_the\\_environment/](https://www.reddit.com/user/MagicBold/comments/1dgcnau/hair_as_a_tool_for_adaptation_to_the_environment/)\n\n[Method schem](https://preview.redd.it/n6clkoej175e1.jpg?width=9918&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=465d88c85e22879919f85a3466f24e3180a00579)",

    "body": "In 2021 I was a 19yo with great hair, I used to see people my age with worse hair than me and think \"wow, i'm so thankful I'm not balding like that guy\". Then 2022 hit. Hairloss and karma hit me very very hard. My dad who's 50 literally had more hair than me.\n\n I tried to cope with it, even buzzed my head clean at one point, but I just could not do it. After tens of hours of watching MPMD, I decided to take Min. I did not want to go near Fin after reading all the stories that went like \"I got on fin and my d*ck fell off, my wife left me and i got fired\" type stuff. So i ordered saw palmetto, pumpkin seed oil, a 1mm derma roller and Min foam. All went great as you can see, i got my hair back fully(i think it was even thicker than before) using those only. \n\nMy happines was short lived, as in that Fall i started noticing that my hair was starting to slowly fall again. I thought \"f*ck it im not taking this shit anymore, I'll just ride it out until I go bald at 30\" . Very very bad decision at the time.\n\nThe min/saw palmetto/pumpkin oil/dermaroll gains lasted about until january and I thought I was all clear. But march came, and oh man, I was feeling like my hair was falling by the day. It started aggresively falling again, more so than before. I buzzed my hair once again on a whim and saw how dire the situation was. I tried to cope and started immediately googling SMP(scalp micro needling) clinics near me and messaged them. They came back to me with quotes that were like 1200$. I'm a broke uni student so no way I'm paying that for some dots on my head(also I've been a gym bro for 7 1/2 years so a month down time from the gym for recovery was no way in h*ll for me). So I decided to give my hair one last try. I went full panic mode, ordered some more Min, a derma stamp, ketoconazole shampoo, and finally got a prescription for oral Fin. Started with Propecia 1mg, all fine for the first month but was costly. \n\nSo for the second month I got a prescription for Proscar 5mg and tried cutting it into 5. It was all good for about 2-3 weeks, but recently I started getting sides (ED-related). I'm sexually active since I was 16 and had sex at least 3 times a week since then. My erections and libido were not what they used to be when I was 16, the novelty did wear off since then,  but I did notice a pretty drastic change since starting proscar. Trust me, it's not placebo and I also don’t jerk off so it isnt caused by over-stimulation either. I will cut back to 1.25mg thrice a week starting tomorrow and post an update in the coming months.\n\nMy total test was 800ng before starting(I'm natty) and my diet is very good for the most part. My sleep is not that great(of course, I'm majoring in Engineering) but that can’t be the cause for the issue since I never had a great sleeping schedule. I also have a very active lifestyle, get a lot of sun(vit D), drink a lot of water, eat healthy, etc. etc. Proscar is literally the only thing that can cause it. I will not stop it though because I'm terrified of losing my hair, I invest really much into my appearance so being bald at 22 really f*cks me up. The sides could also be caused by my sh*tty cutting skills, as it is really hard to perfectly split the pill in 5.  So uneven dosing of the pill.\n\nOn the upside, my hair growing results are really good as I'm closing on my 3rd month since starting the treatment. Fin seemed to clear up my acne too, I rarely get it nowadays(I used to get it often on my forehead before starting). I could only imagine where I would've been had I not stopped last Fall. But I'm so glad I did since it gave me a really big shock and all the motivation I need to never quit the protocol again. EVER.\n\nAt the moment I alternate between Min foam and solution 2x/day , ~1mg fin/day, 1mm dermastamp/week(I use 1.5mm for the hairline), ketoconazole once every other day. Will cut fin to 1.25mg/3 times per week.\n\nThe great results I got are because I'm a great responder to Min and my hair thinning pattern is  the best for starting a regrowing protocol, IMO(diffuse thinning).\n\nIf any young guy is reading this, and debating wheter to start min/fin, I advise you to do it. The world is cruel man, I swear everyday I would get funny looks and comments. I've always been the attractive guy, and the dude everyone looked up to for being fit and having that big of a flaw right in the open really f*ucks with your head at this age. I swear once everybody saw one weakness in me they all went for it with the balding trash talk, even 70yo teachers at Uni. If you’re 30+, it's not that bad, as a large percentage of men that age are already NW 4+ so you don’t get as many looks. But do yourself a favor and start it now, not later. Don't do the mistake I did, because I lost a lot of potential progress post-poning it like that. \n\nAlways try to do your best and leave nothing on the table, whether it is the hair protocol, going to the gym, studying, your relationships, whatever. Always strive to be better and to improve, never settle. In this world full of copers, effort and dedication goes a long way. Starting is the most difficult part. Once you take action, everything falls into place. Your 2035 future-self will thank you. When all your friends are fat, unhealthy and bald, and you'll look as good as ever, pull chicks as hot as you did in your 20s and you will be so glad you stuck to the grind. \n\nTalk to someone about your struggles. It ate me up inside for over 2yrs before I opened to my mom about it and she totally understood and supported me. Having someone like that really helps. It can be a friend or someone close to you.\n\nAlso thanks to MPMD and Haircafe, we owe these guys the world for their time and effort. Dont listen one bit to the copers like Baldcafe because he almost convinced me at one point that it is okay to let yourself go. IT IS NOT!!!!!! \n\nIf this post gets interest, I will respond to any questions and update in the future. Thanks for reading and stay strong guys, life always beats us up in one way or another, it's okay to be down sometimes, but it's not okay to stay there and not get back up.\n\nTL;DR : Aggressive balding at 20, got on min, got great results, quit. Bald again, way worse than before, started a much more aggressive protocol and got sides. Great results again, trying to clear sides going forward.",

Self confidence and esteem came crashing down as I used to be a super confident extrovert and started getting the piss taken out of me by all of my “friends” of all my childhood which didn’t help so I basically just started questioning everything in life thinking everything was just against me and just didn’t really want to live and just wanted to disappear to be honest especially as it was such a young age, been feeling better recently (past couple months) and started minox at around February/march 2023 and saw decent gains in terms of volume and just made it appear better just less visible than it was to be honest and had hope that it would just magically restore everything after paying £300 to a scammy private dermatologist that told me so 😂. Density of my hair is definitely better than it’s peak thinness around a year and a half ago but have been experiencing more thinning on the crown area and just general no volume - as in individual hairs are thicker and appear better but less actual hair if that makes sense? Just been using topical minox since end of feb/march 2023 rogaine before bed and am yet to try oral/topical fin due to fear of it messing with my hormones/nob as I’m still mid 18 but feel like I know that’s my last savour lol. Also haven’t done any dermarolling or tried any rosemary/pumpkin type oils etc. Mental health is better now but WTF DO I DO (Living in UK btw)",

    "body": "So from my last post, I stopped using min due to certain sides and INSANE dandruff. I was thinking dut was killing DHT enough to do the job alone without the other meds. First pic is the shed that came after. So as they say, stopping min will cause major loss! And it’s safe to say that dut has a shed phase as well. \n\nI’m now on .5mg dut daily, 5mg oral min daily, and I use min FOAM here and there which got rid of my dandruff 100%. God the topical with glycol was just nasty stuff. I had crazy dandruff, itch, and even sore spots/scabs from scratching. I know it helps absorb more, but I’d consider switching to foam. Maybe hit it hard with topical for a couple months, then get on foam. \n\nAlso from last post, I was doing 10mg min oral which I do not recommend. It lowers blood pressure and I was dizzy all the time. \n\nI’ve also incorporated 2% ketoconazole shampoo thanks to my dr, but this was after my gains so I’m hoping for more! \n\nAny sides I had have gone away. I’m looking at women all around me, sex drive is back, and no issues in that department anymore. I don’t know if my body got used to the low DHT or if it’s just confidence of gaining hair back. Either way, I’m glad I just stuck to it and staying consistent with a stack has been really good mentally and hormone wise. \n\nI know there are non responders struggling and people that quit early. Consistency is key and you really can’t miss a day. This has been a 1.5yr journey and I now feel like I’ve found the system that works and it’s literally what everyone said, min and dut. \n\nOn a side note, not a sales ploy since I found this on ChatGPT. I’ve been using Kerastase Densifique mousse for styling. I have very thin hair and this stuff makes it look and feel thicc. I’m sure there are cheaper alternatives, but this has been goated for styling. And for hydration, I’ve been using avocado oil straight from the kitchen 😜 also recommend from ChatGPT. I do this before showers sometimes. \n\nFirst pic is from maybe 2 or 2.5 months ago. That was the peak of my shed. All other pics are from today or last night. I have added a few, combed forward, straight crown shot, and the last is fluffed back to show “density” with the styling foam. You can also see the new baby hairs on the forehead really sprouting. I had the baby hairs there for a year doing nothing, but staying on my min is making them grow more and more. I now shampoo my forehead with keto to kill any DHT hoping to get that hairline back. \n\nI hope the best for everyone, and I would nvr try to make a buck off others grief. My post is educational purposed as to what has worked for me. And to be 100% transparent, Reddit has given my hair back. Without this community, I would’ve nvr known about this stack and have always thought Rogaine was a gimmick. Man god bless Kirkland for making such a cheap alternative 🙏🏻 so I’m just doing my part. This stuff works! ",

    "body": "I first got tinea versicolor a couple of years ago. I guess in my mid twenties my hormones began to change, or maybe it was because i took myself off of the birth control pill after years of taking it, but my hormones seemed to change in such a way that I began profusely sweating in my sleep, during an anxious or nervous state, or just from wearing too many layers. <br>\nWhen I finally got to the dermatologist and it was diagnosed, it wasn't very severe so I was prescribed an ointment and a body shampoo. It took about three applications of the ointment a day plus a shower with the body shampoo every day for about three weeks to begin seeing any results. It took a few months after that before it seemed to be completely gone. \nAbout six months later it began to come back, but I had lost my health insurance and had just moved into a place with significantly higher rent, so I let it go for a little while. It finally got to the point where almost my entire chest, front of my neck, and entire groin were one large spot, with many smaller ones between my breasts and belly button. I read a ton of articles about it and found nothing as far as treating it without prescriptions. \nFinally I turned to reddit for help. Searching through endless threads I found a suggestion to use Nizoral,  a prescription-strength dandruff shampoo that is sold over the counter and is only about $13. I apologize now because I tried finding the thread to include with this post and cannot for the life of me locate it again. Apparently, the active ingredient in the shampoo, ketoconazole, is also an active ingredient in many ointments and washes for treatment of tinea versicolor.\nWhat I did, as suggested by a user in the thread, was apply the Nizoral to the affected areas in a thin but full layer and left it overnight while I slept. I then used it as a bodywash for the next few days, and within about six days it was almost completely gone.  It is now completely gone and only took one overnight application and less than two weeks. \nI wanted to make sure to share this information because the treatment is so much more effective and affordable than going to a doctor and filling prescriptions. Would love to hear of anyone elses stories with this method, or other DIY methods! ",

Then I found Nizoral 2% and I've never struggled with it again. I just got back from Samoa and it flared up again (first time in 5 years), but after one treatment with Nizoral 2%, and the afternoon in the sun tanning the affected area, it was immediately gone. \n\nThe surefire way too be certain that your treatment was effective is to put the skin in the sun and see if the pink or white spots are able to be tanned. If the fungal yeast infection is still prevalent than the spots will stay pink or white unable to be tanned. If the treatment was effective then those areas will be tanned like the rest of your skin and within a few days as the skin fades back to normal colour, the spots are unnoticeable.\n\nThis is my treatment plan with Nizoral: \n\n1. Take a shower and wash the affected area very well. \n\n2. Dry the area with a clean towel. \n\n3. Wet the area with water (partner with a water sprayer bottle works a treat) or just wet hands under the tap if you can reach the area yourself. \n\n4. Lather Nizoral 2% cream over the wet area and work into a foamy lather. I put heaps on and get the foam nice and thick, and make sure to cover the affected area and at least 4-6 inches all around. (It's yeast on the surface of the skin, so the affected area is often much larger than just the noticeable spots)\n\n5. Leave it on the skin for 2-10 hours. If your going to sleep with it on, put on a clean shirt and sleep in the shirt and then shower in the morning. After a minimum of 2 hours (I often shoot for 3-5 hours), then shower it clean. \n\n6. Get into the sun as quickly as you can and try to get a good tan on the affected area. As mentioned above, if you can tan the spots then you're in business baby. \n\n  \nThat's been my routine and it's no longer an issue. I even recently used Nizoral 2% that was 5 years expired and it still worked a treat. Was a bit thick, but still kicked its arse beautifully. \n\n  \nGood luck legends!",

        "body": "Hello Everyone!\n\n  \nI decided that once I had got done dealing with my skin issue that I would come back and share my story that way it could also help anyone dealing with Tinea Versicolor. So, initially over the last two years I have had spots developing in my armpits which then grew and started spreading around my neck, back, and a lot on my stomach. I'm 25 and I am medium dark skinned so my spots were mainly dark and had the same web pattern as TV. I then went to a dermatologist about a year ago because I had been frustrated trying to figure it out on my own with no luck or change in prior months before going in to get it checked out, The dermatologist had first did the flake test with the razor and diagnosed me with tinea versicolor which at the time made sense because although I do not live in a humid place, I do go to the gym and stay active (5-6 days a week) and I had assumed it was from all the sweat from those activities. He then prescribed me Ketoconazole shampoo and head and shoulders to use in the shower and to let it sit for five minutes three times a week.  Unfortunately I had no success in months with my spots only very slightly lightening up, but then returning to how is was before. After about six months I almost gave up on trying to figure it out because it felt like it was no use and because it was normal for TV being stubborn to get rid of. I then transferred over to trying all the other over the counter shampoos ( Nizoral, Selsun blue, tea tree oil, and Naturasil TV bar) and still no luck. \n\nAfter that I was super frustrated with nothing working and so I went back and had him re-evaluate my skin. Which when going he had said that it looked worse then when I first went in, and so he then prescribed me Fluconazole for about a month to see if the \"fungus\" would react to the medicine and after taking it for a month... no luck. So, I went in again after taking that medicine and we talked about other options I could do, and I decided to get a biopsy done mainly because he felt that it may or may not be something similar to TV even though it looked like and had similar properties as TV and with doing a biopsy it would allow actual results of what it was. I was a little worried that it would be a waste of money, but luckily it wasn't . I found that after almost a year of treating my skin that instead of TV I had Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis or CARP for short. He then prescribed me 100 mg Minocycline a day for 30 days and I can finally say that my skin has been clear and back to normal for the last six months with no sign of it returning. As a disclaimer, I am not certified in anyway to give medical advise, but I will say that for me the biopsy completely helped me figure out what was going on with my skin. I hope that this helps someone who also had got misdiagnosed and tried multiple things for TV treatment and had no change whatsoever.",

CCs are actually my *only* skin problem besides the usual pains of exiting your 20s, but they were seemingly unbeatable. All the BHA and AHA in the world couldn't budge them. They would NEVER go away unless manually extracted, it was/is a saga written in picking scars on my face. \n\nFinally I splurged on a derm appointment and got a generic tretinoin gel prescription. It zapped the existing ones and flattened them, so I had much fewer CCs than before, but it didn't stop new ones from forming slowly. Eventually I ran out of tretinoin and couldn't afford another derm visit to get more, lived with awful skin for 1.5 years again. \n\nI discovered some time later that I was also suffering from fungal acne (not a big surprise, since I have battled other fungal infections on almost every part of my body for years). When I used ketoconazole and sulfur on my face I saw a big improvement again like the tretinoin but not a full smoothing of my facial texture.  \n\nIt was only once I could use both together that my face finally became nearly CC-free. The last few ones are shrinking away.  Differin (available OTC in my new country) is the big factor now, since my skin seems to have a LOT of trouble with cell turnover and I think the fungus thrives in the dead tissue that builds up. I haven't used ketoconazole in a month but the FA symptoms have stayed gone. \n\nIn both cases, improvement was a matter of days. 4~7 days to noticable difference with tretinoin, 2 days to dramatic visible improvement with ketoconazole.",

I would say Finasteride contributed 90%, ketoconazole 6% and RLT 4%. I use Ketoconazole for itchy scalp; no dandruff. I began treatment during a shed, so I’m uncertain wether Finasteride induced a shed. Testicular ache during first week of treatment then resolved thereafter, but with rare reoccurrence. Increased libido for the first 5-6 months then lower than baseline libido from month 7-9. Libido trending towards baseline for month 10. Slightly higher diastolic pressure but too many confounding factors to make any claims. Reduced hair shedding from month 2-3 onwards.  \n\nNext: looking to add Dutasteride 1-2x/week for decrease scalp sebum and itch so I can ditch the 2% Ketoconazole shampoo.",

I’ve been dealing with hair thinning for a while, and around November 2024, my dermatologist started using something called the Vortex Wand as part of my treatment. It’s a high-frequency device from Vortex Hair Care, and honestly, I was a little skeptical at first.\nBut now, six months later, I can actually see a difference. When I look back at photos from before I started, I didn’t realize how thin it had gotten in some areas. The results aren’t overnight, but my hair feels fuller, and I’ve been getting more consistent growth, especially along my part.\nAlongside that, I’m taking spironolactone (100mg daily now), and recently started using a prescription ketoconazole shampoo. I’m not using minoxidil because I have cats, and one has a heart condition — so I’ve been cautious.\nI saw that they also have a serum? I’ve been thinking about trying it to add into my routine. Has anyone else seen results using the Vortex Wand with other products",

I'm posting this to:\n\n* Show what my journey has looked like over the decade \n* Reflect on what treatments have helped (or haven’t) \n* Get feedback and advice from the community \n\n**A couple questions I’d love your input on:**\n\n1. How does my hair look year-over-year — especially 2025 compared to earlier years? Do you notice any gains, losses, or general stability? \n2. Is there anything else I could try to improve growth or reduce shedding? \n   * I've been shedding more than usual this past year, and it’s starting to worry me. \n\n**Current Treatments**\n\n* **1mg Oral Finasteride (Daily)** Been on this since 2015. I feel like this has been the most important treatment in my routine. \n* **2.5mg Oral Minoxidil (Daily)** Started with 0.625mg in 2022 due to concerns about blood pressure. \n   * Gradually increased to 1.25mg, then to 2.5mg (since Nov 2024, per dermatologist recommendation). \n   * I’m not sure I see a big difference in scalp hair, but I’ve noticed darker, faster-growing hair all over my body such as with my mustache, eyebrows, and legs. \n* **Topical Minoxidil (Rogaine) – 1x/day** I’ve used this consistently for 10 years (usually 2x/day). \n   * Recently dropped to 1x/day after my dermatologist said it might be redundant with oral min. I haven’t fully stopped because I want to monitor any changes before quitting completely. \n* **LLLT – Every Other Day** I started using my Therabody red/infrared light mask (meant for acne) on my scalp for 10 minutes every other day. \n   * Unsure if it’s helping, but figured I might as well try since I already have it. \n* **Ketoconazole** **- 2-3x/week** I've used this on and off through the years. I don't know if it makes a difference through the years I've used it, but I started using it again this year because it's low effort. \n\n**Treatments I Tried and Stopped**\n\n* **0.5mg Oral Dutasteride** Took this for 6 months in 2018. Didn’t see a difference from finasteride and didn’t think it was worth continuing. Not sure about now though if I'll have different effects with my hair. \n   * For what it’s worth, I never experienced any negative side effects from either dutasteride or finasteride. \n* **Supplements (Pumpkin Seed Oil, Nettles, Shark Cartilage, Biotin, etc.)** Took these for years but didn’t notice any major improvements. \n* **Microneedling** Tried this inconsistently from 2018–2021. \n   * Couldn’t keep up the routine, and the post-needling itchiness lasted for days. The effort just didn’t feel worth the payoff. \n\n**Lifestyle**\n\n* I eat healthy, exercise regularly like swim, and lift weights 3–4x/week. \n   * I take whey protein/weight gainer, but avoid creatine due to concerns about DHT.  \n* I try to manage stress through working out and getting enough sleep (8 hours a night + occasional naps). \n* Overall, I’d say I live a health-conscious lifestyle — which I know many of us here relate to. \n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts! Happy to answer any questions, too. Let’s keep fighting the good fight. 💪👴🧬",

    "body": "*...took me forever to learn how to write Minoxidil correctly*\n\nAnywho, this week is two testosterone boosters (...) and Rogaine.\n\n[D-Aspartic Acid](http://examine.com/supplements/D-Aspartic+Acid/) should be seen as more like an amino acid stimulant than a testosterone booster, because it is. D-Asp is just a neurotransmitter that can both directly and indirectly (via NDMA) activate excitatory neurotransmitters. When it does this in the hypothalamus/pituitary region, it causes the release of luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, growth hormone, and alpha-melanocortin stimulating hormone.\n\nIt also just happens to build up in the testicles, where it ups the rate limit of testosterone synthesis causing a spike.\n\nNow, I like this molecule but it is horribly overrated. The testosterone spike was present but kinda insignificant for muscle building (might be nice for aphrodisia) or memory formation (which D-AA is implicated in) but it should be viewed more like L-Tyrosine than anything. Just an amino acid that could provide a small boost in the right direction or possibly form the basis of a 'stack'.\n\nAnd for the love of god it does not need an Aromatase Inhibitor.\n\n[Tribulus Terrestris](http://examine.com/supplements/Tribulus+Terrestris/) is the common testosterone booster that is said to not boost test. I am currently reverting my stance from 'not proven' to 'evidence for proof is weak at best'.\n\nIt is true that doses up to 450mg for 8 weeks have not boosted testosterone in man, and the animal studies in rabbits suggested this should have worked (and now many of you know why rabbits aren't used in research much anymore; much less reliable than rats or mice) the studies in rats are, for the most part, in castrated rats (which cannot easily be applied to humans). There is *one* rat study in Tribulus and one in Tribulus *alatus* (2 in total, assuming the species are similar enough) that suggest testosterone boosting at a dose of 50mg/kg in otherwise healthy; around 750mg for an adult moderate-heavy human.\n\nSo there is a dose range untested in humans for Tribulus, and it is both possible that only this dose works *and* that the benefits of Tribulus on testosterone are animal exclusive; both are plausible hypothesis' at this moment in time.\n\nIt doesn't help much that we don't have much clue as to the mechanisms of Tribulus, just one study about androgen receptor content but the alterations seen may explain aphrodisia but shouldn't explain an increase in testosterone.\n\nDoes appear to be an aphrodisiac (in mice, rats, and boars) and has lowered blood pressure in persons with hypertension. At least its healthy.\n\n[Minoxidil](http://examine.com/supplements/Minoxidil/): Still working on this one currently, just trying to summarize the information a bit better and put the useless fluff about its origin at the beginning\n\nMinoxidil just promotes the time a hair follicle spends in the phase where it grows (Anagen). It works best on non-androgenic hair loss, so *not* the receding hairline stuff; still works on receding hairlines, but the reliability as monotherapy is much lower and it would be wise to pair it with an anti-androgen (azelaic acid, ketoconazole; finasteride if you want an oral one for some god forsaken reason) \n",

Types of Hair Problems (3 Main Areas)\n\nAll common hair problems fall into one of these:\n\n1. **Hair Roots (Hair Below the Scalp)** – Hair fall, thinning, reduced density\n2. **Hair Strands (Hair Above the Scalp)** – Dryness, breakage, roughness\n3. **Scalp Issues** – Dandruff, oiliness, itching, inflammation\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 🧠 2. Hair Root Care – Stop Hair Fall & Grow Stronger Hair\n\nHair fall starts when hair roots weaken or hair becomes thinner. If ignored, it leads to visible scalp and low density.\n\n🛑 **Step 1: Block DHT**\n\n* **Finasteride 1 mg/day** (tablet or topical): Blocks DHT (main reason for male hair loss).\n* Recommended if hair loss is **Stage 2 or more** on Norwood scale.\n\n**💉 Step 2: Improve Blood Flow to Hair Roots**\n\n* **Minoxidil 5%**: Increases blood supply to hair follicles, delivering more nutrients.\n* Apply once or twice daily.\n* For very early hair fall (Stage 1–2), some doctors prefer starting with **caffeine-based or peptide serums** first.\n\n**💊 Step 3: Provide Proper Nutrients**\n\nEven if blood supply increases, without the right nutrients, hair won’t grow strong. Include:\n\n|Supplement|Benefit|\n|:-|:-|\n|**Biotin**|Strengthens hair strands|\n|**Multivitamin (with Zinc, Vitamin D, and B-complex)**|Fixes hidden deficiencies|\n|**Omega-3 or Fish Oil**|Reduces inflammation, nourishes follicles|\n\n**🧪 Step 4: Peptide-Based Serums (for Root Stimulation)**\n\nThese serums contain **plant-based peptides and natural growth factors** that help activate weak or resting follicles without the side effects of stronger medications.\n\n|Serum|Key Ingredients|Benefits|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Redensyl**|DHQG + EGCG2|Activates hair stem cells, reduces hair fall|\n|**Capixyl**|Biomimetic peptide + red clover|Strengthens follicles, reduces inflammation|\n|**Anagain**|Pea sprout extract|Extends hair growth phase (anagen)|\n|**The Ordinary Multi-Peptide Hair Serum**|Blend of multiple peptides|Boosts density, nourishes scalp|\n\n✅ Best used **once daily** on a dry scalp.

Hair Strand Care – Improve Hair Texture, Strength & Shine\n\nThis is the visible part of hair above the scalp. You need to:\n\n**🧴 Use Hair Oil (Carefully)**\n\n* Oil gives moisture and reduces breakage.\n* But **avoid putting oil on the scalp** too often — it can cause dandruff or feed fungus.\n* Apply oil **only on the hair length**, 1–2 times a week, and **wash off properly**.\n\n**🧼 Use Conditioner (Not on Scalp)**\n\n* After shampoo, apply conditioner **only on hair strands** to reduce dryness and tangles.\n\n**💆 Use Hair Mask (Deep Conditioning Treatment)**\n\nHair masks are like super-conditioners. Use them 1–2 times a week to:\n\n* Deeply moisturize dry hair\n* Make hair soft, smooth, and shiny\n* Reduce frizz and split ends\n\n🧴 Choose masks with ingredients like coconut oil, argan oil, shea butter, keratin, or aloe vera.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 🧴 4.

Hard Water vs Soft Water\n\n# 🔹 Hard Water (contains high levels of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals):\n\n* **Effects on Hair:**\n   * Leaves behind mineral deposits on hair strands.\n   * Causes **dry, rough, dull, and brittle hair**.\n   * Can lead to **more hair breakage and tangling**.\n* **Effects on Scalp:**\n   * **Clogs scalp pores**, leading to dandruff or scalp acne.\n   * May cause **itching or irritation**.\n   * Reduces the effectiveness of shampoo and conditioner (hair doesn’t feel clean).\n\n# 🔹 Soft Water (low mineral content):\n\n* **Effects on Hair:**\n   * Makes hair feel **softer and smoother**.\n   * Helps shampoos and conditioners work better.\n   * Prevents mineral buildup, making hair **shinier and more manageable**.\n* **Effects on Scalp:**\n   * Gentle on the scalp.\n   * Helps maintain **natural oil balance**.\n\n# 🌡️ 2. Water Temperature\n\n* **Hot Water:**\n   * Strips natural oils from hair and scalp.\n   * Can cause **dryness, itching, and frizz**.\n   * May weaken hair roots over time.\n* **Cold or Lukewarm Water:**\n   * Retains natural oils.\n   * Helps **seal the hair cuticle**, making hair shinier and smoother.\n   * Best for the final rinse.\n\n# 🧪 3. Chlorinated Water (Swimming Pools)\n\n* Damages the hair shaft.\n* Causes **dryness, discoloration (especially in colored hair), and split ends**.\n* Irritates the scalp and worsens **scalp sensitivity or dandruff**.\n\n# ✅ Solutions if You Have Hard Water\n\n* Install a **shower filter** that removes minerals and chlorine. (or use filtered water from water purifier only for hair wash)\n* Use **chelating or clarifying shampoos** once a week (they remove mineral buildup).\n* Rinse with **apple cider vinegar + water (1:4 ratio)** to remove residue.\n* Apply **deep conditioning masks** to restore moisture.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# # Is Finasteride Safe? Can You Take It Without Doctor Consultation?\n\n**Finasteride** (commonly used for male pattern baldness at **1 mg/day**) is generally **effective and relatively safe** when taken correctly - but **it should NOT be taken without a doctor’s consultation**, especially for long-term use.\n\n# 🔍 Why You Need Doctor Consultation\n\nFinasteride changes your **hormone levels** by reducing DHT (dihydrotestosterone), the hormone responsible for hair loss. Since it alters your body's chemistry, a doctor should:\n\n* Assess if it’s safe based on your medical history\n* Decide the right **dose** and **form** (oral vs. topical)\n* Monitor side effects and hormone balance\n\n# ✅ Is Low-Dose Finasteride (1 mg/day) Safe?\n\nYes, **low-dose Finasteride (1 mg/day)** is considered **relatively safe for most healthy adult men**, especially under medical guidance. In fact, this is the **standard dose** used to treat androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness).\n\nBut even low doses **can have side effects**—though not everyone experiences them.\n\n# ⚠️ Common Side Effects (in 1–10% of users)\n\n* Low libido (reduced sexual desire)\n* Erectile dysfunction\n* Reduced semen volume\n* Breast tenderness or enlargement\n* Depression or mood changes\n\nThese are often **mild and reversible** if the drug is stopped.\n\n# ⚠️ Rare but Serious Risks\n\n* **Post-Finasteride Syndrome (PFS)** – Persistent sexual, neurological, or psychological symptoms after stopping (very rare, still debated)\n* Gynecomastia (male breast growth)\n* Severe depression or anxiety (in rare cases)\n\n# 👨‍⚕️ Who Should Avoid Finasteride Without Supervision\n\n* People with **liver issues**\n* History of **depression or sexual dysfunction**\n* **Those planning to conceive soon** (Finasteride may affect sperm in rare cases)\n* **Women and children** (especially pregnant women)\n\n# 🔍 Monitoring Required If You Take It\n\n* **DHT levels** (optional, but helpful)\n* **Liver function tests**\n* **Prostate exam** (PSA levels can be falsely

        "body": "Errors in your guide which even ChatGPT cannot correct. Hence why you should not use it as a personal doctor. Allow me to correct it from using what is proven and in accordance with my knowledge. \n\nA) In section 1. Types of Hair problems. The root cause of both hairloss, hair thinning, breakage and Density is all causes by DHT. DHT is a useless harmone in adults which is converted from testosterone (good harmone) with an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase (5AR). So all those problems are solved by Finasteride which is 5AR1 inhibitor.\nRegarding scalp with dandruff and flaking problem - 1% ketoconazole is enough. \nAnd that is all \n\nReferences:\n\n1) Shin J, Chung E, Kim M, Kim T, Kim W, Huh C. Evaluation of long‐term efficacy of finasteride in Korean men with androgenetic alopecia using the basic and specific classification system. J Dermatol. 2019;46(2):139-143. doi:10.1111/1346-8138.14719\n\n2) Yanagisawa M, Fujimaki H, Takeda A, Nemoto M, Sugimoto T, Sato A. Long-term (10-year) efficacy of finasteride in 523 Japanese men with androgenetic alopecia. Clin Res Trial. 2019;5(5). doi:10.15761/CRT.1000273\n\n3) Gupta AK, Venkataraman M, Talukder M, Bamimore MA. Finasteride for hair loss: a review. Journal of Dermatological Treatment. 2022;33(4):1938-1946. doi:10.1080/09546634.2021.1959506\n\nAnd here you go. This is all you need to solve all the problems mentioned in section 1. \n\nB) Bloodflow Theory - This theory stated a century ago that bludflow restriction caused by wearing tight hats and creating tension in scalp is the reason for male pattern baldness. this theory has been overused till this day to sell Nonsense products. This theory has been debunked over century ago (1916) by Dorothy Osborn. \n\nReferences : \n1) Osborn D. INHERITANCE OF BALDNESS. Journal of Heredity. 1916;7(8):347-355. doi:10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a110746\n\n2) Nor does wearing Hats or Helmets cause any damage to hair. Here is the study : \nTellez-Segura R. Involvement of Mechanical Stress in Androgenetic Alopecia. Int J Trichology. 2015;7(3):95-99. doi:10.4103/0974-7753.167468 \n\n3) Shoemaker JK, Tiidus PM, Mader R. Failure of manual massage to alter limb blood flow: measures by Doppler ultrasound. Med Sci Sports Exerc. 1997;29(5):610-614. doi:10.1097/00005768-199705000-00004\n\nConclusion : Never drive bike without Helmet and caps when going out in sun without any worries of Bludflow. \n\nC) Supplements are called supplements because they are not FDA approved. When it is not FDA approved, companies can put anything in it without having to disclose the proper composition. So it's best to avoid them or take FDA approved vitamins. Imo just finasteride is enough to solve all hairloss problems. \n\nD) Microneedling does not work as a standalone treatment nor is it safe as a long term usage. it is observed in 3 studies that Microneedling combined with  topical 5%minoxidil has more efficacy than just standalone microneedling and topical minoxidil. This is because the efficacy of minoxidil increases due to channels in epidermis caused by microneedling. \nThere is no standardized protocol for microneedling, so anyone can just dismiss the ineffectiveness of microneedling using No-true Scotsman falacy even when there is compelling evidence to prove otherwise. \nBasically Microneedling is causing inflammation in the scalp and in long term it will become chronic inflammation. Ultimately creating Scar tissue in scalp resulting in a similar situation to what androgenetic alopecia does to scalp. \nI.e back to square one.\nApplying Tretinoin is better than microneedling along with minoxidil to give maximum benefits to hair growth.\n\nReferences: \n1) Chronic inflammation in the etiology of disease across the life span\nDavid Furman et al. Nat Med. 2019 Dec.\n\n2) Unusual Presentation of Tinea Corporis Associated With the Use of a Microneedling Device\nNélia Margarida Martins da Cunha et al. Aesthet Surg J. 2017.\n\nE) Stop using oils if your scalp is already oily. Adding more oils will not benifit in any way. It may even create more grounds for fungal infections.",

        "body": "Please for the love of Hairs, stop asking GPT and Reddit on hair care routine. It never ends well. Consult a proper Dermat (not someone who says to rub oil) and monitor your scalp condition. \n\nWhat has worked for me : \n1. 1mg finasteride orally per day keeps the hair transplant doctor away. ( Only Finasteride/Dutasteride will cure your hairfall issue which is caused by DHT- a useless harmone in adults (useful until puberty passes). \n\n2. Ketoconazole %1 shampoo (%1 is already most effective and strong. Using 2% is overkill unless you suffer from severe case of seborrheic dermatitis. I use it once or twice a week.\n\n3. Never needed topical Minoxidil but it helps only in compliment with Finasteride. Never used minoxidil alone as it does not solve the hairloss issue.\n\n4. I use Tresemme sulphate free shampoo + conditioner for regular use. \n\n5. When I don't use conditioner, I use Kraves wax for styling along with a cold air blower.(Only occasionally)\n\n6. I don't use any oils because my scalp is oily. Applying more will worsen the dandruff problem. \n\n\nThings to Note : \n1. No other serum works unless it does have proper clinical trials and meta analysis studies on it.\n\n2. Never fall for all natural and organic scams. They do not work. be skeptical. Never be blinded by a brand and Fake doctors who claim ridiculous 'CURES'. They do so because people fear drugs and they don't have any evidence or proof of the efficacy. \n\n3. Depending on food and diet as your only way to fight the Slap head curse is a bad idea. Food is food not a medicine. Just because our ancestors used it, does not mean it's good. Our ancestors did not have knowledge nor the protocols for developing cures and conducting clinical trials. \nThe most heinous diseases like TB black death, Hairloss etc have been cured by Pharmaceuticals. So don't fear drugs.\n\n4. DON'T use microneedling. It will cause scar tissue in your scalp which will permanently remove any chance of you growing new hair in that area.\n\n5. Exercise is a must. Never skip a leg day.",

I feel like scratching my head and have lost some hair and it became patchy on one side where I scratched. I don’t see hair follicles there and I am afraid it’s permanent. Not sure if that hair will come back, hope its a temporary hair loss.\nwhat should be the length of hair I should keep so that its easy for me to clean. I feel like going bald, so that atleast i know where the flakes are and I clean it properly.\n\nAlso what should be the length of hair one should keep optimal for applying all the above treatments like minoxidil, dermaroller. Is a normal dermaroller better or something like dermapen is useful. Can you use same dermaroller on face after cleaning.",

Since then I’ve stuck to the basics.\n\nThe second photo is from today – taken in natural sunlight, no concealers, no filters.\nHair feels denser, healthier, and overall much better than where I started.

    "body": "Summer 2024 I realized my hair was shedding quite a bit. I also noticed that, although, my temples were never my strong suit, the hair there was become thinner and thinner. \n\nI tried swapping shampoos out and switched to Nizoral. September 2024 I had COVID, which we know doesn’t help. By December, I was at wits end, shedding so much every time I showered or brushed my hair. I ordered Minoxidil and Nutrafol. I then realized how dangerous Minoxidil is for pets, so I didn’t end up using it, and just stuck to Nutrafol.  I started taking it December 8 which is when I took my before images . The more I read about Minoxidil the more I wanted to avoid it, as I didn’t want to be stuck using it forever, and I was worried about the side effects. I also began taking iron (I use this every other day) and vitamin d (daily) around this time. \n\nMid January I saw my dermatologist who said she thought it was stress related. She said I was doing the right thing by using Nizoral, Nutrafol, and my vitamins. She upped my then dose of 50mg of Spiro to 75mg (I was previously on it for acne). She ordered an RX for 2% Ketoconazole shampoo which I ended up only using once because I hated how it made my hair feel. She also recommended I use rosemary oil in my hair before washing, and I had a Briogeo Rosemary serum, but to be honest I don’t use it because I’m too lazy. Around this time, or a few weeks after, I buckled down on taking my Inositol supplement I had taken a while back because once again my period was irregular. Realizing now that taking this supplement could  also be helping.\n\nSo here I am today: I take Nutrafol, vitamin D, iron, Inositol, and 75 mg Spiro. Sounds like a lot but I take other vitamins and am pretty health conscious so I don’t mind. I wash my hair around 2 times a week, shampooing with Nizoral twice a wash. Each time I shampoo I also use a scalp massager around my hair line. Post-shower I lightly blow dry my scalp so water doesn’t sit and I use leave in conditioner and Olaplex oil on the rest of my hair. \n\nI had gotten my hair cut right before I started this journey in December and just got my hair cut for the first time since, the other day, and my hairdresser told me I have a lot of baby hairs and my scalp seems more dense. I’m now able to visually see the difference, myself! The time between photos wasn’t even 4 months, so I’m counting this as a win! \n\nI know this is long, but I thought I’d share, because I was desperate to see that other women were having luck without Minoxidil when starting my journey. My hairline is doing much better and my hair in general feels and looks a lot healthier. ",

But the little indents might not go away without a in clinic treatment.\n\nI am pretty sure you're allowed to post your routine as long as you give a caution statement for the prescription only things. If you don't want to do that, you could choose not to name the product and just give the active ingredients?\n\nTalk to your doc once your acne subsides on what you can do for the red marks and scars. Good luck and really appreciate seeing someone actually going to a derm rather than asking complete strangers to come up with a routine for them.",
