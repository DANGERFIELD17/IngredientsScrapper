    "body": "https://imgur.com/a/Q0lyvOU\n\nThis was taken after my skincare routine so I might be a lil shiny.\n\nIf anyone could enlighten me on what this is I'd appreciate it! Acne cyst? Normal cyst? Nodule? Ten inflamed pores having a Halloween party?\n\nThanks in advance. I'll leave some info below but it's cool if you can't be bothered reading it.\n\n**PREVIOUSLY ON \"HELP MY SKIN IS A DRAMA QUEEN\"**...(if anyone's interested, I love reading people's stories).\n\nI'm 24 F in the UK. I've had acne since I was 12ish. I got it from my Dad who took antibiotics for his skin for a ridiculous number of years until he died. We both got/get big under the skin cysts/nodes/red explosions of anger all over our faces which leave PIE, but I would also get hormonal acne (cysts and pustules) on my chin which also leaves PIE. Some of the red marks you see are years old. I never pick or squeeze.\n\nMy skin is *very oily* but I have a few dry patches so I'd say its combination. Possibly dehydrated. Whatever it is, it runs in the family.\n\nTried all sorts of topicals for my skin as a teen but as I had undiagnosed (now diagnosed) ADHD, routinely using them was a challenge. As an insecure teen I also couldn't cope with the peeling/dry skin. So I would give up.\n\nFrom 18 to 20, things were chill. Would still get hormomal acne but cysts were few and far between. Then from 20 to 23, it slowly got worse again as I started a PhD.\n\nSo at the end of last year I got into a routine with my ADHD meds and started a skincare routine full of acids which didn't do anything to help my acne. I realised I needed divine intervention from the NHS. Got given Duac and antibiotics as a prescription from the GP and was told they'd refer me to derm if it didn't get better. Got a new basic skincare routine with no other actives (I can't remember what this consisted of except I used the LaRoche Posay moisturiser designed for skin made dry with acne treatments. I'll post my current routine below). I also went vegan January of last year which helped a lot, especially with my hormonal acne. Hated the antibiotics but used Duac for about 4 months and had an amazing result. Clearest skin I've ever had. PIE was still there but I honestly didn't care as long as the active acne was gone.\n\n**PRESENT DAY**: Fell out of my routine over Summer with bad mental health (a recurring theme). Acne came back. Eventually, so did my resolve to tackle it. Bought Duac privately (helping the NHS and all that) again and started my routine again. Happy with how my skin is looking and then this badboy pops up (possibly a purge).\n\n**ROUTINE** (again if you care):\n\nPreparing for the Duac and winter dryness my focus was on hydration. \n\nMorning - Wash with CosRX morning gel cleanser,  Hado Labo lotion thingy, BodyShop Vitamin E essence, TO Niacinimide/Zinc, TO Alpha Arbutin, Vitamin E gel moisturiser. No SPF yet (CosRX aloe SPF is on its way as is TO Ascorbyl Glucoside).\n\n(FYI: The Vit E range has wheat germ oil which is HIGHLY comodogenic apparently. I should have researched the range more before buying but I saw \"hydrating\" and went for it. I don't think it's broken me out but then again there's an inflamed 5 pence coin sized lump on my face...). \n\nAfternoon: Hefty dose of PhD stress.\n\nNight: Remove eye make up with micellar water, double cleanse with BodyShop chamomile oil then CosRX gentle morning cleanser. Hado Labo lotion. Duac. Wait for 30 minutes (especially as I'm using a moisturiser with antioxidant properties). BodyShop VitE night cream or Antipodes night cream.\n\n\nIf you read this whole thing I'm super impressed. Thanks for reading.\n\n\n",

I keep to my routine, sometimes adding some type of acid directly on the pimple, or some diluted tea tree oil.  Once I see a head pop through, I carefully squeeze a bit, clean out some of the plug, then add a hydrocolloid bandage for as long as possible (overnight).  Always keep it hydrated though. Drying out will just make it stay longer.  Sometimes adding some Vaseline overnight after it’s popped helps with the healing process. \nGood luck friend!",

This was my first sunscreen I bought after leaning about photoaging! My first baby! And we were off to a good start. It’s a white watery gel-like texture, light weight, invisible, but quite shiny (some might call this a dewy finish, but I prefer a skin-like finish). A good poster child for the typical Asian sunscreen, I guess. It is not water resistant, and you'll notice this as you sweat throughout the day: It’s like your sweat becomes heavier since it mixes with the sunscreen (you can’t see this of course, but it sure feels like it). I was also worried about touching my face throughout the day, because I felt I might rub the sunscreen off. I can’t remember it ever stinging my eyes, but I’m not entirely sure. The biggest drawback for me was the prize and how inaccessible it is in my country. At this point in time, I also hadn’t learnt about the proper amount of sunscreen you have to use, so I was probably underapplying, and the sunscreen can therefore have appeared lighter-textured in my memory. It contains a lot of fragrance and many ingredients, in general, so that could be irritating. A little bit of science: If you look at the UV filters, there are several UVB filters; many UVB (290-320 wavelength/nm) filters also “bleed into” and filter some UVA II (320-340) as well. The Uvinul A plus filters both UVA II and I (340-400), but it’s also the only UVA filter in this sunscreen, and it’s also the last ranking UV filter on the ingredient list, even though I’ve read that the upper limit for Uvinul A plus is 10% (of the total product). So, is there enough UVA protection? I don’t know, but it’s probably okay since the Pa is four pluses, so I wouldn’t worry too much about it. Packaging is nice and it has a pump, and you get 75 ml, not only the standard 50 ml.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Avène Hydrance OPTIMALE UV RICHE Rich hydrating cream**\n\n* \\- **SPF 20, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **40 ml/1.35 Fl.OZ**\n* \\- **Probably suitable for darker skin tones**\n* \\- **France**\n* \\- **Ingredients:** AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA).

It does not have high enough UV protection, and it is not designed to be used as a sunscreen, and therefore you will end up underapplying. I bought it because I was looking for a day cream at the time. I wanted something for my dry skin and this day cream worked in that regard. But never did I ever apply close to the amount of sunscreen you have to apply to get the labelled SPF and UVA protection. It is on the heavier side, so applying a quarter teaspoon to your face would not feel nice. Trust me. And even then, you’d only get SPF 20. I would not recommend anyone to use this product as a daily SPF product. It also contains fragrance even though it says it’s suitable for sensitive skin.\n* \\- **Score:** 2/5\n\n**NIVEA SUN UV FACE ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS SPF 30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I must have gone though three of these. It has a lot in common with the MAKE P:REM one, and it also shares some of the same problems. It has a similar texture: white watery-gel, which turns translucent on top of the skin. It’s like a glycerine-rich moisturiser. I think it’s less shiny as well – more skin-like finish. The problem arises when you sweat: your sweat starts feeling even heavier than normal. I think I experienced some eye stinging with this sunscreen (nothing major), largely caused by it not being water resistant. It’s important to note that the reason it is so cosmetically elegant is also why it’s not water resistant. I was also scared to touch my face and accidently rub it off while wearing this one, too. It’s smells like sunscreen. If you’ve ever purchased a NIVEA sunscreen, you’ll know what I mean. And the fragrance doesn’t go away immediately either. My biggest problem at the time, was also that I wanted to find a SPF 50 sunscreen, and this one is only SPF 30. I think I’ve recently seen a SPF 50 version of this since, so if you live in Europe, I guess it’s worth giving it a shot. Looking at the ingredient list now, I see that it contains a lot of avobenzone. Avobenzone has a bad rep, but you cannot deny how effectively it protects against UVA when photostable. Avobenzone on its own is not photostable and will start degrading (and be used up) when exposed to the sun or UV light. In this sunscreen, however, (and most non-American sunscreens) it has been stabilised by another UV filter: In this case by Tinosorb S. I think this sunscreen might have much higher UVA protection than the EU requirement, which makes sense since it’s advertised as “ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS”.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Piz Buin Ultra Light Dry Touch Face Fluid SPF 30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Sweat and water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

This sunscreen survived me walking all around Madrid for a week in the middle of summer. Boom. What a trooper. The texture is a thick liquid, not a cream, so the opening is narrow so you can pour some into your hand or tilt your head backwards and pour it directly on your face. It dries to an almost powdery finish – it truly is dry touch. If you have dry skin, you should probably moisturise beforehand. It was also easy enough to reapply when I was out and about in Madrid; So, layering it wasn’t a chore. If you don’t apply it evenly it might dry down with some flakes even – that’s how dry it is. But I didn’t feel like it dried out my skin in the process, but that is of course a very personal observation. I would have been perfect if it was SPF 50, a little less expensive, and fragrance free. If you’ve ever tried a Piz Buin sunscreen, you’ll recognise their trademark fragrance at once: masculine and sunscreen-like. It does bring back good memories of summer and beaches for me personally, though.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**THE BODY SHOP Vitamin E Day Lotion SPF30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I could barely open them in broad daylight, and I had to go back home and wash my face to get it off. Do not, under any circumstances apply this close to your eyes. I don’t know what caused it: maybe all the perfume, or the UV filters? Also, the way this product smells, is absolutely abhorrent. Old lady perfume, and it’s so strong.

I have very pale skin (and am therefore really scared of “universal tints”), but it blended perfectly into my skin tone, perhaps with the slightest bit of coverage. Since it’s a mineral sunscreen, I’m sceptical if it’ll blend into darker skin, even with the tint, so that’s something to keep in mind. It might also have photo flashback, you have been warned. Even though it is silicone based, I wouldn’t describe it as “silicone-y”, if you know what I mean; it has a skin like finish. However, I don’t think I ever applied enough of it to truly know what its finish is like… First and foremost: the packaging. When I bought it, they still used a dropper – I repeat a dropper. This did not work, as the product would spill over, clump up at the inner edges of the bottle’s mouth, etc. And since it clumped up at the sides, I honestly don’t know if I’ve lost some of the UV protection of the product, since it’s no longer a completely homogenous liquid. They later changed the dropper to a pump, but it’s still embarrassing that they ever sold it with a dropper. What were they thinking? You also spend quite a bit of time applying it evenly on your skin, due to its consistency and tint. You kind of have to apply it like a foundation. Since it’s only 30 ml, it means that you should be finishing one of these in less than a month – and only if you’re just applying it to your face. At least it doesn’t have any fragrance! It does have an iffy smell to it, which goes away. Taking into consideration the cost, the packaging (even though it has improved) the fact that it’s not a SPF 50, PA++++ product, you’re left with a very mediocre sunscreen. It could however serve as a daily serum on top of your sunscreen, if you’re very extra.\n* \\- **Score:** 3/5\n\n**Altruist Dermatologist Sunscreen SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I had really high expectations for Altruist, same as many others, and I was let down. It isn’t that bad of a sunscreen, but it’s also not that good. At this point in my quest for the Holy grail sunscreen, I realised I had to up my UV game. SPF 30 wasn’t enough, and I wanted as high of an UVA protection as possible. With the EU’s regulation of UVA protection (in a nutshell the UVA protection has to be 1/3 of the SPF), you could, in theory, end up with SPF 30 sunscreens that had higher UVA protection than your SPF 50 sunscreen. And as a consumer, you simply wouldn’t know the difference. Anyway, Altruist SPF 50, has perfect UV protection, and no fragrance and such. In theory it’s the perfect sunscreen. I mean, look at all those filters (seriously why are there so many, did the chemists make a bet or something?) But in practice? Not so much. First and foremost, if you have darker skin, this might leave a white cast due to the titanium dioxide. Some people have mentioned this in their reviews and some people have also mentioned it stinging their eyes (I can’t remember noticing this). Secondly, the reason I didn’t like it, is because of the texture. It’s the same sort of texture as the MAKE P:REM and NIVEA mentioned above, just less cosmetically elegant. I thought it would dry down or sink into my face, but it never did. I would wait for 20 minutes, and I would still be sticky and a little bit shiny. What worked was putting a lot of translucent powder on top, then I would finally achieve a more skin like finish. Pro tip: Translucent powder can actually make most sunscreens bearable. Since it didn’t dry down, I felt as I would rub it off if my face touched anything. Maybe this sunscreen would work for people with dry skin? Since applying this sunscreen, waiting, applying powder, would take such a long time, I ended up just using a different sunscreen. And I guess that says it all. It also has a “chemical” smell to it, but that didn’t bother me. It might not have worked for my face, but it’s still a good sunscreen for the rest of the body.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Skinnies Sungel SPF30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, broad spectrum, PA++++ (PPD 16+)**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

This sunscreen utilises a new technology called Organogel™. It contains no water, and thus it doesn’t have to dry down, and you only need 1/5 the amount of a normal sunscreen. You heard that right: 1/5! So, you only need a pea-sized amount for your entire face! But I used a little bit more than that, because real peas are actually very small, so when people say pea-sized, they usually mean 2-3 real peas. A photo from their website illustrating what they meant by pea-sized confirmed my suspicion. But it’s still a very small amount! The texture is that of a see-through slightly orange-y gel. It’s oily, but it doesn’t move on your skin (also when you sweat). And it’s completely see-though so I can with confidence say it’ll suit every skin tone. It doesn’t completely dry down, though, but it does seem to sink into your skin a little bit, if you wait a couple of minutes. You can feel the gel on your skin when you touch it, but you wouldn’t notice you had anything on otherwise. Since it isn’t water based it also feels sturdier than the others I’ve tried, so I wasn’t as scared of it rubbing off when touching my skin. I think it might work very well as a primer. It has a slight “chemical” smell, it also doesn’t contain any perfume or any nonsense like that. It’s on the pricier side, but one 100ml bottle is actually the equivalent of 500ml of normal sunscreen, when you think about it, so I think the prize is justifiable. This was the sunscreen I kept on using when the Altruist one wasn’t working for me, by the way. It’s definitely the quickest sunscreen to apply of all the sunscreens I’ve ever used. A con is that is a little bit difficult to gauge if you are using enough, and that you’ve applied it evenly. Turns out there are two versions of this sunscreen: An American one and a New Zealand one. I somehow ended up with the American one, and it has worked just fine for me. The NZ version uses non-FDA approved filters, but it still has the same UVB and UVA protection listed, but I would still recommend you buy the NZ version, since there must be a reason why they chose to not just use the same formulation as the American one, right? Since I bought my bottle, they have also released many new products, like an SPF 50+. If the SPF 50+ behaves the same way as this one, I think I might have given it a score of 5/5. But keep in mind that it does not have a dry-touch finish (more of an immovable oily finish), but at least it has a sturdy one.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**The Balm BALMSHELTER TINTED MOISTURIZER (Shade: Lighter Than Light)**\n\n* \\- **SPF 18, broad spectrum**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **64 ml/ 2.15 Fl.

Note that this tinted moisturiser is much lighter than any of The Balm’s other products labelled “Lighter Than Light”. It’s really is a pale shade (it appears darker before you spread it over your skin), and it blends perfectly into my skin: I’ve never seen a tinted moisturiser or BB cream this fair before. However, it is so sheer, that the tint almost doesn’t matter. A little goes a long way, and that’s why you shouldn’t really use BB creams, tinted moisturisers and foundation as UV shields. I intended on using this on top of my sunscreen, but since it has next to none coverage, I never find myself reaching for it. If you’re pale as I am, and you want to experience the novelty of owning a tinted moisturiser, this is a good pick.

This sunscreen was bought in Europe. America/Canada/Australia/Asia might have a different version of this sunscreen, because of the country’s different restrictions on UV filters and sunscreen criteria (especially American sunscreens). These versions are not always equal, both in UV protection and cosmetic elegance. It also turns out that I have bought two versions of this sunscreen: A new and an older version. I actually bought the newest version first – and I loved it. I couldn’t understand how people hated it (the skincare community is very split when it comes to the Shaka fluid). Of course, everyone’s skin is difference and can have a lot to say on how a sunscreen feels and behaves on the skin. It’s a fluid, so you have to shake it thoroughly. It takes a little bit longer to apply, since it’s a fluid. It dries down matte, and you can’t see that you’re wearing anything. Easy peasy. Its biggest downfall is the prize (I bought it on sale) and that it only comes in a tiny 50ml, so you can’t buy it in bulk, so to speak. But this was the newest version (as of this year)… and then I ended up accidently buying the older version online (which might still be in production?), and oh boy, was that a different experience! Not dry-touch, but oily! They looked so similar, but I instantly felt the difference on my face, because it didn’t dry down. Absolutely horrible in comparison, I felt so gross. You can tell the new version from the old from the packaging: The newest version has “ANTI-OXYDANT” written underneath the “UVB + UVA” text. It has a similar texture as the Piz Buin mentioned above, but I personally think the Piz Buin is superior in texture: even more dry-touch. But the shaka outshines almost all sunscreens in terms of UVB and UVA protection, and it doesn’t have any irritating fragrance to boot. I thought this would be my final HG sunscreen, because it couldn’t get any better in terms of UV protection and cosmetic elegance.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5 (new “ANTI-OXYDANT” version, 2019) (old version: 4/5, because it still has great UV protection, okay?)\n\n**EVY TECHNOLOGY SUNSCREEN MOUSSE SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I found it. Perfect texture, high UV protection, and relatively affordable. It also comes in a 100 ml bottle, not a 50 ml, which I appreciate. According to EVY, their sunscreens work differently than other sunscreens, because they don’t lay on top of your skin and form a film, but instead they sink into the skin (stratum corneum, I presume). Because of this, they’re very water resistant and sturdy. You shake the bottle, turn it upside down, and squeeze out a golf ball-sized blob of mousse. (This mousse holds its shape pretty well and you can play with it.) Then I just rub the mousse into my face: first it turns into a light-weight white cream… and then it disappears into the skin. After a couple of minutes, there is no trace of it, but if I’ve applied to much there might be some stickiness. It certainly feels like it sinks into the skin, because it’s very hydrating. The other sunscreens I’ve liked, I’ve liked for their dry-touch finish, but with EVY I don’t need to worry about it, because I can’t feel it on my face when I touch (well, technically my face feels like it’s been hydrated) and it doesn’t do anything when I sweat. A Youtuber reviewed EVY and said that the Boots star system is only marketing – it’s not. While we have a universal measurement of UVB: SPF, we’ve later realised that UVA also causes skin damage and cancer, but we still haven’t been able to agree on one universal measurement or requirement. The Boots Star Rating system with a maximum of 5 stars requires much higher UVA protection than the European Recommendation, where the UVA protection only needs to be 1/3 of the SPF. Gothamista, however, really liked EVY. It has no fragrance, but a light aerosol smell that goes away. Because of the packaging, no preservatives are needed. It also contains some antioxidants. I’m already on my third bottle of EVY, and I will continue to purchase it in the future.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5\n\nSome sunscreens I’ve heard good things about and might want to try one day: Anessa sunscreens, Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50 PA ++++, Ultrasun sunscreens, Bioderma Photoderm Max Cream SPF50+.",

In addition, the long-term consumption of foods shown to be preventive against each cancer should conversely be promoted in order to maintain good health. \n\nIn order to reduce the cervical cancer risk, we may need to promote the **long-term consumption of antioxidants, such as vitamins A, C, D and E, carotenoids, vegetables and fruits, and avoid cigarette smoking.** To reduce the endometrial cancer risk, we should take care to avoid continuously consuming fat, energy sugar and acrylamide. To reduce the ovarian cancer risk, we should take care to avoid the long-term consumption of pro-inflammatory foods, including saturated fat, carbohydrates, animal proteins and acrylamide. \n\n📷\n\n**Some interesting notes from this study:**\n\n* **Eat your veggies goddamn it:** Recently, Barchitta et al. reported that a Western diet, which is characterized by the high intake of red and processed meats, dipping sauces, chips, and snacks with a low intake of olive oil, was associated with a higher risk of HPV infection \\[[20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6787610/#B20-healthcare-07-00088)\\]. A Western diet has been reported to lead to increased inflammation, reduced infection control and increased risk of developing auto-inflammatory disease \\[[21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6787610/#B21-healthcare-07-00088)\\]. In comparison to women who showed low adherence to a Mediterranean diet (MD), which includes vegetables legumes, fruits and nuts, cereals, fish, and a high ratio of unsaturated to saturated lipids, women with medium adherence to an MD had a lower risk of HPV infection \\[[20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6787610/#B20-healthcare-07-00088)\\]. Meanwhile, the low consumption of whole vegetables (including dark green, dark yellow, and dark orange vegetables and cruciferous vegetables), fruits (including fruit juices), yogurt, tofu, fish and meat was not protective against HPV persistence \\[[22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6787610/#B22-healthcare-07-00088)\\]. Supporting these results, Sedjo et al. reported that **higher levels of vegetable consumption were associated with a 54% reduction in the risk of HPV persistence** (odds ratio \\[OR\\]: 0.46) in a prospective cohort study \\[[23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6787610/#B23-healthcare-07-00088)\\].\n* **Consume Carotenoids for HPV persistence:** Giuliano et al. demonstrated that the **dietary intake of carotenoids (lutein, zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin), vitamin-C and papaya was associated with a reduced incidence of type-specific HPV persistence** in 433 HPV-positive women \\[[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6787610/#B24-healthcare-07-00088)\\]. **The intake of carotenoid (lutein) was also reported to be associated with a 50%–63% reduction in the risk of HPV persistence** in a prospective cohort study \\[[23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6787610/#B23-healthcare-07-00088)\\].\n* We should **avoid the long-term consumption of large amounts of high-risk foods and nutrients.** The key words for high-risk diets in gynecologic cancers seem to be “oxidant” “mutagenic” and “pro-inflammatory”. In contrast, the keywords for diets with preventive effects against gynecologic cancers seem to be “anti-oxidant” “anti-mutagenic” and “anti-inflammatory.” **A common dietary component with a preventive effect against gynecologic cancers seems to be the soybean. The intake of soy protein inhibited the proliferative activities of certain cancers.** In in vitro experiments, Rayaprolu et al. showed that soybean peptide fractions inhibited human blood (CCRF-CEM and Kasumi-3), breast (MCF-7) and prostate (PC-3) cancer cell lines by up to 68% \\[[169](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6787610/#B169-healthcare-07-00088)\\]. Soy protein contains isoflavone (one of the flavonoids) that has been reported to have anti-oxidant, anti-mutagenic and anti-proliferative properties \\[[148](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6787610/#B148-healthcare-07-00088)\\]. The long-term consumption of such good foods should be maintained for health. Western diets include the consumption of large amounts of animal protein, whereas traditional Japanese diets involve the consumption of large amounts of soy proteins. In Japan, the age-standardized ovarian cancer mortality rate is only 6.2 per 100,000 women \\[[170](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6787610/#B170-healthcare-07-00088)\\]. In contrast, the age-standardized mortality rates in women in the USA and UK were 7.0 and 12.7 per 100,000 women, respectively.\n   * (May be a controversial take on soy, I recommend looking of the effects of soy deeper, but this is interesting nonetheless)\n* **Avoid red and processed meat: Positive associations between a high intake of red meat \\[**[**119**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6787610/#B119-healthcare-07-00088)**,**[**120**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6787610/#B120-healthcare-07-00088)**\\] or processed meat \\[**[**120**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6787610/#B120-healthcare-07-00088)**,**[**121**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6787610/#B121-healthcare-07-00088)**\\] and the ovarian cancer risk were reported in case-control studies.** Red meat and processed meat are sources of saturated fat and iron, which have been independently linked to carcinogenesis \\[[122](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6787610/#B122-healthcare-07-00088),[123](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6787610/#B123-healthcare-07-00088)\\] as well as the fat content of the meat \\[[123](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6787610/#B123-healthcare-07-00088)\\]. In addition, processed meats contribute to the formation of carcinogenic and mutagenic N-nitroso compounds \\[[124](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6787610/#B124-healthcare-07-00088)\\] and heterocyclic amines \\[[125](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6787610/#B125-healthcare-07-00088)\\]. \n* **Eat fish and chicken:** In contrast, some case-control studies have suggested that the **frequent intake of poultry \\[**[**121**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6787610/#B121-healthcare-07-00088)**,**[**126**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6787610/#B126-healthcare-07-00088)**\\] or fish \\[**[**120**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6787610/#B120-healthcare-07-00088)**,**[**121**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6787610/#B121-healthcare-07-00088)**,**[**127**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6787610/#B127-healthcare-07-00088)**\\] is associated with a 25–75% reduction in the ovarian cancer risk** in comparison to the infrequent intake of poultry or fish. This may be because poultry contains a lower proportion of saturated fatty acids (>30% vs. ≥45%) and a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (≥15% vs. <10%), in comparison to red meat.\n* **Avoid Acrylamide**: It is a chemical that can form in some foods—mainly plant-based foods—during high-temperature cooking processes like frying and baking. The major food sources of acrylamide are French fries and potato chips; crackers, bread, and cookies; breakfast cereals; canned black olives; prune juice; and coffee. Root vegetables including potatoes, sweet potatoes, beetroot, turnip, swede and parsnips can all carry high levels of the compound once they have been roasted or fried until darker brown or crispy. As well as high temperatures, long cooking times can increase levels of acrylamide even further. Here are some steps you can take to help decrease the amount of acrylamide that you and your family consume:\n* Frying causes acrylamide formation. If frying frozen fries, follow manufacturers' recommendations on time and temperature and avoid overcooking, heavy crisping or burning.\n* Toast bread to a light brown color rather than a dark brown color. Avoid very brown areas.\n* Cook cut potato products such as frozen french fries to a golden yellow color rather than a brown color. Brown areas tend to contain more acrylamide.\n* Do not store potatoes in the refrigerator, which can increase acrylamide during cooking. Keep potatoes outside the refrigerator in a dark, cool place, such as a closet or a pantry.\n   * (This is why they say burning food can cause cancer)\n\n(https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/you-can-help-cut-acrylamide-your-diet)\n\n**The lowdown: Foods to consume:**\n\n* **Vitamin A:**\n   * Cheese\n   * Eggs\n   * Oily fish\n   * Yellow, red and green (leafy) vegetables, such as spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes and red peppers\n   * Yellow fruit, such as mango, papaya and apricots\n   * (https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-a/)\n* **C:**\n   * Cantaloupe\n   * Citrus Fruits\n   * Broccoli\n   * Red Cabbage\n   * Kiwi\n   * Red Bell Peppers\n   * (https://www.webmd.com/diet/foods-high-in-vitamin-c#2-3)\n* **D:**\n   * Salmon\n   * Egg yolks\n   * Mushrooms\n   * Fortified foods\n   * (https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/9-foods-high-in-vitamin-d#Supplements-101:-Vitamin-D)\n* **E:** \n   * Wheat germ oil\n   * Sunflower, safflower, and soybean oil\n   * Sunflower seeds\n   * [Almonds](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/almonds/)\n   * Peanuts, peanut butter\n   * Beet greens, collard greens, spinach\n   * [Pumpkin](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/winter-squash/)\n   * Red bell pepper\n   * Asparagus\n   * Mango\n   * Avocado\n   * (https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/vitamin-e/)\n* **Carotenoids (lutein, zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin):**\n   * Key sources of these carotenoids include **kale, parsley, spinach, broccoli and peas.** Kale is one of the best sources of lutein with 48–115 mcg per gram of kale. By comparison, a carrot may only contain 2.5–5.1 mcg of lutein per gram. \n   * **Orange juice, honeydew melon, kiwis, red peppers, squash and grapes** are also good sources of lutein and zeaxanthin, and you can find a decent amount of lutein and zeaxanthin in durum wheat and corn as well. \n   * In addition, **egg yolk** may be an important source of lutein and zeaxanthin, as the high fat content of the yolk may improve the absorption of these nutrients. \n   * **Fats improve the absorption of lutein and zeaxanthin, so including them in your diet, such as some olive oil in a green salad or some butter or coconut oil with your cooked greens, is a good idea.

    "body": "The prices of LUSH lotions and scrubs have hit the point where I will no longer pay for a full size (I still love the Kitchen Box) if I can make my own with a dupe fragrance or by repurposing a less expensive product. I’ve been experimenting and my textures are close to LUSH textures. \n\nThis is a snow fairy scrub ($30 for a scrub, no thank you. $3 (if that) for the same size, that’s better!) made with a Snow Fairy shower jelly, some SF shower gel, glycerin, jojoba oil, argan oil, wheat germ oil, Vitamin E oil, avocado oil, confectioners sugar, and regular sugar. \n\nA Honey I Washed The Kids scented lotion is made with cocoa butter, shea butter, avocado oil, jojoba oil, argan oil, wheat germ oil, Vitamin E oil, glycerin, dupe fragrance, and a base massage lotion. Cocoa butter is the most expensive part. Still, this pot was less than $5 to make. If I would have added olive oil, mine would have easily been as thick as the Dream Cream, but my daughter is allergic to olive trees and I’m going to send her some of this batch.\n\nSuper easy, fast, and fun (I just added a little of this, a little of that, until the texture felt good). I’m such a texture girl - I love getting to feel all the different textures as the product changes!",

    "body": "Waitrose have a skin/hair care line called 'Pure' which is fragrance free, hypoallergenic, cruelty free and uses mostly 'naturally derived' ingredients, whatever that means. It's also really cheap, and regularly on offer. I know this isn't a hair care sub, but their shampoo and conditioners are fab, and extremely good value. The dry/damaged conditioner is how I make it up to my hair for bleaching it to all hell. \n\nAnyway, I got a few of the skincare products a few months ago when they were doing 3 for 2. They're now on 1/3 off, so I thought I'd post some mini-reviews. \n\nI would describe my skin as oily, somewhat congested, and quick to anger. It’s also probably somewhat dehydrated by bad office aircon and just, like, winter in general. \n\n**Waitrose Pure Hydration Hot Cloth Cleanser** RRP £5, currently £3.33\nhttps://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-pure-hydration-hot-cloth/508007-539993-539994\n\n**Ingredients:** Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Candelilla Cera, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, Vitis Vinifera Seed Oil, Oryza Sativa Powder, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Triticum Vulgare Germ Oil, Gossypium Herbaceum Seed Oil, Aqua, Tocopherol,  Lecithin, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Phytate\n\n**Verdict:** God, I wanted to like this. I love hot cloth cleansers, and this one was so simple and cheap - and it even comes with a cloth! However, the rice powder totally ruins it for me - using a face cloth is exfoliating enough, and I don’t want even a gentle scrub on my face. If you are super into scrubbing your face, this might be perfect - it’s not going to rip you to shreds like walnut shells, and it’s not illegal  and murderous like microbeads. \n\nI was very sad about this until I realised that what I did now have was a super-luxurious body scrub. I used it the other day - I spent a long time massaging it into dry skin before taking a hot shower and washing it all off with a sponge. Because the cleanser’s so rich, my skin was very soft and moisturised afterwards, and a couple of days later the patches of KP I had were almost gone. I might do it again next weekend - it’s not really a weekday type thing because rubbing it all in takes ages, washing it all off also takes ages, and they’re both kind of the point (it’s sort of like a soothing diy massage) so you don’t want to hurry it.\n\n**Waitrose Pure Hydration Facial Oil** RRP £5, currently £3.33\nhttps://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-pure-hydration-facial-oil/862289-541045-541046\n\n**Ingredients:** Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Vitis Vinifera Seed Oil, Shea Butter Ethyl Esters, Gossypium Herbaceum Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil,  Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Prunus Persica Kernel Oil, Tocopherol, Citric Acid\n\n**Verdict:** Blergh. I sometimes do really well with facial oils - I really love the Boots Botanics Organic one - but this was just a nope all round. Bar the absence of smell, it just feels like I rubbed coconut oil into my skin. I shine with a thin film of grease. I might try it on my hair, maybe? Or try doing the OCM with it? I will say this, the packaging’s nice - a lovely frosted glass bottle - so I suppose if nothing else I can empty it out and put other things into it. As you can see, I’m trying really hard to find positives here.\n\n**Waitrose Pure Hydration Day Cream SPF 15** RRP £5, currently £3.33\nhttps://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-pure-hydration-day-cream-spf-15/450717-539849-539850\n(It says ‘this product is unavailable’ but it’s definitely for sale in multiple shops.)\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua (Water), Zinc Oxide (Nano), Coco-caprylate/Caprate, Shea Butter Ethyl Esters, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Olivate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Sorbitan Olivate, Propanediol, Cetyl Alcohol, Simmondsia Chinesis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Titanium Dioxide (Nano), Phenoxyethanol, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Aluminum Stearate, Sodium Phytate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Isostearic Acid, Alumina, Methylpropanediol, Tocopherol, Sodium Hydroxide, Gossypium Herbaceum (Cotton) Seed Extract, Lecithin, Polyglyceryl-3 Disostearate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Glyceryl Stearate\n\n**Verdict:** Hell to the yeah. I really really love this moisturiser, and have just rebought it as I’m getting near the bottom of the jar and it’s on offer again. I think it’s just that my skin is a big fan of zinc oxide, since I find that Sudocrem also calms my skin down a whole bunch. It’s thick and creamy, and feels very protective against the winter wind, and it’s the only thing that seems capable of withstanding a day in the weird dry recirculated air in my office. It’s not every day you find a physical-only sunscreen for such a low price, either, even if it is only SPF15. There’s a slight whiteness as you rub it in, and people with darker skin tones might find it leaves a cast - I’m not sure, as I haven’t noticed one, but my underlying skin colour’s quite pale and so it’s not always visible on me. On days when I especially don’t care about ruining the SPF aspect (ie most days right now because it’s deepest winter and I’m barely leaving the house anyway) I will often mix in a bit of Sea Kelp Bioferment. \n\nThe Pure Natural line is even cheaper. In particular, I think it’s great that they offer some really basic thick face creams with no fragrance. I’m probably going to try out their SLS free face wash at some point.",

    "body": "Hello! Good morning, & how do you all do?\n\nToday I am going to be delving into skincare! In particular, the indie skincare brand, **Chikyu**. You can find the storefront on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Chikyu?ref=simple-shop-header-name&listing_id=572367388) as well as a personal business [website](https://chikyuskincare.com/). For thorough information about each ingredient & benefits please check the site listings. I haven’t even made a dent in the items I want to try from the catalog, but I feel as if I have acquired enough product (purchasing & through generous samples) that it was time to do reviews. Be prepared for a rave fest! Also I might break this up in different posts, to keep it from being a slog of reading.\n\nTAT was incredibly swift. The packaging is *the most* thoughtfully packaged item I have ordered from a skincare company. Everything was wrapped so delicately in tissue paper & securely, all secured with a beautiful knotted silky type rope. I have ordered three times now, & there has been a generous amount of sizable samples included each time! Before I even get into the quality of the product itself, I have to mention the quality of the containers & labeling. Absolutely as if you were ordering from a high end, big brand, but in my humble opinion, better than that! \n\nAbout my skincare, if it is of any use. As I have gotten older, my skin requirements have started to change, & I now consider myself in the mature skin category. I can get a mild breakout from time to time if I am on my cycle & irritate my skin at the same time, but it is not as sensitive as it was in my twenties. I do require products that are heavier in terms of moisturizing, & probably have for a while now without realizing it. My main issues are sebaceous filaments, milia on my cheeks, hyperpigmentation, & dry patches. Wrinkles I don’t see as an issue, just a part of aging, although I do want to be proactive at not accelerating them any quicker than need be.\n\nNow let the reviewing commence!!\n\n# Utsukushii “INDIGO Elixir” – Fortifying Night Oil\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\n1oz (Full Size)\n\n.25ml (Trial Size/Miniature)\n\n1.5ml (Sample)\n\nIngredients: Rice Bran Oil, \\*Tsubaki (Camellia) Seed Oil, Olive Squalane, Papaya Oil, Shiso-Yo (Japanese Perilla Oil), \\*White Chia Oil,\\*Coconut Oil, \\*Jojoba Oil, , Blue Tansy, Jasminum Sambac, Vitamin E, Poris Cocos Mushroom, Marine Algae, Rice Ferment Peptides, Hyaluronic Acid, Pseudocollagen,\n\nAlright folks. This is *the* product that drew me into this brand in the first place. I had been searching for some time, for a blue tansy face serum or a balm. After some deliberation & searching this subreddit for past reviews, I actually found a raving review on this exact product & with communication from the OP I was confident in going in on a FS.\n\nAs you will find out with a lot of the products, this one is a staple in my routine now. The FS comes in a beautiful, quality glass dropper style bottle. The serum goes a long way, & while it feels very moisturizing, it is lightweight & sinks into the skin fairly quickly. The smell is slightly earthy, which I enjoy. It has a very soothing quality & it does not just sit on top of the face. I was worried about the coconut oil, but I am almost done with my first FS bottle (heavy handed use) & I have not had any adverse reactions to it. I do find that my hair tends to absorb the oils at night, but actually I feel as if it has been helping my dry hair so win/win! I apply this only at night, right after a bukachoil serum from another store. I recommend trying sample sizes or a trial size before committing to a FS though, because I did find I have a preference between three of the serums I have tried.\n\n# Indigo (Silk) Face Cream\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\n30ml/1oz (Full Size)\n\n7.4ml/.25oz (Trial/Miniature Size)\n\n1.5ml (Sample Size/Skin Tester)\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\n\\*Calendula Hydrosol, Marula Oil, Prickly Pear Oil, \\*Grapeseed Oil, Sesame Seed Oil, \\*Calendula Oil, \\*Rose Hip Oil, \\*Aloe Leaf, \\*Coconut Oil, Avocado Oil, Jojoba Oil, Witch Hazel, Sunflower Seed Oil, \\*White Willow Bark, \\*Neem Oil, Pseudocollagen, Hyaluronic Acid, Phyto Peptide Complex (Plant Based Peptides), Silk Amino Peptides, Blue Tansy (Moroccan Chamomile ESO), Klamath Blue Algae, Caprylic Triglyceride (Coconut based), Stearic Acid (Plant Sourced), Cetyl Alcohol, Xanthan Gum, Palmarosa Oil, May Chang fruit oil, Benzoin Resin oil, Cedarwood Bark Oil. Magnesium, NonGMO Soybean Germ Extract.\\*Rosemary ESO, Vitamin E, \\*Vegetable Glycerin, Radish Root ESO\n\nI had originally received this as a sample in my first order & ended up ordering a FS. I usually use a different brand of face moisturizer that I honestly prefer over this one. Although for reasons unknown to me, the shop never followed through with shipping out of my order & even though there were communications with the other shop owner, I still don’t know if I am getting my package or a refund as informed. Either way, with that in mind, I ordered a FS of this because as a replacement, this one fits the bill nicely & Chikyu is always extremely reliable. It doesn’t feel as moisturizing as my preferred, but it also doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry by any means. It isn’t greasy & absorbs fairly quickly. The size is in my opinion slightly smaller than I had imagined, but a little really does go a long way, especially if you are also using her other products. The container is quality glass like her other FS products. I think the price is reasonable though, because this one is packed full of vastly more beneficial ingredients comparatively. So I would definitely recommend this to someone who doesn’t like a heavy moisturizer. There is a mushroom moisturizer that I am more interested in trying, so before I finish this container, I will order a sample of that one to see if it is better suited for me. Until then I will continue to use this product.\n\n# Hakumai Mizu “Rice/Pearl” Face Cleanser\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\nSize: 1oz (Trial/Travel Size)\n\n4oz (Full Size Glass Jar with Bamboo Fibers)\n\n4oz (Full Size Glass Jar without Bamboo Fibers)\n\nINGREDIENTS: Fermented Rice Water\\*, Coconut Oil\\*, Lavender Flower Extract\\*, Rose Hip Oil, Castor Oil, Rice Bran Oil, Matsutake Mushroom Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple Fruit Essence), Wild Burdock Root Extract\\*, Crushed Pearl Powder, Rice Ferment Peptides, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Bamboo Fibers, \\*Grey Sea Salt, Glucose (Sugar Based), Vitamin C, Vegetable Glycerin\\*, Sake, Stearic Acid (Plant Derived), Cetyl Alcohol, Guar Gum, NataPres (Radish Root, Honeysuckle, Aspen Bark).\n\nI had also originally received a sample of this & ended up FS. I really love this cleanser. The sample does not come with the option for the bamboo fibers, & when I ordered a larger size I opted for the bamboo fibers. This is an extremely sizeable glass container for how little you need to use. It has a pearlescent sheen to it that is extremely beautiful. The bamboo fibers are delicate, but abrasive enough to scrub the skin without having to apply much pressure on your face when rubbing it in. I did notice that using this alone as a cleanser left my skin feeling stripped more than I would like. So with that in mind the next product I will review compliments this one. This is definitely a staple, but I am very curious about her other cleansers & plan on sampling the others to see if I have a preference. I am especially interested in the Matcha Cleanser.\n\n# Facial Cleansing Oil\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\nSize: 4oz (Full Size)\n\n1oz (Trial/Travel Size)\n\nINGREDIENTS: \\*Meadowfoam Oil, \\*Camellia Oil, \\*Grapeseed Oil, Castor Oil, \\*Rose Geranium ESO, Multifruit BSC\n\nI love this cleansing oil. This is admittedly my first foray into double cleansing & boy do I feel like a dingus for not having done this before! In my opinion, if you use the rice/pearl cleanser, this one is a must to use beforehand. I have noticed with consistent use, that my face is left feeling more moisturized & better cleansed than if I had just used the other alone. A little goes a long way, the FS is a glass pump container that is sizeable. No matter what cleanser I use, I will always have this in my routine. The smell is delicate, & does not irritate my skin whatsoever. I highly recommend trying a sample of this product. The sample I originally ordered was enough to carry me through three weeks of heavy handed use. I have no plans on looking for another cleansing oil. I will continue to use this as long as Lyn sells it!\n\n# Kagayakimasu “GLOW” Face Elixir\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\n1oz (Full Size)\n\n.25ml (Trial Size/Miniature)\n\n1.5ml (Sample)\n\nINGREDIENTS: \\*Watermelon Oil, \\*Cucumber Seed Oil, Rosehip Seed Oil, \\*Olive Oil, \\*Hemp Seed Oil, Sea Buckthorn Oil, \\*Tsubaki (Camellia) Seed Oil, \\*Jojoba Oil, \\*Tamanu Oil, Wheat Germ Oil,Geranium ESO, Lavender ESO, Grapefruit ESO, Pseudocollagen\n\nThe sample size container reminds me of my previous career in histopathology working with antibodies in immunohistochemistry. It’s a little flip top, sturdy, plastic container, but isn’t flat on the bottom. Something you would have in a rack while you pipette. Alright, I wanted to love this one. It smells absolutely gorgeous! But it felt way too heavy on my face, almost greasy. I am glad I only ordered a sample size of this, because I did start getting some clogged pores & small breakouts on my chin & forehead after using this one. I will mention that I had started my cycle right after trying this one, so that really could have been the culprit, but my face didn’t feel as irritated after I stopped using it. I just don’t feel like this one is for me & that is ok! I believe it is well loved by others here & obviously on her multiple reviews on both store sites. I plan on using up the sample on my décolletage‬ area & hands. \n\n# Liquid Moisture\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\n1oz (Full Size)\n\n.25ml (Trial Size/Miniature)\n\n1.5ml (Sample)\n\nINGREDIENTS: Cranberry Seed Oil, Pomegranate Seed Oil, Marula Oil, Baobab Oil, \\*Pumpkin Seed Oil, \\*Borage Oil, \\*Grapeseed Oil, Jojoba Oil, Neroli ESO, Jasmine Grandiflorum Absolute, Jasmine Flowers, Pseudocollegen\n\nI ordered the trail size of this product & it comes in a cute little glass dropper style bottle. This serum specifically states on the listing that it will not clog pores & is intended for dry skin. I love this one just as much as the Indigo serum. I would say this is the lightest, in terms of weight & oiliness it leaves on the face compared to the other two. It feels as if it sinks in faster than the other two. I do prefer to use a bit more in my hand to get an even layer spread out, but it is perfect for adding it underneath my daily moisturizer. I only wear this one in the morning since it is so lightweight. I plan on purchasing a FS of this on my next order. Although I am curious about the Silk Serum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, I absolutely love everything about Chikyu. From the amazing customer service, the high quality & intention with each creation, the reliability of knowing I will receive my products & that the turn around time is consistently quick, & the fact that is actually making my skin feel better. In regards to my skincare needs, I have seen a significant reduction in the milia I usually have on my cheekbones, my dry patches that I tend to get on the sides of my nose/under eye area are not an issue, & with proper usage of cleansing & adequate moisturizing of my face, my blackhead/sebaceous filaments have become less apparent. I did not realize that I was over-cleansing & under-moisturizing my face before & that was what was making my pores look so raggedy & sad! Also, my hands have been feeling the love & are not scary lizard skin looking like before. They are soft & happy!! I highly, highly recommend at the very least, ordering some samples if you are curious. There is so much to try, that I am positive you will find something that works for you. If you made it this far, thank you for reading my thoughts!! I would absolutely love to hear about anyone else's experience with Chikyu products, especially ones I haven’t mentioned! I do have a lot more product samples I haven’t touched yet, & plan on leaving another review eventually! I tried to be thorough & I hope I didn't leave anything out! Have a nice day!",

The water is harder where I currently reside so i do clarify and detox when needed and get professional treatments/haircuts as needed.\n\nEven after I invest in salon quality products, their formulas randomly change( redken, joico, etc.) some for the worse, some slightly better. \n\nThere is no more naturallycurly or curlmart.\n\nMy scalp  and hair HATES Mielle Organics, most of shea moisture lines especially since the formula changes, Camille rose is okay, curlsmith is meh, kinky curly has minimal products, briogeo lacks styling products that work for me, devacurl is over rated, miss Jessie’s is overpriced and you need too much of it.. innersense is nice i guess,  melanin is cool but vv  minimal line, etc  i’ve tried so many yet, I’m not satisfied with the results or overall health of my hair. \n\nI haven’t tried pattern beauty, taraji’s line, cecred, fenty because I’m tired😩\n\nIs anyone having the same issue or am i bugging and just getting older? \n\nThese were the ingredients of Aubrey Organics HoneySuckle Rose Conditioner.

        "body": "For moisture, Adwoa Beauty, Camille Rose, Miche Beauty, and Shescentit are the best brands for me. Briogeo has excellent oils and heat protection, but everything else isn’t worth the price.\n\nI typically buy from Hattache (black-owned, online, wide selection of brands, and they also carry a ton of Ayurvedic products), Sephora, or Ulta.\n\nHowever, I’ve discovered that it’s not just the products that give me that moisture - it’s my technique and the state of my hair too. This is what’s worked for me:\n\n* **Double wash with a good shampoo.** Don’t need to strip your hair - I just go for a squeaky clean feel. If my hair isn’t fully clear of old products, then they block proper absorption of my DC and my hair isn’t very moisturized after.\n* **Apply my DC and styling products to slightly wet hair.** Big game changer for me. You want to have just enough water still in your hair that the products slightly foam when applied or that they “melt”. Dripping wet hair means I won’t be able to use enough product for *moisture*, and damp/dry means there isn’t enough water to get proper *hydration*.\n* **DC with heat.** My hair is low porosity, and products don’t absorb well if I don’t use heat. I just sit under a hooded dryer for about 10-15mins.\n* **Dry my hair to 70% with heat.** Same reason as above. 70% dry for me is very slightly damp. Then I air-dry from there.\n* **Maintain that protein moisture balance.** Hydrolyzed protein helps maintain the structure + strength of your hair, AND helps keep it moisturized by [slowing down the loss of water from your hair](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2015/10/protein-101-lots-of-basic-information.html?m=1). I use protein more for the first benefit than the 2nd, but my hair also stays significantly more moisturized when that balance is there. I use light amounts weekly through my regular DCs, and do one bigger “DIY” treatment every 4-6 weeks. I have fine hair so this is what works for me - adjust as needed. \n* **Apply a few drops of oil and UV/heat protector on top of my styling products.** I live in a pretty hot area and my hair is prone to sun/UV damage. This made it [more porous and increased how quickly it dried out](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/summer-sun-and-your-hair.html?m=1). Using a UV heat protector has been a lifesaver for eliminating this. With oil, I’ve found that it helps a lot with moisture retention when used correctly. I go for light oil products with ceramides and fatty acids in the first few ingredients. \n\nI know this all sounds like a lot, but everything here is either a change to something you’re already doing, or a very small addition! It takes me at most an hour to shampoo, DC, style and dry to 70%. My hair stays moisturized the whole week till the next wash day, no refreshes or spritzes in between.",

I have an idea of what was in the coconut fatty acid cream base but have yet to attempt to recreate it. \n\nIt is not you! I have the exact same problem. Nothing has ever come close to AOHSR. I randomly search every few months for anyone who has cracked the code and duplicated. I think I need to try. \n\nI was devastated when they ruined his products. I've gone through SO many since then. I landed on Rahua (specifically the original and the one for color just because it smells amazing) and Desert Essence is good low cost - coconut, grape with resveretol, and raspberry. Their line to prevent breakage is also really good, but smell isn't the best, and I just found out it's being discontinued. They aren't close to AOHSR but I've used both long term without any issues and keep my hair looking pretty good. \n\nI also love/hate morroco method. I can't stand ACV smell and very sensitive to it and smell it in the shampoos. The pearl essence creme conditioner smells sublime but it's too heavy for my hair.

    "body": "I recently found a website called CosDNA which basically tells you on a scale of one to five how comedogenic an ingredient is. For those who do not know, comedogenic ingredients are likely to clog your pores and cause black heads and/or breakouts. I had never heard of this scale before so I went to different websites to see what each said about different ingredients. This is my list of what I found to be the most common listed, highest rated, comedogenic ingredients. The number in () is the rating it got. \n\n(5) isocetyl stearate \n(5) carrageenan \n(5) algae extract \n(5) wheat germ oil \n(5) isoproply isostearate \n(5) isoproply myristate \n(5) Laureth 4\n(5) octyl stearate \n(5) red algea \n(5) sodium chloride \n(5) sodium lauryl sulfate \n(4) Lauric acid \n(4) ethyhexyl palmitate \n(4) algin \n(4) acetylated lanolin \n(4) acetylated lanolin alcohol\n(4) syearyl heptanoate \n(4) octyl palmitate \n(4) peg 16 lanolin \n(4) propylene glycol monostrearate \n\nI know it’s a lot but it makes a world of difference (if you are prone to break outs) to pay attention to ingredients. What I took from everything is that it is not guaranteed that these will break you out but if you are prone to break outs with certain products then on a scale of 1-5 these are the ingredients probably causing them. Majority of places also said that if they are not listed in the first 7 (or so) ingredients that you are most likely fine to still use that product. They also said these products are generally fine in cleansers because they do not sit on your skin. \n\nHopefully this list can help those of you who are struggling to find products that work for you. Again, this is a list I put together based off of what various websites had posted. (Such as CosDNA.) \n\nIf you have any ingredients that fall under this category or any insight please let everyone know in the comments! \n\nEdit: remember that everyone’s skin is different! It can react differently to treatments, products, and even foods. So even if these are rated “high” on the list, that doesn’t mean they will break everyone out. ",

Kinda wish I had grabbed two...\n\n**Review**\n\n**Abbate Y La Mantia \"Buttero\" shave soap** - Everybody here knows my enthousiasm for the soaps from AYLM, with the Laureato being one of my overall favorite soaps. Matteo 9:11 is in that list. Buttero will not knock them from their current positions, but that just shows how strong the overall line-up is.\n\nButtero's extra ingredient is wheat germ oil, which has a number of noted benefits. Bear in mind that the wheat germ oil is included in the saponification process, so it's hard to say just how much original wheat germ oil remains behind. The soap, true to form, is very easy to lather, and produces a deeply creamy dense lather with excellent slickness. Yet another excellent performer from AYLM.\n\nThe scent is a deep and slightly sweet leather scent. It smells like a brand new high end Italian leather jacket, so yeah, it smells fantastic. The scent strength is very good and remains pretty strong throughout the shave. I smell something sweet as well, my first impression is a sweet dried apricot. No idea where that part of the scent comes from, but it smells really good.\n\nPost shave is good, but not at the same level for me as the Laureato or the Matteo 9:11. Skin feels supple for a while, but after an hour or so my skin feels pretty tight. I have skipped the aftershave balm for a few days, and it's ok, but not good enough for me to skip the balm every day.\n\nIf you like the smell of expensive leather, paired with the overall very good performance of the soap, get some -- you are going to be happy you did.\n\n**Supply SE stainless steel razor** - /u/coddou reached out to me here on Reddit to offer one of the Supply razors for review. I love my Schick Injector razor, so trying out another modern take on the SE injector style seems like a must-do. The Supply comes with two additional base plates, one mild and one aggressive. I stuck with the middle one for this week.\n\nThe razor ships with a fake blade in the head, which will pop out when you insert the first real blade. I had an issue with this first blade exchange, in that the blade from the injector did not line up perfectly with the fake blade, and did not go in as smoothly as I would have liked (that one is for you, /u/ItchyPooter). That first blade clearly was damaged and just did not work, so I replaced it, but *this time* I loosened the screw holding on the base plate slightly and the new blade injected smoothly and pushed out the old blade. Supply does highlight this in their materials, and it is very simple to get it right: you just have to pay attention when you first try to change the blade. If the new blade is not exactly level with the old blade, don't force it; loosen the baseplate slightly and the new blade will line up perfectly.\n\nThe new blade made all the difference in the world. The Supply really is so easy to use, and feels very safe on the face. Zero blade chatter, no overhang, the angle is easy to find and maintain, and the shave itself is very close and comfortable. I have really enjoyed using the razor all week, and am quite looking forward to trying out the two other baseplate options. The razor is on the heavier side, but is still very easy to hold and maneuver. The handle is smooth, with no pattern or texture, but I never felt it was hard to hold or slippery (/u/ItchyPooter, I hope you are keeping count somewhere).\n\nOverall excellent shaves all week, and I am very happy with the razor. There is one spot where the razor drops in comfort for me, which is at the bottom of my neck in the ATG pass. It reminds me a great deal of the Mongoose, which has the same issue. That part of the shave just feels uncomfortable, like the blade is digging in a bit (something about the SE blades?), but I normally just do another XTG pass in that spot. That is a very minor issue, which I can easily work around. I really looking forward to trying out the other baseplates, and it may be that the milder baseplate does not have the same issues.\n\n/u/hawns: the aftershave splash remains excellent, and my wife loves the scent. +1 to Charm!!\n\nThank you all for your advice on Fortnite, by the way; I have not yet jumped in, because it may be that Splinter Cell: Conviction includes co-op play, so that might come first.\n\nBe good to each other, my friends, and I hope you all have a great week!",

Worked great, nails grew out without any major issues aside from being very thin and bendy (but as that had been a thing my whole life, I just figured it was genetics) and I avoided breaks. \n\nAfter a couple months of no biting I found this sub, stopped using gel polish/gel wraps and when my vitamin e oil ran out I replaced it with jojoba; as it being able to penetrate the skin better than other oils/still contains vitamin e, it seemed like it would be the ideal option. \n\nBut it seems like when I exclusively use jojoba oil on my nails, they're more prone to peeling and tearing vs when I use vitamin e (blends or pure wheat germ oil). This time last year, I assumed it was just due to the top layer or my nails being damaged to improper wrap removal, decades of nail biting, and some health issues that made it difficult to keep food (thus: nutrients) down. \n\nHowever now over a year out from nail care/no gels, and 10 months out from getting my health issues treated and being able to change my lifestyle for the better. My nails have naturally gotten stronger, but still peel during periods of exclusive jojoba oil use, and do not peel during periods of vitamin e blend/ wheat germ oil use- when all other variable remain the same.  \n\nI know everyone is different, but I do see jojoba being touted as the gold standard, and I'm thrilled it works best for a majority of people! But I was curious if anyone else had better results with a different oil like I have.\n\nMaybe it's genetics? Deficiencies? Am I just reading too much into it lol?

We need someone trustworthy to study these foods, especially acai berries. If acai berries are truly so low PUFA and high vitamin E, they would be a very effective way to get whole food vitamin E. 60 cals of acai berries, according to this data, is literally 100% of the vitamin E RDA. If anyone is interested in testing this themselves, with 100g of acai berries, powder, or puree, you might be able to test it here: [https://foodlabelpro.com/services/#:\\~:text=FDA%20Compliant%20Nutrition%20Facts%20Panel%3A%20%24150%20per%20product,based%20on%20your%20package%20size](https://foodlabelpro.com/services/#:~:text=FDA%20Compliant%20Nutrition%20Facts%20Panel%3A%20%24150%20per%20product,based%20on%20your%20package%20size)\n\nAlso, I don't want to type them all, but cooked leafy greens are generally all high in vitamin E and low in PUFA. I included a few in my contributions.\n\nFinally, I don't know if this is true, but I also read on a reddit post that dairy fat and ruminant animal fat can be high in vitamin E when they're raised properly and fed high vitamin E foliage, and apparently you can tell by how golden their fat is. Apparently, high vitamin E (and A) dairy or ruminant animal fat should have a golden & amber color to it. u/acivilizedman sent me this article, which says grass-fed butter has 0.4mg per 0.93 tbsp of butter: https://ketologic.com/blogs/articles/grass-fed-butter. He said that grass-fed milk has about 50% more vitamin E than regular milk, but it's still relatively low. If he remembers correctly, 8 cups of grass-fed milk is about 2.1mg vitamin E (only 14% of the RDA).\n\nIf you want to supplement, u/acivilizedman recommends TocoVit from IdeaLabs. They extract the vitamin E from wheat germ oil. Apparently, with a standard dose (about 100mg), it lasts 250 days.",

This bias in the dietetic literature can be traced to various sources, but a major influence was the campaign in the 1970s by the drug companies that had patented new forms of synthetic “vitamin A.” They had physicians and professors fabricate stories about the great toxicity of natural vitamin A, and placed the stories in national magazines, to clear the field for their supposedly non-toxic products, which have turned out to be disastrously toxic. The result is that many people have fearfully stopped eating liver, because of its vitamin A. The other vitamins in liver, including vitamin K, function very closely with vitamin E, and the stably stored forms of vitamin E are likely to be a good approximation for our needs.*",

        "body": "Ray has pointed out that eggs and dairy are both foods that nature has designed to provide all the things necessary to fuel the growth of an entire organism. Those are both likely to be rich sources if they are raised in keeping with their ancestral niche.  Animals are also accumulators in the appropriate context.  A source which i never tested but which i suspect to be VERY high was lobster roe.  When i worked in a seafood restaurant we would steam a dozen lobsters at a time for pot pies and i would clean them and the chef let me keep the roe which had an incredible taste and texture and could stain and color any liquid into which it was mixed a bright red.  If you ever steam your own lobster, look for the seam of roe that runs down the center of the back from the head to the tail.  That's the good stuff.  I suspect if you wanted to get a good regular source from some kind of eggs in a realistic way, you could keep your own chickens like Danny does, but feed them on a huge compost pile.  If you're familiar with Justin Rhodes, he interviewed a guy from Vermont who does that on a massive scale.

    "body": "I suffer from a potentially very painful and debilitating anal fissure. I tried all the usual stuff prescription medicine, including steroids, sitz baths, pain killers, stool softeners - none worked, except for the steroids.\n\nBut, this plan of action works. Some are for life as preventative measures (diet and BM squat) and some (including the ointment) are for when an attack is on. Using this plan I've reduced the attacks to less than one a year and the length of the attack to just a few days, and only the first day or two are actually painful.\n\n**First: The 9 Commandments**\n\n* Drink water and tea, plenty. It's 2 litres minimum a day (4+ if exercising or in the summer.) Coffee I find is bad for my bowels, could be just me, I stopped drinking it. A beer is good. No sugary (or diet) drinks, they cause blockages.\n\n\n* Eat lots of fruit and vegetables. Every day, all day. But, sadly, some very healthy fruit, those that are high in vitamin C, can really wreck havoc. I'm talking about grapefruit, blueberry, beetroot, kiwi and others. If I'm having an attack these can be bad, very bad. I used to eat these more when having an attack (because they are healthy and full of fibre) and they made it more painful. I presume the acidity hurts the open wound. \n\n\n* Cut down on (cut out) white flour and rice, junk food, fried foods, fatty foods and sugary foods. \n\n\n* If you have to go, go; don't delay it. Never be constipated, never have diarrhoea.\n\n\n* Don't sit, squat. This is probably the most important thing in the list; do it and you'll thank me for life. Your feet need to rest on the bowel. It takes a while for the leg muscles to get used to this, but it's really, really worth it.\n\n\n* Never ever use toilet paper or any wipes of any sort. They are bad for the anus and bad for the environment. You must wash after every BM. A bidet, or just a large bottle of water next to the toilet are great, I have a little shower thing. It is the residue on the anus that causes the pain not the fissure itself; the residue contains bacteria and can be acidic, and these are painful.\n\n\n* Use my ointment (see below) liberally.\n\n\n* Exercise, especially running, walking, stretching and kicking. Anything that gets the blood flowing between your legs. Cycling is not so good.\n\n\n* Use soap minimally on the anus. And no soap during an attack. Soap dries the skin which exacerbates the fissure. Water is sufficient.\n\n\n**Second. My ointment.** \n\nIn a small jar with a lid mix 2 or 3 of these oils: sesame, olive, avocado, coconut or wheat germ oil. Sesame and coconut are the best. Then add about 10 drops each of these essential oils: mint, cypress and tea tree. Apply 4 times a day: before and after every BM, after showering and before going to bed. Use a finger to spread around the itchy area and inside the anus. Difficult, unpleasant, but necessary. Slide a finger about 2 cms up the anus and do that 4 times. Never double dip - ie do not replace your dirty finger into the jar. Good for hems and fissures. The ointment stops the itch and the pain. The base oils lubricate the area for easier BMs and help healthy skin  grow back. The essential oils are anti-bacterial (the bacteria on the open skin is painful) and the mint is a pain killer.\n\nAnother thing to do which is really powerful is garlic. Put a few small cloves of garlic in the ointment, this is good in itself. But, the powerful thing is to put a clove up there. Ideally do this after a BM, and overnight. The combination of the ointment and the internal garlic will give you painless BMs.",

Severe pain from fissures and hemorrhoids all of a sudden (54 yo male, athletic and healthy) and your BMs become meditations on stomach cancer and how fragile human existence is. Local health food store lady told me to put garlic clove in anus. Peeled obviously but careful not to rupture the clove itself even with your fingernails as the liquid will sting so badly that you have to take it out. Within 3 days almost no symptoms, life saver. Wtf. No other treatments. \n\nDefinitely all other advice re diet exercise alcohol coffee etc stands but I looked around this subreddit and only one person (here above) mentions it. Must do garlic - it disinfects kills bacteria. I didn’t know this was an issue with me but apparently, given my own experience, it is. I know I’m a clean person but apparently the anus is a different story. \n\nStopped using garlic perhaps 10 days into it. -a week later did excruciatingly hard physical labor in the last 5 days. Shuffling dirt. Also did coffee which I normally don’t do.  Yesterday pain and blood came back. Very disappointing.  \n\nMy strategy now is to keep doing a clove a day (overnight), to stop coffee and do this for a whole month. Quality of life is zero with this situation as all of you know. I’ll update you guys in a few days (if I remember to). Feel free to remind me. \n\nPlease try the garlic. I’m willing to bet it will make a difference.",

I am always being gifted things from them and especially when I get something that smells divine, I look up the ingredients and bam. Wheat germ. It's in a lot of shampoos and conditioners too! Careful at Sally's, there aren't too many product options without it.\n\nMost of the research I have found states that people with Celiac's should NOT use it. Skincare is easily accidentally swallowed or moved around on surfaces to be swallowed later.\n\nWhatta life we have to cope with. Reading every ingredient label ever and being scared in public when not in our GF certified home safe space.\n\nI am also recovering from cross contamination. Good news is my roommate who keeps poisoning me is moving out. So exciting! No more roommates... 😻 A dream!",

    "body": "So recently - as some of you may have noticed - there has been a bunch of actives (especially Vitamin C serums) popping up on Amazon with basically the same ingredients. That's because they buy from a wholesaler and just repackage the product. The wholesaler in question is commonly RainshadowLabs, and you can buy the product direct from them in 2oz bottles (~56ml) for much cheaper (~$4) than the repackaged Amazon equivalents. \n\nI ordered 4 sample bottles from them. If it's your first order you get 3 samples free which was nice of them, but they don't advertise it. They contacted me a few days after ordering letting me know they discounted the amount charged to me. One thing people might not like is that they don't give a shipping cost outright, once you've ordered they process it and apply the shipping to your card after, so you sort of have to pay an unknown amount. I ended up paying ~$25 for 4 sample bottles to the UK, so I think shipping is okay, but probably a lot cheaper for US purchases. \n\nI contacted them about the pH of a couple of their products I was interested in (I would have asked for more for this sub in hindsight but these were the only ones I wanted so I only asked for these three), and though it took them a little while to get back to me, they were very open about the information. So here it is:\n\n[**VITAMIN C SERUM**](http://www.rainshadowlabs.com/QVSC-Vitamin-C-Serum-72-organic_p_1111.html)\n\nComes in 18% or 20%\n\nVitamin C: Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate\n\npH: 7.9\n\n*18% Ingredients:* Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe), Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C), Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel), Carbomer, (2s)-2-Amino-5-guanidinopentanoic Acid, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba Oil), Phenoxyethanol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin.\n\n*20% Ingredients:* Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe), Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C), Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel), d-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Carbomer, (2s)-2-Amino-5-guanidinopentanoic Acid, Ferulic Acid, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba Oil), Phenoxyethanol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin. \n\n[**RETINOL SERUM**](http://www.rainshadowlabs.com/ARRSARRSI-Retinol-Serum-72-organic-_p_639.html)\n\nComes in 1% or 2.5%\n\nUses retinol, not a weaker derivative. \n\npH: 5.7\n\n*Ingredients:* Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel), Pentylene Glycol, Phospholipids, Retinol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba Oil), Triticum Vulgare (Wheat Germ Oil), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Organic Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea), Wildcrafted Resina Propoli (Propolis), Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin.\n\n[**RETINOL MOISTURISER**](http://www.rainshadowlabs.com/LORLORI-Retinol-Moisturizer-71-organic-whole-foods-_p_1019.html)\n\nComes in 1% or 2.5%\n\nUses retinol, not a weaker derivative. \n\npH: 6.1\n\n*Ingredients:* Organic Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera), Organic Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower Oil), Isopropyl Palmitate (Palm Oil),  Pentylene Glycol, Phospholipids, Retinol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Tocopheryl (Vitamin E), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide, Glyceryl Stearate,Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba Oil), Wildcrafted Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea), Wildcrafted Resina Propoli (Propolis), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter),  Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid.\n\nFinal note: I am not affiliated with RainshadowLabs in any way, I just have been hearing murmurings about them in this sub so I thought I'd share some information for anyone else curious.

    "body": "- Hemp Seed Oil is nature's secret to clear and healthy skin. Hemp has a 3:1 ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs), which is the perfect match to human skin, meaning it quickly and easily soaks deep into skin to provide hydration from the inside out, reducing redness and irritation of the skin. Additionally, hemp's high concentration of polyunsaturated EFAs helps it reduce inflammation, aiding in the treatment of skin conditions such as acne, eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, or sensitive skin in general. Hemp seed oil is a non-comedogenic moisturizer that does not leave a greasy layer or clogged pores. Hemp has been found to be very effective for those with sensitive skin or other dermatological issues (Callaway, JC, Schwab U, Harvimaa I, Halonen P, Mykkanen O, Hyvonen P & Jarvinen T (2005). Journal of Dermatological Treatment.). Hemp helps lock in moisture and soften skin, while at the same time, creates a firm lather and effective cleanser that can clean away the toughest grease while still leaving your skin smoother than ever. \n\n- Shea Butter helps lock in moisture and restore elasticity to skin, minimizing scars and stretch marks. By providing deep hydration (similar to hemp), while having natural sun protection benefits, shea butter helps treat many skin conditions ranging from acne to rosacea. Shea butter is non-comedogenic and is naturally rich in vitamins A, E, and F to help provide deep and long-lasting hydration. \n\n- Coconut oil is highly moisturizing, and is high in natural Lauric Acid which helps protect the skin from microbial infections. Coconut oil's high concentration of EFAs softens skin and heals dry, cracked skin, while its concentration of natural proteins and vitamin E help keep skin healthy and rejuvenated. \n\n- Sunflower oil has a high concentration of beta-carotene which reduces sun sensitivity and prevent premature signs of aging. Sunflower is high in vitamin A which is essential to healthy skin. Due to the high concentration of vitamin E, sunflower oil cleanses and moisturizes acne-prone skin and rejuvenates dry, cracked skin. \n\n- Wheat Germ oil is high in antioxidants which help repair damage done to skin over the years. Wheat germ oil soothes irritated and inflamed skin while promoting new skin growth, giving your skin a fresh healthy look. Similar to shea butter, wheat germ oil helps reduce stretch marks and scars. \n\n- Beeswax forms a protective layer on the skin which reduces contact with the elements, preventing the development of chapped skin and lips. Like shea butter, beeswax provides protection from sun exposure. Beeswax acts as an anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antibacterial, which aids in the treatment of many skin conditions such as acne, psoriasis, eczema, rosacea, and more. Beeswax's antibacterial properties help prevent the spread of skin conditions such as acne. \n\n- Palm oil contains a high concentration of vitamin E, which acts as an antioxidant that helps the skin fight damage and the effects of aging by preventing the damaging effects of free radicals on the skin. In cleansers and shampoo, palm oil provides a thick lather and effective cleanser, all while moisturizing skin, leaving skin soft and rejuvenated. Similar to sunflower oil, palm oil is high in natural beta carotene, which provides much-needed vitamin A along with vitamin E, both of which aid in smoothing and repairing skin. \n\n- Rosemary extract is high in antioxidants which acts as a natural preservative while at the same time aiding in the repair of damaged skin. \n\n- Essential oils:\n\nLavender - antiseptic, helps treat acne\n\nJasmine - antiseptic, helps treat acne; cicatrisant, helps reduce scars\n\nPineapple - astringent, helps control oily skin\n\nGrapefruit - antiseptic, helps treat acne; astringent, helps tighten skin and reduce the size of pores; bactericidal, helps fight bacteria which leads to acne and other skin conditions\n\nOrange - anti-inflammatory, helps reduce inflammation associated with many skin conditions; fungicidal and bactericidal, helps eliminate the bacteria and fungus that promotes the propagation of acne, eczema, athlete's foot, and other skin conditions",

While there are any number of naturally available beta sterols that are proven to be useful if not as effective as finasteride, including saw palmetto, pumpkin seed, lycopene, wheat germs, and rice bran,  DHT blocking efficacy has remained the domain of drugs like finasteride and dutesteride...

I am almost 5 months post surgery and have noticed a big increase in vascularity between the incisions and the mesh placement. I have also found that the channels created for the surgical tools combined with the tissue healing has had an etching effect on my abdominals, especially on the left side where my repair was required. As a side note, I picked up some steel maces and Indian clubs That were below the weight lifting restriction my doctor provided.

That's because they buy from a wholesaler and just repackage the product. The wholesaler in question is commonly RainshadowLabs, and you can buy the product direct from them in 2oz bottles (~56ml) for much cheaper than the repackaged Amazon equivalents. \n\nI ordered 4 sample bottles from them. If it's your first order you get 3 samples free which was nice of them, but they don't advertise it. They contacted me a few days after ordering letting me know they discounted the price charged to me. One thing people might not like is that they don't give a shipping cost outright, once you've ordered they process it and apply the shipping to your card after, so you sort of have to pay an unknown amount. I ended up paying ~$25 for 4 sample bottles to the UK, so I think shipping is okay, but probably a lot cheaper for US purchases. \n\nI contacted them about the pH of a couple of their products I was interested in (I would have asked for more for this sub in hindsight but these were the only ones I wanted so I only asked for these three), and though it took them a little while to get back to me, they were very open about the information.

    "body": "I read a post here that canning liver was not possible because it's too dense? Is that true, and is it still true if it's finely chopped (perhaps grinded) and added to ground beef as a mix? Offal is very nutrient dense and healthy for us and for dogs.\n\nI have a great dog food recipe and usually portion it out and vacuum seal then freeze them. When it comes to dinner time, it needs to be thawed, and then cooked for our dogs which has to cool before letting them eat. It's a bit of a long process.\n\nSo, I'd like to can the recipe. I've done a batch before and had 6 quarts, pressure canning the raw mix for 90 minutes at the proper pressure for my altitude. The dogs seemed to prefer it even over the freshly cooked batches. I found it interesting that when I would open the jar, it smelled like good, fresh dog food.... but it definitely smelled like dog food.\n\nAs a certified canine nutritionist, I have several recipes that are breed-targeted for my Siberian Huskies living in our climate. I would like to know if there are any recipes already officially tested and approved by National Center for Home Food Preservation or another trusted source. And if not, how would I go about testing my own recipes? Would I just take a batch and let it age, perhaps for a year, and have it tested for botulism, listeria, e-coli, and salmonella?\n\nMost of the canning advice I have read for this sort of specific recipe is to do not add oil, as it will 'coat' the ingredients and potentially protect pathogens from the canning process and don't can eggs as there is no tested recipes for canning eggs. Does that include eggs as an ingredient?\n\nHere's an example of a recipe I commonly use:\n\n>Ingredients  \n\n>5 pounds 90% lean ground beef (do not use fattier meats)\n\n>2 pounds beef heart\n\n>1 pound beef liver\n\n>8 pasture-raised eggs without shells (could be reserved and added at the time of feeding if necessary for canning purposes)\n\n>8 ounces kale\n\n>8 ounces broccoli\n\n>8 ounces dandelion greens\n\n>12 ounces blueberries or mixed berries (blueberries, raspberries, blackberries and cranberries)\n\n>5 tbsp bone meal (seaweed calcium can be used for adult dogs)\n\n>2 tsp wheat germ oil (added at time of feeding)\n\n>2 tsp himalayan salt\n\n>1/4 tsp kelp\n\nThe underlying nutritional breakdown is very specific and well-balanced. I'm not concerned about the recipe, but I'd like to know how to safely make it shelf stable using pressure canning. Has anybody gone through the process for testing a new recipe?",

You might want to look at approved recipes for beef stew, especially the hot pack version, and adjust other ingredients as necessary keeping it in line with AAFCO guidelines. Ditto mixed vegetables.  Also look at specifics for each ingredient. Both use pressure canners. Broccoli and organ meats are not recommended for canning. You may have to sub chicken or turkey for the organ meats to provide protein and both are cheaper than beef. We just use chicken breast and 93% lean ground turkey in our food.\n\nRight now, freezing is your safest way to go.

    "body": "To start this off, my girlfriend has had really bad migraine issues for the past couple years. Not only that, but just not feeling well overall. Always sluggish and just feeling like complete crap, usually every single day. She has taken antibiotics and all different types of prescriptions, and nothing seems to fix it. Just gives temporary relief. \n\nWell she was talking to her friend about it, and was recommended to a chiropractor. So we go. \n\nThis chiropractor is not very well known, and the reason for this is because he only works on referrals. Seems like a legit guy. He's rather young (28ish), but has all his degrees on the wall just like any ordinary doctors office.\n\nHe takes us back to the back room, and explains to us this technique that he uses. It is called \"Body Energetics Technique\", and it ends up sounding like some really off the wall crap. He says its a way of communicating with the body using frequencies from movement. Im thinking WTF? \n\n So he starts his \"exam\" that he does for first timers. This is a full body exam he does to find out what issues you have with your body. He literally touches her stomach with one hand, then his other hand is behind his back doing all types of weird movements (kind of looks like hes cracking his knuckles, or trying to), and then some how he can tell if she is stressed, or has a vitamin deficiency. He does that, then gives her a massager to massage whatever point on her body he worked on. Here is a link with more info on it...\n\nhttp://www.kaychiropracticcenter.com/index.php?p=381819\n\nSo he gets done the exam, and finds like 10-15 issues she supposedly has. He says he can treat 2 per visit, and suggests she comes for 8 weeks. Let me point on too, he seemed very honest. He said to try it for a few weeks, if you don't feel better, save your money and stop coming.\n\n He says he can start on 2 right then and there. So she does it. He starts the first 2 things, which only take about a minute each, and then gives her a massager in each hand to massage the 2 points he worked on. He tells her then that she has a vitamin C and D deficiency. He also tell her that she needs wheat germ oil and alkaline drops because her body is too acidic. \n\nSo the bill ends up being about $270 just for the first visit ($125 first timer exam, $45 for each issue he fixed, and then $55 for supplements). Im thinking ok, that's pricey, but that should be all the supplements she needs. \n\nSo a week later we go back for the next visit and he works on the next 2 issues he found. He does his weird hand stuff, and tells her she has more deficiencies. Sells her more supplements.\n\nWe are on the 8th week now, which is the last one, and as of now she is on about 10 different supplements.\n\nNow I will admit, she is saying that she is feeling better, much better actually, but I am still skeptical. I don't feel like his technique is actually what fixed her migraine issues, just because I can't see how you can touch someones stomach and be able to tell if they have a vitamin deficiency.  I really think all the guy did was sell her a bunch of vitamins, and got lucky on one fixing her problems. Which in my opinion is pretty easy to do. You sell someone 10 different things, one of them is bound to work for sure.\n\nSo my question is, has anyone else ever heard of or trying anything at all like this, and am I right for being skeptical about it? \n\nEdit: He also has her do this \"ion cleanse\" thing where she puts her feet in and the water color changes depending on what toxins are being pulled from your body. Usually its liver toxins, and I always joke with her and tell her \"See, you drink too much!\"  I was told this was all a scam, and of course the girlfriend told him that I thought it was a scam. He comes back saying \"yes a lot of them are. If you go online you will see some going for $100 or $200, and they don't work. The water will change color weather you have your feet in or not. Ours are three THOUSAND dollars\" and that's all he said. I guess the high price tag is supposed to mean its legit?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

For example, if we found 200 people, 100 determined to be deficient in Vitamin C and 100 in Vitamin A by either diet or blood work. If we put these people in front of him could he use this technique and determine better than chance who was deficient with which vitamin?  \n\nBesides his strange diagnostic techniques, his prescriptions are just as strange.  Does he have any evidence to support germ wheat oil can treat these vitamin deficiencies?  And why can he only treat 2 at a time?  Does the body have a unknown threshold where only two issues can be treated at a time?  Does he want to make sure he gets both the office visit charge and the treatment charge each week?  And if he knows there are 15 issues, why can't he tell you all of them now?\n\nNow, from someone that works in the molecular diagnostic biotechnology field, where I have to follow FDA regulations and have to have evidence and approval before the release of any diagnostic test, the fact that a \"Doctor\" can diagnose and prescribe medicine to someone with simply the use of massagers and the waving of his hands pisses me off. What good is all the work my company does in the lab?  Why spend millions on clinical trials?  Why should I spend all my time on quality control and testing procedures if diseases, dietary deficiencies and other issues can be determined by what seems to be magic?  Can this guy diagnose a staph infection by his magical hand waving?  How about cancer?\n\nTruthfully, he is scamming you both. Nothing he is doing has any scientific backing. She may be feeling better due to the placebo effect or due to the natural course of the illness she is actually suffering from. When it comes to subjective symptoms like pain and general unease, doctors have a very difficult time with diagnosis. It's not an infectious disease. It's not cancer. It's most likely diet. So the doctor says eat healthy. That isn't very comforting to the patient. \n\nBut when the other \"Doctor\" gives you a real answer, Vitamin C deficiency, you walk away with the answer. I'm sure she has no actually symptoms of scurvy, but that doesn't matter. He got your money and she feels like someone is giving her answers to why she feels like shit. She starts to feel better and attributes that to the doctor. Everyone wins accept your pocket book and science.",

I decided to share my journey because I wish I had known these things earlier—it would have saved me a lot of time, money, and frustration.\n\nI'm a 42-year-old male in decent physical shape, standing 5'9\" and weighing 150 lbs. I've been doing calisthenics for eight years and have two children. After the birth of my second child, I noticed a significant drop in my libido and testosterone levels. Studies indicate that new fathers can experience a 30% decrease in testosterone while caring for a newborn.\n\n[Fatherhood Decreases Testosterone](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/09/fatherhood-decreases-testosterone)\n\nI tried nearly everything to counter this decline. Some methods worked temporarily but had side effects, and others had no effect at all. Here’s a detailed account of what I tried and the outcomes.\n\n# Short-term Solutions That Didn't Last (Not Recommended)\n\n* **Boron (6mg):** Worked initially but not sustainable.\n* **Pumpkin Seeds:** High in zinc and magnesium but also inhibit 5-alpha reductase.\n* **Joov Go Red Light:** Effective only when combined with boron.\n* **Sunshine:** Beneficial but concerns about skin damage.\n* **Taurine (6g):** Initial improvement but built tolerance quickly.\n\n# Ineffective or Minimal Effect\n\n* **Pomegranate Extract**\n* **Rhodiola**\n* **Aged Garlic Extract**\n* **Fenugreek**\n* **Ginseng**\n* **Cordyceps Militaris**\n* **Tongkat Ali (2% and 10% extracts)**\n* **Polygala**\n* **Icing of Testicles Nightly**\n* **L-Citrulline (3-7g)**\n* **Vitamin C (3 x 500mg extended release)**\n* **Liver Tablets**\n* **Cacao Powder**\n* **Vitamin E from Wheat Germ Oil**\n\n# Successful Supplements and Practices\n\n**Supplements:**\n\n* **Magnesium Glycinate or Citrate (200mg):** Taken before bed.\n* **Zinc Glycinate (11mg):** Effective in small doses; larger doses reduced libido over time. Taken before bed.\n* **B-Complex and B6 (25mg):** High dose taken on and off for a decade, before bed.\n* **Fish Oil with 500mg DHA**\n* **Cod Liver Oil (1,200mg)**\n* **Vitamin D (4,000iu):** Taken with breakfast, which includes grass-fed butter rich in vitamin K2.\n\n**Dietary Additions:**\n\n* **Grass-fed Butter:** Rich in vitamin K2 and saturated fat.\n* **Sorghum:** Possible DHT increase. [Source](https://anabolicmen.com/dht-supplements/)\n* **Coffee:** Boosts testosterone; started drinking recently. [Source](https://www.ergo-log.com/more-testosterone-less-estradiol-in-coffee-drinkers.html)\n* **Eggs:** Two per day for cholesterol and micronutrients. Old school bodybuilders claimed significant testosterone boosts from high egg consumption. [Source](https://www.vincegironda.com/vince-girondas-36-eggs-a-day-diet-is-it-truly-as-good-as-steroids/)\n* **Homemade Kefir:** Higher CFUs than commercial probiotics. [Source](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/transplanted-bacteria-turn-up-testosterone-to-protect-mice-against-diabetes/)\n* **Gelatin:** One tablespoon before bed improved sleep quality.\n\n# Lifestyle Changes\n\nI significantly reduced alcohol consumption, which was a nightly habit after my mother passed away six years ago. Now, I only drink once a week, and this change has notably improved my sleep. Quality sleep is crucial for maximizing libido and testosterone.\n\n[More Sleep Can Double Your Testosterone](https://www.ergo-log.com/more-sleep-can-double-your-testosterone-level.html)\n\nRegular exercise remains a cornerstone of my routine.\n\n[Testosterone Levels in Men Over 50](https://www.ergo-log.com/testosterone-levels-in-men-over-50-age-is-not-a-factor.html)\n\nI hope my experiences can help others in their journey to improve libido and testosterone levels.

The ones I made at home were both greasy and waxy feeling, though they eventually did absorb. \n\nWhat could I do in the future to mimic the ones that were bought for me?

Adding a bit of coconut or jojoba oil, like the Seattle Sundries bars use, could help them absorb faster too :) I found a recipe guide with tips on balancing ingredients if you want to check it out: [Lotion Bar Recipe](https://inspirebeautytips.com/blogs/body-lotions-scrubs/lotion-bar-recipe). Hope the next batch gets closer to what you’re going for! :)",

I'd try a ratio with coconut oil in there, maybe 3 oz beeswax and 3 oz coconut oil and 4 oz almond oil (keeping the 5 oz of Shea butter).  You could also re-melt your bars and add coconut oil and shea butter so the aren't so firm, then re-pour.",

I recently had two cysts in the crease of my arm that were open and draining for a month.  Nothing helped, they wouldn’t close up and heal and were so painful. After two nights of applying wheat germ oil they started to heal and the pain subsided.  I’m not sure if it helps inflamed cysts as much as healing open ones.  Make sure to purchase a high quality oil that needs to be refrigerated.\n",

Only three ingredients , aloe, rosewater and sodium benzoate (food grade preservative)...no colours, no crap almost 100% pure going by the ingredient list. \n\nTIP: buy the tubs not the pumps...towards the end, the pump is pretty much useless to get remaining product out (had to use a dining knife to take it out).\n\n* Rustic Art Aloe Vera gel - blue tub without any extras. Other variants with lemon, papaya etc...not sure if they are using a preservative so best to use it fast. Expensive compared to Kazima.\n\n* desert essence aloe Vera gel - sometimes pops up on Amazon india, price too high\n\n**Aloe Vera ++**\n\n* forest essential aloe Vera - overpriced. Ingredients list has aloe Vera plus stuff like glycerin, **wheat germ oil (best avoided by oily skin)**, ashwagandha and **acqua** etc...seems nice but no mention of what percentage of aloe there plus that acqua! Makes me suspect probably high percentage is water and rest only a small part\n\n* face shop aloe - claims high percentage aloe but remaining percentage have plant pools and esters (which may not be FA safe). Value for money, comes in a huge tube.\n\n* Innisfree aloe -  very similar to face shop but has bigger ingredients list compared to face shop one...so probably more opportunity to trigger FA, but both this and the face shop one are great value for money if it suits.\n\n\nP.S. feel free to add your thoughts and any aloe products that you tried and liked.",

Also, measurements in cups and grams would be helpful. Beta-carotine and organic acids also boost iron absorption. Zinc RDA increases with increasing consumption of phytate-rich foods (wheats and legumes etc.)\n\nAlso the quote about spinach might be misleading because spinach contains non-heme iron which is harder to absorb (Fe3+) than heme-iron (Fe2+) and it contains high levels of oxalic acid which also interferes with the absorption. So it's not about how much is in spinach it should be about how much can be absorbed in comparison to the same amount of meat, eggs etc.",

I've been using moisturiser all over my body for many years because I used to have quite bad eczema on my arms and legs, and also was prescribed topical corticosteroids which thanks to the great brand Eucerin, I no longer need.\n\nI have combination skin, mildly oily with some dry patches on the face. I had mild acne as a teenager, treated ineffectually with stuff like Zineryt, oral antibiotics etc. It pretty much cleared up when I reached my twenties and went on the pill. I occasionally get the odd spot after bad sleep/diet, but don't really breakout. I still have some marks and redness on the chin and around the nose, as well as quite a few sebaceous filaments/blackheads (not sure which they are). I know having pores is normal, but when my former partner commented on 'my cute black dots' on my nose (I don't have freckles!) I started to think, yikes, they are kinda noticeable. I used to remove them with a blackhead remover tool, but as we all know, they just came back quite fast and I'm not sure how to keep them at bay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wear makeup about 2-3 times a week and use olive oil to remove it followed by washing with Cerave Foaming Cleanser.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy goals: reduce sebaceous filaments, reduce dryness but also control oiliness, reduce any dullness, and also start mild anti aging measures.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy skin routine: \n\nAM\n\nSplash my face with water\n\nEucerin Dry Skin Replenishing Face Cream 5% Urea\n\nEucerin Sun Sensitive Protect Face Sun Cream for Sensitive Skin SPF 50+\n\nEucerin Aquaphor (life saver) or Vaseline on dry patches\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPM\n\nWash with Cerave Foaming Cleanser with Niacinamide for normal to oily skin\n\nTwice a week: The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% (just started using, not seeing any noticeable results so far)\n\nEvery other night: Inkey List Retinol Serum (been using for a month or so, feel like this has improved the very faint smile lines I was getting)\n\nEucerin Dry Skin Replenishing Face Cream 5% Urea\n\nSome nights I don't use any retinol/creams and just use Neom's Perfect Night's Sleep facial oil as moisturiser (contains wheat germ oil, rosehip oil, soybean oil and cranberry seed oil)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have also bought The Ordinary's AHA/BHA peel, as I heard it can help with sebaceous filaments and I really want to reduce mine as they are so visible. I've used it once so far, planning to use it once every two weeks or so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tqeiq8tqykvb1.png?width=2316&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e818c96b8cabbc9553ebf2a162881295da91aea\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/amh892me0lvb1.png?width=2316&format=png&auto=webp&s=f454dc7f83b0289fafbddb0739408662fd8810e7",

There are many reasons your hair may fall out, from genetics and vitamin deficiencies to hormone changes. \n\nThere’s no magic bullet for growing hair, but research has shown some herbs may slow hair loss or help promote new growth. \n\n**Herbal hair oils**\n\nHair oils, also called hair tonics, are herbal extracts mixed in a carrier oil base. Some hair oils include multiple herbs and carrier oils.\n\nPopular carrier oils used to make herbal oils are: coconut oil, sweet almond oil, walnut oil, olive oil, jojoba oil, wheat germ oil\n\n**Some herbs used in herbal hair oils are:**\n\n* **Chinese hibiscus (*****Hibiscus rosa Sinensis*****):** Chinese hibiscus is an evergreen shrub. Its edible, vibrant flowers are often used to make herbal tea. Hibiscus is thought to help stimulate hair follicles, increase follicle size, and increase hair growth.\n* **Brahmi (*****Bacopa monnieri*****):** Brahmi, also called bacopa, is a creeping herb used in Ayurveda medicine. It contains alkaloids thought to activate proteins responsible for hair growth.\n* **Coat buttons (*****Tridax procumbent*****)*****:*** Coat buttons is a creeping Ayurvedic herb and member of the daisy family. It contains antioxidants and promotes hair growth on its own and in synergy with other herbs.\n* **Jatamansi** ***(Nardostachys jatamansi*****)*****:*** Jatamansi is a small shrub whose rhizomes may speed hair growth. It’s been shown to increase hair growth in alopecia caused by chemotherapy.\n* **Ginseng (*****Panax ginseng*****):** Ginseng is an age-old natural remedy for many conditions, including hair loss. It contains saponins, which are believed to encourage hair growth by inhibiting 5a reductase. This is an enzyme related to hair loss in men.\n\nInformation Source:  [Herbal Remedies for Hair Growth](https://www.healthline.com/health/herbs-for-hair-growth)",

Due to them NOT having the full spectrum of Vitamin E \"components\"... Is this true...?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf yes, what would you recommend taking for Vitamin E... Incorporating it in natural diet is quite hard since they are not that common. According to my research the best and safest way is to obtain vitamin E from \"Wheat Germ Oil\" supplement. This should have full range of vitamin E components and should be natural in origin... Is it so...? So i do not even have to bother with concrete vendor and just \"get some (general) Wheat Germ Oil\" and im good to go?",

I was so curious about these before I bought them, but I couldn’t find many reviews from people who follow CGM or have curly/wavy hair.\n\nAbout my hair: I have type 2 (ranging from a-c in different places on my head), fine, medium porosity, protein loving hair that is a bit longer than shoulder length. It has light bleach damage on the bottom 1/4 of it. \n\nAbout my routine: I live in Phoenix, AZ where it is very hot and very dry most of the time. I have pretty hard water, so I switch between using this shampoo and using a light chelating shampoo (Bb Sunday shampoo). I shampoo then condition and STC upside down. I detangle with a wetbrush and drizzle rinse out the conditioner, then using a TON of water, I scrunch in a defining cream, usually AG Re:coil, then glaze and scrunch in Harry's gel. I pixie diffuse to 80% dry and root clip, then SOTC once 100% dry.\n\nFormulate review: I started with the 8oz. size of both shampoo and conditioner (ingredients listed below).  I set my preferences to be no dyes, no anti-brass, silicone free (all formulate products are sulfate and paraben free). There are options to make them vegan and gluten free, but I did not select those.\n\nThe hair concerns I chose for them to base the ingredients off of were number one curl definition (lol wavy probs) followed by improve scalp health, prevent thinning, volumize and anti-frizz. For scent I chose Tidal for my first round (described as Ocean, Sage, Lily and Musk). \n\nI wasn’t really expecting to be that blown away by these. I've tried function of beauty and really didn't like it. I was considering Prose, and got these instead as a way to talk myself out of spending Prose money and I am SO GLAD I DID. I never knew I could love a shampoo and conditioner, I'm not a brand loyal person and almost never get the same thing twice because I like to experiment, but I will not be straying from these anytime soon. The shampoo is A GAME CHANGER. It has so much slip and is so hydrating I could honestly detangle my hair with just the shampoo in it. It feels so good and lathers well, leaves my scalp feeling actually clean. It has a weird consistency, there's a jelly-like substance mixed into a more traditional shampoo-like substance, but it doesn't really bother me at all when I'm using it. The conditioner is similarly amazing - so much slip, super moisturizing. It gives me such good definition, I mean better than most curl definers, that I started drizzle rinsing, something I’ve never done before, to leave some of it in even though it's not meant to be a leave in. It is shocking how much definition and clumping action it gives my hair!! \n\nLike most CGM users, and because I use my chelating shampoo every fourth wash day or so, I went through the conditioner faster than the shampoo and am now on my second bottle. I've sized up so now my conditioner will be 16oz. and my shampoo will be 8oz. I AM IN LOVE. I switched to a new scent because Tidal smells a bit too much like a man for my personal preference. I set my scent level to medium and I will say it does linger, not overpoweringly, but your hair will smell faintly like it even on day 2. \n\nMy formula does contain a little protein in both the shampoo and conditioner. My hair loves protein, so that's cool with me! Plus I feel it helps balance out the moisture. I suspect it's part of the reason I get such good definition from these. If you are considering trying Formulate, I cannot recommend it highly enough and truly feel it is worth every penny. In the past I've tried TGIN, Jessicurl, DevaCurl (pre-scandal) and As I Am, and nothing compares to Formulate, including products from my pre-CGM days.\nPackaging is really nice, although I wish they would offer the sustainable option to just get refills every month instead of new plastic bottles. I love the ease with which you can make edits to formula and cadence and bottle size. Having access to the formulation chemist and technician so you can talk to them if you have concerns or want changes instead of a call-center type of person is a really nice touch. The website has this awesome feature where it will tell you what every single ingredient is and why it’s there, which is so nice if you’re trying to learn more about hair care ingredients. \nI will say they put a weird amount of emphasis on whether you are a “him or a her” in their hair quiz and that’s just so dumb in my opinion. Hair has no gender, I can’t imagine why they need to know this, and they should have more options than the binary if it’s that important to them. Also it’s really hard even once you have an account to circumvent the stupid quiz and just login. Like way more annoying than it needs to be. These are my only complaints though. \n\n\nTL;DR: Very highly recommend these, worth every penny imo!!\n\nIngredients in my shampoo: Purified Water, Coconut-Derived Cleanser, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Diglycerin, Cocamide MIPA, At Dawn(scent), Methyl Gluceth-20, Guar Gum, Coconut-Derived Cleanser, Polyquaternium-7, Polyglycerol-2 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-6 Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate, Polyglyceryl-4 Cocoate, Polyglyceryl-6 Ricinoleate, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Argan Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Propanediol, Phenylpropanol, Panthenyl Hydroxypropyl Steardimonium Chloride, Sesame Seed Oil, p-Anisic Acid, Levulinic Acid, Vegetable Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Lactic Acid, Sodium Lactate, Carbamide, Starch Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Saw Palmetto, Sweet Almond Oil, Avocado Oil, Vitamin C, Beta-Sitosterol, Hemp Seed Oil, Vitamin E, Citrus Fruit Acid, Pumpkin Seed Oil, Broccoli Seed Oil, Aloe Vera\n\nIngredients in my condiitoner: Purified Water, Polyquaternium-7, Diglycerin, At Dawn(scent), Polyquaternium-32, Lecithin, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Oilseed Turnip, Butyl Stearate, Polyquaternium-37, Mineral Oil, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Polyglycerol-2 Laurate, Acetamide MEA, Sesame Seed Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Propanediol, Phenylpropanol, Argan Oil, Methyl Gluceth-20, Keratin Oil, Vitamin B5, Sweet Almond Oil, Cocoyl Hydrolyzed Collagen, Avocado Oil, Oleoyl Sarcosine, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenyl Hydroxypropyl Steardimonium Chloride, Coconut-Derived Cleanser, Saw Palmetto, Guar Gum, p-Anisic Acid, Levulinic Acid, Vegetable Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Lactic Acid, Sodium Lactate, Carbamide, Starch Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Vitamin C, Hemp Seed Oil, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitol, Beta-Sitosterol, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Polysorbate 80, Vitamin E, Jojoba Seed Oil, Linoleic Acid, Wheat Germ Oil, Wheat Germ Acid, Cocoyl Sarcosine, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acids, Vitamin E, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Aloe Vera, Broccoli Seed Oil, Pumpkin Seed Oil, Citrus Fruit Acid\n\nEdit: formatting",

So that takes care of that!\n\n34, male, generally healthy but looking to drop some body fat. I have started tracking with Cronometer and cut about 400 kcal/day since I started. That was already probably 200 kcal/day less than I was eating. In addition, I am doing some form of strength training (total newbie) and cardio every day.\n\nMy eating habits before starting this were maintenance calories (stable weight for years, until pandemic inactivity and post-brain surgery steroids) from pretty much \"all real food\" with lots of vegetables, and little to no processed junk foods or sweets. However, I was eating too many calories in grains (blithely thought \"whole grains\" automatically meant \"healthy\"), was too carefree with my fat intake, and didn't really emphasize lean protein (lived 4 years in India, 4 years in Vietnam).\n\nNow, I have managed to settle on a good program for meals/snacks through midday, and by the end of the day, I can usually hit somewhere in the 90% range with micronutrients while staying on track with macros. I started taking Vitamin D because I don't want to get skin cancer, and zinc (15mg every other day) because I don't eat red meat, and oysters are too impractical to eat frequently.\n\nThe two remaining micronutrients that seem to be insufficient are Vitamin E and choline. I am aiming for a fat intake of \\~0.4g–0.5/lb of bodyweight, which is 56–70g for me. It seems like the simplest way to hit the RDI of both Vitamin E and choline is through foods that also happen to be relatively high in fat, and thus high in calories. However, with this fat intake budget (56g) and calorie budget (1625kcal), the heavy hitters for these micronutrients (almonds, wheat germ oil, beef liver, beef, several eggs) are out of the question.\n\nSo, considering all that, is it worth supplementing choline and Vitamin E?",

It is found in many foods including vegetable oils, cereals, meat, poultry, eggs, fruits, vegetables, and wheat germ oil. It is also available as a supplement. Vitamin E supplements may prevent coronary heart disease , support immune function, prevent inflammation , promote eye health, and lower the risk of

It seems like any comprehensive  table of ratings would have been comprised of data from multiple sources, so the ratings would not be absolute or even directly comparable.  In addition, the degree of comedogenicity has been shown to change in the finished product. (Ie products with comedogenic ingredients may not be comedogenic) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/16488305/?i=5&from=comedogenic%20ingredients  Even the term itself isn't regulated or, as far as I can tell, standardized. [see Paula's choice article](http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/myths/_/six-meaningless-cosmetics-claims-you-shouldnt-believe) The only use is as a guide that any given ingredient is likely to cause acne, not an absolute to the degree of acne it will cause.   For instance, if you are reactive to fatty alcohol you can't predict that an ingredient rated higher will cause you breakouts.  Also, just because something has a rating of 0, doesn't mean it can't lead to exacerbation of acne.  \n\nI think there is some more history or additional information about where the scores came from.

The majority of the aftercare is fine, agrees with everything I've heard and is close enough to the official tattooit aftercare suggestions. During healing they recommend sparingly applying either Tattoo Goo or A&D ointment, but they kind of push the Tattoo Goo. I looked it up and it has 97% natural ingredients: Olive Oil, Beeswax, Cocoa Butter, Wheat Germ oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lavender Oil, Sunflower Oil, Rosemary Extract, and D&C Green 6.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with Tattoo Goo? Is it a better option than A&D ointment or Aquaphor? Would my tattoo/skin benefit any more from the natural ingredients (than if I used something else)?\n\nThanks guys!",

I apply approx. 2ml/day - keeping it on scalp for at least 2h - and am about to mix an updated batch tomorrow. Note: The ingredients should be significantly diluted before application.   \n\nThis serum is just one component of my regimen and I've just started with the latest revision, so I cannot answer whether it's been effective for me. I can say that I haven't noticed any shedding at all with my current regimen, which doesn't include RU/Fin/Dut/Min, while I have noticed significant shedding prior to it and some shedding when I was just using Keto. I have also noticed \"fuzzy regrowth\" and vellus hairs, but I think those came after adding microneedling.  \n\nThe ingredients are listed in the following format (without brackets and line breaks):  \n\n[Volume-based percentage of the total serum]  \n[Ingredient name]  \n[(Mechanism of action (+increase,-decrease), estimated hair count increase per cm^2 after 24 weeks with treatment alone from reference]   \n\n**15% Rosemary oil (Local blood flow+, [+7](https://issuu.com/pulsemarketing/docs/skinmed_v13_i1))  \n25% Procyanidin B-2 4% concentration (Protein kinase C-/TGF-beta-, [+28](https://media.turkports.com/wwweeose/Pdfler/procyanidinno_b.pdf))  \n20% Liquid saw palmetto extract (DHT-,[+34](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajd.12352)\\*\\*)  \n20% Curcuma aeruginosa \\*\\*\\* (DHT-, [+31](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546634.2011.568470))  \n10% Pumpkin seed oil (DHT-, n/a\\*\\*\\*\\*)    \n10% Castor oil (PGE2+, n/a)**    \n\n\n\n\n---  \n**EDIT (7/20/19); updated recipe:**   \n\nApply *Apple Poly Procyanidin B-2*  \n\nthen immediately apply homebrew mix:  \n\n3%\t0.9ml\tRosemary oil   \n3%\t0.9ml\tPeppermint Oil   \n25% 7.5ml\tSaw Palmetto  \n7% \t2.1ml\tCurcuma aeruginosa  \n29% 8.7ml\tPumpkin seed oil  \n10%\t3ml\tCastor oil  \n23%\t6.9ml\tethanolic safflower flower extract  \n\nthen apply Purador serum after 30 min   \n\n--- \n\nAfter application, I top it of with Pura d'or serum. It's cheap, doesn't have a lot of artificial stuff inside, has a lot of ingredients \"to fill in the gaps\" like caffeine, and it may also have some penetration enhancers.  \n\nConstructive feedback is welcome - e.g., legitimate limitations of studies, transfollicular penetration issues, potential side effects, further ingredients supported by double-blind studies of AGA subjects etc. Please no comments like \"only the big 4 work,\" \"natural stuff doesn't work.\" A minority of people experience sides on effective, first-line treatments like finasteride and minoxidil. At the other end, not everything that's natural works:  \n\n> [Bogus Treatments: In 1980 an advisory panel to the US Food and Drug Administration evaluated a number of substances used in hair lotions and creams—including amino acids, aminobenzoic acid, ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, B vitamins, hormones, jojoba oil, lanolin, polysorbates 20 and 660, sulphanilamide, tetracaine hydrochloride, urea, and wheat germ oil—and subsequently proposed that these products be removed from the market. Other ineffective remedies include scalp massage, dietary modification, frequent shampooing, electrical stimulation, and Chinese herbal extracts.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1113949/#B27).  \n\nThen there's a ton of mice studies that might not generalize to humans. The studies above have been with human patients, however.    \n\nI don't want to publish the places where you can buy these products as it may violate the \"no advertising\" rule of this subreddit, but most of these ingredients can be found pretty easily on Amazon (or Google).  \n\nI'm looking to update and improve the recipe over time.  \n\nEDIT: I've made a small modification. I now apply the Procyanidin B-2 4% concentration first, and then apply the rest. This is based on the instructions given to me by the vendor (apply water-based Procyanidin B-2 first, and only then oil-based products).  \n\n\\*\\*  The study treatment also contained green tea extract, Peony root extract, Piroctone-olamine, Oligopeptides  \n\\*\\*\\* I couldn't find the liquid form of this particular plant, so I'm using plain liquid tumeric, which I believe is very similar.  \n\\*\\*\\*\\* Oral pumpkin seed oil 400mg/d plus other ingredients (Octa-Sabal Plus) demonstrated an estimated hair count increase of +85 after 24 weeks. I say *estimated* because they only have the relative increase of 40% and I found out the average hair count in 1 cm^2 from one of the other studies.",

Normally there's a lot of onion in a goulash that is naturally left out of this recipe.\n\nThe recipe is for about 5 kilograms of food. After cooking I had 4,7 kilograms. The recipe is for gently cooking and is tailored to puppies. I use a slow cooker set to low to cook the food for that. Having it simmer on low on the stove should also work. Just don't cook it at high heat and for long periods.\n\nThe recipe is balanced using Animal Diet Formulator. The analysis results is in the pictures at the end of the recipe.\n\nThe meal has 1,32 kcal per gram. Use that to calculate the portion size for your dog. Don't use the portion size in the ADF results as those are for my dogs.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 2 kg Ground beef (Grass-fed 85% lean)\n* 250 gr Beef heart\n* 200 gr Beef liver\n* 150 gr Beef spleen\n* 200 gr Mussels raw\n* 200 gr Oysters raw (Canned in water)\n* 150 gr Egg (about 3 eggs)\n* 500 gr Bell pepper / Paprika. Mix of red, green en yellow\n* 250 gr Carrots\n* 300 gr Tomato\n* 400 gr Sweet potato\n* 250 gr Mushrooms (Button or Portabello)\n* 10 gr Garlic fresh\n* 25 gr Parsley dried\n* 5 gr Caraway seed\n* 5 gr Sea salt\n* 5 gr Black pepper\n* 10 gr Turmeric\n* 20 gr Hempseed hulled\n* 40 Wheat Germ Oil\n* 10 gr Kelp, dried 700 mcg/g Iodine\n* 60 gr Bonemeal\n* 10 gr Nutritional yeast\n* 1 tablet Vitamin D 1000 IU\n* 3 capsules Choline 350 mg / capsule\n* 2 tablets Copper\n\n[All the ingredients for the goulash](https://preview.redd.it/ev5gpnc61q7f1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f125763d67d5602f68c3cce93590f2d081d0433)\n\n**Instructions**\n\nThe bell pepper, sweet potato and mushrooms I have bought pre-cut and frozen from the supermarket. \n\nCut all the fresh vegetables in to small pieces if not bought pre-cut. If you run the food through a blender or food processor after it has cooked you can use bigger pieces. I didn't so I cut the veggies in to bite size pieces.\n\nSame for the beef heart, liver and spleen. Cut these in to bite size chunks\n\nAdd all the ingredients to a slow cooker. I had a bit too much to fit in my slow cooker so I had to split the ingredients in to two portions. If you do that combine everything well after the cooking process to combine all the ingredients and supplements. If you don't combine the ingredients properly you won't have balanced meals.\n\n[The ingredients in the slow cooker ready to cook](https://preview.redd.it/nhofhxj91q7f1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e673b7fd3c5fda14e4240b523aed66b288a06bd)\n\nSet the slow cooker to low. After about 3 - 4 hours depending on your slow cooker the meat will be cooked and the vegetables will be soft. \n\n[After about 3 to 4 hours the food will be cooked](https://preview.redd.it/v8zron1d1q7f1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba6eaca2b90b301fb712b5c276b4b37c9ae0336c)\n\nEither run the food through a food processor and mix everything well or just mix without the blending.\n\n[All ingredients well combined after cooking](https://preview.redd.it/z9yhrbwf1q7f1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8e1ba3c5c9bd79132ccc1cd62bb210ff0e3457f)\n\nI let some of the goulash cool for a little taste test with the pups.

Although, in size each tub looks really close to a cup.  I was really looking for a thick, hand moisturizer to combat the harsh winter temperatures.  I think it works really well and absorbs easily.  The container says it can be used for any part of the body, but I haven't applied it to my face.  In terms of cost, this seems to be very competitive versus what a same size tub or bottle from CeraVe or similar brand would cost.  The tube of CeraVe Hand Therapy was $10.xx and is a fraction of the size of ONE of these tubs and seems to work just as well.  Also, it's made in the USA for those who try to keep their money here.\n\n<i>INGREDIENTS: water, mineral oil, glyceral stearate, cetyl alchohol, stearic acid, glycerin, stearyl alcohol, vitamin e, soluble collagen, hydrolyzed elastin, aloe leaf juice, squalane, wheat germ oil, vitamin a, dimethicone, coconut oil, sunflower seed oil, carbomer, triethanolamine, propylene glycol, diazolidinyl urea, methylparaben, propylparaben, parfum</i>\n\n(apologies for any spelling errors)\n\n[The product thumbnail  ~~in the middle~~ for the Vitamin E Skin Care Cream is the product I'm talking about](http://fote.com/skincare/), but there seems to be no real information on the page despite the tub directing customers to it.\n\nIf this looks like a good buy, then share with your friends and family!  If not, I'm interested in its flaws.  \n\nThanks everyone!\n\ne: link and wording.",

    "body": "There is nothing more attractive than a thick head of hair that glimmers with natural health. But hair loss is a problem that many people suffer from.\n\nThere can be several factors behind hair loss such as environmental effects, aging, too much stress, excessive smoking, nutritional deficiencies, hormonal imbalance, genetic factors, scalp infections, use of wrong or chemically enriched hair products, certain medicines and medical conditions like thyroid disorder, autoimmune diseases, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), iron-deficiency anemia, and chronic illnesses.\n\nit’s time for you to take some action so it doesn’t progress to [baldness](https://www.cosmeticssurgerycentre.com/cosmetic-reconstructive-services-mumbai/hair-restoration/) or bald spots. Many readily available ingredients can be used to treat hair loss at home.\n\n1. Hair Oil Massage\n\nThe first step that you can take to reduce hair loss is to massage your scalp with appropriate hair oil. Proper hair and scalp massage will increase blood flow to the hair follicles, condition the scalp, and enhance the strength of your hair’s roots. It will also promote relaxation and reduce feelings of stress.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/02gbo7338c611.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9947921df20c7286f90ee5086571bec63631569\n\nYou can use hair oils like coconut or almond oil, olive oil, castor oil, amla oil, or others. Add a few drops of rosemary essential oil to the base oil for better and faster results. Other types of oil that you can use are emu oil, argan oil, and wheat germ oil.\n\n1. Massage any of the hair oils mentioned above onto your hair and scalp by applying light pressure with your fingertips.\n2. Do this at least once a week.\n3. Indian Gooseberry\n\nFor natural and fast hair growth, you can use Indian gooseberry, also known as amla. Indian gooseberry is rich in vitamin C, of which a deficiency in the body can cause hair loss.\n\nThe anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and the exfoliating properties present in Indian gooseberry can help maintain a healthy scalp and promote hair growth.\n\n1. Mix one tablespoon each of Indian gooseberry or amla pulp and lemon juice.\n2. Massage your scalp with the mixture thoroughly. Cover your hair with a shower cap.\n3. Leave it on overnight and shampoo your hair in the morning.\n4. Fenugreek\n\nFenugreek, also known as methi, is highly effective in treating hair loss. Fenugreek seeds contain hormone antecedents that enhance hair growth and help rebuild hair follicles. They also contain proteins and nicotinic acid that stimulate hair growth.\n\n1. Soak one cup of fenugreek seeds in water overnight.\n2. In the morning, grind them to make a paste.\n3. Apply the paste to your hair and cover with a shower cap. After about 40 minutes, rinse your hair.\n4. Follow this remedy every morning for a month.\n5. Onion Juice\n\nOnion juice helps treat hair loss due to its high sulfur content, which helps improve blood circulation to the hair follicles, regenerate hair follicles and reduce inflammation.",

However, the inflammation/lack of mobility is clearly modifiable, on the 4th day of a recent water only fast, my muscles felt incredible and very pliable, I was almost dunking a basketball, but that did not remain after refeeding.\n\nAny thoughts about what else I could do? I stationary bike often, lift weights, ice bathe, sauna. These help but not lasting. I was playing basketball in a league but strained my hamstring mildly, likely due to this inflammation issue.\n\nI don't think it is severe enough to try TNF-a inhibitors (side effects) but still impacts my life.\n\n&#x200B;",

    "body": "Yo, brothers! It's so important to remember that if you’re trying to set the stage for the fastest, fullest, healthiest growth, the first step is reducing inflammation. For folks with sensitive skin, that can be tougher than it is for others, so I wanted to write this short guide for you. A brother asked about this on the sub yesterday, and most of this info was there, but I thought it deserved its own post in case someone needs it down the road. Let’s dive in.\n\nFirst off, sensitive skin can be a challenge, but it’s super manageable once you know what to look for. The beard care market is full of products that claim to work miracles, but a lot of them are downright awful for sensitive skin. Here’s what you need to know to find products that actually help rather than hurt. Here's a few red flags to watch for!\n\n**Understand the oils**\n\nNot all oils are created equal, especially for sensitive skin. The big thing to look for is the oil's comedogenic rating. This tells you how likely an oil is to clog your pores. For sensitive skin, stick with oils that have a rating of 2 or lower. Anything below 1 is even better and is classified as \"non-comedogenic\". That’s the gold standard. Clogging your pores can lead to irritation, inflammation, and even breakouts, which is the exact opposite of what you want when trying to grow a healthy beard. You can look these up with a quick Google search, but here's some common ones. \n\n**Hemp Seed Oil** – 0,2  \n**Argan Oil** – 0.7  \n**Sweet Almond Oil** – 1.7  \n**Jojoba Oil** – 2.6  \n**Grapeseed Oil** – 0.8  \n**Avocado Oil** – 1.9  \n**Castor Oil** – 1.1  \n**Coconut Oil (Unrefined)** – 4.5  \n**Coconut Oil (Fractionated)** – 0.8  \n**Olive Oil** – 2.6  \n**Apricot Kernel Oil** – 1.7  \n**Hazelnut Oil** – 0.7  \n**Sunflower Oil** – 0.3  \n**Macadamia Nut Oil** – 2.1  \n**Pumpkin Seed Oil** – 2.4  \n**Rice Bran Oil** – 2.1  \n**Rosehip Seed Oil** – 1.5  \n**Baobab Oil** – 1.6  \n**Meadowfoam Seed Oil** – 1.4  \n**Shea Butter (Unrefined)** – 0.4  \n**Shea Butter Oil** – 1.4  \n**Lanolin Oil** – 4.2  \n**Palm Kernel Oil** – 4.1  \n**Wheat Germ Oil** – 5  \n**Emu Oil** – 3.3  \n**Ostrich Oil** – 3.6  \n**Duck Oil** – 4.2\n\nYou can take a quick average of a blend to get a loose idea, but that's the best you can do without knowing the exact ratios a company uses of each oil. Always ask. Any company worth a damn will know the comedogenic rating of their formula off-hand. \n\n**Avoid artificial fragrances**\n\nArtificial fragrances are one of the worst offenders for sensitive skin. These are often alcohol-based or packed with synthetic chemicals that can trigger reactions. Common culprits like linalool and limonene are found in tons of mass-market products. You want to see \"No Artificial Fragrances\" on the label. Essential oils are usually a better choice, but even those need to be used carefully. Regulation in the essential oil world is basically nonexistent, and there’s a ton of misinformation out there. For example, most don't know that there are only 176 recognized essential oils, and of those, only about 102 are commonly used in scenting. So if someone’s telling you they’ve got \"leather\", \"tobacco\", or \"mahogany\" essential oil, that’s nonsense. Those aren’t essential oils. They might be fragrance oils derived from natural absolutes (which is a whole thing). but they are more likely artificial and made with synthetic chemicals. Either way, avoid them unless you know exactly how they’re made. Even with real essential oils, concentration matters. Sensitive skin can’t handle high doses. The safe level for essential oils in a beard product is about 1.75% or less. Anything more can lead to major reactions or even photosensitivity.\n\n**Choose the right cleanser**\n\nSensitive skin thrives in a balanced ecosystem. That means finding a pH-balanced beard wash and using it as necessary. Always follow up with a good, non-comedogenic oil to calm the skin and keep inflammation under control. Harsh soaps or products with sulfates will strip your beard and the skin beneath it of natural oils, leaving everything dry and irritated. That’s a fast track to more inflammation and slower growth, especially for dudes with sensitive skin. Stick to gentle cleansers designed specifically for beards.\n\nSensitive skin might take a little more effort, but always worth it to grow a great beard. Employ these tools and let that beard rip, y'all. ",

The almond is also the name of the edible and widely cultivated seed of this tree.\n\n\nTypes of almonds\n\n\n1. Bitter : These almonds are used for making (almond) oil, which has multiple benefits.\n\n\n2. Sweet : Sweet almonds are edible in nature.\n\n\n\nProperties and benefits of Almond\n\nProperties:\n\n• Taste) – Sweet\n• Potency – Hot\n• Quality – Slimy), Heavy\n• Undergoes swet taste after digestion – Madhura(sweet)\n\n• Effects on Tridosha – Reduces vata dosha but Increase pitta dosha\n\n• Vrsya (Aphrodisiac), Balya (Provide strength)\n\n\nBenefits\n\n• Vrushya – aphrodisiac, improves vigor\n• Vatahara – useful in treating disorders of Vata Dosha imbalance  such as neuralgia, paralysis, constipation, bloating, etc\n• Shukrala – improves sperm and semen quantity and quality\n• Raktapitta –useful in bleeding disorders such as nasal bleeding, heavy periods, etc\nIts fruit pulp is balances Vata and Pitta Dosha. It slightly increases Kapha Dosha\n\n\n\nnutritional value of almond\n\n\n• Vitamin : E, B1, B2, B3, B6, B9, A \n\n• Minerals : calcium, copper, magnesium, selenium, zinc, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, magnese and choline(Choline is often not classified as a vitamin, but as a nutrient with an amino acid-like metabolism)\n\n\n• Almonds contain approximately 49% oils , of which 62% is mono-unsaturated oleic acid (an omega-9 fatty acid), 24% is linoleic acid (a poly unsaturated omega 6 essential fatty acid) \n\nand 6% is palmitic acid (a saturated fatty acid). A trace of arachidic acid has also been found. \n\n\n• Phenolic compounds : flavonols (isorhamnetin, kaempferol, quercetin, catechin and epicatechin), flavanones (naringenin), anthocyanins (cyanidins \n\nand delohinidin), procyanidins, and phenolic acids (caffeic acid, ferulic acid, P-coumaric acid and Vanillic acid)\n\n\nInformation about vitamin and minerals which are in large amount\n\n\n1) Fibres:  improve your bowel movement and digestion\n\n\n\n2) Proteins:  repair your muscles and tissues. \n\n\n\n3) Vitamin E: protects body from free radicals act as a antioxidant\n\n\n                 - It also enhances immune function and prevents clots from forming in heart arteries. \n\nThese antioxidants tend to build up in cell membranes in your body, protecting your cells from oxidative damage.\n\n\n               - Vitamin E rich substance: Wheat germ oil, Sunflower, safflower, and soybean oil, Sunflower seeds,Peanuts, peanut butter, Beet greens, collard greens, spinach, Pumpkin, Red bell pepper,Asparagus, Mango, Avocado.\n\n\n\n4) Manganese: magnesium in almonds  help to decrease blood pressure. Magnesium intake may offer major improvements for metabolic syndrome.\n\n\n\n5) Magnesium:  The mineral plays an important role in assisting more than 300 enzymes to carry out various chemical reactions in the body such as building proteins and strong bones, and regulating blood sugar, blood pressure, and muscle and nerve functions. Magnesium also acts an electrical conductor that contracts muscles and makes the heart beat steadily.\n\n\n          - Magnesium is a key factor in making several parts of the body run smoothly: the heart, bones, muscles, nerves, and others. \n\n\n\n6) biotin(vit. B7): Biotin plays a vital role in assisting enzymes to break down fats, carbohydrates, and proteins in food.

I was an idiot and reduced my gluten intake before going to my doctor, because I was trying to figure out what was causing my problems (at the time mainly just bloating). So I decided to go properly gluten free, because the 5 more weeks of gluten didn't sound that appealing at the time if I wanted to be tested. \n\nNow if I have any (haven't intentionally, but cross contamination gets me) I get bloating, stomach pain, nausea,etc, and acne. If in skincare products/shampoo (hydrolyzed wheat protein and wheat germ oil), I get itchy skin. So I know I'm reacting to something. \n\nI'm at the point where I just want to know if it's coeliac disease or not, but the thought of the gluten challenge puts me off. I'm in a master's year at uni, so while I'm not in as much as I used to be, I need to be productive, and I worry eating gluten and the associated symptoms is going to ruin my life and work ethic for the month. \n\nSo, do you think it's worth it?",

    "body": "Sleep is essential to good health, but many of us struggle to slip into the deep slumber we desire. This can be due to a multitude of reasons, both physical and psychological, from stress, anxiety, depression, or poor lifestyle choices leading to insomnia, or underlying medical conditions or obesity causing sleep apnea or other sleep disorders. \n\n8 Necessary Vitamins And Minerals for Sleeping Better\n\nIf you are like most people, you probably can resonate with some bits of it:\n\n*You start the day off feeling pretty good after a cup of coffee. You get through the morning – maybe you catch a quick lunch workout, then around 2 or 4pm, you hit a slump. You feel like you could spend 4 hours in the staff nap room, but you know you have 24 more emails to get through before you can even begin to start winding down your workday. You promise yourself you’ll go to bed early, and if you wake up you won’t stare at your phone until the wee hours of the morning.*\n\n*You have another cup of coffee on the drive home from work, start dinner, sit with the kids and family, load the dishwasher, and still have to put together the summary of a presentation for tomorrow morning. You feel more tired and overwhelmed, so you catch an episode of your favorite show and spend an hour wrapping up your presentation only to find its 10:30pm and you are exhausted.*\n\n*You go to bed, but you just haven’t had the time to wind down so you lie there looking at the ceiling, listening to your partner snore like a chainsaw. When you do finally get to sleep, you wake up four hours later in the wee hours of the morning, and can’t get back to sleep…*\n\nYou’re tired, so why can’t you go back to sleep?\n\nSometimes, our bodily sleep cycles get a little mixed up due to the poor nutritional choices we make in our day to day lives. We eat fast food on the run and miss out on important nutrients our bodies need to function properly and run smoothly. A body can only function properly for so long with an improper diet then at some point something has got to give.\n\nThis article will show you 8 vitamins, minerals and supplements to help you get a better sleep and increase your energy and productivity to help you look and feel your best!\n\n**A Word of Caution:**\n\nIt is always important to talk to your doctor or pharmacist prior to using vitamins for sleep or adding supplements to your diet, as some of them you can overload on – such as iron, and the fat soluble Vitamins A, D E & K.\n\nA doctor, pharmacist or dietician can give you specific advice about how much of any supplement you may need as some supplements are not suitable for people who are pregnant, breastfeeding or have certain medical disorders.\n\n### 1. Vitamin D\n\nMost experts agree that Vitamin D isn’t actually a vitamin but rather, a hormone made in the body with the help of sunlight.\n\nIn a meta-analysis published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, it was found that Vitamin D deficiency is in fact associated with a higher risk of sleep disorders and that with less than 20 ng/mL Vitamin D could increase the risk of sleep disorders.\n\nYou can get Vitamin D from supplementation, and sunlight! Some foods high in Vitamin D are eggs, salmon, tuna fish, and mushrooms.\n\nCheck with your doctor or pharmacist to see what your current Vitamin D level is and how much you should be supplementing. Because Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin, it can get stored in your body and become toxic if the level is too high.\n\n### 2. Vitamin E\n\nA 2011 study looking at the neuroprotective effect of Vitamin E showed that Vitamin E can prevent sleep deprivation-induced memory impairment, as well as normalizing hippocampus antioxidant mechanisms during sleep deprivation.\n\nIn addition to this, Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant – protecting the body tissue from free radical damage, and playing a role in healthy aging.\n\nIt also helps to keep the immune system strong, is important in the formation of red blood cells and helps the body use Vitamin K.\n\nSunflower seeds, almonds, and wheat germ oil are foods that contain Vitamin E in relatively decent amounts. You can also buy it in capsule form at most pharmacies.\n\nVitamin E is another of the fat-soluble vitamins, so check in with your doctor or pharmacist to assess your needs.\n\n### 3. B Vitamins\n\nThere are 8 B Vitamins that are vital to your health which together are called the B -complex Vitamins. Some emerging research shows that certain B-Vitamins – B3, B5, B6, B9 & B12 to be exact – help regulate the body’s supply of Tryptophan, which in turn helps the body produce melatonin. Melatonin is a hormone produced in your body to make you sleepy. *(More on Tryptophan and Melatonin later).*\n\nThe B-Vitamins are typically included in most multivitamins, or you can purchase B-Complex on its own in supplement form. A healthy, well rounded diet with plenty of whole grains, meats, fruit and veggies often provides a good base amount for the body.\n\n### 4. Calcium & Magnesium\n\nThese two minerals are often recommended together just before bed as they both play a role in muscle contraction and relaxation.\n\nIt is believed that a lack of Calcium and Magnesium can cause numerous sleep interruptions throughout the night, and Calcium works with Tryptophan (another hormone involved in sleepiness) to produce Melatonin which helps induce sleep. Chronic insomnia is also one of the initial symptoms of Magnesium deficiency.\n\nA diet rich in greens, nuts and seeds will ensure you get Magnesium and Calcium as well as you can buy a supplement containing both at any pharmacy.\n\n### 5. Theanine\n\nTheanine is an amazing amino acid that is found in tea leaves – particularly green tea – and some types of mushrooms.\n\nTheanine boosts some of the chemicals in the brain (such as dopamine, GABA, and serotonin) which help to regulate sleep. It also lowers chemicals in the brain that have an excitatory effect.\n\nExperts believe it helps induce sleepiness and speed up the time it takes to fall asleep as well as improving sleep quality.\n\nAs mentioned, you can get Theanine from green tea. However, you can also find it in supplement form at many pharmacies.\n\n### 6. Iron\n\nThe number one symptom of low Iron levels is fatigue and sleep disturbance. Low iron levels are thought to be a major risk factor in Restless Leg Syndrome, which can cause sleeplessness or insomnia.\n\nLow iron can also contribute to feelings of anxiety which can make sleep tough as well.\n\nHave your doctor check your iron levels. If you are low, they will recommend a supplement. Did you know that your body absorbs 2 to 3 times more iron from animal sources than from plant sources?\n\nHack: Vitamin C helps your body absorb Iron, so try taking any recommended supplements with apple or orange juice!\n\nThe following foods are high in iron:\n\nLean beef, oysters, chicken, turkey, beans and lentils, tofu, baked potatoes, cashews, dark green leafy vegetables such as spinach, fortified breakfast cereals, whole-grain and enriched breads.\n\n### 7. Melatonin\n\nMelatonin is a hormone naturally produced by the body, which makes you feel sleepy.\n\nIf you are having trouble getting to sleep, you can also find it in supplement form and typically taking it for a short period (two weeks or so) can help reset your circadian rhythm and let you fall asleep faster. Experts recommend trying it for a short period then stopping supplementation and seeing how your body has responded.\n\nYou can help melatonin do its job by “setting the mood”. Turn the lights low, shut off screens, and get cozy.\n\nAnd if you still have trouble getting to sleep, you can find its supplement at almost any pharmacy.\n\n### 8. Tryptophan\n\nYou know how after Thanksgiving dinner, everyone heads for the recliner or couch and falls asleep? Studies have shown over and over again that tryptophan can induce sleepiness and help you fall asleep faster.\n\nYou can buy tryptophan supplements at most pharmacies. You can also get it from many foods such as: nuts, seeds, poultry (not just turkey), milk, spinach, eggs and salmon.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nHealthy sleep is imperative for overall bodily health, yet it is not uncommon to experience sleep issues at different times in your life – for many different reasons.\n\nWhether it is stress, or hormone related or otherwise, there are many things that can assist you to improve your sleep.\n\n6 Tips for a Better Bedtime Routine\n\nSure, without a bedtime routine, you will eventually fall asleep. But who knows how long that will take—or how well you will actually sleep when the lights go out.\n\n“Most of us cannot sleep on command, but routine helps the brain know that it’s preparing for sleep,” says Rebecca Scott, research assistant professor of neurology at the NYU Langone Comprehensive Epilepsy Center—Sleep Center. “Our sleep system, along with most other neurophysiological systems, likes predictability and consistency.”\n\nWhy? Because predictability and consistency are boring. It’s calm. “Routine implies safety,” says Dr. Rafael Pelayo, clinical professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine. “It’s why we read kids the same story every night.”\n\nHere are six tips to creating a bedtime routine that will have you waking up feeling better. Remember, the key to these tips is making them part of your routine—so no giving up after two nights! Pelayo notes that some people need a few weeks or even a couple of months for their bodies to really cement a routine.\n\n### 1. Give yourself time to decompress from your day\n\n“One of the top mistakes that women make is that they fail to take time to themselves that they need to wind down and decompress from their day,” Scott says. “Women are under overwhelming pressure to excel in all areas of their lives—to be the perfect mother, worker, daughter, partner, and struggle with balancing or even recognizing their own needs.” But to go to sleep, you need to. “The brain is preparing for sleep about two hours before our actual bedtime. We literally go from billions of neurons firing up all day to keep us alert, active and engaged, and that waking system has to slowly come down to allow the sleep system to take over.”\n\nDr. Peter A. Fotinakes, medical director of the St. Joseph Hospital Sleep Center, recommends his patients to set an alarm an hour to two prior to their expected bedtime —and that they use it to remind them to wind down from the day. Do something you truly enjoy and find relaxing. It could be spending some time with your partner or family, taking a “me” break, reading or even watching TV.\n\n### 2. But don’t wind down with your gadgets\n\nIf you do decide to catch up on your favorite show, don’t do it on your computer or tablet. “Generally, the TV is far enough away from the eye and does not give off the same type of light that other hand-held devices emit, Scott says. Now more than ever we know the impact of blue light on sleep quality and alertness, and we know that even just a few seconds of exposure from a blue light-emitting device an hour before bed can disrupt the melatonin rhythm, a rhythm that is so critical to helping us fall asleep, stay asleep and wake up feeling refreshed.”\n\n### 3. Eat a light, pre-bedtime snack (if you’re hungry)\n\nWhile heavy foods and big meals or snacks consumed right before bed can disrupt sleep, the greater nighttime food issue facing many women is hunger, Fotinakes says. “In our perpetually dieting world, it’s not uncommon to lie in bed hungry, but not wanting to eat in an effort to save calories. However, hunger is stimulating and fragments sleep,” he says\n\nSound familiar? Go ahead and eat a light snack before bed, preferably one that is low in fat, which can spur nighttime acid reflux. “Eating a light carbohydrate or protein snack prior to bedtime will stave off hunger without causing you to crash and awaken later in the night,” Fotinakes says. Possible snack choices include an apple, slice of lean turkey or a cup of yogurt.\n\n### 4. Take a warm bath two to three hours before bed\n\nAccording to research from Cornell University Medical College, a nighttime drop in core body temperature increases one’s chances of both falling asleep and enjoying the coveted deep layers of sleep.\n\nInterestingly, one of the best ways to trigger a drop in your body temperature is to raise it two to three hours earlier by taking a warm bath, Scott says. When your body senses the increase in core temp, it responds by dilating your blood vessels and directing blood flow toward your skin, which quickly releases heat. If you find yourself in need of some extra relaxation, you can also try adding some lavender oil to the water.\n\n### 5. Don’t get into bed until right before it’s time to sleep\n\nYou’ve probably heard the saying that your bed is for sleep and sex—and that’s it. But even those extra hours spent reading or watching TV before sleep can add up. “The more time you spend in the bed before you sleep, the more your body gets used to being awake in bed,” says Pelayo.\n\nHe recommends spending any time winding down before bed in a “daytime” space like the living room, then heading to bed about 20 minutes before you want to be asleep.\n\n### 6. Go to bed at the same time every night\n\n“We have an internal sleep-wake cycle that revolves around the 24-hour day,” Fotinakes says. “I tell patient that I don’t care so much about when they sleep, but that they get enough sleep and keep their sleep cycle regular.” That goes even for the weekends. Sleeping in to compensate for late Friday or Saturday nights—or sleep-deprived workweeks—is a major cause of insomnia and sleep trouble, he says.\n\nSource: [http://www.hiwamag.com/health/8-essential-vitamins-minerals-help-sleep-better/](http://www.hiwamag.com/health/8-essential-vitamins-minerals-help-sleep-better/)",

Looks like this is your first time posting in this sub, but I also saw you’ve been active in the r/hardflaccidresearch subreddit.\n\nGlad you were able to get a second opinion, and that you’re feeling some improvement. That said…for anyone reading this and thinking about trying the same stack, please check with a qualified doctor first.\n\nSome of these meds are used off-label or are region specific, and while a few may support blood flow or inflammation, they’re not guaranteed to address the root issue… especially if there’s been an injury like a suspected ligament tear.\n\nPost injury protocols need to be evaluated case by case. What works for one person could cause complications in another. \n\nFor example, Etoricoxib is banned in the U.S. The FDA voted not to approve it due to concerns about cardiovascular risk and its potential to exacerbate hypertension. That said, I understand it’s prescribed in other countries where guidelines differ\n\nBut in this subreddit, dozens of ED subtypes are discussed, including those related to blood pressure… so, blanket recommendations can get risky, or misinterpreted (especially for those guys)\n\nAgain, while this may be a legit recommendation in your region from a licensed provider, it’s really important for others reading this to speak to their own doctor before trying the same stack.",

    "body": "Almost everyone is aware about **Dr. Barrie Tan** the great researcher of tocotrienols vitamin E.\n\nBarrie is above all else a researcher with a Ph. D. in Chemistry/Biochemistry, began as an associate teacher at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst (Chemistry, Food Science and Nutrition). His central goal at [**American River Nutrition**](https://www.eannatto.com) is to convey the most elevated quality nourishing items dependent on sound logical research.\n\nThroughout the previous 35 years, Barrie has submerged himself in the realm of Vitamin E and is viewed as one of the world’s premier specialists, credited with finding tocotrienol in 3 noteworthy common sources – Palm, Rice and Annatto. Barrie proceeded with his exploration and was before long remunerated when he found the top tier tocotrienol in the Annatto plant!\n\nBarrie’s association with Annatto has spread over **20 years** and various clinical preliminaries crosswise over ceaseless ailments – Annatto tocotrienol has demonstrated clinical advantages. To peruse increasingly about these preliminaries, it would be ideal if you click the “see more” catch to one side.\n\n**Dr. Barrie Tan** is hailed as a pioneer and the world’s premier master on nutrient E. Dr. Tan is credited with finding a type of nutrient E called tocotrienol in the three noteworthy sources – Palm, Rice and Annatto. Portrayed as a logical pioneer, his main goal is basic: improve the regular strength of individuals’ lives through the thorough utilization of DeltaGold® – the first-since forever without tocopherol tocotrienol item removed from annatto and the most powerful type of nutrient E in presence today.\n\n## Dr. Barrie Tan has did following investigations on tocotrienols\n\n## How Can It Work?\n\nIn spite of the fact that from the outset, the nutrient E particles show up the equivalent, subtleties in their sub-atomic structure set them apart. While both are outstanding cancer prevention agents, just tocotrienol is progressively adaptable because of three twofold bonds in the tail locale of the particle, bringing about advantages other than security from oxidation. Besides, littler tocotrienol atoms, specifically delta-and gamma-tocotrienol, were demonstrated to be most powerful for most applications, since their little size enables simpler access to cell layers to all the more promptly extinguish free radicals.\n\n## Three Sources of Tocotrienol\n\nAnnatto Until 2003, the main business wellsprings of characteristic tocotrienol were palm and rice. Henceforth, early investigations used tocotrienol got from these two sources. The two sources, in any case, contain huge measures of alpha-tocopherol, which was set up to meddle with tocotrienol benefits. “Palm tocotrienol” and “rice tocotrienol”, likewise some of the time called tocotrienol-rich portion (TRF), are really blends of tocopherol and tocotrienol, normally containing 25-half tocopherol (for the most part as alpha-tocopherol). Annatto normally gives just the most powerful delta-and gamma-tocotrienol while being without tocopherol, a piece at no other time seen.\n\n## For what reason is Tocopherol-Free Important?\n\nTocopherol meddles with tocotrienol benefits. Without precedent for 1996, the cholesterol-balancing properties of tocotrienol were observed to be undermined by one of its own special nutrient E kin, alpha-tocopherol. The scientists inferred that powerful tocotrienol arrangements ought to contain fewer than 15% of alpha-tocopherol and over 60% of desmethyl tocotrienols (gamma-and delta-tocotrienol). The main common wellspring of tocotrienols that fits this essential is annatto, which is basically tocopherol free and contains just the most intense delta-and gamma-tocotrienols (90% and 10%, separately). Today, more research is affirming that alpha-tocopherol meddles with tocotrienol benefits, both straightforwardly and by implication.\n\n## Why Annatto Tocotrienols?\n\nEvery day it is ending up progressively comprehended that tocotrienols (particularly delta-tocotrienols) are the correct type of nutrient E. Well more than 100 investigations and clinical preliminaries have demonstrated the astonishing advantages of tocotrienols – with no known reactions. These investigations demonstrate that tocotrienols, joined with a sound way of life, do unbelievable things including bringing down lipids, diminishing aggravation, securing the liver, advancing bone wellbeing, murdering disease cells and notwithstanding expanding survival rates in malignant growth patients.\n\n## Advantage\n\nAs a major aspect of the nutrient E family, tocotrienol is a great cancer prevention agent. Lipid oxygen radical absorbance limit (L-ORAC) thinks about point to delta-tocotrienol as the most powerful cancer prevention agent of the nutrient E arrangement, trailed by gamma-tocotrienol and delta-and gamma-tocopherols. Beside cancer prevention agent benefits, inquire about since the mid 80s has over and again shown that delta-and gamma-tocotrienol help in the upkeep of cholesterol levels that are now inside the typical range.\n\nAs various new investigations are distributed, tocotrienol arrives at another proportion of research tallness, pointing towards promising advantages for in general ideal wellbeing and maturing.\n\n## Nutrient E History\n\nHerbert McLean Evans and Katherine Bishop found nutrient E in 1922 as a fundamental supplement to counteract birth abandons. Notwithstanding, it was not until the late 1950s that established researchers ended up mindful that the nutrient E family comprises of two noteworthy subgroups, in particular tocopherols and tocotrienols. In 1936, nutrient E was first detached from wheat germ oil. While commercialization of regular soy-determined tocopherols started during the 1950s, tocotrienols were as of late brought to the market, beginning with items got from palm in 1992, rice in 1999, lastly annatto in 2003.\n\nMany therapeutic news out of Europe. Unexpectedly, in government-supported disease inquire about; human patients taking a particular dietary enhancement lived longer than the individuals who did not. The examination demonstrated a one of a kind type of nutrient E, called tocotrienols, when utilized with the standard consideration for repetitive ovarian disease patients, multiplied their future. Extra research is additionally demonstrating guarantee for bosom, colon and lung disease patients. Furthermore, specialists are additionally observing proof that tocotrienols may bring down awful cholesterol and improve heart wellbeing.\n\nIt’s made many individuals look to nutrient E as an absolute necessity have supplement in their day by day routine, and that has some wellbeing specialists concerned. Tocotrienols is a remarkable type of nutrient E and isn’t likely found in your normal multi-nutrient or supplement. You need to comprehend what to search for.\n\n**Dr. Barrie Tan**, creator of **The Truth** **about Vitamin E**, is broadly viewed as the world’s driving expert on tocotrienols and nutrient E. His is discussing the theme with an end goal to instruct the general population on the examination’s discoveries and how to appropriately exploit the enhancement’s medical advantages\n\n## Dr Tan is accessible to talk about:\n\n* The consequences of the investigation on tocotrienols\n* The significance of the investigation’s discoveries for disease research and patient survival\n* The advantages of nutrient E and tocotrienols\n* How to appropriately get the advantages of tocotrienols\n\nIf you want to buy the book of[ ](https://barrietan.com/book/)[**Dr. Barrie Tan on “The Truth about Vitamin E**](https://barrietan.com/book/)**”** then you can visit EAnnatto website as well.\n\nFor more informationTo Know More About Dr. Barrie Tan : [https://barrietan.com](https://barrietan.com/)",

    "body": "To start this off, my girlfriend has had really bad migraine issues for the past couple years. Not only that, but just not feeling well overall. Always sluggish and just feeling like complete crap, usually every single day. She was told she has Epstein Barr Virus She has taken antibiotics and all different types of prescriptions, and nothing seems to fix it. Just gives temporary relief. \n\nWell she was talking to her friend about it, and was recommended to a chiropractor. So we go. \n\nThis chiropractor is not very well known, and the reason for this is because he only works on referrals. Seems like a legit guy. He's rather young (28ish), but has all his degrees on the wall just like any ordinary doctors office.\n\nHe takes us back to the back room, and explains to us this technique that he uses. It is called \"Body Energetics Technique\", and it ends up sounding like some really off the wall crap. He says its a way of communicating with the body using frequencies from movement. Im thinking WTF? \n\nSo he starts his \"exam\" that he does for first timers. This is a full body exam he does to find out what issues you have with your body. He literally touches her stomach with one hand, then his other hand is behind his back doing all types of weird movements (kind of looks like hes cracking his knuckles, or trying to), and then some how he can tell if she is stressed, or has a vitamin deficiency. He does that, then gives her a massager to massage whatever point on her body he worked on.\n\nSo he gets done the exam, and finds like 10-15 issues she supposedly has. He says he can treat 2 per visit, and suggests she comes for 8 weeks. Let me point on too, he seemed very honest. He said to try it for a few weeks, if you don't feel better, save your money and stop coming.\n\nHe says he can start on 2 right then and there. So she does it. He starts the first 2 things, which only take about a minute each, and then gives her a massager in each hand to massage the 2 points he worked on. He tells her then that she has a vitamin C and D deficiency. He also tell her that she needs wheat germ oil and alkaline drops because her body is too acidic. \n\nSo the bill ends up being about $270 just for the first visit ($125 first timer exam, $45 for each issue he fixed, and then $55 for supplements). Im thinking ok, that's pricey, but that should be all the supplements she needs. \n\nSo a week later we go back for the next visit and he works on the next 2 issues he found. He does his weird hand stuff, and tells her she has more deficiencies. Sells her more supplements.\n\nWe are on the 8th week now, which is the last one, and as of now she is on about 10 different supplements.\n\nNow I will admit, she is saying that she is feeling better, much better actually, but I am still skeptical. I don't feel like his technique is actually what fixed her migraine issues, just because I can't see how you can touch someones stomach and be able to tell if they have a vitamin deficiency. I really think all the guy did was sell her a bunch of vitamins, and got lucky on one fixing her problems. Which in my opinion is pretty easy to do. You sell someone 10 different things, one of them is bound to work for sure.\n\nSo my question is, has anyone else ever heard of or trying anything at all like this, and am I right for being skeptical about it? \n\nEdit: He also has her do this \"ion cleanse\" thing where she puts her feet in and the water color changes depending on what toxins are being pulled from your body. Usually its liver toxins, and I always joke with her and tell her \"See, you drink too much!\" I was told this was all a scam, and of course the girlfriend told him that I thought it was a scam. He comes back saying \"yes a lot of them are. If you go online you will see some going for $100 or $200, and they don't work. The water will change color weather you have your feet in or not. Ours are three THOUSAND dollars\" and that's all he said. I guess the high price tag is supposed to mean its legit?\n",

Chiropractic field has an advantage in that you can use more alternative methods that help when the traditional (medicine) route has failed, but the downside is you get a lot of therapies and interventions that are hard to research and study with scientific method.\n\nMy personal thought is that if she has migraines, one of the supplements could have caffeine in it such as a green tea supplement. Could also have anti-inflammatory precursors such as white willow bark (pretty much Aspirin). A lot of people have vitamin C and D deficiencies anways, and I personally would tell them to eat more food with vitamin C and get more sunlight.\n\nI don't think this guy is trying to pull the wool over you or anything, but he isn't who I would go to or send my family to. If it works, then great. If not, I would really search out someone else. Chiropractic care is great for migraines and other ailments, and chiropractors will generally give you the least-invasive option first... such as diet changes for digestive issues opposed to going on medications.\n\nOne thing I would ask though is maybe remove the link in your post. Some people get very anti-chiropractic, and I would hate for this person's clinic to be the target or some random \"internet justice\" simple because they were linked-to.

    "body": "Hi all,\n\nI have 3B (\"*Curly With Spirals. 3B hair is made up of well-defined, spiral curls that range from bouncy ringlets to tight corkscrews.*\") hair in a weird bob.. I chopped my mane 2 years ago & I am in the painful process of growing it back out. I have **always** used 'curly girl approved' drugstore products for my entire routine - like Shea Moisture, John Frida, Not Your Mother's etc. They all worked perfectly but I have been trying to r/ZeroWaste, so I switched those for natural products. My actual routine has been the same **FOR YEARS**: I co-wash (using prayer hands technique), and scrunch-dry with an old t-shirt outside of the shower, scrunch-dry my gel into semi-dry hair.\n\nSo, I switched over to haircare bars from my local shop! I used this shampoo & conditioner.. the makeshift pair were amazingly for three months. I was hesitant to use them because they contained sodium ***coco*** sulfate.. I know that SLS is the devil of curly hair, but I thought I'd be safe with this natural sulfate.\n\nRecently, they have been leaving my hair feeling dry and feeling like straw... my hair has absolutely no life. I am afraid this change is because of the natural sulfate in the bars, despite the conditioner being 'specifically for curly hair'. I don't know what to do next... does anyone know any organic/natural hair products to use? Should I just go back to drugstore stuff?\n\n[Shampoo ingredients:](https://www.gabeandangel.com/product-page/the-hydrator-shampoo-conditioner-1) sodium coco sulfate, coconut oil, cocoa butter, matcha green tea, french green clay, shea oil, hemp seed oil, apricot seed oil, isosteareth, dimethicone copolyol, ichthammol, stinging nettle extract, and d-panthenol (essential oils of: peppermint, eucalyptus, rosemary, cerdar wood, and bergamot) \n\n[Conditioner bar:](https://www.gabeandangel.com/product-page/the-hydrator-shampoo-conditioner) behentrimonium methosulfate (from rapeseed oil), cetearyl (natural emulsifier and conditioner), cocoa butter, shea butter, olive oil, cetyl, coconut oil, glycerin, jojoba oil, wheat germ oil, sweet almond oil, d-panthenol, organic aloe vera, cyclomethicone, and vitamin E (essential oils of: coriander seed, juniper berry, sweet orange, palmarosa, geranium, cardamom, and patchouli)",

In addition, since you aren't doing great, this may br a problwm for you. But Dimethicone copolyol is water soluable, so the shampoo bar is ok!\n\nNow, since you have been using a sulfate, it probably hasn't built up too badly. But I think you are proving the case in favor of the CG method.\n\nThere are many organic/natural products to use, but you still have to be a little careful. Giovanni is a trused natural haircare producer, and many of their products are CG friendly, but many aren't. Take a look at their website. They have many new lines to try. Plug the ingredients into www.isitcg.com to double check if it is ok. If you see something you like, but are still unsure, post here to see get opinions, if any. There are others.\n\nYou said you want to be zero waste. But perhaps for now a compromise would be to recycle through Terracycle.",

Hope this helps the oily skin sufferers out there! \n\n  \nManaging oily skin isn't as simple as picking products labelled \"oil-free\" - you'll also want to know an ingredient's comedogenicity index - (a scale from 0 to 5) that indicates how likely they are to clog pores. A score of 2 or less means the ingredient should be suitable for oily skin and will helps prevent breakouts and enlarged pores. I's also best to avoid alcohol-based products that strip your skin and can trigger more oil production.\n\nMy top 3 ingredients to look out for, for controlling oily skin are:\n\n1. Niacinamide (Vitamin B3): Studies have shown that a 2% niacinamide moisturizer significantly decreased sebum production over 4 weeks of usage. Niacinamide can also help reduce the severity of acne and facial redness.\n\n2. Salicylic acid - dissolves oil and other contaminants and it also has anti-inflammatory properties.\n\n  \n3. Green tea extract - Using a 3% green tea extract can cut sebum production by over half  (60%) when used over 8 weeks - so worth sticking with it even if it doesn't make an instant difference!\n\n\n\nOther anti-inflammatory ingredients to balance oil skin:\n\n\\- Aloe vera: Contains amino acids and minerals that reduce inflammation\n\n\\- Witch hazel: Contains tannins that help manage oil production\n\n\\- Chamomile: Soothes irritated skin\n\n\n\nPoor clogging (comedogenic) ingredients to avoid: \n\nCoconut oil, coconut butter, Wheat germ oil, Cocoa butter, Isopropyl myristate, Lanolin\n\n\n\nHope that helps!\n\n\n\n   \n",

On some sites and studies they don’t even mention the PC/PE ratio and say that supplementing with one or the other lead to positive outcomes. However, I read a study that says that an abnormally high or low cellular PC/PE ratio influences energy metabolism and is linked to disease progression. So I assume that supplementing either orally or via a phospholipid injection could disrupt this ratio and cause issues? \nSorry if this is confusing to read, I’m just confused. I’m reading about this and trying to learn about biochemistry due to my belief that I’m likely suffering from mitochondrial dysfunction as a result of long Covid, so I’m working with a broken brain. I know that phospholipids (primarily PC and PE) make up most of the mitochondria cell membranes and that their permeability affects their ability to synthesize ATP via having a gradient. According to most of what I’ve read from functional med drs they say just to supplement with wheat germ oil and/or PC to restore the membrane barrier, but it doesn’t seem like it’s as simple as that based on what I’ve read. None of the videos I watched or articles I read from those talking about lipid replacement even mentioned the PC/PE ratio. Does anyone have any insights on this? It would really be appreciated!!!

        "body": "When you take phospholipids orally, typically phospholipases cleave a fatty acid from the glycerol backbone creating a free fatty acid and a lysophospholipid  that are mostly absorbed in the small intestine. I feel like injections would be weird because phospholipids are ampiphatic which may do strange things in the blood or cause different signaling pathways to cascade if free fatty acids get loose in your blood because these are toxic to cells.  Free fatty acids are basically like soaps and will solubility membrane. Usually fatty acids are bound as lipids forming membranes which sequesters them from freely roaming our circulatory system or interstitial fluids.  If you inject phospholipids into the circulatory system then that may produce a stress response because typically phospholipids only come out of membranes when damage occurs.  Some small amounts of stress can produce positive performance benefits but  this desired effects requires serious consideration to develop a protocol that elicits this response. \n\nWhat situations call for injections? I work with plant lipids and have a pretty good grip on the biochemistry involved. Basically lipids are broke down  and reassembled as needed so dietary variables make a large impact on lipid digestion. Food that has high oleic acid content and fish oils with EPA and DHA are often claimed to be beneficial to brain and heart health. Most likely a multivitamin that provides choline and phosphate can give your body what it needs to meet your body’s demands.  However humans do not produce EPA and DHA and some studies have supported the claim that these fatty acids are positive for brain and heart health so this is why fish oils are popular.  This is all my own opinion in casual conversation not medical advice.",

Mitochondrial membranes are not unique in containing PC/PE - every membrane in the human body contains them in different ratios. \n\nWhat is more important for bioenergetic membranes like the mitochondrial inner membrane are charged lipids (in human cells these include PS and PI) for maintaining a local proton gradient. Permeability has very little to do with it as the key players in energy production are not able to cross the membrane and are shuttled across via transporters, charge carriers and ATP synthase. \n\nAs a final anecdote I will note that in my experience studying protein-lipid interactions that neutral lipids like PC/PE tend to be the least interesting. They don't participate in a lot of regulation events or binding and I suspect that they are simply there to dilute the rate of other lipid binding events (cholesterol, PI, etc).",

A ratio that is too low means you don't have enough pc or too much pe. And these disruptive ratios can be due to disease.\n\nSo on the one hand they're just talking about higher values of either compounds, but the ratio itself doesn't change. On the other hand the ratio itself is not good, which can point to a metabolic problem.\n\nOf course I am not a medical doctor, and even healthy cells can be disrupted by an abnormally high concentration of whatever due to \"artificial\" intake.",

I apply approx. 1ml/day - keeping it on scalp for at least 2h. I use it because I react with cardiovascular sides to 2% and 5% minoxidil. I would *not* expect this natural serum to outperform 5% minoxidil.     \n\n**Effect**  \n\nThis serum is just one component of my regimen. I can say that I haven't noticed any shedding at all with my current regimen, which doesn't include RU/Fin/Dut/Min, while I have noticed significant shedding prior to it and some shedding when I was just using Keto. I have also noticed \"fuzzy regrowth\" and vellus hairs, but I think those came after adding microneedling.  \n\n**Content**  \n\nThe ingredients are listed in the following format (without brackets and line breaks):  \n\n[Volume-based percentage+|vol| of the total serum bottle]  \n[Ingredient name]  \n[(Mechanism of action (+increase,-decrease), estimated hair count increase per cm^2 after 24 weeks with treatment alone from reference]   \n\nI apply *Apple Poly Procyanidin B-2*  \n(Protein kinase C-/TGF-beta-, [+28](https://media.turkports.com/wwweeose/Pdfler/procyanidinno_b.pdf)), then immediately apply 1ml of    \n\n**3%\t0.9ml\tRosemary oil    (Local blood flow+, [+7](https://issuu.com/pulsemarketing/docs/skinmed_v13_i1))  \n3%\t0.9ml\tPeppermint Oil    (TODO)  \n25% 7.5ml\tLiquid Saw Palmetto Extract  (DHT-,[+34](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajd.12352)\\*\\*)  \n7% \t2.1ml\tCurcuma aeruginosa   \\*\\*\\* (DHT-, [+31](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546634.2011.568470))  \n29% 8.7ml\tPumpkin seed oil   (DHT-, n/a\\*\\*\\*\\*)    \n10%\t3ml\tCastor oil   (PGE2+, n/a)   \n23%\t6.9ml\tethanolic safflower flower extract (TODO, many growth factors)** \n\nthen I apply Purador serum after 30 min have passed. It's cheap, doesn't have a lot of artificial stuff inside, has a lot of ingredients \"to fill in the gaps\" like caffeine, and it may also have some penetration enhancers.  \n\n**Sequence of Serums**  \n\nWhy do I apply the serums in this sequence? Apple-Poly directs the user to apply oil-based products after applying Procyanidin B-2. Furthermore, Apple Poly Procyanidin B-2 contains penetration enhancers that help the natural oils. Lastly, I do not want the penetration enhancers of Apple Poly Procyanidin B-2 to interfere with those of the Purador serum, so I wait 30min before applying the Purador.  \n\nConstructive feedback is welcome - e.g., legitimate limitations of studies, transfollicular penetration issues, potential side effects, further ingredients supported by double-blind studies of AGA subjects etc. Please no comments like \"only the big 4 work,\" \"natural stuff doesn't work.\" A minority of people experience sides on effective, first-line treatments like finasteride and minoxidil. At the other end, not everything that's natural works:  \n\n> [Bogus Treatments: In 1980 an advisory panel to the US Food and Drug Administration evaluated a number of substances used in hair lotions and creams—including amino acids, aminobenzoic acid, ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, B vitamins, hormones, jojoba oil, lanolin, polysorbates 20 and 660, sulphanilamide, tetracaine hydrochloride, urea, and wheat germ oil—and subsequently proposed that these products be removed from the market. Other ineffective remedies include scalp massage, dietary modification, frequent shampooing, electrical stimulation, and Chinese herbal extracts.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1113949/#B27).  \n\nThen there's a ton of mice studies that might not generalize to humans. The studies above have been with human patients, however.    \n\nMost of these ingredients can be found pretty easily on Amazon (or Google).  \n\n\\*\\*  The study treatment also contained green tea extract, Peony root extract, Piroctone-olamine, Oligopeptides  \n\\*\\*\\* I couldn't find the liquid form of this particular plant, so I'm using plain liquid tumeric, which I believe is very similar.  \n\\*\\*\\*\\* Oral pumpkin seed oil 400mg/d plus other ingredients (Octa-Sabal Plus) demonstrated an estimated hair count increase of +85 after 24 weeks. I say *estimated* because they only have the relative increase of 40% and I found out the average hair count in 1 cm^2 from one of the other studies.",

Breakdown and Excretion:** Enzymes break down Vitamin E, and the body eliminates the waste products through urine or feces.\n\n# What are the sources Of Vitamin E? \n\n* **Non-Vegan:** Fish, liver, Butter.\n* **Vegan**: Nuts (almonds, hazelnuts), sunflower seeds, [annatto](https://wellnessextract.com/blogs/wellness/the-truth-about-vitamin-e-by-dr-barrie?_pos=6&_sid=cbcdd031d&_ss=r), spinach, wheat germ oil, avocado.\n\n# Vitamin E -related deficiencies\n\n* **Red Blood Cells' Fragility:** Cells become fragile and break easily.\n* **Nerves Damage:**  Damage to nerves, especially those in the outer parts of the body, leading to weakness and coordination problems.\n\nOther than these, deficiency can also lead to other issues, for instance:\n\n* **In Adults:** Weak muscles, Trouble with reflexes and coordination, Difficulty walking\n* **In Preterm Infants**: It can lead to a serious type of anemia\n\n# Daily recommended dosage of Vitamin E:\n\n* **Men**: 4 mg per day.\n* **Women**: 3 mg per day.\n\n# Overdose Risks\n\nVitamin E overdose is rare but can lead to problems like bleeding, muscle weakness, tiredness, nausea, and diarrhea. \n\n* The main risk is excessive bleeding.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mtbonwkzdzxe1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=f55499fdca9eceb29a552a239dc60b56872d3142",

It contains wheat germ oil, which after some googling turns out is a high natural source of vitamin e.  I had just bought some vitamin e oil to mix a few drops with their every other day fish oil we currently use since Ive heard you need to do with fish oil due to how brands with no vitamin e added can deplete vitamin e over time.  But now seeing this brand I'm not so sure I need to add additional vitamin e drops with the days they get fish oil, if I start using this one.  Should I still add a drop or so of vitamin e anyway with this brand?",

If SP somehow actually works for you then you're utterly blessed at needing so little intervention (not beyond all possibility). Most will not be so lucky. Fin is the FDA approved drug with a great track record and is very cheap and is made to a certain known standard. Most supplements are not controlled so well as prescription medicines though.

It fertilized but degenerated by day 3.\n\nI have endometriosis, and have had surgery 2x on my right ovary to remove large cysts. Between the endo and the surgeries I believe I'm firmly in the DOR camp.\n\nThis is the stimulation protocol I was using:\n\n* Days 3-7 : Gonal F 225 IU, Menopur 75 IU\n* Days 8-11: Gonal F 225 IU, Menopur 75 IU, Cetrotide .25 mg\n* Day 12: Cetrotide .25 mg, Lupron trigger p.m.\n* Day 13: Lupron trigger a.m.\n* Day 14 retrieval \n\nI should also add that I'm on a ton of supplements: CoQ10, prenatal, vitamin d, wheat germ oil, fish oil, DHEA, iron.\n\nTomorrow I have a meeting with a provider to discuss plans for a second cycle. Is anyone with DOR willing to share a stimulation protocol that has been relatively successful for them? I'm also going to cross-post this to the InfertilityBabies sub, but I wanted to ask here because we're all still in the trenches.\n\nMy sincerest thanks to anyone who can help! I've tried researching and have honestly been overwhelmed - there doesn't seem to be any consensus or any best practices regarding DOR patients. Between this and the general dumpster fire that is my life (serious elder care issues and a high stress job during a high stress time of year), I'm running out of energy for research. I've checked the FAQs, but I wasn't seeing a ton of replies from people with DOR.\n\nETA: for 5 of my IUI cycles I was on a medium dose of Femara - 5 mg, I think? Each of those cycles I produced 2-4 follicles. That's part of the reason that this IVF cycle was such an incredible disappointment.",

I was lucky and both developed into embryos. I was also taking DHEA (3 x 25mg), prenatal, CoQ10 (3 x 200mg), Vit D (5000 units) and omega 3. \n\nNext protocol we are doing estrogen priming and decreasing my initial dose of menopur to 75, keeping gonal F at 100 and adding Omnitrope (a growth stimulating hormone). \n\nMy RE told me to stop taking DHEA as too much can have the reverse effect. So I stopped and will follow her guidelines for my next retrieval. \n\nSorry you had a poor response. I was devastated with my response as well but seems that first round is a trial and error and while many people are successful, it can take others some time to find the right protocol that will work for their specific body chemistry.

The cold gradually goes away, but the warm weather comes to us not only with the sun, but also with various diseases, in particular, flu and colds. Now the human body is more vulnerable than ever, so it is very important to take care of it with proper nutrition. This way you will kill two birds with one stone-improve the immune system and cleanse the body of toxins.\n\nProper nutrition is important for the immune system. Nutrition should be as rational as possible in terms of quantity and quality. A diet high in empty calories not only leads to weight gain, but also makes the body more susceptible to infections. To boost the immune system, it is recommended to eat foods that are rich in vitamins and antioxidants. Foods can be useful for strengthening the immune system, as well as preventing colds and flu. Especially useful are green, orange and red fruits and vegetables that contain vitamins A and C: spinach, all types of cabbage, green onions, legumes, citrus fruits, carrots, pumpkin, sweet peppers, apples, sea buckthorn, rose hips, cranberries, cranberries, sea buckthorn, apples and persimmons. Eat more citrus fruits and apples (they contain vitamin C and iron).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gofm9gt0h9851.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d27cbfb662918b0e37ce2d02974ce65b3e6d6b16\n\n \n\nYour menu should contain proteins of animal and vegetable origin. Animal proteins are found in meat, fish, eggs, and milk. Vegetable proteins — in peas, beans, buckwheat and oat groats. Also, do not forget about legumes. This food is high in protein, which helps the body to resist various colds. Beef liver and seafood( shrimp, mussels, squid) have a Beneficial effect on the immune system.\n\nVitamins A can be obtained from carrots, grapes, and greens. It is found in all red and orange fruits and vegetables. Vitamin C is found in citrus fruits, rose hips, cranberries, cranberries, cabbage, especially sauerkraut. Vitamin E is found in sunflower, olive, or corn oils. There are many b vitamins in legumes, cereals, eggs, any greens and nuts.\n\nOf the microelements, zinc and selenium have a positive effect on the immune system. Zinc is found in fish, meat, liver, nuts, beans and peas. Here are some of the main food sources of zinc: oysters, baked beans, cashews, and cereals.(there is a lot of it in raw grain, brewer’s yeast) Selenium should be “extracted” from fish, seafood, and garlic. They are rich in grain bread, beef, veal, turkey. Minerals-iron, copper, magnesium, and zinc-are found in the liver, kidneys, heart, nuts, legumes, and chocolate.\n\nOther immunostimulating foods include fresh garlic, onions, horseradish, black radish, and turnips. These vegetables contain essential oils and biologically active substances that inhibit the growth and development of bacteria. They have an antiviral effect on the body and help us not get sick, so be sure to include them in your diet in the autumn and winter, when the risk of catching a cold or flu is highest.\n\nFoods containing probiotics are also useful for the immune system. They help the intestines work properly and help the body produce antibodies to viruses, thus protecting it from diseases. These include fermented milk products, sauerkraut, sourdough bread, and tofu cheese.\n\nCarotenes, from which vitamin A is synthesized, and vitamin E are the best protection of thymus (thymus gland) cells. The higher their concentration, the more successfully this body is able to fight microorganisms. The spleen also produces protective bodies and should be protected from harmful substances by antioxidants such as vitamins A and E. Provitamin A is found in carrots, spinach, rose hips, and vegetable oils are rich in vitamin E.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vs0ff6a8h9851.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0dfac851a77ed58a16ee2c406254c4205b5cac0\n\n \n\nRegular consumption of tomato juice increases the concentration of carotenes in all cells of the body. As for vitamin E, its deficiency in the body is easy to overcome if you take a tablespoon of vegetable oil daily-in pure form or salads.\n\nBlueberries contain a flavonoid called anthocyanin, which has antioxidant properties that can help strengthen a person’s immune system. Researchers found that people who ate foods rich in flavonoids were less likely to get an upper respiratory tract infection or a cold.\n\nTurmeric is a yellow spice that many people use in cooking. This is also present in some alternative medications. Consumption of turmeric can improve a person’s immune response. Curcumin has an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect.\n\nSalmon, tuna, sardines, and other fatty fish are rich sources of omega-3 fatty acids. long-term consumption of omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\nSweet potatoes are rich in beta-carotene, an antioxidant that gives the potato skin an orange color.\n\nSpinach can strengthen the immune system, as it contains many essential nutrients and antioxidants, including: flavonoids, carotenoids, vitamin C, and vitamin E.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/88wd5t9dh9851.jpg?width=1880&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ccb8c9816914a16280669854eafb453e51a257ac\n\n \n\nResearch also shows that flavonoids can help prevent colds in healthy people. Green tea contains a small amount of caffeine, so people can enjoy it as an alternative to black tea or coffee. By the way, green tea can not only be an excellent substitute for coffee, but also a real medicine! After all, green tea contains substances that strengthen the immune system, actively resists bacteria and viruses that cause flu and colds. Healthy people need 1–2 cups of tea a day. In case of illness, increase the dose and drink 3–4 cups daily. No less useful is tea made from rose hips. Drinking can also strengthen the immune system.\n\nAs with blueberries, green tea contains flavonoids that can reduce the risk of a cold. Kefir is a fermented beverage containing live cultures of bacteria that are beneficial to health. Initial research shows that drinking kefir can strengthen the immune system.\n\nSeeds can be a delicious addition to salads or Breakfast bowls. They are a rich source of vitamin E, an antioxidant.

A trace of arachidic acid has also been found. \n\n\n• Phenolic compounds : flavonols (isorhamnetin, kaempferol, quercetin, catechin and epicatechin), flavanones (naringenin), anthocyanins (cyanidins \n\nand delohinidin), procyanidins, and phenolic acids (caffeic acid, ferulic acid, P-coumaric acid and Vanillic acid)\n\n\nInformation about vitamin and minerals which are in large amount\n\n\n1) Fibres:  improve your bowel movement and digestion\n\n\n\n2) Proteins:  repair your muscles and tissues. \n\n\n\n3) Vitamin E: protects body from free radicals act as a antioxidant\n\n\n                 - It also enhances immune function and prevents clots from forming in heart arteries. \n\nThese antioxidants tend to build up in cell membranes in your body, protecting your cells from oxidative damage.\n\n\n               - Vitamin E rich substance: Wheat germ oil, Sunflower, safflower, and soybean oil, Sunflower seeds,Peanuts, peanut butter, Beet greens, collard greens, spinach, Pumpkin, Red bell pepper,Asparagus, Mango, Avocado.\n\n\n\n4) Manganese: magnesium in almonds  help to decrease blood pressure.

It fertilized but degenerated by day 3.\n\nI have endometriosis, and have had surgery 2x on my right ovary to remove large cysts. Between the endo and the surgeries I believe I'm firmly in the DOR camp.\n\nThis is the stimulation protocol I was using:\n\n    Days 3-7 : Gonal F 225 IU, Menopur 75 IU\n    Days 8-11: Gonal F 225 IU, Menopur 75 IU, Cetrotide .25 mg\n    Day 12: Cetrotide .25 mg, Lupron trigger p.m.\n    Day 13: Lupron trigger a.m.\n    Day 14 retrieval\n\nI'm also I'm on a ton of supplements: CoQ10, prenatal, vitamin d, wheat germ oil, fish oil, DHEA (recent addition), and iron.\n\nFor 5 of my IUI cycles I was on a medium dose of Femara - 5 mg, I think? Each of those cycles I produced 2-4 follicles. That's part of the reason that this IVF cycle was such an incredible disappointment.\n\nTomorrow I have a meeting with a provider to discuss plans for a second cycle. Is anyone with DOR willing to share a stimulation protocol that was successful for them? I've also cross-posted this to the Infertility sub. \n\nMy sincerest thanks to anyone who can help! I've tried researching and have honestly been overwhelmed - there doesn't seem to be any consensus or any best practices regarding DOR patients. Between this and the general dumpster fire that is my life (serious elder care issues and a high stress job during a high stress time of year), I'm running out of energy for research. And it would be reassuring to hear success stories!",

    "body": "Hi all! My dog is a 12 yo chihuahua who’s a little overweight (3.9 kgs - ideal weight 3.4 kg), he’s been eating home cooked food since february with no success. He’s never had any GI issues until we switched from kibble to homemade. His liver enzymes dropped since we changed the diet (were a little high), however an echo showed his bowel is inflamed. Twice or three times per month he’ll have diarrhea and won’t eat anything for a least half the day, then he’ll go back to normal and eat his food again. The inflammation markers (NLR and PLR) increased a lot and my guess is it’s because of the food. He can’t have chicken or eggs. His diet til now was 80/90 grams of beef meat (cooked), 10 grams of beef heart, 5 grams of beef liver plus veggies, a calcium supplement and krill oil supplement.\n\nHe also has mitral valve disease which has worsened over the last months.\n\nI’ve tried three different nutritionists but didn’t get good results with any so i decided to use the app “animal diet formulator” to formulate his diet:  \n\nRecipe:\n35 grams - Chuck beef, gently cooked\n8 grams - Beef heart, gently cooked\n6 grams - Silverside fish, gently cooked\n5 grams - Beef liver, gently cooked\n15 ml - Bone broth\n10 grams - Sweet potato, boiled\n9 grams - Butternut squash, boiled \n6 grams - Kale\n6 grams - Blueberries\n1.6 grams - Sunflower seeds \n0.88 grams - Wheat germ oil\n0.58 grams - Kelp, dried \n1 gram - Better bones calcium supplement \n\n+ krill oil supplement (150 mg EPA and 90 mg DHA)\n\nAccording to the app, it’s a well balanced diet but I’d like to have an opinion! \n\nThank you🙏🏻",

I can't afford his products but I am learning from them. Do y'all think this is a quality Vitamin E option or do you have a personal favorite you can recommend?\n\nVitacost Vitamin E & Tocotrienol Complex - 60 Liquid Vegetarian Capsules\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3yy2vkgwggbe1.jpg?width=382&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3966ea75d76c977d475cbb2cf5afcc0f3bc115a\n\n  \n\n\n\\--\n\nWhat ChatGPT has to say about Vitamin E supplementation (if you're curious) -\n\nChoosing a **Vitamin E** supplement involves understanding the forms of Vitamin E, their sources, and how they fit into your overall vitamin regimen. Here's what you need to know:\n\n# 1. Forms of Vitamin E\n\nVitamin E is a group of fat-soluble compounds, and the main forms include **tocopherols** and **tocotrienols**:\n\n# Tocopherols:\n\n* **Alpha-Tocopherol**:\n   * The most biologically active form and commonly found in supplements.\n   * Often the only form listed on most multivitamins or Vitamin E products.\n* **Gamma-Tocopherol**:\n   * Important for anti-inflammatory properties and scavenging nitrogen radicals.\n   * Ideally included alongside alpha-tocopherol in high-quality supplements.\n\n# Tocotrienols:\n\n* Less commonly found in traditional supplements but offer additional benefits, particularly for cardiovascular and skin health.\n* Found in palm oil, rice bran, and annatto seed extracts.\n* More potent antioxidant properties compared to tocopherols.\n\n# 2. Synthetic vs. Natural\n\n* **Natural Vitamin E (d-alpha-tocopherol)**:\n   * Derived from natural sources like vegetable oils.\n   * Better absorbed and retained by the body compared to synthetic forms.\n   * Look for \"d-alpha-tocopherol\" on the label.\n* **Synthetic Vitamin E (dl-alpha-tocopherol)**:\n   * Less effective and may not provide the same health benefits.\n   * Avoid \"dl-alpha-tocopherol,\" which indicates synthetic Vitamin E.\n\n# 3. Ideal Supplement\n\n* Look for a **mixed tocopherol** formula containing:\n   * Alpha-tocopherol\n   * Gamma-tocopherol\n   * Beta-tocopherol\n   * Delta-tocopherol\n* Optional: Consider including **tocotrienols** for broader antioxidant support.\n\n# 4. Dosage\n\n* The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for adults is **15 mg (22.5 IU)** per day.\n* Safe upper limit: Up to **1,000 mg (1,500 IU)** per day for short-term use.\n* Stick to doses around **100–400 IU/day** unless specifically advised by a healthcare provider.\n\n# 5. Food Sources\n\nTo complement your supplement, incorporate foods rich in Vitamin E:\n\n* Nuts (e.g., almonds, hazelnuts)\n* Seeds (e.g., sunflower seeds)\n* Avocados\n* Spinach and other leafy greens\n* Oils (e.g., sunflower, safflower, and wheat germ oil)\n\n# 6. Compatibility with Other Fat-Soluble Vitamins (A, D, K)\n\n* Vitamin E works synergistically with **Vitamins A, D, and K** to support antioxidant defense, bone health, and immune function.\n* Take Vitamin E with meals containing fat to enhance absorption.\n* Ensure balanced supplementation, as excessive Vitamin E can interfere with Vitamin K's role in blood clotting.\n\n# Caution\n\n* High doses of Vitamin E may increase bleeding risk, especially if you’re on blood thinners.\n* Monitor for potential interactions with other supplements or medications.",

The ingredients list is: \n\nRicinus Communis Seed Oil (castor oil/non-fragrant oil/emollient), Petrolatum (emollient), Euphorbia Cerifera Wax (candelilla wax/emollient/texture-enhancing), Lanolin (emollient), C10-30 Cholesterol/Lanosterol Esters (emollient/skin replenishing), Cera Alba, (beeswax/texture-enhancing), Ozokerite (texture-enhancing), Ethylhexyl Palmitate (emollient), Copernicia Cerifera Wax (carnauba wax/emollient/texture-enhancing), Butyrospermum Parkii Butter (shea butter/emollient/antioxidant), Jojoba Esters (emollient), Triticum Vulgare Germ Oil (wheat germ oil/non-fragrant oil/emollient), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate (vitamin C/antioxidant), Tocopheryl Acetate (vitamin E/antioxidant), Trihydroxystearin (emollient), Hydrogenated Polyisobutene (emollient/texture-enhancing)\n\nI have tried to look for products that have similar ingredients, and they usually are too \"slippery\" or \"greasy\" feeling. \n\nAny suggestions would be very greatly appreciated!",
