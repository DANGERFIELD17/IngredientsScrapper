    "body": "Part 2 based on u/winwinnwinnie’s comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/Hair/comments/t82slz/mending_split_ends_part_2_with_castor_oilsebacic/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nYou can temporarily mend split ends together with the ingredients polyquaternium-28 and PVM/MA copolymer. Most products that claim to mend split ends don’t have these two ingredients. Also, both ingredients are required for the mending to work and withstand other stresses like combing. \n\n#Here’s the study done on these two ingredients showing the semi permanent mending effects: \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/6111412_Semi-permanent_split_end_mending_with_a_polyelectrolyte_complex\n\n##Brief explanation:\n\nThe cationic, anti static ingredient **polyquaternium-28** is attracted to the anionic ingredient **PVM/MA copolymer**. The idea is that damage and split ends are anionic so the polyquaternium-28 is attracted to them and will bind them together until it is washed out. In the study, these two ingredients were shown to bind together split ends and also withstood the stress of combing.\n\n#Here are some products I FINALLY found that have these two ingredients:\n\n#[Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum 4 oz ($20)](https://www.frendsbeauty.com/kim-kimble-healed-ends-serum-4oz.html)\n\nIngredients: \n\nWater (Aqua), **Polyquaternium-28**, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Arctium Majus Root (Burdock) Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail Extract, Malva Sylvestris (Mallow) Flower Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Saccharum Officinaru (Sugarcane) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Lactic Acid, Ethylhexyglycerin, Betaine, Hexylene Glycol, **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Dimethicone PEG-8 Meadowfoamate, Hexapeptide-11, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nThis one has **polyquaternium-28** as the 2nd ingredient, then some oils, a bunch of extracts, then the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 17th ingredient. Phenoxyethanol as the preservative is fine here since it is being used on the ends, not on the scalp.\n\n#[Color Proof SuperRich Split Ends Mender 3.4 oz ($11)](https://www.beautyplussalon.com/color-proof-superrich-split-ends-mender)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Glycerin, **Polyquaternium-28**, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Fragrance (Parfum), **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Polysorbate 80, Caprylyl Glycol, Linalool, Citric Acid, Limonene, Sorbitan Oleate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Citronellol, Citral, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Quaternium-95, Propanediol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Hydrolyzed Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Lentinus Edodes Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Benzoate, BHT, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate.\n\nThis ingredients list is interesting, **polyquaternium-28** as the 3rd ingredient is awesome, but the 4th, 5th, and 6th ingredients are two preservatives and a fragrance. That’s fine, as xanthan gum is also a thickener. Then the 7th ingredient is the **PVM/MA copolymer**. Then there’s a bunch of emollients and extracts and another preservative that is annoying to see in products. \n\n##This one contains Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, a **formaldehyde releasing preservative**. This is fine, as the formaldehyde is how it preserves the product, but it is always good to be aware of these things, so you don’t let the bottle sit for a very long time, as this ingredient **releases formaldehyde slowly over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[White Sands The Cure 24/7 Serum 3.38 oz ($20)](https://sleekshop.com/products/white-sands-the-cure-24-7-serum.html?sku=whs09-3-38-oz)\n\nIngredients:\n\nDeionized Water, **Polyaualerium-28**, **PVMMA Copolymer**, Xanthan Gum, Caprylic/Capric Acid, Triglyceride, Cyrribidium Grandilorioum Flower, Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate, Fragrance.\n\nThis one has a much more simple ingredients list! **Polyquaternium-28** is the second ingredient and the **PVM/MA** copolymer is the third ingredient. Then there is xanthan gum to thicken and preserve. \n\n##However, again, at the end of this list we have **formaldehyde releasing preservatives**: **Diazolidinyl Urea and Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate.** Again, this is fine, but good to be aware of so you don’t let the bottle sit for a year, as these preservatives **slowly release formaldehyde over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[OGX Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream 6 oz ($9)](https://www.ulta.com/p/locking-coconut-curls-air-dry-cream-pimprod2005306)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater (Aqua), Tapioca Starch, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Polyquaternium-37, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Polyquaternium-28**, **PVM/VA Copolymer**, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Lecithin, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nHere we have tapioca starch to reduce any heavy oily feel. Then some emollients and oils. Then **polyquaternium-28** as the 7th ingredient and the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 8th ingredient. Then there’s some more emollients and then the preservative and a fragrance. Phenoxyethanol is a fine because this is for use on the end of the hair, not the scalp. \n\nSo there you have it. You can semi-permanently mend your split ends. It took a LONG time for me to find products that actually had the *combitnation* of BOTH of these ingredients. \n#So if anyone else finds more products that contain polyquaternium-28 and PVM/MA copolymer, please share here!\n\nAlso, for those that can’t tell, the links are imbedded in the title of the product. So, for example, you can click on the title Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum at the top of the post and it will take you to the website. The links are imbedded in every title",

Some retailers have the ingredients list with zinc oxide only, and then the official packaging and website say its a chemical sunscreen (both english and korean), and also, the official packaging also lists fragrance just above carbomer (from the naver posts that i saw), whereas the official korean website ingredients list has fragrance at the bottom of the ingredients list, maybe bc of different ingredients list laws in korea…. lol idk anymore its confusing.",

As such, this review is based on my experience with the product and may differ (for better or worse) with other experiences or your own experience.  I hope that this honest review of the product will help you to decide whether or not you think this product will work well for yourself.\n\n# Product Itself (Before Trying)\n\n**At a Glance (before opening)**:\n\n* Product size is 11.5 oz. / 326 g.\n* Product states that it is formulated with no parabens, phthalates, mineral oil, or petrolatum.\n* Product states that it is not tested on animals, is cruelty free, is ethically traded/sustainably sourced, comes from a certified corporation, is family founded, and is created with fair trade shea butter.\n   * [What does \"fair trade\" mean?](https://www.greenerchoices.org/fair-trade-certified/)\n* Product states that it is manufactured in the USA using globally-sourced ingredients.\n* Product jar itself is made from 35% recycled plastic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Description on Container**: \"Our Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Whipped Curl Cream provides definition with a soft, flexible hold.  Formulated with Manuka Honey, Yogurt, and Fair Trade Shea Butter, this lightweight curl cream also hydrates and helps strengthen hair to reduce breakage while styling.  Experience significantly less breakage when used as the fifth and last step in the Hydrate + Repair regimen.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Directions For Use on Container**: \"After generously spraying hair with the MANUKA HONEY & YOGURT HYDRATE + REPAIR MULTI-ACTION LEAVE-IN, apply to clean, damp hair and work through.  Style as desired and air dry or diffuse to finish your look.  This is the ultimate finish to the Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair regimen.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients as Listed on Container**: \"Water (Eau), Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin (Vegetable), VP/VA Copolymer, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Olivate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Carbomer, Honey (Miel), Yogurt Extract, Yogurt Powder, Adansonia Digitata (Baobab) Seed Oil, Trichilia Emetica (Mafura) Seed Butter, Inulin (Chicory Root), Sorbitan Olivate, Sodium Hydroxide, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Sodium Phylate, Triethyl Citrate, Caprylyl Glycol, Benzoic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance (Parfum)\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredient Breakdown (with the help of the \"Is it CG?\" Engine):**\n\n1. Product contains two humectants: Glycerin (Vegetable) and Honey (Miel).\n   1. *Humectants absorb moisture and help balance dry and damaged hair, but humectants also pull moisture from the environment too.  It is advised to use humectants with caution if you live in environments are hot and dry.*\n2. Product contains two oils:  Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil and  Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter.\n   1. *Oils are good at coating hair strands in order to seal moisture, but should be used with caution as they may build up over time (especially if you cowash).  It is advised to use a clarifying shampoo occasionally (about ever 2 weeks) to remove buildup that oils may cause.*\n3. Product contains a conditioning agent: Caprylyl Glycol.\n   1. *In this case, this conditioning agent is working as a film-forming ingredient over the hair.  Conditioning agents are water soluble but have potential to build up over time (can clean with clarifying shampoo, see note in oils for more info).*\n4. Product contains a moisturizing alcohol: Cetearyl Alcohol.\n   1. *Alcohols are generally added to hair products to improve their ability to penetrate hair.  This alcohol is considered a moisturizing alcohol, so it will not dry hair.*\n5. Product contains three botanical ingredients: Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Adansonia Digitata (Baobab) Seed Oil, and Trichilia Emetica (Mafura) Seed Butter.\n   1. *Botanical ingredients are ingredients that are derived from plants.  Botanical ingredients generally help with cleansing, stimulating, nourishing, refreshing, soothing, moisturizing, normalizing, and deodorizing.*\n6. Product contains two preservatives: Benzoic Acid and Phenoxyethanol.\n   1. *Preservatives prevent growth of bacteria and micro-organisms in your product.*\n7. Product has fragrance.\n   1. *Fragrance is generally okay to use on hair.  People with scalp sensitivities or allergies to fragrance should avoid fragrance in products.*\n8. Product *may* contain a protein, but this would be a light protein if so: Yogurt Extract and Yogurt Powder.\n   1. *I am honestly not sure if this is a protein, but when looking up online, some sources do say that yogurt contains protein.  If this is a protein, it is likely a very weak form of protein that would not impact your hair too much (honestly, it would still probably be less protein than the Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie, which contains silk protein).*\n\nHere is the full breakdown using the [\"is it CG?\"](http://www.isitcg.com/view/TZFBb9swDIX_CuHDYGMOeu8t8dJ1hyBGUqQY0AttszFRWTRoaYs27L-PyrKiN9N6j_z4-LvwxX1xHAlhJ7yEqAQ79PEN4VE8JfgE3-UcNcBL8ZgGxUDwGQ40Iys8jzzPNEAT1UGjhNNLUdQFW8dnEyqUW4xVDQ0FQk0O1q6XUVwNX13qSdlDeaIzBewcme7U3p3W0MgsLk2kNeydcW2jyoz2Ue4d_6AKHjRygD1bnwP37ONinmmKnhcoG1yCaAVHMrCr5n16thtWDZsYksoyk05xghb1jRnKHEKV34zcmFE7uUL8y6HcMTljvKWxvQTFPrzXrfwcsm09oF_EM8IXPnPAYNgblA67j0hPyv3IzlTbiQL3Jtrha1Sbf-X-D_HNR5dDakbuRRMcRIIxHEU76-0tn9tGRxnYVskXkgsPtmNLPiBpCqNysOifyIBXA6_CqrP13U2bxmyxED1O12xundoxuWttqBSsgIatQU6vwdluaX_yEfMxN-R_Cfew7nmwwSN5uSQzoc-vD4pnRd8TlJb0a5yq4s9f) engine.  I recommend using this engine even if you do not use the CG method because it lets you see what ingredients do what to your hair.  \n\n**Overall Impression Based on These Factors:**\n\nThis is my impression BEFORE trying the product.  Overall, this product sounds like a great replacement for those who are looking for a lightweight, protein-free (at least, from my analysis) curl cream.  I think this product would be a great alternative for those who liked the Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie but didn’t like the protein and weight that the Curl Smoothie had.  This product does have glycerin in it, which I know some hair types are sensitive to, so that could be a turn off for some people.  This product has a lot of moisturizing ingredients in it, so it will probably benefit those seeking moisture for their hair the most.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Information About the Hair this Product is Tested on (My Hair)\n\n**Curl type**: 3A \n\n**Porosity**: Medium-High \n\n**Width**: Fine \n\n**Length**: Somewhere between 12-24 inches \n\n**Density**: lower-normal \n\n**Damage**: I may have a little protein damage on my hair (may have overdid it with a rice wash), but other than that it is mostly healthy.  Last cut was a little over 3 weeks ago.  Last clarify wash was a week ago.  I generally have halo frizz around my scalp area which I am currently combatting with the upside-down shower method.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Other Products Used with this Product and Application Methods Used\n\n**Note**: All products are CG approved.  These are all the products I used on the day I tried this product.  I wash my hair every other day.\n\n**Pre-Treatment**: dampen hair, detangle with a little bit of the Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt conditioner, scrunch out some wetness, apply overnight oil (sweet almond oil, olive oil, rosemary oil, tea tree oil mixture) and sleep with a processing cap on.\n\n**Shampoo**: Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Shampoo\n\n**Conditioner**: Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Conditioner\n\n**Deep Conditioner**: Raw Sugar Healing Power Hair Masque with Avocado Oil + Banana + Coconut Milk + Agave\n\n**Leave-in**: Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Multi-Action Leave-in\n\n**Curl Cream**: Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Whipped Curl Cream (this product)\n\n**Gel**: Kinky Curly Original Curling Custard\n\n**Cast-breaker**: Shea Moisture 100% Argan Oil\n\n**Tools**: WetBrush Wet Brush, Microfiber head wraps (I use them as towels to scrunch), Xtava Black Orchid Diffuser, InfinityPro by Con Air Drier, my hands (for scrunching)\n\n**Method**: Wet hair while leaning forward (back of head facing ceiling and hair pointing down).  Shampoo roots while leaving forward and use praying hands to run shampoo over the rest of the hair.  Rinse leaning forward.  Apply conditioner leaning forward and use a wet brush to distribute in product, squish to condish while leaning forward.  Let sit for 2-4 minutes.  Rinse while leaning forward.  Apply deep conditioner while leaning forward and use a wet brush to distribute product.  Let sit for 8-15 minutes.  Squish to condish and leave a little in hair when finishing.  While leaning forward, apply leave-in and curl cream by using praying hands and then scrunching upwards.  Scrunch some of the moisture out of hair with a microfiber cloth, then praying hands + scrunch in gel.  Diffuse with Xtava’s Black Orchid diffuser on low heat low (\"cool\") speed, let hair sit for a couple minutes and scrunch out the cast with Shea Moisture’s 100% Pure Argan Oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# First Impressions After Opening Product\n\nThe smell of the product is quite nice and very low-key.  It smells like the rest of this line if you have ever tried it.  The consistency is almost like lotion (if you have ever used Cerave Daily Moisturizing Lotion, think of that texture/look/consistency).  On a side note, the safety seal was INSANE to take off, so you’ll *definitely* know if someone tampered with your product.  When compared to the curl smoothie, the curl smoothie is a lot more “coagulated” (idk how else really to describe it) versus this product, so this whipped curl cream definitely gives the appearance of being lighter than the curl smoothie.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Thoughts During Application\n\nI applied this product while upside down (leaning forward so that the back of my head faced the ceiling and my hair pointed downward) and with near soaking wet hair by running a small amount on my hands down the top of my head first (not raking in).  After that, I applied a little more to my hands and used prayer hands to apply it down the length of my hair.  Something interesting I noticed while doing this was that the cream seemed to soak in immediately, like, in literal seconds.  At first I thought I wasn't using enough product, but as I continued using prayer hands around my hair I noticed that the product melted in all around my head.  When I scrunched after using praying hands, I noticed that the curls seemed quite defined (I had a little wet frizz, but this is nothing out of the ordinary for me).  The smell was very pleasant and didn't bother me at all during the application.  Something else I noticed was that this product didn't provide the same \"slip,\" or slippery feeling, that the curl smoothie did.  This may be because it wasn't as heavy as the curl smoothie, but it did leave my hair with its normal, slightly rougher texture that I normally feel (it felt like how wet hair feels without any product added).  I kind of actually liked this, since to me that was proof that it wasn't going to weigh my hair down and didn't create a film over the hair that brought it down, but I could still tell it was working because of how well my hair was holding a curl while wet.  Overall, I probably used a little over a quarter's worth (maybe a half-dollar coin's worth) of product, which for me is more than I'd use for the curl smoothie but less than I thought I'd have to use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Results\n\n**Before Scrunching:** As I am sitting here letting my hair settle after diffusing, I am looking at my hair and noticing the amount of volume it has now before breaking the cast that I do not normally get.\n\n**After Scrunching:** Holy volume Batman!  So after scrunching, I noticed that my curls definitely look softer than they normally do with the curl smoothie.  I'm not sure if that is a good thing or bad thing at the moment, so I'll have to see how my hair holds up for the rest of the day.  The cast I had wasn't entirely crunchy, so I may not have diffused for long enough which could also be the culprit, but unknown.  My hair smells sooooo good but is not overwhelming, which is nice.  My hair also feels a lot softer after having scrunched, so it looks like the cream doesn't turn your hair super rough.  [Here is what my hair looked like after I scrunched it (not my closet, sorry for the clutter in the background).](https://imgur.com/a/T08BGx3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Final Verdict\n\n**Disclaimer**: I am only one person, and this is only one product review.  As such, this review is based on my experience with the product and may differ (for better or worse) with other experiences or your own experience.  I hope that this honest review of the product will help you to decide whether or not you think this product will work well for yourself.\n\nMaybe it is still too soon to tell, but I really, *really* like this cream after this first wash.  It didn't make my finer hair feel weighed down after a shower, and I didn't have to be super careful to not overdo it during application like I normally have to do for the curl smoothie.  My hair feels softer and less \"wet\" than it normally does after I scrunch the crunch, which may be due to my gel or this curl cream, but either way I'm liking it.  Now that my hair is crunched, it feels extremely bouncy (like, I'm bouncing in the mirror just to see how it bounces) and lightweight.  I don't know how it will hold up in the elements, since I haven't gone outside, but for now it looks great.\n\nConsidering the price for the amount of product, it seems like a pretty good deal.  The Whipped Curl Cream's container is 11.5 oz (interestingly enough, the curl smoothie is 12 oz, so it looks like someone at Shea Moisture wanted to be funny).  I bought the tub for $12, so it looks like that is nearly a dollar per ounce, which I consider to be good for the price.  I didn't have to use a ton of product to get the result I did, so I anticipate this tub lasting me at least 6 months if not longer.  \n\nThe smell and consistency were great in my opinion.  The product didn't feel \"goopy\" like the curl smoothie and essentially melted into my hair, which I was totally not expecting.  This is probably due to the \"whipped\" nature of the product, as products marketed as \"whipped\" tend to be lighter and absorbed easily.  The smell was not overpowering, and I actually kind of preferred it over the curl smoothie to be honest (after a while, the curl smoothie begins to smell like over scented baby-powder/diapers to me).\n\nOverall, I think this product is *definitely* worth checking out if you are looking for a lightweight curl cream, have used the Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie but feel weighed down by it, or are looking for a curl cream for finer hair.  The price is good, the product looks good, and I am very happy with the results.  \n\nI hope this review may have helped some of you curlies out there!  Good luck on your curl journey :)\n\n# After a Week Update\n\nGood morning y’all!  So it’s been a week since I bought this product and I’ve had some time to see how it performs with my hair.  I’ll start by saying I think that it’s done well for my hair in that it is so lightweight, but sometimes I still find it hard to style my hair without that “coating” the curl smoothie gave me.  I have noticed that I’ve had a bit more wet frizz than normal, which I had a really bad buildup episode so it could be that or this cream, but I’m really not sure.  I’ve still also noticed that my hair seems to become a bit more frizzy when I scrunch the crunch, but I have a funny feeling that that’s due to the new gel I tried and not this cream, but it could be.  Here is a pros and cons list of what I’ve noticed over the past couple days:\n\n**Pros:**\n1. Product is very light weight and clearly does not weigh down my hair.\n2. Product forms wet curls well when scrunched in (but may need a strong-hold gel after to keep them).\n3. Product smells great (I prefer it way more than the curl smoothie).\n4. Price point for product is very affordable.\n\n**Cons:**\n1. Product may not be able to support certain curl types without more hold (I have 3a hair, may work better for wavier hair but this could also be a gel problem).\n2. You will need to use more product than expected to get results.\n3. Product may contribute to wet frizz (my hair had a ton of buildup so this may have contributed too)\n4. This is not a curl cream that you can probably add in and then walk out for the day, it will most likely require a gel to help the hold.\n\nOverall, I’d rate it 7.5/10.  It’s worked really well for my hair, and this rating could go up when I try swapping my strong-hold gel back into my routine and see if it was the cream or the gel that isn’t holding my hair.  The product makes my hair so soft once my routine is done and doesn’t weigh my finer width hair down, but I do have to use more product than I normally did with the SM CS.  I’m definitely going to use up the rest of this jar, and I still highly recommend this to people who are looking for a lightweight curl cream to try.  Unfortunately, there is no sample size containers out there and I did email Shea Moisture asking about samples, but they essentially told me to take a hike so that was a no.  Regardless, if you are able to get your hands on this product, I think it is definitely worth a try!",

        "body": "Thank you so much for your extremely thorough original post, and for the update. Your hair looks great!\n\nI have somewhat similar hair, have been experimenting with products for a while, and have yet to find any holy grail products. Reviews like this help a lot!\n\nI used to have such a simple hair routine, several years ago. I’d occasionally shampoo with T-Gel for scalp issues, but would normally cowash with a conditioner (not CG) and use a little of the same stuff as a leave in, then scrunch with a T-shirt and air dry. Depending on how badly I needed a haircut, I wouldn’t need any styling product until refreshing, and my hair would have good clumpy ringlets up front and a good wave in the back on my short-ish style. But then my perfect conditioner was discontinued. My hair has never looked as good with so little effort since. \n\nIt’s improved a lot since this round with CG, mostly due to this sub. My curls can get curlier and the waves in the back are sometimes curls, but my hair seems really sensitive to both protein and humidity. I’m in the Pacific Northwest, so we can get a lot of humidity! I’m also sensitive or allergic to a ton of scents used in hair products, so that limits what I can try. \n\nSorry to rant all over your wonderful product review. You’ve actually helped with some of my curly hair frustrations because I think I’m going to try this curl cream.",

    "body": "This was my first time using a non-Western sunscreen and I don't think I can come back to that ever again. I already tried a Purito product that worked well for me so I was pretty excited about their new unscented version of the sunscreen. The consitency of the sunscreen is very similar (if not the same) as a light moisturizer. It applied very nicely and was pretty hydrating. I didn't seem to experience any pilling when applied over my other skincare products, so if you do apply makeup over this sunscreen you'd probably be safe. After applying, it left no whitecast (I have a lighter skintone with yellow undertones) or any greasy residue on my face. Most sunscreens I wear leave a gross sunscreen smell on my skin, but as advertised this one left no scent. It also doesn't contain any essential oils like its counterpart, so anyone sensitive skin would have a safer time trying out this version. I would recommend this sunscreen and would purchase it again for myself. If anyone has a question, feel free to ask :)\n\nIngredients:\nWater,Butylene Glycol, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Glycerin,Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate,Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Acrylates Copolymer, Silica,1,2-Hexanediol, Niacinamide,Dibutyl Adipate,Ethylhexyl Triazone,Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Cetearyl Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Sorbitan Olivate, Glyceryl Stearate, Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Sorbitan Stearate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Disodium EDTA, Adenosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol",

    "body": "[Shelfie](https://imgur.com/a/oLge8Bq.jpg)\n\nHairType: 1A/1B leaning towards 1A. Fine hair, High Porosity, Waist length. Virgin hair, never been chemically treated, I don't do any heat styling, no blow-drying. Only Air-drying\n\n[Pic 1, Im turning away from camera](https://imgur.com/a/3YQDuew.jpg). Hair is so hard so photograph properly, If I get more accurate pictures, I'll edit to add.\n\nSo life's pretty bad right now, so I'm not able to do the elaborate hair care routine I used to. Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This is an anti-dandruff shampoo and the best I've used so far.\n\nOther than the usual supermarket brands I've used Bioderma Node Ds (Excellent but pricey. Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles. Bottle looks super tiny and the plastic waste bothers me.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Re'equil Anti-Hairfall Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:   [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-c14-16-olefin-sulfonate), [Cocamidopropyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-hydroxysultaine), [Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-cocoyl-isethionate), [Decyl Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/decyl-glucoside), [Coco-Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/coco-glucoside), [Dexpanthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Glyceryl Oleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-oleate), [Biotin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/biotin), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Nasturtium Officinale Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/nasturtium-officinale-extract), [Tropaeolum Majus Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tropaeolum-majus-extract), [Polyquaternium-22](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-22), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Glycol Monostearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycol-stearate), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Methylchloroisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylchloroisothiazolinone), [Methylisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylisothiazolinone), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Ci 45100](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-45100), [Ci 42090](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-42090)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.450 for 250 ml. Max discount 30%.\n\nUsage Timeline: 2 months\n\nConsistency: It's a pink liquid. Normal shampoo consistency\n\nUsage:  I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: Oh my god, you guys. Best find of this year. This gives super shiny, sleek looking hair. I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember. I used up the entire bottle. I think 9ish months?? or more.\n\nConsistency: Normal shampoo consistency, HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above. Forever Repurchase. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Oriental Botanics Red Onion Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients: This has an ingredients list a mile long. Will update soon.\n\nPrice: MRP 449 for 300 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years and I'm only done with half the bottle\n\nConsistency: Normal Shampoo\n\nUsage: I take a lot and apply it from shoulders to ends, if I've not oiled my hair.\n\nReview: I literally had to go and check what the name of this product was to type this review and I've been using it for 2+ years. I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

Was MRP 490 for 500 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years. I'm on my second tub\n\nConsistency: White cream.\n\nUsage: I take one big spoonful, add it to half a mug of water, swirl it around till it mixes with the water, dip my hair in and leave it. I'm not sure why this works since leaving hair in water isn't good, but it does. Between just straight up applying it and doing this, this works better. I leave it on for 5 minutes and then rinse it off.\n\nReview: This is a cult favourite  around here and for very good reason. I use this in the place of a conditioner. This conditions. I get nice, shiny frizz free hair. The cost - benefit was insane and this was HG. Not going to say anything else, because it's not available and it's pointless.  I paid higher than MRP to get my hands on a tub, when I realised it was going to be rEfORmuLAted and I've had no regrets so far.

Plum has a 100 million sales throughout. You can get it for around 450ish.\n\nUsage Timeline: No clue. I'm on my third tub.\n\nConsistency: Thick white cream\n\nUsage: This works both ways. Straight up applying and mixing it with water, both works equally well. You might use up more if straight up applying it.\n\nReview: This is brilliant protein conditioner. If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

Rare Beauty is charging $20 for their lip oils while the Etude Glass Rouge Tint costs $7.21 over on YesStyle.com.\n\n\n\nRare Beauty Lip Oil:\nWater (Aqua/Eau), Diphenyl Dimethicone, Diisostearyl Malate, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Octyldodecanol, Bis-Behenyl/Isostearyl/Phytosteryl Dimer Dilinoleyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Sorbitan Isostearate, Polysorbate 60, Pentylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Menthoxypropanediol, Ceteareth-20, Squalane, Fragrance (Parfum), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Stevioside, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ammonium Polyacrylate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Butylene Glycol, Gardenia Florida Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Nymphaea Odorata Root Extract, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Eugenol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Yellow 6 (CI 15985), Red 28 (CI 45410), Red 33 (CI 17200), Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Blue 1 (CI 42090)\n\n\n\nEtude Glass Rouge Tint:\nWater / Aqua / Eau, Diphenyl Dimethicone, Diisostearyl Malate, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Octyldodecanol, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene (Glycerin), Bis-Behenyl/Isostearyl/Phytosteryl Dimer Dilinoleyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Dipropylene Glycol, Sorbitan Isostearate, Polysorbate 60, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Ceteareth-20, Phenoxyethanol, Squalane, Fragrance / Parfum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sunset Yellow FCF (CI 15985), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Fruit Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Blue 1 (CI 42090), Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Red 33 (CI 17200), Red 28 (CI 45410)\n\n\nThe only differences I can find is that Rare Beauty added menthol to give a tingly feeling. And the oils are different. Rare Beauty uses jojoba and Sunflower oils. ETUDE uses Shea Butter, Argan Oil, Apricot Oil, Evening Primrose Oil and Sweet Almond Oil. Rare Beauty also uses Florida Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, and Nymphaea Odorata Root Extract. While Etude just uses Mango Fruit Extract.\n\nHave you seen this before, where a company dupes another company's formula and then charges more for it?",

It's being advertised as oil-free, non-comedogenic, and hydrating. Not many reviews out on it yet, but based on those as well as its ingredient list, it seems to be similar to Unseen by Supergoop - a transparent silicone-based formula that feels a bit like a primer. This one is a bit more bare-bones than Unseen, as it doesn't contain added beneficial ingredients like meadowfoam and shea butter, but it's also slightly higher SPF and offers better water resistance. And the price is much lower ($24 versus $36 for 50ml). Unfortunately it doesn't specify UVA protection level but I would guess probably at least PA+++. I'll see if their customer service will reply to me with that info and update this post if so.\n\n(I also like that they list it as \"Hawaii compliant\" rather than \"reef-safe.\" (Reef safe marketing is fake propaganda and anyone who tries to argue about this in MY comment section will only receive stupid gifs in reply.))\n\nI plan to order today as I don't have a decent water-resistant sunscreen on deck for this summer. I may not be able to test it for a few weeks though as I have other new products I'm trying to work into my routine and I prefer to introduce one at a time.\n\n[https://starface.world/products/clear-as-day-spf-46](https://starface.world/products/clear-as-day-spf-46)\n\nIngredients: Avobenzone 3%, Homosalate 10%, Octisalate 5%, Octocrylene 10%, Isododecane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethicone/Vinyl Diemthicone Crosspolymer, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Silica, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate\n\n.\n\nEDIT after purchasing and using for a few weeks: There's a lot to like here! It doesn't break me out. It goes on very smoothly and settles to a lovely natural finish with a slight smoothing/pore-blurring effect. It reapplies nicely as well. I used this at an outdoor family gathering and applied a total of 3 times throughout the day, it went on nicely each time and it gave great protection, no burning or tanning by the end of a very sunny day. The only drawback is it stings my eyes TERRIBLY, I really can't use it unless I put a different sunscreen around the eye area, and even then the longer I have it on the more likely it is to end up migrating to the eyes. I would continue to repurchase as I don't have a better go-to at the moment but I will continue searching for a holy grail waterproof sunscreen.",

    "body": "I am trying to understand what is the deal with Purito and their sunscreens.\n\nThey have two different sunscreens\n\n* Centella Green Level Safe Sun \n* Centella Green Level Unscented Sun\n\nAlthough they have the same two UV filters (one UVA filter and one UVB filter), the formulation is not the same. However, the company claims the exact same SPF and UVA PF results for both sunscreens: PPD of 22.59 and SPF of 84.5 (you can see the videos below). This is very strange as even if the exact same formulation is tested twice, we will not get the EXACT same results.\n\nApart from the fact that they have used one set of results for both sunscreens, which is fairly suspicious, they have disclosed the percentage of UV filters used in their unscented formulation. According to their website: “The PURITO Centella Green Level Safe Sun contains 3% of Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate and 2% of Ethylhexyl Triazone.”\n\nThis means that they claim an SPF of 84.5 just from 2% of a single UVB filter.\n\nNow in contrast to this sunscreen, we have the Invisible fluid (formerly known as the Shaka Fluid) from La Roche Posay. This sunscreen claims to feature a special technology to “gel and stabilize the droplets containing the filters, thus forming an extremely tight and protective structure”. With this technology on board, the company still uses a good amount of UV filters, namely Octisalate (5%), Uvinul T 150 (4.5%), Tinosorb S (4%), Avobenzone (3.5%), Mexoryl XL (2%), Mexoryl SX (0.495%).\n\nAs in Europe any SPF above 60 can only be labelled SPF 50+, we can only learn more information about this product’s SPF from other countries. In Brazil, it is marketed as SPF 60 when they are able to market products with SPF 70 (https://www.laroche-posay.com.br/anthelios/hydraox-fluid-fps60). So I will assume it has an SPF of 60 - 70.\n\nSo, La Roche Posay must use a special technology and 9.5% UVB filters and 6.495% of broad spectrum filters, i.e. a total of 16% of filters blocking UVB (8 times more filters) to get a lower SPF.\n\nEven the filter used by Purito at 2%, is used by La Roche Posay at 4.5%, i.e. more than double.\n\nNow for the UVA protection, La Roche Posay claim a PPD of 46 as opposed to 22.59, but still there, they use 10% of UVA filters as opposed to 3%. So, they are using more than 3 times the amount of filters to achieve double the PPD value.\n\nIs it possible that the formulation of the Purito is so special that they can use 8 times less filters to get a higher SPF???\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Centella Green Level Safe Sun**\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dibutyl Adipate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, Niacinamide, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Silica, Cetearyl Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Centella Asiatica Extract (4315 ppm), Hyaluronic Acid, Tocopherol, Sorbitan Olivate, Glycery l Stearate SE, Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Sorbitan Stearate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Disodium EDTA, Adenosine, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nPPD = 22.59 and SPF = 84.5\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZy0t\\_UCgNk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZy0t_UCgNk)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Centella Green Level Unscented Sun**\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Glycerin, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene , Acrylates Copolymer, Silica , 1,2-Hexanediol, Niacinamide, Dibutyl Adipate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Cetearyl Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Sorbitan Olivate, Glyceryl Stearate, Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Sorbitan Stearate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Disodium EDTA, Adenosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol\n\nPPD = 22.59 and SPF = 84.5\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOQJzdQaiF4",

        "body": "People who are not skincare addicts but still want to protect themselves will see everyone here recommending Purito sunscreens. You see it all the time, skincare newbies who finally get skincare hauls will often have Purito unscented as the sunscreen. They'll buy it, and a lot of them will go out under the sun thinking they're protected. But no they're not, and will increase their chances of sunburns and melanoma.\n\nYes, I do think that promoting Purito sunscreens is harmful to most consumers. Because not everyone knows how unprotective this sunscreen is.\n\nAnd then, people say this is an inside sunscreen. UVA penetration through windows is highly overestimated by people. You don't need sunscreen inside. If you live close to windows everyday, then buy curtains???",

Of course filter concentrations don't say everything, different grades of mineral filters, coatings and inactive ingredients can influence the SPF a lot. So you can't determine the SPF solely based on filter concentrations, but going from on average 15-25% needed for SPF50+ to 3.6-5%, I mean it's at least something that jumps out and makes me curious. It's the first time I see a sunscreen with such a high filter efficiency. I hope Regardsurlescosmetiques or someone else will test the Purito Comfy and Green Level, although it's of course difficult to say how reliable these in vitro results are, maybe it will give some insight.",

I understand the necessity for a cosmetically elegant sunscreen that you’ll wear everyday but EU sunscreens are not that thick/pasty/heavy as everyone seem to make them as. Honestly, there are ways to make them work, like applying no moisturizer or less moisturizer underneath and allowing them to dry for a while before applying makeup. And it’s all worth it for the protection you get in return. I just wish people stopped recommending Purito sunscreens to newbies who’d trust it without extensive research.",

        "body": "I think this is a really interesting topic, and I did a bit of digging, and here's what I think, however I preface this that I'm not a professional here.\n\nIt could be due to the way the sunscreen was manufactured(like how it was mixed), as Lab Muffin Beauty Science describes in [her video](https://youtu.be/aTNcbLHZusc?t=333), she explains that the manufacturing process is just as important as the actual UV filters used. \n\nLike the Purito suncreen, the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50 also uses the same UV filters and I believe is manufactured by the same lab, and again, Lab Muffin Beauty Science explains why she thinks that product is protective enough [here](https://labmuffin.com/sunscreen-reviews-klairs-mecca/).\n\nAnother idea is that the sunscreen has a hefty amount of niacinamide which has [photoprotective properties](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20354654/), and since SPF is a ratio between the amount of UV required to cause a burn sunscreen protected skin and UV required to burn unprotected skin, it means that SPF doesn't measure the actual SPF absorbed or reflected from the UV filters themselves but rather whether or not your skin will burn. It also looks like La Roche Posay sunscreens do not contain the array of antioxidants that the Purito one does, because antioxidant plant extracts may [enhance the SPF value](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4177626/).\n\nAn interesting note, while looking at the La Roche Posay sunscreen from the Brazilian website the Google translation says that it is water and sweat resistant, which is interesting, because in Australia, we have the same product but it does not have any water resistance claims.\n\nTaking all this together, in my opinion there might be differences in how the products are manufactured which would play a very big role in the tested SPF, but also the ingredients other than the UV filters would affect their SPF. \n\nThat would be my take on it.",

Ultra elegant, yet SPF50+, PA++++ (ok, it only means PPD >16, but still)... something doesn’t quite add up, even factoring in the amount of alcohol that goes into the some of them. If high protection EU sunscreens have taught us anything, it’s that (currently) you can’t have high protection without harming (to some extent) the elegance of a sunscreen. And in many cases a good balance has been found (eg Shaka Fluid for a lot of people), but I’m really skeptical of these ‘seemingly perfect’ sunscreens from Asia because the SPF-branding is less regulated and the results just don’t seem to align with what Europe offers.",

So if we take it that it’s SPF is indeed 60, and if the UVA is 46, wouldn’t that mean the Invisible Fluid would have a Boost Star rating above 3 since the SPF and UVAPF are much closer to one another, compared to say the P20? We don’t have a Boots Star rating for the Invisible Fluid (as far as I know), but the Ambre Solaire Fluid, which we are assuming is very close to the Invisible Fluid, only has a Boots Star rating of 3. If it did have the same protection as the Invisible Fluid (SPF60 & PPD46) shouldn’t it have a higher star rating? I don’t like the Boots system, as I think it is confusing and misleading, but it got me thinking. Also I have been using the Garnier Ambre Solaire Advanced Fluid since March and it’s great (briefly went back to Shaka/Invisible Fluid, but prefer the more matte Garnier), so I hope it has a similarly high UVA protection.",

I wonder if they actually tweaked it, or if it will be the same burnt orange shade. I wonder if the large particle titanium dioxide you mentioned, will mean the tint will be less transparent? With a higher coverage result. Excited to see. \n\n\nEdit to add: Do you think the UVMune would be as good (or better) than the P20 Kids? In terms of UVA1 protection?

But I’m gonna do it anyway…I think out of all the sunscreens I have tried/reviewed (this will be number 16) I haven’t had one recommended and pushed in my direction more than the Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun. And on paper…I 100% understand why.\n\nThis is the first K-Beauty sunscreen that I have used that doesn’t contain fragrance, essential oils, and has absolutely no white cast…all in one product. The first time I applied this sunscreen I thought “No way…absolute magic.”. The look and feel of this product really reminds me of the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence. But, I find the Purito to be lighter and a bit more creamy/milky (if that makes sense LOL). The Klairs Airy UV Essence is a bit more jelly-like and thicker…although honestly the difference is very minimal.\n\nAnother quality I love about this Purito Unscented Sun is the fairly concentrated blend of Centella Asiatica. 5 different forms of “Cica” are here including Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, and Asiatic Acid. I found this blend (along with the Niacinamide also found here) to help in reducing redness/irritation from a few blemishes and the introduction of Curology/Tretinoin into my routine. \n\nAnd finally, while the scent is very similar to that of the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence…its a bit more mild/approachable. If you remember, I compared it to super glue or artificial nail glue (but not as intense). My first week using the Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun had me feeling very impressed. It seemed to be doing all the things that I loved about the Klairs Sunscreen but with a lighter feel and at a more affordable (per OZ) cost. I was totally ready to do my happy dance…until I decided to go for a walk/jog without my sun hat LOL!\n\nI posted about it in a few places (so you might already know the story LOL)…but after 57 minutes outside with my forehead exposed (just the Purito Sunscreen on) and I had a fairly noticeable tan line where my head wrap stopped just along my hair line. Honestly, to say I was shocked and a bit disappointed by this was an understatement. I’ve been working so hard to keep my skin away from UV exposure to give the Tretinoin/Hydroquinone as good of a chance to reduce my hyperpigmentation as possible. It really felt like a step back to see this kind of result. \n\nOver the course of the next week (up until today)…my skin just seems to have darkened a bit. Between the combination of being near windows, getting the mail/walking the dog, and having my mask off as I drive to and from places…the Purito Centella Green Level Sunscreen just doesn’t seem to offer as much protection as other products have. I don’t think there has been another sunscreen I have used that I can say this about. Other products may have been greasy, smelly, or white-cast inducing…but they all did the basic function of screening the sun LOL!\n\nNow, this isn’t to say that this product doesn’t have the ability to work. Korea has some strict standards and testing in place so this product is by law…SPF 50+ PA++++ if it’s allowed to be sold as such. However, there are so many other factors that can play into the efficacy of sunscreen once it’s on.\n\nMy sweaty face while exercising, putting on and taking off my face covering, and just daily life will absolutely take a toll on the efficacy of my sunscreen...I get that. But this product from Purito seemed to degrade and become less effective faster (on my skin) than other products I have used including the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence and other “non-waterproof” products. The Klairs in particular came with me on early spring hikes a few times where I was sweating my fat butt OFF (LOL!)…without issue.\n\nOne last thing that kind of tipped me off to the Purito Centella Green Level’s tendency to not get along with my skin was the amount of stinging it caused to my eyes. I have had this happen with other chemical sunscreens…but I felt like it was particularly constant and hard to keep at bay this time around. Usually, by keeping a product a fair distance from my eye line or patting on some physical sunscreen to create a “wall” around my eyes will do the trick. But, this product seemed to find its way to my eyeballs every time LOL!\n\nSo, moral of the story. Is this a “bad” sunscreen…probably not. It’s been tested to provide SPF 50+ PA++++ and I’m sure that it does a fine job for most people. But, depending on your habits/lifestyle…it might not be the best fit (just like anything else). I’m not here to scare anyone into thinking that this product will 100% cause them to burn or tan or spontaneously combust (LOL)…I’m just saying that I’d rather pass on this product in favor of a sunscreen that more accurately fits MY needs. Your experience with this (and any other product) will vary. Right now, that would be the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence.\n\nI love, love, love that people are so passionate about their SPF. While it sometimes makes it hard to feel comfortable talking honestly about SPF, sun protection, skin damage, and even disease caused by sun exposure…I feel like keeping an open/honest discussion about it is important. Especially for those that might be learning about the importance of sun protection for the first time. \n\nRegardless of how intense my “tan line” was…the fact that it was there is a problem for me. Any amount of tanning, skin tone change, or burning is your skin’s response to damage…bottom line. Skin doesn’t do it for fun or know that you prefer that color in the summer time LOL! And you know…some of us will take that knowledge and continue to get our summer tan on. While I don’t love that…I understand it (I mean was the exact same way not too long ago). I just hope that people at least acknowledge the risks and really think about the long-term consequences before heading outside without sun protection. The worst option is to see posts like this or hear warnings and ignore them/pretend you’re the exception. You’re not…no matter your background of skin tone.\n\nAlright, thats it. Let the comments roll in LOL! Just kidding, you all have been super kind and supportive and I appreciate that. This topic seems to be THE ONE that can get people heated.

I decided to check out the differences in the formula ingredients between Sam’s and charlottes. NO SHADE INTENDED. Let’s compare! \n\nCharlotte Tilbury Hollywood Flawless Filter ingredients: \n\nAQUA/WATER/EAU, HYDROGENATED DIDECENE, MICA, GLYCERIN, PROPANEDIOL, SQUALANE, CETYL PEG/PPG-10/1 DIMETHICONE, ISOAMYL LAURATE, HYDROGENATED STYRENE/ISOPRENE COPOLYMER, SODIUM CHLORIDE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HYDROXYACETOPHENONE, POLYGLYCERYL-4 ISOSTEARATE, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, GLYCOSAMINOGLYCANS, HOYA LACUNOSA FLOWER EXTRACT, [+/- IRON OXIDES (CI 77491, CI 77492, CI 77499), BISMUTH OXYCHLORIDE (CI 77163), TITANIUM DIOXIDE (CI 77891)]\n\nCharlotte even uses this specific flower extract. (Porcelain flower extract, I’m assuming the Hoya lacunosa) \n\nAuric Glowlust ingredients:\n\nWATER (AQUA), HYDROGENATED DIDECENE, MICA, GLYCERIN, PROPANEDIOL, SQUALANE, CETYL PEG/PPG-10/1 DIMETHICONE, POLYDECENE, HYDROGENATED STYRENE/ISOPRENE COPOLYMER, SODIUM CHLORIDE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, PHENOXYETHANOL, POLYGLYCERYL-4 ISOSTEARATE, SODIUM DEHYDROACETATE, CETYL DIMETHICONE/BIS-VINYLDIMETHICONE CROSSPOLYMER, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, GLYCOSAMINOGLYCANS, TRIETHOXYCAPRYLYLSILANE, TROPOLONE, HOYA LACUNOSA FLOWER EXTRACT, PENTAERYTHRITYL TETRA-DI-T-BUTYL HYDROXYHYDROCINNAMATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, (+/-) TITANIUM DIOXIDE (CI 77891), BISMUTH OXYCHLORIDE (CI 77163), IRON OXIDES (CI 77492, CI 77491)\n\nHers definitely has more ingredients but it’s VERY similar and even has the same flower extract! 🧐\n\nI know so many cosmetic formulas are stupidly similar especially when comparing eyeshadows and powder products, I just thought this was interesting! Had to share my nerdy detective observations with someone. 🤓\n\nRegardless, my CT flawless filter is definitely expired, and I bought Aurics to replace it. Also, I definitely prefer and love to support Sam instead. I’m excited to try it and feel and see the differences in person.",

    "body": "I ordered the Purito unscented sunscreen from Amazon on July 12 and received it today, July 22. FYI: I have slightly dry/dehydrated skin. \n\nHere are my initial impressions:\n\n**Packaging**: It arrived with the same packaging as the scented version, except it also came with samples! (2 samples of Deep Sea Pure Water Cream and 1 sample of the scented version of the sunscreen).\n\n**Scent:** As anticipated: no scent. After applying it onto my wrist for a patch test, I thought I could smell the faintest of scents, but realized that I was just smelling the scent of my skin.\n\n**Application (tested on my arm):** It squeezes out slightly thicker than the scented version, although I wonder if it's because it's a new bottle. Looking at them side-by side, the scented version appears to be more \"watery\". I tried to find variations in the application phase between the unscented and scented versions, but they are pretty darn similar (EDIT: During a second test comparing them side-by-side, I noticed that the unscented version is actually less slick/has more friction to it. Not bothersome, just an observation). It immediately breaks down from cream/gel into a liquidy phase, and then wipes down into a matte finish within 30 seconds-1 minute. Like the scented version, it has a cooling/soothing effect during its initial drying phase. After 30 minutes of application, I see no signs of irritation on my skin.\n\n**Overall:** It really does seem like a true unscented version of the Centella Green Level Safe Sun. From my initial impression, they are nearly identical, but with one simply having no scent. Tomorrow, as a true test, I am going to apply the scented version on one half of my face and the unscented version on the other, and I will see how they compare throughout the day. I'll be on the lookout for any stark differences.\n\n**Concerning PPD and sunscreen efficacy:** From messaging them: \"The rating(PPD, SPF) derived from clinical trials of 10 people from organizations selected by the KFDA. The tests are conducted both organization and the KFDA, so yes, we follow standadized process that set by the government.\" PPD of their sunscreen is 20. \n\nUPDATE 7/23/19:\n\n**Morning Application:** So I just applied both sunscreens to opposing sides of my face and a major difference I noticed is how much longer it takes to rub in the unscented version. I was briefly alarmed by the initial application of the unscented version because it actually reminded me of a zinc oxide sunscreen (wondering if it's due to the new additions to the unscented version: butyloctyl salicylate, acrylates copolymer, Madecassoside,Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate). After 30 seconds of rubbing, there was still a white smear on one side of my face while the scented version had already nearly disappeared in whiteness. After about a minute of additional rubbing, the unscented version finally dried down into a matte, non-whitecast finish identical to that of the scented version. Upon initial application, they are equally moisturizing to my slightly dry skin. I'll give an end of the day update after I run some errands and hang out with a couple of friends.\n\n**End of the day:** The residue of both sunscreens was virtually the same by the end of the day. One could argue that the scented version is slightly more emollient/moisturizing. At this point, in terms of performance, I enjoy the scented version more due to its easier application and slightly more emollient properties. I actually like the scent too, even though it dissipates soon after application. However, considering lavender oil's potential negative effects, I will most likely continue to use the unscented version as it is definitely a great sunscreen.",

(or bullet lipsticks!)\n\ni'm not typically a clear gloss on its own person - i enjoyed the Maybelline lifter gloss in \"Ice\" but i was essentially wearing it as a balm by the end. I wouldn't wear it on top of lipsticks, though, and looking into this topic made me realise why - most lip glosses, at least today, seem quite oil-based, which i guess makes sense as lip oils are all the rage and people are often looking for a lip gloss/oil that feels moisturising and not sticky\n\nhowever, one of my all-time favorite lip products is the Kiko Milano \"Unlimited Double Touch\". it's a double-sided liquid lipstick and clear gloss. i love it because the gloss doesn't disturb the liquid lipstick at ALL - the shine does disappear lightly after a couple of hours, but the lips still feel nice and not dry when you rub them. i was thinking of how nice it would be if they sold the gloss on their own so i could layer it on top of any liquid lipstick, without having to buy a whole liquid lipstick alongside them (i love them, but I already finished one and have 2 more to go!). looking into the formulation made me realise why pretty quickly:\n\n\"DIMETHICONE, CETYL PEG/PPG-10/1 DIMETHICONE, CERA MICROCRISTALLINA (MICROCRYSTALLINE WAX), PARAFFIN, PENTAERYTHRITYL TETRA-DI-t-BUTYL HYDROXYHYDROCINNAMATE\"\n\nsuch a short ingredient list!! i'm not a cosmetic chemist, but this seems like it's extremely silicone-based, which I guess is why it doesn't feel \"moisturising\" whatsoever, but does keep my lips feeling soft without disturbing the liquid lipstick underneath. a really similar concept is the NYX \"Shine Loud\" lipstick, which I have not tried but have heard it works the same, where the top coat is:\n\n\"DIMETHICONE, TRIMETHYLSILOXYSILICATE, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE\"\n\nessentially just dimethicone! i guess that's the trick. yet, when I looked into the formulation of most other clear lip glosses I was familiar with, they almost entirely consisted of very emollient ingredients and oils. so i guess i am a sticky lipgloss person in a sea of oils :D\n\nis there a \"workhose\" siliconey clear gloss you like to layer on top of any liquid lipstick? or do you use regular, moisturising ones because you prefer the look even if it makes the lipstick not transfer-proof? or are you just a diehard lip oil and nothing else person ",

I love this one and I like mixing stickier glosses with this one to make them smooth. It’s good on its own and over lip liner. The one in the shade Summer Punch wears so well on its own too.\n\n- Essence Meta Glow lipgloss: Wears well over liquid lipstick if you want to add a holographic glittery finish to them.\n\n- Catrice Melt&Shine in Sea-cret: This is a very thick balm-type product and slightly glossy. I like to wear it with lip liner.\n\n- Bad Cosmetics Glossy: it’s basically a dupe to the Mac Clear Lipglass but with a vanilla smell. This doesn’t dry out my lips. This layers well over liquid lipstick and you don’t need a lot of it to get a mirror-like finish. It’s 10€ but it lasts a looong time. You can only find this in Rossmann or online.\n\n- Mac Clear Lipglass\n\n- Laneige lip glowy balm in Berry or Peach: moisturizing and glossy but doesn’t do well over liner or liquid lipstick.\n\n- NYX Shine Loud lipstick: The clear side is this silicone type gloss you discribed and it layers well over any liquid lipstick. I have some colours that don’t suit me which is why I am trying to use up at least the clear side (the swatches online are not good tbh).",

I could be wrong but I think that they are just releasing in the EU the l’Oreal Paris UV Defender sunscreen that is already available in india and looks pretty nice from what I’ve seen until now. \nPlus, a foaming cleanser with vitamin c too.",

But I’m gonna do it anyway…I think out of all the sunscreens I have tried/reviewed (this will be number 16) I haven’t had one recommended and pushed in my direction more than the Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun. And on paper…I 100% understand why.\n\nThis is the first K-Beauty sunscreen that I have used that doesn’t contain fragrance, essential oils, and has absolutely no white cast…all in one product. The first time I applied this sunscreen I thought “No way…absolute magic.”. The look and feel of this product really reminds me of the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence. But, I find the Purito to be lighter and a bit more creamy/milky (if that makes sense LOL). The Klairs Airy UV Essence is a bit more jelly-like and thicker…although honestly the difference is very minimal.\n\nAnother quality I love about this Purito Unscented Sun is the fairly concentrated blend of Centella Asiatica. 5 different forms of “Cica” are here including Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, and Asiatic Acid. I found this blend (along with the Niacinamide also found here) to help in reducing redness/irritation from a few blemishes and the introduction of Curology/Tretinoin into my routine. \n\nAnd finally, while the scent is very similar to that of the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence…its a bit more mild/approachable. If you remember, I compared it to super glue or artificial nail glue (but not as intense). My first week using the Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun had me feeling very impressed. It seemed to be doing all the things that I loved about the Klairs Sunscreen but with a lighter feel and at a more affordable (per OZ) cost. I was totally ready to do my happy dance…until I decided to go for a walk/jog without my sun hat LOL!\n\nI posted about it in a few places (so you might already know the story LOL)…but after 57 minutes outside with my forehead exposed (just the Purito Sunscreen on) and I had a fairly noticeable tan line where my head wrap stopped just along my hair line. Honestly, to say I was shocked and a bit disappointed by this was an understatement. I’ve been working so hard to keep my skin away from UV exposure to give the Tretinoin/Hydroquinone as good of a chance to reduce my hyperpigmentation as possible. It really felt like a step back to see this kind of result. \n\nOver the course of the next week (up until today)…my skin just seems to have darkened a bit. Between the combination of being near windows, getting the mail/walking the dog, and having my mask off as I drive to and from places…the Purito Centella Green Level Sunscreen just doesn’t seem to offer as much protection as other products have. I don’t think there has been another sunscreen I have used that I can say this about. Other products may have been greasy, smelly, or white-cast inducing…but they all did the basic function of screening the sun LOL!\n\nNow, this isn’t to say that this product doesn’t have the ability to work. Korea has some strict standards and testing in place so this product is by law…SPF 50+ PA++++ if it’s allowed to be sold as such. However, there are so many other factors that can play into the efficacy of sunscreen once it’s on.\n\nMy sweaty face while exercising, putting on and taking off my face covering, and just daily life will absolutely take a toll on the efficacy of my sunscreen...I get that. But this product from Purito seemed to degrade and become less effective faster (on my skin) than other products I have used including the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence and other “non-waterproof” products. The Klairs in particular came with me on early spring hikes a few times where I was sweating my fat butt OFF (LOL!)…without issue.\n\nOne last thing that kind of tipped me off to the Purito Centella Green Level’s tendency to not get along with my skin was the amount of stinging it caused to my eyes. I have had this happen with other chemical sunscreens…but I felt like it was particularly constant and hard to keep at bay this time around. Usually, by keeping a product a fair distance from my eye line or patting on some physical sunscreen to create a “wall” around my eyes will do the trick. But, this product seemed to find its way to my eyeballs every time LOL!\n\nSo, moral of the story. Is this a “bad” sunscreen…probably not. It’s been tested to provide SPF 50+ PA++++ and I’m sure that it does a fine job for most people. But, depending on your habits/lifestyle…it might not be the best fit (just like anything else). I’m not here to scare anyone into thinking that this product will 100% cause them to burn or tan or spontaneously combust (LOL)…I’m just saying that I’d rather pass on this product in favor of a sunscreen that more accurately fits MY needs. Your experience with this (and any other product) will vary. Right now, that would be the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence.\n\nI love, love, love that people are so passionate about their SPF. While it sometimes makes it hard to feel comfortable talking honestly about SPF, sun protection, skin damage, and even disease caused by sun exposure…I feel like keeping an open/honest discussion about it is important. Especially for those that might be learning about the importance of sun protection for the first time. \n\nRegardless of how intense my “tan line” was…the fact that it was there is a problem for me. Any amount of tanning, skin tone change, or burning is your skin’s response to damage…bottom line. Skin doesn’t do it for fun or know that you prefer that color in the summer time LOL! And you know…some of us will take that knowledge and continue to get our summer tan on. While I don’t love that…I understand it (I mean was the exact same way not too long ago). I just hope that people at least acknowledge the risks and really think about the long-term consequences before heading outside without sun protection. The worst option is to see posts like this or hear warnings and ignore them/pretend you’re the exception. You’re not…no matter your background of skin tone.\n\nAlright, thats it. Let the comments roll in LOL! Just kidding, you all have been super kind and supportive and I appreciate that. This topic seems to be THE ONE that can get people heated.

It gives me red angry patches on my face when my skin is drier than usual. When that happens, I have to resort to my old HG, the Skin Aqua super moisture milk.

(The regular Super Moisture Milk is my HG & has always worked flawlessly for me in the brightest & sweatiest of conditions, but the pink bottle just doesn't protect as well despite the SPF 50 PA++++ rating.) I'm wondering if some of the difference could have something to do w/ lower UVA protection since the bar to reach PA++++ is not that high and we don't know the relative levels of UVA protection offered by sunscreens above the threshold of PA++++.",

And this is the second time I’m purchasing it. \nI have sensitive skin and this one doesn’t sting ( even thought there’s perfume in it ? .. ) most of the time I take Korean sunscreen like Skin1004 centella sunscreen because this one is very oily and it peels a lot one the skin :( but for a summer sunscreen it’s cool 👌\n\nIngredients : Aqua (water), dicaprylyl carbonate, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate, propanediol, decyl oleate, coco-caprylate/caprate, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine, phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid, prunus armeniaca (apricot) kernel oil, ethylhexyl triazone, lactobacillus ferment, cetearyl glucoside, lactobacillus, potassium cetyl phosphate, triacontanyl pvp, parfum (fragrance), tocopherol, cocos nucifera (coconut) fruit extract, aloe barbadensis leaf juice powder, avena sativa (oat) kernel extract, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, glycerin, hydrogenated vegetable glycerides citrate, xanthan gum, sorbitan olivate, ethylhexylglycerin, sodium hydroxide, panthenol, cetearyl alcohol, maltodextrin, citric acid.\n\n—\n\nAnd finally, some peoples said that :\n\nLa Roche posay Cicaplast B5+ balm \n\nWas nice for sunburn, ( brought for 10,99€ ) I will not lie I wanted to buy this balm before not for sunburn but because I swim a lot and being in contact with chlorine too much can be irritating sometimes so I wanted to try it, don’t know if the aloe Vera gel would be better or not but I will try and see if one is better than the other for me. \n\nIngredients : Aqua/ water/ eau, hydrogenated polyisobutene, dimethicone, glycerin, Butyrospermum parkii butter/ shea butter, panthenol, Zea mays starch/ corn starch, propanediol, butylene glycol, cetyl PEG/ PPG-10/ 1 dimethicone, trihydroxystearin, Centella asiatica leaf extract, Polymnia sonchifolia root juice, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, manganese gluconate, alpha-glucan oligosaccharide, silica, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium sulfate, mannose, capryloyl glyc,, caprylyl glycol, vitreoscilla ferment, citric acid, trisodium ethylenediamine disuccinate, lactobacillus, acetylated glycol stearate, maltodextrin, polyglyceryl-4 isostearate, tocopherol, pentaerythrityl tetra-di-t-butyl hydroxyhydrocinnamate, CI 77891/ titanium dioxide",

It still contains 10% Niacinamide, but they have added a new patented ingredient called \"Melasyl\". They've also added some ingredients, and dropped others.\n\nThey say it's based on 18 years of development. Not sure if that refers to the overall formula, or the Melasyl ingredient. More [here](https://www.laroche-posay.us/melasyl.html)\n\nDark spots and hyperpigmentaion aren't my main concerns, at this stage anyway, but I'm interested in the part that says it doesn't block the melanin process, but \"magnifies\" your own skintone. One of the images on the product page uses \"Clarify\" to describe Melasyl's action.\n\nThe colour of the serum reminds me of the Skinceuticals H.A. Intensifier Serum. I was interested to see that it also contains Licorice Root Extract, like the Skinceuticals serum. They're marketed as doing different things, but I thought that was interesting. Also, redness is an issue for me, and Licorice Root Extract can be helpful for that.\n\nIt's only available in the US at the moment.\n\nI'm not going to rush out and try to import, but I might try it out of curiosity whenever it gets launched in Europe.\n\nAnyway, seems interesting.\n\nThey also have a new Mela B3 sunscreen, also contains Melasyl. It's called Mela B3 Daily Moisturiser SPF30. As it's available in North America, it only uses the older sunscreen filters. No Mexoryl 400. I wonder if a non-North American version of this sunscreen will use different filters, since it uses 10% Homosalate, which I believe will no longer be used in Europe from 2025.\n\nEdit: Can anyone tell me how to get my post to display the image from my link above? it used to do it automatically, but doesn't do it anymore. Thanks.\n\nEdit 2: Not sure if PSA is the correct tag for this.",

Glow Oil SPF 50**\n\nI think out of all the Supergoop! products I picked up as part of this brand review...the Glow Oil SPF 50 had me most curious.\n\nWith Soybean, Grape Seed, Radish Seed, Meadowfoam, and Coconut Oils all in the formulation...I expected this oil to be nourishing yet heavy.\n\nBut, I was surprised with how well this “dry” style oil absorbs and applies (thanks Alcohol LOL). \n\nThis pump style mist oil doesn't dry down completely but I found it comfortable to wear in small amounts on my arms, legs, and chest. It also added a nice softness to my skin that I appreciated.\n\n“Small amount” you may be thinking? Yeah, this isn't something I would slather myself in for complete SPF protection.\n\nUsing the proper amount of this oil to get the SPF protection needed would leave me (and I assume most people) soaking in oil...no matter how well it absorbs.\n\nRather, this product ended up being a compliment to my lotion SPF to layer for a nice glow-y boost. \n\nJust a few sprays on the neck or wherever you like will not only add that boost in glow...but amp up the sun protection from whatever you are using as a base.\n\nI don’t think I will be using the Supergoop! Glow Oil very often, but once we are allowed to socialize and gather around a pool again...I could totally see myself applying some strategic sprays of this product to really shine! \n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nActive Ingredients: Avobenzone 3%, Homosalate 10%, Octisalate 5%, Octocrylene 10%\n\nInactive Ingredients: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Alcohol, Octyldodecanol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Polyester-8, Polyamide-3, Lauryl Lactate, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Diethylhexyl Syringylidenemalonate, Tocopherol, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Raphanus Sativus (Radish) Seed Oil, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Alaria Esculenta Extract, t-Butyl Alcohol, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Denatonium Benzoate, Citric Acid\n\nWhere To Buy (Supergoop!

Hasn’t been sold for about 3 years I think): \n\nAqua / Water,Cyclohexasiloxane,Nylon-12,Isododecane,Alcohol Denat.,Cyclopentasiloxane,PEG-10 Dimethicone,Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone,PEG-20,Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate,Disteardimonium Hectorite,Phenoxyethanol,Magnesium Sulfate,Disodium Stearoyl Glutamate,HDI/Trimethylol Hexyllactone Crosspolymer,Titanium Dioxide [Nano] / Titanium Dioxide,Methylparaben,Acrylonitrile/Methyl Methacrylate/Vinylidene Chloride Copolymer,Tocopherol,Butylparaben,Aluminum Hydroxide,Isobutane,Alumina,Silica,Glycerin,Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate\n\nFast forward to 2 months ago I ruined my hair with Garnier ultimate blends coconut oil shampoo (I forgot this brand ruined my hair in the past):\n\nAqua/Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Coco-Betaine, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, CI 14700/Red 4, Cocos Nucifera/Coconut Oil, Sodium Benzoate, Hydroxycitronellal, Sodium Hydroxide, Theobroma Cacao Shea Butter/Cocoa Seed Butter, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyquaternium-10, Salicylic Acid, Benzyl Salicylate, Benzyl Alcohol, Linalool, Caramel, Citric Acid, Hexylene Glycol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Parfum / Fragrance\n\n(Though I do think my hair is bad with coconut oil, I’m not sure if that’s the sole reason as the result is basically the same as when I used this shampoo in the past) \n\nI initially thought that it’s because my hair is already dry and coarse (as well as low porosity fyi) that these shampoos didn’t do me much good as they have drying alcohols and a few sulphates, and nothing that is really moisturising or nourishing. Though, I thought about it more, and in between the two periods I ruined my hair, I was using this shampoo by Herbal & Essences which also does seem pretty drying, but didn’t damage my hair at all (from what I saw physically):\n\nAqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Cocamide MEA, Parfum, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Hexyl Cinnamal, Magnesium Nitrate, Zea Mays Silk Extract, Rose Extract, Pearl Extract, CI 19140, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Tocopheryl Acetate, Potassium Sorbate, CI 42090\n\nIt in fact has more sulphates, but also more humectants at the same time. Could it be the alcohol? Or is the problem in fact, not the drying of my hair? I’m really lost and scared to buy another shampoo in case I ruin my hair again.",

Salon shampoos and conditioners may be more expensive however they are usually highly concentrated and when used properly can actually last much longer.

Even if you don’t want a cut a trim would be good if you are not happy with your hair. During your appointment discuss your issues and I am sure they will be happy to give a recommendation. If you really really don’t want a cut at all ask for a wash and style so that you can have time to ask about products during your appointment. You will get a much better recommendation by making an appointment and they can even try out what you want to buy on you before you purchase and take it home! \nSide note: if you use a sulfate free shampoo always wash twice! They are so gentle once is usually not sufficient. Even washing twice you use less than a typical drugstore shampoo.",

They have come out with 5 products which include their \n\n1. Skin renew peptide anti pollution facewash\n2. Skin renew peptide hydrating toner with peptides and hyaluronic acid\n3. Skin renew ABC peptide exfoliator serum\n4. Skin renew peptide retinol serum-cream\n5. Skin renew barrier repair peptide moisturiser\n\nOut of these what fascinates me is their peptide retinol serum and moisturiser.\nThe serum claims 3% peptides, 0.2% encapsulated and 1% alpha arbutin, similarly, moisturiser has 1% ceramides, 0.5% peptides as star ingredients. The reason this intrigues me is this is something new in the Indian market I mean I don’t think we have 1% ceramides in an affordable range and 3% peptides that too with encapsulated retinol. Despite the fact that Dr Vanita is shady af these ingredients are attractive enough to ignore that.\n\nRetinol-peptide serum Ingredients :\nAqua, C13-15 Alkane, Diethylhexyl Carbonate, Behenyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Alpha-Arbutin, Retinol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Retinaldehyde, Pentaerythrityl Distearate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate,\nPentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, 4-t-Butylcyclohexanol, Xanthan\nGum, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Ethylhexylglycerin,\nTrisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Metabisulfite, Sodium\nLactate, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nMoisturiser ingredients :\nAqua, Propanediol, Coco Caprylate/Caprate, Ceto Stearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, Betaine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate,\nIsododecane, Squalane, 3-0-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Ceramide NP, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylgylcerin, Glycerl Mono\nStearate, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Glyceryl Sterate Citrate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantion, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, Sodium Gluconate\n\nHere comes my doubts\nI thought dr Vanita will formulate these products according to US guidelines by which first 10 ingredients should be above 1% and in descending order after which they can have any order. So the serum really confuse me. Retinol is above peptides which are 0.2 and 3 percents respectively and retinol is at number 7\nThere are two peptides which claimed to be higher are at number 12 and 13\n\nSimilarly star ingredient of the moisturiser, ceramides (1%) are at number 12 that too only one ceramide (ceramide NP)\n\nWhat you guys think? Will these productsbe effective? \n\n",

If you want niacinamide in the moisturizer I would check out the Bioderma atoderm crème some folks love it. They also have a baume but it has no niacinamide. My reason for loving the la roche posay was the soothing nature of the thermal water and the occlusion so the avene ticks the boxes for even tho it’s pricey - well worth it with a coupon or discount on sale. Also if occlusion is very important to you I know the Uriage xemose cream and xemose oil balm are also great! I just can’t find them easily where I’m located.

Iirc polyquats are even more difficult to remove than amodimethicone, but why bother? These ingredients impart shine and smoothness and are somewhat protective (among other things). Your hair does not contain living cells and does not require nutrients to be delivered into the inner core, nor does it require water inside the hair shaft. In fact, from my research less water in the hair shaft is ideal. So a layer of emollients will do more good than harm imo.\n\n\nObviously buildup will occur after some time, and when this occurs you can always use a clarifying shampoo. I was strictly no sulfates/silicones for a few years for my curly hair. Nowadays knowing the science behind things, I don't understand the movement.",

My shampoo has that same cleanser, and some people describe it as essentially a sulfate while others say it's the most stripping of the non-sulfates but still weaker. If it were me, I would go by how my hair feels. If your hair seems gunky, sticky, or like it won't detangle the way it normally would, you can throw in a suave daily clarifying wash. If not, maybe your hair just likes being coated in silicone (or the shampoo is cleaning adequately) and you don't have to worry about it. The other thing to watch out for is that those heavy silicones tend to prevent oils from getting to your hair, so if you feel like your hair is really dry, or like the texture of it when unconditioned is getting worse, that may be a sign to switch conditioners or at least do a sulfate wash and use a silicone-free deep conditioner before you resume using the amodimethicone one.",

I'm looking to restock this summer, but I'm having a hard time finding it on the websites of the pharmacies I normally visit, usually Iceland sometimes also in Denmark.\n\nInstead I'm finding this product: La Roche-Posay Anthelios Anti-shine Face Cream SPF50+ (which doesn't have the UVMune labeling, and instead says \"Anthelios XL\" instead -- the UVMune hydrating cream is still available curiously). I've included two forms of ingredients lists that have appeared for this product below.\n\nIt seems like perhaps this is mainly happening in Iceland - the rest of Scandinavian sites seem to have the UVMune version listed. I'm having a hard time figuring out where Iceland is getting this specific XL product from, as I assumed they generally imported primarily from the UK and Scandinavia suppliers - but they all seem to still be carrying the oil control gel creme, so...\n\nMy main questions are, does anyone know what has caused this renaming/reformulation in certain markets? And, would these options still provide the same coverage that UVMune does? Or should I keep looking for that product?\n\nJudging by the ingredients list below, the second would potentially provide the same coverage as it has Meroxyl 400 (METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE) and a few additional filters the first list doesn't. Putting aside the fact that listed ingredients on websites don't always reflect what's on the shelf, would this assumption about filters be correct?\n\nThank you all for your help!\n\n* / WATER • HOMOSALATE • SILICA • OCTOCRYLENE • ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE • BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE • ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE • BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE • DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE • ALUMINUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE • GLYCERIN • PENTYLENE GLYCOL • STYRENE/ACRYLATES COPOLYMER • POTASSIUM CETYL PHOSPHATE • DIMETHICONE • PERLITE • PROPYLENE GLYCOL • ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER • ALUMINUM HYDROXIDE • p-ANISIC ACID • CAPRYLYL GLYCOL • DISODIUM EDTA • INULIN LAURYL CARBAMATE • ISOPROPYL LAUROYL SARCOSINATE • PEG-8 LAURATE • PHENOXYETHANOL • SCUTELLARIA BAICALENSIS EXTRACT / SCUTELLARIA BAICALENSIS ROOT EXTRACT • SILICA SILYLATE • STEARIC ACID • STEARYL ALCOHOL • TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID • TITANIUM DIOXIDE • TOCOPHEROL • TRIETHANOLAMINE • XANTHAN GUM • ZINC GLUCONATE\n* AQUA / WATER / EAU • DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE • SILICA • ALCOHOL DENAT. • ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE • ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE • BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOLMETHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE • DIISOPROPYL ADIPATE • PEG-8 • DIPROPYLENE GLYCOL • C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER • GLYCERIN • DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE • ALUMINUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE • BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE • METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE • TOCOPHEROL • DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE • ACRYLATES COPOLYMER • ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER • BIXA ORELLANA SEED EXTRACT • CAPRYLYL GLYCOL • CITRICACID • HYDROXYACETOPHENONE • MALTODEXTRIN • PENTAERYTHRITYL TETRA-DI-T-BUTYL HYDROXYHYDROCINNAMATE • PENTYLENE GLYCOL • SILICA SILYLATE • SODIUMPOLYACRYLATE • TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID • TRIETHANOLAMINE • TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINEDISUCCINATE • ZINC PCA.",

        "body": "All soap requires the same 3 things- water (to dissolve lye),lye and fat. For lye there's 2 to choose from-Potassium Hydroxide is what gives those soaps a softer final product, and Sodium Hydroxide which makes a harder soap. For your fats there's tons to choose from, but over the years soapers have figured out Stearic Acid and Palmitic Acid impart the qualities that shavers desire, a smooth, dense, creamy lather. Tallow and butters like Kokum, Mango seed have the most stearic acid, however straight stearic acid (which is 99% of the time actually a 50/50 mix of stearic and palmitic acid) has tons of benefits in immediately raising the Stearic/palmitic numbers and allowing for soapers to add other beneficial ingredients (like shea and other exotic fats) without sacrificing the qualities we value . Coconut oil (cocos nucifera) is ubiquitous for its bubble formation, it doesn't take a bunch, especially for shave soap. Too much and it can be drying or stripping on your skin which is why it's always further down from anything containing stearic acid.\n\nI'd say you're probably allergic or sensitive to a fragrance, maybe all of them.\n\n  \nI'm surprised sodium cocoate is the number 1 ingredient in SV, a famously excellent soap. I never would have guessed it to be honest, as a soaper I try to limit the coconut oil to the lowest I can.",

My problem is that my daily face lotion, the Aveeno Ultra-Calming Daily moisturizer STINGS when I put it on, even after washing my face. Almost like a chemical reaction sting, it's strange.

However, I'm obviously slightly concerned and wanted to isolate some ingredients that could be causing the reaction and avoid in the future.  \n\nIngredient list - does anything here pop out as something that could cause this? Are any of these known nasties to Tretinoin? I do know it's heavily fragranced...thoughts?  \n\nActive Ingredients: Avobenzone (3%) (Sunscreen), Octinoxate (7.5%) (Sunscreen), Octisalate (2%) (Sunscreen)\n\nInactive Ingredients\nWater, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, Cyclohexasiloxane, Arachidyl Alcohol, Phenyl Trimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Panthenol, Benzyl Alcohol, Ethylene/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Behenyl Alcohol, Steareth-2, Sodium Cocoyl Amino Acids, Steareth-21, Fragrance, Polyacrylamide, Arachidyl Glucoside, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Sarcosine, Laureth-7, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Potassium Aspartate, Magnesium Aspartate\n\nEdit: Thanks again All, as ever, extremely helpful.

    "body": "The is not a paid endorsement, but it is a fact: Dr Bronner's Soap is the gol-durn best bath soap ever in the whole wide world. Is it cheap? No. At my local market, it's $4.39 for a single 5-ounce bar. A four-pack of 3¾-ounce Irish Spring bars costs $1.89. So the math says, Dr Bronner's is a lot more expensive.\n\nBut let's calculate it a different way: For me, a bar of Irish Spring is gone after a week or so. A bar of Bronner's lasts about three times as long. Do the math on that, and you'll see that Dr Bronner's is still a lot more expensive, so this soap can't be justified on a cost basis.\n\nNot everything is dollars and cents, though. To me, the purpose of being a cheapskate is to have a few bucks in my pocket for nice things. [This bar of soap](https://boutique.humbleandrich.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-29-at-3.07.32-AM.jpg) is one of those nice things.\n\nWhen I used Irish Spring I kinda liked the smell, but it was always obvious to my nose that the scent was artificial. Bronner's smells fantastic, and not fake or chemically at all. The ingredients listed are all pronounceable and you probably know what the words mean: Coconut oil is the first ingredient listed, and tocopherol is the last, and it's the only word I didn't know. Turns out it's \"a fat-soluble vitamin made from organic compounds.\"\n\nIrish Spring's list of ingredients, by comparison, starts with sodium tallowate and/or sodium palmate, and ends with sodium chloride, pentasodium pentatate, pentaerythrityl tetra-di-t-butyl hydroxyhydrocinnamate, titanium dioxide, and then a couple of chemicals for coloring. \n\nDr Bronner's is a family business, not a subsidiary of any global corporation. Their soap is made in America, with ingredients sourced through fair trade, and it's environmentally sound, and biodegradable. Such green and lefty stuff means something to me, but your mileage may vary.\n\nThe company was founded in 1948 by a former mental patient, and that pedigree is still very visible in their mildly bonkers packaging — lots of tiny-print words wrap around the branding, and it reads like hippie-speak from the '60s. They sued the federal government for the right to include hemp in their recipe, and they won in court. Wikipedia says the CEO is \"a critic of drug prohibition and an activist for the legalization of a number of psychoactive substances.\" Again, without waxing too political for r/lazycheapskate, I'll just say that means something to me.\n\nMostly, though, I just like the smell. You're invited to drop by and take a whiff of me after a shower some morning, once the pandemic is over.\n\nDoc Bronner's sells their soap [by mail](https://shop.drbronner.com/castile-bar-soap), and it's at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Dr-Bronners-Pure-Castile-Moisturizing-Biodegradable/dp/B004K4J6Z2/), or you might find it at a supermarket. At my local grocery, it's in the \"natural products\" aisle, not in the soap aisle where I spent ten minutes looking for it the first time, before asking for help.",

I have absolutely no education in this area so I apologize if this is a “dumb” question- I just can’t get any answers directly from companies I have asked. \n\nA few years ago I was diagnosed with an allergy to Fragrance Mix II. My allergist gave me a list of things to avoid (I can add that list if it will help)- essentially I have to avoid all natural and synthetic fragrances because the test itself does not single out which specific allergens are the problem. \n\nWith cosmetics I’ve run into a problem with skinsafeproducts.com . I reference them to help determine which products are “safe.” One of the main things I was told to avoid was Cinnamal and all its forms (like hexylcinnamal etc.). With Skinsafe they often label products safe for me even though they contain Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate and/or pentaerythrityl tetra-di-t-butyl hydroxyhydrocinnamate. I’m hesitant to try them because my reactions aren’t worth it- hives, severe headaches, congestion and dermatitis breakouts that last too long. \n\nI keep running into those two ingredients and I’m confused how they are considered “safe” for my allergy. If anyone could explain I would greatly appreciate it. I’m hoping my allergist was wrong bc if those two specific things are NOT a “fragrance” it would unlock a tremendous amount of cosmetic and skincare options for me. Thank you",

I believe that each of the compounds you named is some slight variation of the original, an analogue. \n\nThe immune system is highly specific to how it recognizes a \"threat\" biomolecule versus a \"naturally\" synthesized biomolecule. Very small modifications in stereochemisrty or reactive groups will change how the immune system will sense a target. My guess is that the analogues that you mentioned are likely different enough to not be recognized, but similar enough to perform their function. When considering the bio molecular level, very small modifications can be very dramatic on impact. \n\nA popular example demonstrating how a small change can make a big difference is D-methamphetamine vs L-methamphetamine; where the first is the bad 'meth' an illegal stimulant, and second is found in over the counter vicks spray. \n\nIf youre worried about having an allergic reaction your best bet is to see your family doctor (if possible) or see a dermatologist. They're the experts in their field. \n\nTl:dr.. possible that these analogues are determined safe by manufacturing regulations, but you should be cautious and ask a dermatologist before trying.",

I could be wrong!\n\n/u/Wigi_wigi is correct in saying that the immune system can be highly specific. In the case of [cinnamal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexyl_cinnamaldehyde#/media/File:Hexyl_cinnamaldehyde.png), the relevant molecule is an aldehyde (carbon double bonded to oxygen, with a hydrogen on one side). Aldehydes undergo specific reactions in the body and it's likely that your allergy is specific to these types of fragrances.\n\n[Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octyl_methoxycinnamate#/media/File:Octyl_methoxycinnamate.svg) and [pentaerythrityl tetra-di-t-butyl hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/image/imagefly.cgi?cid=64819&width=290&height=290) are esters, and esters react very differently than aldehydes. It's possible that these cinnamal derivatives are different enough structurally that your immune system won't identify them as foreign. From what I gather, neither compound is a fragrance, and are instead used as UV-absorbers and antioxidants, respectively.\n\nI'll say that if you're concerned, ask your doctor.

There is also the A-Derma Exomega Control Emollient Lotion which relies on Petrolatum, Shea Butter, Glycerin, Mineral Oil and Dimethicone but less Niacinamide. What do you think of the Lipikar Lotion? I noticed that formula has not changed (as in they retained the mineral oil for now). I think it is the petrolatum and mineral oil that distinguishes the old Baume and the new one!",

    "body": "So, to start things off: I have curly, low-porosity hair that's on the coarse side, and although I love my curls at times I've been really wanting to experiment with doing a silk press. Of course, I want to make sure I won't be damaging my hair in the process or ruining my curls, so I've been doing my research and looking around for my holy grail heat-protectant - one that can tolerate high-heat (around 425 F), has water-soluble silicones, no proteins, and no drying alcohols. I've already found a heat-protectant that I plan on trying soon (Discover Found Avocado Oil Heat Protectant Spray), however I'm still looking for a hydrating, heat-protectant leave-in conditioner to use prior to blow-drying. It's been a long search, and although I haven't found the perfect product I think I've come close enough with some of these. I'm open to some exceptions, such as using Amodimethicone because from my understanding it creates a thin film over the hair, doesn't build on top of itself, and mainly builds in damaged areas in the cuticle. Proteins are something I'd highly prefer to avoid as my hair seems to like getting as much moisture as it can get, but in really small quantities I may be fine. Also trying my best to avoid drying alcohols. So with all that in mind, I'd love to get some second-opinions on these products and which would be the best fit for what I'm looking for. I've left some notes on these, so I hope that won't confuse anyone lol. Any other product suggestions would be highly appreciated.

I legitimately don't understand why, it's one of the only things that leaves my scalp feeling calm. I'd like to be able to use something else though because I know all the sulfates are probably really harsh on my curls.\n\nIngredients: Aqua/Water/Eau, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Piroctone Olamine, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Sodium Benzoate, Polysorbate 20, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Gluconate, Dimethicone Propyl PGBetaine, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium Salicylate, Salix Alba Bark Extract/Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Parfum/Fragrance, Linalool, Limonene, Betula Alba Bark Extract, Zingiber Officinale Root Oil/Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Citronellol, Citral, Isopropyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, sr-Spider Polypeptide-1, 1,2- Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n-\n\nPANTENE NUTRIENT BLENDS COMPLETE CURL CARE SHAMPOO - Made me unbearably itchy, red and flaky. The worst of the bunch.\n\nIngredients: Water, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Fragrance, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Polyquaternium-10, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Salicylate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Acrylates Copolymer, Panthenol, Panthenyl Ethyl Ether, Histidine, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil\n\n-\n\nBRIOGEO SCALP REVIVAL MICRO-EXFOLIATING SHAMPOO - This one feels pretty good, but sometimes it leaves my hair feeling too \"squeaky clean\" and I'm not sure if I should be exfoliating my scalp every wash day. \n\nIngredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate*, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil*, Glyceryl Stearate*, Glycerin*, Microcrystalline Cellulose*, Cocamidopropyl Betaine*, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate*, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate*, Hydrogenated Castor Oil*, Lithium Magnesium Sodium Silicate, Panthenol, Xylitylglucoside*, Charcoal Powder*, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil*, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil*, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil*, Mentha Viridis (Spearmint) Leaf Oil*, Anhydroxylitol*, Bisabolol, Menthyl Lactate*, Xylitol*, Polyquaternium-7, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Fragrance (Parfum), Citric Acid*, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n-\n\nBRIOGEO BLOSSOM & BLOOM VOLUMIZING SHAMPOO (which I guess was recently discontinued?) - Feels pretty good as well, some itchiness.\n\nIngredients: Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate*, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine*, Lauramidopropyl Betaine*, Glycerin*, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate*, Polysorbate 80*, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate*, Soyamidopropyldimethylamine Oxide*, Maltodextrin*, Biotin, Panthenol, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate*, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Citrus Tangerina (Tangerine) Peel Oil, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Mentha Viridis (Spearmint) Leaf Oil, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil, Sodium C14-18 Olefin Sulfonate*, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate*, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate*, Polyquaternium-7, Polyquaternium-71, Fragrance, Citric Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid\n\n-\n\nBRIOGEO CURL CHARISMA SHAMPOO - Moderate itchiness on my scalp and also just way too heavy for my hair.\n\nIngredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Lauramidopropyl Betaine*, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate*, Glycerin*, Glycol Distearate*, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine*, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter*, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract*, Rice Amino Acids*, Lactobacillus/Tomato Fruit Ferment Extract*, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil*, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil*, Acanthus Mollis Leaf Extract*, Tocopheryl Acetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice*, Keratin Amino Acids*, Coconut Acid*, Hydrolyzed Quinoa*, Sodium Hyaluronate*, Acyl Coenzyme A Desaturase*, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil*, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil*, Polyquaternium-71, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate*, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Isethionate, Polyquaternium-7, Anhydroxylitol*, Xylitylglucoside*, Xylitol*, Fragrance (Parfum), Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol",

Upon initial application, it felt so moisturizing and gave me that perfect sheer tint everyone has been raving about. But the NEXT day my lips were so dry and I never typically have this problem- even exfoliating or using a lip sleeping mask didn’t help. Every time I use it now, the next day my lips have this terrible dry film on them. I’m wondering if anyone else has had this issue? I looked at the ingredients and nothing stood out to me as overly drying or irritating other than the dyes. I included the ingredients below incase someone else has better insight.

I have recently tried a tester of this (two small testers, used both), and my skin really dealt well with it. I’ve been trying to use more vitamin c, but my skin always gets these tiny little red dots around my chin area and is just unhappy in general. This would happen after one to maximum two times using the product, and would resolve itself immediately after ceasing usage. This did not happen with this new product. The tester has been the first time I’ve experienced the “vitamin c glow”, I was so impressed and happy. Before, I tried a vitamin c serum, a vitamin c emulsion and mixing my own low dosage serum with powder. None of this worked, I bought all versions at The Ordinary, and my skin hated it. So now this product is quite expensive, but it also worked great. Does anyone have any opinions on this product and the formula??

    "body": "Hello r/SkincareAddiction 👋\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**TL;DR** : Long post sorry. Basically I break out or get sensitive reaction to most products I try. Hope you could help me find which are the most likely to cause these reactions. Listed below are the products that make me break out (most of them contain BG in the first few ingredients but idk) and others that don't ; with the ingredient lists. Thanks :)\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI've been trying to build a skin-care routine that'd work for me for a few years now and stay consistent with it, but the problem is that my skin reacts negatively to most products I ty.\n\nI don't think it's an proper allergy since the reaction isn't major (no hives or anything like that) ; but more a sensitivity : it can go from pimples on my cheeks with areas of redness to a burning sensation that lasts throughout the day or some itching and tightness.\n\n**My skin type :** combination and highly dehydrated (no product seems to be hydrating enough and some products marketed as hydrating actually seem to dehydrate my skin more ? ; or maybe the dehydration is caused by my sensitivity to the products idk). **Main concerns :** Dehydration + Visible pores and sebaceous filaments on nose (++) and chin + Oilyness on nose and chin during the day + Occasional hormonal acne pimples\n\nIt's a bit discouraging since I've tried products from all prices ranges and with differents ingredients and nothing seems to calm my skin (except a few products I've listed below). My skin seems to react particularily badly to gel-cream moisturizers designed for my skin type (oily to combination + dehydrated) for some reason...\n\nI've tried to compare the ingredients of the products that break me out and spot the culprits but I'm not sure since I'm not super knowledgeable in ingredients. But **Butylen Glycol** seems to be in the first ingredients of most products that break me out so idk ?\n\nPlease help me I don't know what to do anymore 😔 **Which products do you recommend I try

        "body": "I was right in the middle of an investigation to find out the culprit who broke me out and had just reached the conclusion that it could actually be butylene glycol. What a coincidence 😊\n\nI went through the ingredient list of every single product that caused me irritation and lo and behold, every single one of them contains butylene glycol among the top ingredients. Certain products would work great for a few months and then one fine day my skin will start getting itchy bumps. In other cases, the irritation will occur right after the first use. This was driving me crazy. Then I found that the products that caused irritation right away contained butylene glycol among the top three ingredients and for the rest, it came towards the bottom of the list. I researched the products that I used to use before I started serious skin care and none of them had butylene glycol. So this has to be the culprit.\n\n Sadly this means finding Asian Beauty products that works for me a hard task since almost all of them contain butylene glycol. Thankfully, my sister is not allergic to BG, so the products won't go to waste. \n\nI have combination skin by the way and I am not using any actives.",

    "body": "I've started using a shampoo and conditioner from the L'Oreal Elvive Hydra Hyaluronic range recently. The products are advertised for dry hair and contain ingredients such as glycerin and sodium hyaluronate, typically used as humectants in skincare.\n\nMy understanding of glycerin and sodium hyaluronate is that they are water-based ingredients, so I was sceptical if this is just marketing and if they'd do anything meaningful or simply be washed out.\n\nThe formula does include silicones, so perhaps the active ingredients could be trapped underneath that, but on the other hand, perhaps the silicones would be stopping them from penetrating the hair? (I'm not sure if the glycerol or hyaluronate are the right molecular size to enter the hair shaft in the first place.)\n\nSuppose they could bypass the cuticle would they provide any benefit?\n\nI've been looking at diagrams of hair anatomy and can't tell if dry healthy hair is meant to contain a certain amount of water. Assuming it is, and that a damaged cuticle leads to a reduction of this as water is escaping, leaving hair feeling \"dry\", would such ingredients be able to increase the water content in hair?\n\nIf so, is there such a thing as too much water, where this could help damaged hair, but make healthy hair limp or fragile? \n\n\"Dry\" hair is fragile too, ie. inflexible and prone to snapping, but it's not clear if increasing water content can alleviate this if oils and silicones haven't been enough.\n\nMy understanding of humectants in skincare is that they work by either drawing in water from the air or pulling it up from the skin surface, but neither of those seem to apply here, so are hair humectants doing anything, particularly when used with silicones? Would it maybe make sense to apply silicones afterwards?\n\nThe hair range also includes a leave-in product with a lot more hyaluronate, and oil instead of silicone, but I don't know about penetration when it comes to applying this on dry hair (presumably on a layer of silicones from the conditioner).\n\nI'd love if someone could weigh in on the science here.\n\n--\n\nList of the ingredients in this range for reference:\n\nShampoo:  \nAQUA / WATER • SODIUM LAURETH SULFATE • GLYCOL DISTEARATE • SODIUM CHLORIDE • COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE • DIMETHICONE • CI 60730 / EXT.

HYA and glycerin won’t remain on your hair when washed out, but in a conditioner, they may linger a bit, as most conditioners leave behind a film by design.  It is good to have humectants in a formulation for many reasons.  But not every ingredient in a formulation is going to perform independently as it would if you were using separately.  In other words, in a formulation it does one thing, while if you were put a HYA serum directly on your hair, it would do something else (or have a different effect rather).  \n\nFwiw, you can always a drop or two of HYA or glycerin to your leave-in conditioner if you want more humectants in your hair.",

        "body": "The relationship between hair and water is complicated.  When most people talk about \"moisturizing\" or \"hydrating\" their hair, they're really talking about the benefits of using conditioner, which mostly forms a coating of conditioning agents on the hair that make it softer and smoother rather than adding water.  It's a mis-application of skincare concepts to hair.  Hair is quite different from skin.  If there's too much water in the hair, it actually feels more dry, which is what the moisture bot that this comment will trigger says.  Porous hair, especially if there is chemical or heat or sun or chlorine damage, will usually allow too much water into the hair shaft, so conditioners offer the benefit of decreasing (but not completely blocking) the amount of water that passes through.\n\nHowever there has been a bit of an overcorrection of this idea in some hair science circles to give the impression that hair doesn't benefit from any water at all, and that's not true either.  [This video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C1qFlgNSgLp/) is information-dense and just scratches the surface of the topic, and I wish I had additional resources to share but that's all I've found that's made for a general audience.\n\nIn your situation, your hair feels dry (rough/brittle) to you, so it may actually have too much water in it and would benefit from products with oils, silicones and other polymers that help reduce water passing through.  L'Oreal has a big budget for product development and testing, so I trust that their products are good for the hair type they say they are, but exactly how & why may not match what the label says, that's just marketing that is aimed to appeal to customer's *perceptions*, not reflect scientific reality.  It could be the silicones in the product and other ingredients you're not familiar with that offer a lot of the benefits that the product promises.  You might find some of the [LabMuffin Beauty articles/videos on silicones](https://labmuffin.com/?s=silicones) useful, it's important to understand that they don't create an impermeable barrier on the hair to block anything from getting through.\n\nI share the skepticism of the other commenter that humectants in a shampoo would do much for hair, since it's meant to remove stuff from the hair and then is rinsed out.  Conditioners are formulated to stick to the hair, however it's still very possible that the hyaluronic acid is featured mainly for marketing purposes.  There has been a recent fad in marketing to highlight skincare actives in the products, but hair and skin are very different and those actives don't necessarily behave the same way for hair or help hair at all.  Glycerin may be useful if the product leaves it on the hair, but people's experiences with glycerin in hair products vary wildly, because it depends a lot on your local climate and the humidity level of the air around your hair.  It's also possible that glycerin was added to the product to change the product consistency rather than its effect on the hair, or simply because people *associate* it with moisture/hydration even though that's not the role it plays in the product.",

The formula no longer includes sulfates like Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Tea‑Lauryl Sulfate, and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, and instead they opted to use gentler cleansers/surfactants - likely to market it as “sulfate-free”. Also, I assume this was to appease folks with sensitive skin. They also seem to have removed some thickening agents like acrylates. The result is a cleanser that lathers less, feels thinner, and offers a milder cleanse overall. While that may be better for sensitive skin, I have oily skin and preferred the original formula. It gave me a deep clean that I followed with moisturizer, and I really miss that refreshed feeling. Will they go back to the original, highly not likely.\n\nFor the Facial Fuel Gel Cleanser, they updated it from \"Energizing\" to \"Invigorating\" to differentiate the two formula. I really miss the original.\n\nI imagine a lot of their product line (scrubs, cleansers, etc) got updated and folks noticed. Read a lot of reviews on their website and people are not happy.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u36c19l7vi7f1.jpeg?width=512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a554bf9d61e1b0b870d073c5ccebee7d80894f44",

So I was hoping someone recognizes my problems and has some good product recommendations (which don't cost a fortune, poor student over here :( ). (btw I live in the Netherlands and sorry if my english is a bit messy)\n\n\nSkin type/problems: I have very oily skin, but it gets extremely dry if I don't moisturize properly. I have some pimples and when I'm about to get my period it gets worse. I think the pimples also get worse when I don't eat healthy. I also have some blackheads.\nI also have these colourless bumps on my cheeks, which are filled with sebum. You can only see them if the lighting is right and you can feel them. I can just clean them like a pimple and it will dissapear, but they always come back.\n\nDuring winter it's very cold and my skin gets really dry. During summer my skin gets really oily.\nLast spring I went to Surinam(South-America). The climate is tropical and I was there during the rain period. I noticed my skin was doing much better. Soft, glowing, healthy looking, no pimples and not oily. When I returned to the Netherlands it pretty quickly went back to how it was before.\n\n\nRoutine and products:\n\nMorning: \n\nI use a face wash from the brand Neutral for about 1 or 2 years now. It's a foam cleanser. \nIt's an ok facewash, but my skin does get dry after I use it. During winter it's like cracking dry. Right now it's warmer so  my skin doesnt crack, but I feel it pulling if I dont moisturize emediatly.\n\nI've been using witch hazel (pure witch hazel, no alcohol) as a toner for about a month now. I really like it, it makes my skin feel clean and kind off hydrated.\n\nI use the Vitamin E Day Lotion SPF30 from the body shop. I've used this for about 2.5 years I think. It's a very light lotion which I like. I don't like thick creams. It hydrates my skin very well, but it also makes it a bit oily, especially during summer. The main reason I use this cream is because of the SPF.\n\nAbout 2 or 3 times a week I use Freeman Charcoal & Black Sugar Gel Mask & Scrub. This makes my skin feel really soft and clean.\n\nEvening:\nSo I have to admit I often skip my evening routine, but I'm trying to make it a habit to clean my face properly in the evenings.\n\nI use the same facewash and toner.\n\nI also started using Vitamin E oil about a month ago as a \"night cream\". It's just pure vitamin E oil, and I think it works really well. When I put it on my skin feels a bit sticky/oily, but it doesn't really look shiny. And the next morning my skin is really soft and not oily at all.\n\n\n\nQuestions:\nI would like to use a different face wash and day cream, any recommendations?\nI've also been thinking about making a day cream myself, if anyone has some experience with this or advice i'd love to hear it.\n\nI've also read about using Salicylic Acid instead of a scrub. Would that work on my skintype or only damage my skin?\n\nI would love to hear any advice from people with similar skin/problems and the products/routine they use. If you think I'm using the wrong products for my skin pleasy let me know.\n\nI listed the ingredients of my products below, I don't know if it's any help but anyways...\n\n\n\nProduct ingredients:\nNeutral facewash - Glycerin\t,Aqua, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Niacinamide, Sucrose, Cocoate, Sodium chloride, Allantoin, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium gluconate, Citric acid \n\nThe Body Shop Vitamin E daycream - Aqua, Butylene Glycol, Octocrylene, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Glycine Soja Oil, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Pentylene Glycol, Polyglyceryl-2 Stearate, PEG-8 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Phenoxyethanol, Stearic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Palmitic Acid, Parfum, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-t-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Linalool, Adenosine, Citronellol, Myristic Acid, Spiraea Ulmaria Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Buddleja Davidii Extract, Thymus Vulgaris Flower/Leaf Extract, Limonene, Benzyl Alcohol, Crithmum Maritimum Extract, Eryngium Maritimum E x t ract, C i t r i c Ac i d , Leontopodium Alpinum Callus Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum.",

        "body": "I'm not sure what's available to you where you live (I'm in the US), sorry if these aren't helpful! \n\nFor face wash, it sounds like you need something gentle and hydrating. I'd recommend the cerave hydrating cleanser. Look for anything marketed as being gentle or for normal to dry skin. I know you said for oily skin, but if that's how your skin feels after cleansing, cleansers marketed for oily skin may be too harsh.\n\nDefinitely switch to a chemical exfoliant. Scrubs are harsh, and can damage your skin and moisture barrier. I don't have a specific recommendation, but BHA  (salicylic acid) is good for oily skin, pimples, and blackheads. Find a leave on product with 2% salicylic acid. Patch test first, then start by using it once per week and slowly increasing the frequency as needed.\n\nIf you like your moistirizer, stick with it! Not sure about DIY face creams, sorry.\n\nOrder of application (skip steps as needed depending on time of day and day of week): cleanse, tone, exfoliate, moisturize, spf",

I haven't even started to evaluate if any of them are clogging my pores and breaking me out. Or even evaluating texture. I usually hate heavy emollients since I have oily skin in humid country but now I'm willing to try anything that works.\n\nThe products sting my cheeks and tingles my upper lip. The rest of my face feels ok, even my jaws which is usually where my acne is. And so far my skin type has slowly transformed into combo/dry when it was oily before.\n\nPS Vanicream is not available in my country :(\n\nAny advice or recommendations will be appreciated!",

From my own experience I’ve learnt that chemical sunscreens can be veeeery irritating, especially while applied on “tret damaged” skin. And not even they can sting or burn it, I’m not 100% sure chemical sunscreens guarantee good protection (my pigmentation used to get darker and wider, uhhh). These days I’m using a physical sunscreen and I can say my skin colour doesn’t change even if I stay in the sun for 3-4 hours daily. \nThe main concern about a mineral sunscreen is a white cast on the face. Not every one wants to look like a kabuki actor, I guess 😄\nThat’s why I’ve recently switched to Japanese mineral sunscreens. They are mostly waterproof and have sort of a tint so that they give you a natural finish.",

Also same thing with never needing a moisturizer because of the SEA heat and humidity before tret. Currently im using the isntree yam cream as a night moisturizer and i no longer buffer the tret after getting used to it. Maybe look into it? Isntree has an official shop on shopee so it’s p accessible. \n\nRegarding the stinging, personally ive found that products with niacinamide would end up stinging my face on extra sensitized days. I still use a sunscreen with niacinamide because i love the formula but if it starts stinging i know i need to up my barrier care.",

While many people do apply tretinoin around their eyes, this can cause permanent damage to the oil glands in the eyes, and can result in permanently dry eyes. Remember that tretinoin travels up to 2\" below the skin, so you'll still get anti-aging benefits even if you don't apply right next to your eyes. Be safe, and protect your eyes: don't apply tretinoin near your eyes or on your eyelids. [Here's what the Mayo Clinic has to say about safe tretinoin application.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/tretinoin-topical-route/proper-use/drg-20066521#:~:text=Do%20not%20use%20this%20medicine,the%20tips%20of%20your%20fingers) (To learn more, search for \"Meibomian gland dysfunction\")\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "body": "Hey! I have these bumps on my forehead, that are small and skin colored. I’ve tried niacinamide serums, P50, differin, stridex, oils, nothing helped. Last night in a desperate situation, I used two layers of LRP Lipikar Lotion. The bumps are suddenly much smaller, some have disappeared entirely. What could be the cause of this? I read somewhere that Lipikar has a ferment, but I can’t seem to find that information. Here’s the ingredients:\n\nAQUA / WATER • BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER / SHEA BUTTER • GLYCERIN • SORBITAN STEARATE • PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM / MINERAL OIL • NIACINAMIDE • BRASSICA CAMPESTRIS OLEIFERA OIL / GRAPESEED SEED OIL • ALUMINUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE • DIMETHICONE • CERA ALBA / BEESWAX • SORBITAN TRISTEARATE • CARBOMER • SODIUM HYDROXIDE • POLOXAMER 338 • AMMONIUM POLYACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE • DISODIUM EDTA • SUCROSE COCOATE • CAPRYLYL GLYCOL • CITRIC ACID • T-BUTYL ALCOHOL • CETYL PALMITATE • BHT • PENTAERYTHRITYL TETRA-DI-T-BUTYL HYDROXYHYDROCINNAMATE • CHLORHEXIDINE DIGLUCONATE\n\nSo what’s causing this sudden reduction? I don’t want to continue using this since it contains mineral oil and silicones, so I want to find what ingredients help my skin. Any ideas? Thanks!",

Its a preservative in this product (so its used in a really small amount, because its regulated by law) which sometimes used as an \"active\" ingredient in mouthwashes to kill bactetias in the mouth. Btw it has some antifungal activity too, sooo..... Im not a fan of this \"fUnGaL aCnE\" thing, because it seems like everybody has it, everybody wanna have it, but in your case it can be the problem. Just search for fungal acne in this thread for details. (My tip: use nizoral every other day as a mask for 5 min, for six week. Then your skin should be fungus-free. In this six week try to use fungal acne safe products.)",

At the right concentrations, these amphiphiles would assemble into micelles (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_micelle_concentration), which might give you the \"cloudy but uniform liquid solution.\"\n\nMy intuition is that most of the soap would dissolve but that some components would not form a stable suspension (e.g., I would assume the titanium dioxide would settle after some time if there's a reasonable amount of it in the soap). Easy enough to test though :)",

The batch code shows that it is a January 2024 batch date (A14 or something). \n\nI used up a decant that I've had for a couple years now and kept a little so I could compare them side by side. And while they're the same scent, something is different about the new one. Almost as if it's less spicy, pungent? I'm not sure how to describe but it feels like a note is missing entirely. \n\nI've looked up to see if it's been reformulated and didn't find anything specific one way or the other. Is it possibly just that it needs to mature for a bit? The other one was from ScentSplit and have no idea what year that would have been from, 2021 or earlier for certain. \n\nIt could be that it just needs to sit for a month or so after being sprayed for the first time. According to whatever website it used to have lilial in it--which presume it no longer has.\n\nThe current ingredient list is: Alcohol Denat., Water Aqua Eau, Fragrance (parfum), Benzyl Salicylate, Hydroxycitronellal, Alpha-isomethyl Ionone, Coumarin, Limonene, Linalool, Eugenol, Farnesol, Cinnamal, Citronellol, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Cinnamyl Alcohol, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Phenoxyethanol\n\nNot sure if this differs from 2021 or older. I still like it, it's just--slightly different. \n\nReason I'm asking is that if there is a major change, I'd rather return this one in the return window and purchase an older batch. ",

My fiancé is all about clean beauty, and she's been encouraging me to switch to fragrances that don't contain any problematic ingredients. As someone with a newfound love for fragrances and a background in chemistry, I'm eager to delve into this world and find scents that meet her criteria.\r  \n\r  \nThe challenge? Well, I'm finding it a bit daunting navigating through all the ingredient lists. Despite my degree in chemistry, deciphering some of these research papers on specific ingredients has been quite the task. The literature on certain ingredients is enormous. Plus, with ongoing reevaluations of various components, it's tough to stay up-to-date on what's considered safe.\r  \n\r  \nTo give you an idea of our fragrance preferences, my fiancé currently wears Pure - Second Skin, and she used to wear Burberry Blush before she questioned the ingredients. On the other hand, I've been a fan of Aqua di Gio and Boss Bottled. So far, our joint exploration has led us to Clean Reserve - Rain (for myself), which ticks the boxes for cleanliness.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, we're on the hunt for more options! Specifically, we're looking for fragrances that don't contain \"bad\" ingredients like certain UV absorbers (e.g., octocrylene), antioxidants (e.g., pentaerythrityl tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate), or dyes (e.g., CI 17200).\r  \n\r  \nCould anyone here point us in the right direction? Whether it's suggesting clean fragrance brands or offering alternatives to the scents we used to wear, any help would be greatly appreciated!",
