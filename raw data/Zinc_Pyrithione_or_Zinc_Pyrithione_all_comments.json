Personally, having a moderate amount of healthy carbs in my diet improves my hair shedding. I shed so much hair when I was on a low carb diet. My detailed hair growth routine is here:*** [***https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/173ktba/how\\_i\\_have\\_successfully\\_grown\\_my\\_hair\\_back/***](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/173ktba/how_i_have_successfully_grown_my_hair_back/)\n* **Scalp conditions: healthy white scalp, no itchiness, no flakes**\n* **Shampoo routine: shampooing every other day, using Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair every  7-10 days, Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo for the rest of the week.**\n* **Diet and Lifestyle: Mediterranean diet; go to bed before 12; 7-8 hours of sleep everyday;**\n* **Stress management: don't give a shit about things that used to bother me, overall better mood**\n\nHi there, I've benefitted a lot from this community, so I'd like to make some contributions. I was losing an average of 200-300 hairs everyday at the onset of my sebderm. After two months, I'm now only shedding about 90 hairs daily, which is within the normal range. I know that clinically speaking there is no cure to sebderm and it may come back later, but I'm just happy that it's at least under control now. So I want to share this as my SOS protocol. As for long-term maintenance, I'm still learning so much about it from this community.\n\nBackground:\n\n\\- suffered from dry dandruff (large and white flakes) for more than 12 years but never experienced any hair loss\n\n\\- Because of COVID, I developed a bad habit of only shampooing 1-2 times a week (I have an oily scalp and straight hair). On non-wash days, I used a lot of hair products to keep my scalp feeling clean, e.g. scalp serum and dry shampoo. I only found out later that they contained denatured alcohol, which can destroy our skin barrier.\n\n\\- In late Aug, I experienced increased hair shedding of a daily average of 200-300 strands when I usually only shed a maximum of 30-60 strands a day. At the worst point, I was losing 500 hairs when I was shampooing one day. And I almost passed out.\n\n\\- My scalp was tingling, burning, and sore.\n\n\\- I went to a dermatologist in early Sept. He diagnosed me with severe sebderm and folliculitis on my scalp. He said I needed to get my sebderm under control before he could treat my hair loss\n\n\\- My before and after pics (warning: my sebderm was really bad on my scalp): [https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i](https://imgur.com/a/jmhG46i)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSebderm and hair loss:\n\n\\- I was very anxious and depressed about my hair loss because I've always had thick and healthy hair. People always give me compliments on how my hair looks. The point is that I was feeling so much pain mentally.\n\n\\- I consulted other dermatologists. Some said sebderm could cause telogen effluvium because my condition was so severe that it shocked my hair. Some said even though sebderm could cause increased hair shedding, mine was too serious to be caused by sebderm alone. There might be other causes.\n\n\\- But from Dr. Donovan's blog, there is a study that revealed that the more seborrheic dermaitits a person has, the more shedding (telogen effluvium) a person will experience. This tells us that individuals with severe seborrheic dermatitis are likely to have a severe telogen effluvium.\n\n\\- I still went to my family doctor and a naturopath to get blood tests done just to be sure what we're dealing with here. Everything was normal, so I focused on getting my sebderm under control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow I got the situation under control:\n\n\\- My dermatologist prescribed me with clobetasol solution and ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo.\n\n\\- At first, I was reluctant to use steroid. However, the longer my scalp stays inflamed, the more possible damage will be caused to my hair follicles, so I followed my derm's instructions and applied clobetasol to the affected areas daily for 21 days. My scalp was less red but I was still shedding 150-200 hairs a day.\n\n\\- Using the ciclopirox 1.5% shampoo (every other day for 8 weeks, as instructed by my dermatologist) was not very helpful. After much research, I came up with my own protocol that has really helped me get my sebderm under control.\n\n**- What I found is key is that the protocol needs to consist of three components: 1) destroy the biofilm, 2) kill malassezia, and 3) rebuild skin barrier. For each component, there are numerous ingredients/products available.**\n\n**- You can do all three components on a particular day or scatter them around throughout the week, depending on whatever suits your schedule and skin needs. Experiment and observe what suits your skin the best.**\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **on a given shampoo day**: 5% xylitol solution on the affected areas to be left on for at least an hour --> wash it off with an antifungal shampoo --> apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- An example of a three-component routine **in a particular week** (this is what I'm doing now): biofilm shampoo on day 1 and day 3 of the week followed by ciclopirox shampoo on day 5 and day 7. Each time after shampooing, apply a malassezia-safe moisturizer\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 1) destroying the biofilm: xylitol, ACV, and selenium sulfide, MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 2) killing malassezia: ciclopirox, ketoconazole, coal tar, zinc pyrithione, and MCT oil without lauric acid\n\n\\- Some ingredients for 3) rebuilding skin barrier: panthenol (vitamin B5), niacinamide (vitamin B3), glycerin, and aloe vera\n\n\\- Salicylic acid is not anti fungal per se, but it's great at removing the scales, regulating sebum production, and calming down inflammation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy detailed protocol:\n\n**-  I shampoo four times a week: Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide --> Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide OR T/Sal --> Ciclopirox 1.5% Shampoo --> T/Sal (I only use Selsun Blue twice a week for 2 weeks when things are bad because it is very strong)**\n\n**- This protocol is for short-term ONLY, e.g. 2-6 weeks! To get things under control first.**\n\n**- (updated on 4 Jan 2022) As my sebderm is getting much better, I have switched to this gentler protocol, which again incorporates all the essential components, for long-term maintenance. I'm rotating three different shampoos: Neutrogena T/Sal, DermaKB Scalp Detoxifier (biofilm disrupter), and Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Shampoo (contains an antifungal Piroctone Olamine). To hydrate my scalp, I've been using a DIY niacinamide and panthenol spray.**\n\n\\- Selenium Sulfide 2.5% is a game changer for me!! The dandruff/biofilm was finally coming off after 1-2 uses. Antifungals cannot get to the malassezia to do their job if the biofilm is present.\n\n\\- After shampooing, ~~I apply a DIY 3% panthenol aloe vera gel to my scalp.~~ I'm now using this DIY 2% glycerin, 2% panthenol, and 4% niacinamide in water spray.\n\n\\- Avoid ANY ingredient that may feed malassezia (I use a website called Sezia. Simple Skincare Science is also a very good source).\n\n\\- Even though I don't suffer sebderm on any other area, I switch all of my skincare products to seb-derm safe products because my skincare may transfer to my pillow.\n\n\\- I use a silk pillow case to reduce the friction (I can't afford to lose even one more hair).\n\n\\- I change my pillow case every 2-3 days and wash my pillow every week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct recommendations:\n\n\\- What is weird is that a lot of the products that are supposed to be formulated for people with sebderm are not sebderm friendly. They contain ingredients that feed malassezia. There is a useful website called Sezia that I use to check whether a product is safe (not affiliated). This is also the reason I need to DIY the panthenol and aloe scalp treatment.\n\n\\- Products that I like: Selsun Blue 2.5% Selenium Sulfide Shampoo, Neutrogena T/Sal, Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Scalp, dermaKB Biofilm Scalp Detoxifier, Philosophy B5 powder, the Ordinary 100% niacinamide powder,\n\n\\- Products that made my situation worse: Head and Shoulders Royal Oils Scalp Elixir, Inkey List Salicylic Acid Scalp Treatment, Head and Shoulders Clinical Strength 1% Selenium Sulfide\n\n~~- I will be experimenting with a DIY niacinamide and panthenol toner (for rebuilding skin barrier and calming inflammation) and 5% xylitol solution (for destroying the biofilm) and will keep this community updated of my results.~~ After much trial and error, I settle on this DIY scalp toner (2% glycerin, 2% panthenol, and 4% niacinamide in distilled water, which I think is really helpful for calming my scalp.\n\n**- Neutrogena T/Sal shampoo may be too harsh for people with a dry/sensitive scalp, but my oily scalp loves it!!! It helps get rid of the oily buildup and flakes on my scalp while also regulating my sebum production. My scalp is definitely less oily. And malassezia loves an oily scalp because they also feed on our natural sebum.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDiet and supplements (Please see here for a detailed wholistic approach to tacking sebderm: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/rggsrj/a\\_novelwholistic\\_evidenceinspired\\_approach\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/rggsrj/a_novelwholistic_evidenceinspired_approach_to/)):\n\n\\- Daily: Vitamin D3+K2, cod liver oil, ~~reishi, homemade kefir~~, nutritional yeast, ~~MCT oil~~\n\n\\- 2-3 times a week: zinc, magnesium glycinate, and collagen powder\n\n**- What I would recommend for almost everyone: vitamin D3+K2, magnesium, and fish oil.**\n\n\\- Around 60-70% of people in North America are deficient in vitamin D. There are also studies that point to an association between vitamin D deficiency and inflammatory skin conditions such as sebderm. Although this does not mean a causal relationship, taking vitamin D3 overall can help regulate our hormones and immune system. Magnesium and vitamin K2 should be supplemented with vitamin D3. This combo also help me better deal with stress, which is also a trigger of sebderm.\n\n\\- Fish oil supplement helps the body repair the skin barrier. It is also highly anti-inflammatory. But remember to choose a reliable brand. Many of the fish oil supplements on the market are contaminated. Brands I love that are also third-party tested: Nordic Naturals, Natural Factors Pharmaceutical Grade Fish Oil, and InnovixLab.\n\n\\- Probiotics that I've tried and quite like: Garden of Life Dr Formulated, Seed, and Visbiome (not affiliated in any sense; purchased all products with my own money)\n\n\\- Garlic powder supplement and oregano oil capsules daily for 1 week for killing the bad bacteria in my gut\n\n\\- Homemade bone broth for repairing my gut\n\n\\- Gluten-free\n\n\\- No refined carbs at all\n\n\\- No sugar\n\n\\- No dairy ~~except kefir~~\n\n\\- Lots of greens with some meat each meal\n\n\\- Berries everyday (there is a study that revealed a correlation between low fruit intake and sebderm in women). Plus, berries are anti-inflammatory\n\n\\- Avoid using vegetable oil in cooking. Opt for more heat-stable oils that are also low in omega-6s, e.g. extra virgin olive oil, avocado oil, ghee, and butter.\n\n\\- To sum up, the key is to incorporate as much anti-inflammatory food as possible. Some further examples are turmeric and ginger.\n\n\\- What I usually eat: [https://imgur.com/a/nr1JKne](https://imgur.com/a/nr1JKne)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummary of helpful resources/research:\n\n\\- Simple Skincare Science website\n\n\\- Sezia Website\n\n\\- Dandruff Deconstructed Website\n\n\\- Dr. Donovan's blog (He has recently published quite a number of articles on sebderm)\n\n\\- Ceramide insufficiency in sebderm patients ( [https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(07)01771-9/fulltext#relatedArticles](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(07)01771-9/fulltext#relatedArticles)) ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12115025/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12115025/))\n\n\\- Niacinamide increases ceramide production ([http://fagron.lookhere-dev.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Atopic-Dermatitis\\_Nicotinamide-Tanno-O-2000-BJD.pdf](http://fagron.lookhere-dev.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Atopic-Dermatitis_Nicotinamide-Tanno-O-2000-BJD.pdf))\n\n\\- Caprylic and Polygalacturonic Acid Combinations for Eradication of Microbial Organisms Embedded in Biofilm ([https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01999/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01999/full))\n\n\\- Topical nicotinamide \\[i.e. niacinamide\\] for seborrheic dermatitis: an open randomized study ([https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/55117499.pdf](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/55117499.pdf))\n\n\\- Skin moisturizing effects of panthenol-based formulations ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21982351/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21982351/))\n\nFinally, I want to say that there is still hope. Don't give up. I will pray for everyone in this community to regain their health soon!\n\nEdit: I will continue to edit this and add on to it based on my ongoing research and trial and error. And also to add the things that I forgot to mentionEdit: Added some before and after pics and meal idea pics.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have any questions\n\nEdit on 19 Jan 2022: Now my scalp is free from dandruff with very mild redness, itch is very neglectable like only very mild itch every 5-6 days, and I'm shedding an average of 70 strands of hair daily, which is within the normal range of 50-100 hairs daily as advised by most dermatologists. This is my latest weekly routine (I shampoo four times a week): Neutrogena T/Sal Shampoo --> Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Scalp (start with as little shampoo as possible because it lathers very well; too much lather can be irritating to the scalp) --> Phillip Adam Apple Cider Vinegar Shampoo (Fragrance Free) --> Ciclopirox 1.5% Shampoo (available by prescription only; alternatives are ketoconazole shampoo and selenium sulfide). ~~Each time after shampooing, I apply the DIY hydrating scalp spray containing 2% panthenol, 2% glycerin, and 4% niacinamide.~~ No longer using the toner as the shampoos I'm using now are very hydrating and gentle.\n\nEdit on 23 Jan 2022:  I've just stumbled across some substitutes for this DIY spray from a brand called COSRX. Although they are not hair products, the ingredient lists seem pretty good. This toner ([https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/centella-water-alcohol-free-toner](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/centella-water-alcohol-free-toner)) contains panthenol and sodium hyaluronate, which are both good hydrating ingredients. This one ([https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/bha-blackhead-power-liquid](https://www.cosrx.com/collections/toner-mist/products/bha-blackhead-power-liquid)) contains salicylic acid, niacinamide, and panthenol. I'm probably going to try these out soon as I sometimes don't have the time to make the DIY spray. BIG **DISCLAIMER: These are not products formulated for the scalp. Use at your own discretion.**\n\nUpdates on 15 Mar 2022: I'm now using a routine targeted at healing my skin barrier because my scalp is now flake-free but mildly red. Shampooing every other day: ciclopirox shampoo once a week and Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo (if you have a really oily scalp, Briogeo Be Gentle Be Kind Matcha Shampoo may be a better alternative) for the rest of the week. Each time after shampooing, I apply some diluted niacinamide serum from The Ordinary because the original 10% may be too irritating. The study that suggested niacinamide as a potential treatment for sebderm used a concentration of 4%. I also added some panthenol powder to the mixture (at a concentration of about 1.5%), which is completely optional. I'm now shedding about 50 hairs daily.\n\nThe new HA hydrating serum by The Ordinary did not work for me. I tested it on my hairline, then the sebderm migrated to my hairline while my scalp, luckily, is still clear.\n\nUpdates on 12 May 2022: Shampooing every 2-3 days because my scalp is less oily and less itchy. Not using any topical hydrating product because I think my skin has healed so much. Now I'm using ciclopirox shampoo (by prescription only) once a week, and Bioderma Node A Shampoo for the rest of the days\n\nUpdates on 7 July 2022: Shampooing every other day; Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair once a week and Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for sensitive scalp for the rest of the week; taking anti-inflammatory herbs prescribed by a licensed Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner (TCM); shedding 40-50 hairs daily; scalp pretty healthy; incorporated more carbs in my diet because realized a low-carb diet makes me shed more hair\n\nUpdates on 28 Aug 2022: Shampooing every other day; Vichy Dercos Anti-dandruff Shampoo for Oily Hair every 10 days and Bioderma Node A Soothing Shampoo for the rest of the week; been taking the herbs for almost 2 months now. Noticed my scalp is less oily, zero itch now, no flakes, and redness almost gone. There are some days where I'm shedding only 20-30 hairs daily, which is my pre-sebderm level. But I DON'T recommend visiting a TCM practitioner in western countries. Most of them have no idea what they're doing, and the herbs, if not prescribed properly, can cause damage to the liver and kidney. They are also not well-regulated under the law. My diet is lots of cooked vegetables, some berries, some carbs, and some meat. My TCM doctor told me to avoid seafood (except some fish) and beef.",

I may try a Bukuchiol solution first (milder, plant-based retinoid).

    "body": "**If you don't want to read this story, there's a TL;DR at the end**\n\nSo I've been battling with seborrheic dermatitis since I was a little girl. Long story short, my younger brother threw some of our mother's fragrances and essential oils into my scalp (and his own). This was when I was around 8 or 9. I'm 21 now.\n\nMy mother always combated it my mixing some Nizoral (ketoconazole 1% OTC shampoo) with regular kids shampoo. If it was really bad, she'd use the Nizoral whole. She'd use regular products to style my hair (edge control, Luster's Pink Olive Oil, etc) and I'd be good to go. I could use anything on my scalp without issue. As I got older, I used the Nizoral less and less because my scalp was nice and healthy.\n\nThen by the time I hit 16/17, my seborrheic dermatitis started flaring up like hell. I'd wash it like usual and it'll flake up within two or three day of washing. At the worst points, it'll start flaking as soon as my scalp dried.\n\nI tried all the common dandruff shampoos on the market. Head and Shoulders (zinc pyrithione), T Gel (coal tar), T Sal (salicylic acid), and Nizoral. I used each one alone for several months, then tried to alternate between them. I left them on from 5-10 minutes before rinsing. I'd double wash.\n\nI switched to a SLS free shampoo (Cantu Sulfate-Free Cleansing Cream Shampoo). I used a clarifying shampoo (Suave Daily Clarifying). I used all of these shampoos in various combinations.\n\nI went no shampoo; I'd only \"wash\" with water. I tried different water temperatures. I tried filtered, distilled, spring water. Then, I went to using ACV (apple cider vinegar) as shampoo. I tried ACV and baking soda. During senior year of high school, I went to my graduation rehearsal smelling like ketchup because I'd washed my hair with ACV that morning. \n\nI tried washing my hair every day. It would keep the flakes at bay, but it was a tedious process to wash my hair every day and wait for it to dry. It also stripped the hell outta my hair. It wasn't practical. Sometimes I'd have to go to sleep with wet hair. Then, I switched to only washing in the morning.\n\nI tried hot oil treatments: olive oil, coconut oil, mineral oil,  and castor oil either by themselves or in various mixes. I tried to leave in the hot oil treatments, I tried them before washing, I tried them after washing.\n\nI scrubbed my scalp with tea tree oil. I tried various \"dandruff\" shampoos and conditioners. \n\nThen, I finally went to to the dermatologist this year. I was prescribed 2% Ketoconazole shampoo and 0.01% fluocinolone acetonide oil. I used them as prescribed (leave the shampoo on for 5 minutes, wash every 3 days, use the oil after washing). My dandruff got better. I thought it was fixed after I finished the bottle. I switched back to the otc ketoconazole shampoo, and the dandruff returned. I was damned. \n\n*Cue MCT oil*\n\nMCT oil (Medium-chain triglyceride) is derived from coconut oil. *Wait a minute*, you're probably thinking. *Isn't coconut oil bad for dandruff? Won't it only feed the yeast?* Not MCT oil! Sciency science has shown that malassezia  yeast (what causes seborrheic dermatitis) can't metabolize the fatty acids in medium-chain triglycerides. [Basically, we're in the clear to use MCT oil](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10507598)\n\nSo, after washing my hair with the Nizoral, I apply MCT oil to my entire scalp.

        "body": "THANK YOU FOR THIS! I've been suffering from SD for the past 4-5 years, went for a Brazilian keratin treatment and the hairdresser applied it onto my scalp :-|\nIt tingled, but I have high pain tolerance, so I wasn't too bothered.\nThat was until I started becoming allergic to shampoo, and my scalp had acne on it, small to medium sized burning bumps.\n\nLike you, I've also tried 'organic all-natural' shampoos (Moroccan Method, Himalaya, Dermaveen, Dr.Bronner's baby, Burt's bees baby shampoo, Aubrey Organics, god knows what else. FYI I was aware that I'm allergic to fragrance, so most of the stuff I tried were fragrance free and I also tried to avoid essential oils), ACV rinse, JUST WATER, Free & Clear shampoo, coconut oil scalp masks, black soap, and when one day my scalp was actually warm to the touch and burning on the inside, I finally went to the dermatologist. She prescribed me Polytar, which didn't really work for the dandruff, but it calmed my scalp. Did a patch test which shows that I'm allergic to formaldehyde!!! I did read that the Brazilian keratin treatment had formaldehyde in it. (I was also prescribed a scalp lotion called Elosone, which was nice but too lazy to put it on, and a shitload of strong antihistamines which made me very very depressed, so I stopped taking it)\n\nPolytar stopped production about a year I was into it, and I've tried pine tar and other types of coal tar shampoos since. I've been on the routine of alternating between [DHS zinc shampoo](https://www.amazon.com/DHS-300960729165-Zinc-Shampoo-16oz/dp/B0046JOT4O?th=1) and [MG 217 shampoo](https://www.amazon.com/MG217-Psoriasis-Medicated-Conditioning-Formula/dp/B009ZBMVHU) a couple of years ago, this reduced my dandruff about 70%. I only feel the bumps 10% of the time now and it's *nowhere* near as painful as it was. \n\nThat said, I've also been taking [turmeric pills](http://www.vitahealth.com.my/product/proddetail.aspx?act=PI&PID=86) which helps A LOT. I'm usually very sceptical, but my doctor-surgeon parents prescribed it to my sister who has RA, and tried to cook more turmeric-based meals due to the anti-inflammatory property, so I thought I had nothing to lose anyway. WHOO HEY side effects: skin cleared up, no more scalp burning and acne, and 95% dandruff gone (the dandruff is back because I switched to a lower dosage turmeric pill -____-)\n\nCan't wait to get my hands on MCT oil! Coconut oil doesn't even penetrate into my hair and skin so I had a bad impression on it. *continues thanking profusely*\n\nEdit: Fixed abbreviation",

ACV soaks before medicated shampoos can greatly improve their effectiveness. UVB exposure is really effective and probably the most effective IMO. Supplementation with Vitamin D is vital. Dosage is 1,000 IU's per 25lbs of bodyweight. Vitamin D can reduce the over proliferation and turnover of skin cells. Sulfur and selenium are very effective topically as well as internally. Thyroid glandular supplementation or T3 if TSH is over 3. So many things can be done to win the battle of Seb derm. and psoriasis. Having adequate water and lower inflammatory foods is always the best prevention, of course. The nuke that I've found is topical DMSO(50-90%) if it's malassezia overgrowth.

    "body": "I don't know if this post will get any attention, but I wish I could shout out loud so that everyone dealing with acne and more importantly blackheads and rough skin texture can hear it. \n\nI was suffering with acne on the face and back for 20+ years, since my teens. I tried endless number of remedies, lotion, potions... and nothing worked, either at all, or not as much as I wanted. There were the points where I would give up, thinking that nothing can help. Two years ago I saw a Dr. Dray's video on zinc pyrithione (a common ingredient in anti-dandruff shampoos), where she explained in detail condition that many people recognise as fungal acne. She also said that it is more common on the back. Although my acne did not look like fungal, I bought a bottle of Head and Shoulders and tried it. It did not just clear my acne, but also resolved the bumpy texture of my back skin. That is when I decided to try it on the face as well. For a year now I have been using a zinc pyrithione shampoo as a face mask. I apply a thick layer on the clean skin, still damp, wait 10 mins and then rinse. Although it helps with acne (including \"maskne\"), it keeps me free from blackheads on the nose and the chin. \n\nOftentimes I see people ask how to get rid of blackheads, especially on the nose. In my case nothing has been as effective as zinc pyrithione. Using PC BHA liquid every day did a fraction of what I achieved with just an anti-dandruff shampoo. My blackheads are gone, my pores are purified and my skin is no longer bumpy under my fingers. \n\nAs zinc pyrithione shampoos are very cheap, I think it is worth trying for everyone dealing with blackheads. It's effects on dandruff and somewhat on acne is well known and usually talked about, but it may have some effects beyond these. It least speaking from my own experience.",

    "body": "Hi!\n\nAs the title states, I am a doctor who has been inflicted with this disease for over two years. I have never posted on reddit before. But I felt obliged to because I similar to many of you have found this skin condition to be a real challenge to manage. It is incredibly disappointing to find so little evidenced based research on this topic. \n\nI have had dandruff since my teens but have been able to manage it with head and shoulders. About 2 years ago, I noticed a rash developing on my nasolabial fold but didn't think too much of it. I was to consumed with my work and didn't really pay attention.\n\nFast forward to this year and the rash progressed to my forehead and was far more noticeable. I self diagnosed myself with sebderm and followed the NICE guidelines (link below)\n\n [Scenario: Seborrhoeic dermatitis - face and body | Management | Seborrhoeic dermatitis | CKS | NICE](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/seborrhoeic-dermatitis/management/seborrhoeic-dermatitis-face-body/) \n\nI used ketoconazole and hydrocortisone to little effect for around 4 weeks. At this point, I decided to get a private dermatologists opinion on the rash. They concurred that it was indeed sebderm and prescribed additional ketoconazole and a tacrolimus ointment. \n\nThe tacrolimus cream was very effective. The rash after 2 weeks was barely noticeable. After a 6 week course however it gradually started to return. I decided to use the tacrolimus cream twice a week for maintenance. But about two months ago I decided that I didn't want to become dependent on it. I think many patients share the same stance. \n\nThese last three months I have tried a range of products. I attempted using salicylic acid, sebclair cream, zinc pyrithione and miconazole. Tried spending an hour or so outside in the sun (30C). I even tried using manuka honey as many have suggested. Not all at once of course. Nothing worked despite giving each treatment option a decent length of time. \n\n3 days ago, I got myself a bottle of MCT. I would say that for me, the results are comparable to using the tacrolimus cream.  I hope that it continues to work in the long run. I use nothing else but a cetaphil moisturizer. \n\nAs many of you know, there is a very limited understanding of this disease. I find it mind-boggling that certain treatment options are excluded, because there is no evidence for their efficacy when nobody's actually bothered to hold a trial. \n\nDoes diet play a role? Dermatologists don't seem to think so. Based on what? \n\nI intended to post this, just to share my frustration with the community. I don't intend to provide any medical advice from this post.",

My diet was quite clean outside of chips.  But I still suffered terrible SD.  In my estimation, it ain't diet. A crappy diet may not contribute well, but I don't believe it's the source.  But then again, I am very sensitive to sugar.    \n\nI paid $40 bucks on clobetasol nearly a month ago (nizoral also).  Doctor warned me it would tingle very badly and that some patients had trouble handling it (i like this doctor).  There was 0 tingle for me. I was to use it once a week because it can thin the skull.  First time it was great.  But the itch came back so hard I used it again the same week.  Tried to do it like I was told but I could not handle the itch.  Twice a week it is.  SO, I came here and made a bunch of posts loll  \n\nIn my desperation I used white vinegar a few nights ago (apparently a day ago, but I've done it twice and not washed it for today) instead of shampoo.  Amazing results the first time.  Calmed the itch tremendously, hair looked clean and soft.  I used again the next night.  Same results.  I did not wash my hair today and usually I cannot do this because the itch is too intense and hair looks horrible.  My hair today is not greasy, and the itch is there a little, it is not torturing me.  \n\nI'll give this some more time before I am 100% convinced the ingredients in shampoo is what is harming people.  Maybe it doesn't show up until later in life because the scalp gets tired of the long term use.   \n\nClobetasol is still shampoo.",

Currently I am managing it with T/Gel 1% which I apply daily to my scalp and face. I leave it on for my entire shower then rinse it off at the end and while doing so I rub my t-zone with my fingertips rather vigorously to loosen up the flakes, avoiding scratching with my nails. This usually handles most of the problem, then if I still have some flaking in that area, I apply Vaseline petroleum jelly and rub it in. I have tried most of the topical ointments recommended, both prescribed and otc. None of them were long lasting or without some side effect which was typically a burning sensation that would only tend to irritate the skin more.\n\nI do find the possibility of correlated symptoms rather intriguing. Like many, I also suffer from allergic rhinitis, but I have also been diagnosed with CF (cystic fibrosis) which has a long list of potential symptoms, many of which mimic IBS and COPD. I haven't seen any possible correlation between CF mutations and SD though. There is also CF related diabetes, which I currently do not have, but is always a concern.\n\nAt the age of 17 I was also diagnosed with AS (ankylosing spondylitis), though it has either somehow gone into remission or I was misdiagnosed. I do however, have scoliosis and frequent sciatica.\n\nNot sure if any of this is even relevant or useful, but I figure I will toss it all out there if someone wants to dive down the rabbit hole of inflammatory diseasees.",

    "body": "Initial disclaimer: I have zero ties to any of these products. I have spent YEARS and $$$$ attempting to get rid of Tinea Versicolor. Selsun, pills, anti-fungal creams-- you name it, I've done it. I developed the infection as a by-product of intensive beach volleyball training between the ages of 16 and 28. My solution outlined below is the result of years of tinkering.\n\nMy condition: I had diagnosed TV all over my back and chest to the point where the entirety of my chest and back skin was one large block of light-colored, flaky, TV. It worked its way up my neck and down my arms to my wrists and also down to my groin. It embedded itself on the entirety of my scalp, hidden by my hair, and caused terrible flaking and itchiness. It was BAD. I recently stumbled on the solution and am putting it here for the internet to know. Feel free to spread and share or ask questions. I am not a doctor.\n\nPrecursors: Be prepared to spend $200-$300 to rid yourself of this completely. A smaller instance may be solvable with $100-$150. This takes dedication, but I can assure you it is possible without prescriptions. What you save in doctor copays, prescriptions costs, etc will make this a cost savings in the end.\n\nTHE PROCESS--------------------------\n\nStep 1: You must shower a minimum of once per day, you can NEVER miss a day - Shower at the same time each day, and set aside 20 minutes for this required \"ritual\".\n\nStep 2: Wet you hair & skin and then turn the showerhead away from you. Lather into your hair any (generic is OK) anti-dandruff shampoo containing zinc pyrithione. Do not allow this to drip down your forehead as it will need to stay on your scalp here until you reach the rinse (step 5) and you do not want it getting in your eyes. This step is first and necessary because it is the only way to treat your scalp which can harbor TV and allow it to come back even when your skin appears clear.\n\nStep 3: Using a 10% sulfur soap bar, and a maximum strength neem oil soap bar (two separate bars, source wherever you want to) lather your entire body (focusing on affected areas) in soap. Don't forget your neck, and lower face. NOTE: the shower is NOT rinsing your skin right now. You are adding soap to the skin and letting it sit there. NOTE2: sometimes the sulfur soap bar will develop one sandpaper-like side. Use the smooth side, don't destroy your skin.\n\nStep 4: Wait 3 minutes. This feels like an eternity. It isn't. I promise.\n\nStep 5: Rinse completely. Do NOT use conditioner. Do NOT use any other soaps. Step's 2 & 3 strip your skin and prepare it for Step 7.\n\nStep 6: Once you are done rinsing, dry yourself completely... COMPLETELY. (During weeks 1-4 you can NEVER reuse a towel-- one towel per day. It hurts but its the truth, believe me... towels are vectors for reinfection).\n\nStep 7: This is the only product placement here. I do not have any connection with this product, but for better or for worse its the only one that works. Get yourself a 4oz for minimal infection, 8oz for bad infection, 2x8oz was needed to completely clear me up. On Etsy, search for \"Tinea Versicolor treatment\" made by the vendor \"PurePresence\". Mist yourself (a roommate/partner will have to help with your back) on affected areas (light misting OK) and let dry before putting on a shirt. No lotion allowed for weeks 1-4 (your skin will be dry, this is unavoidable but NOWHERE near as dry as with Selsun or prescriptions).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNOTE ON HAIR & GENERAL DRYNESS: Your hair will be dry in the first few weeks. My best guess is that this is due to modern reliance on conditioner. It will pass. Keep your water consumption up and your hair will find a way in the new conditions to be OK.\n\nNOTE ON DIET: I have not had to adjust my diet for this, although I'm sure it would help to eat more \"cleanly\" if you wanted to.\n\nComplete this process for 8-10 weeks until you run out of the spray. I would recommend continuing to wash with these soap bars 4 weeks after the infection is gone. I will likely wash with these bars for 12 months as they are cheaper than the spray and therefore a cheaper maintenance solution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am now over a month completely free of TV for the first time in over a decade (2023 update: I am 3+ years TV free, still using both soap bars when I shower). This process is slow and difficult but I promise that it is better than second-degree burns from Selsun or liver damage from pills. Also, prescriptions like Ketoconazole are far too expensive and only treat small areas. Feel free to ask questions or DM with questions. Best of luck to you!",

I live in NYC but grew up in Scandinavia. I am relatively fit and work out 4-5 days a week at the gym. My dad has pretty severe psoriasis, so my first instinct when I saw the tinea versicolor on me was that I got psoriasis. I saw those red little bumps on my stomach first, and then it started to flare up on my back. I wish I had a photo of it, but my lower, mid and upper back / shoulders was covered. It was pretty bad but it didn’t itch or hurt at all. I just didn’t like the look of it. \r  \n\r  \nI went on a vacation to Puerto Rico for a week where I was exposed to the sun and humid weather. I got a tan, but the areas with the tinea versicolor didn’t get tanned, and this is when I finally went to the dermatologist to understand what it was. The dermatologist prescribed me itraconazole that I took for 7 days. I also got the 2% Ketoconazole shampoo to lather my body with every day plus the Ketoconazole cream to use twice a day. \r  \n\r  \nI followed all these steps every single day, which honestly wasn’t hard for me at all. Taking the pill in the morning right after breakfast. Taking a shower and put this shampoo on my body and let it sit for 5 minutes wasn’t hard. Putting the creme on wasn’t hard either, it’s just something that needed to be done (trust this process). Along with this, I ate very healthy and tried to avoid alcohol and junk and processed food. To be honest, I don’t know if this matters, but remember that TV is a fungus, so it would make sense to eat clean and avoid sugar and carbs to kill the fungus. I also think that eating healthy and drinking plenty of water is great for your overall health, so it won’t hurt to do this so your body can repair itself properly. \r  \n\r  \nSecondly what I did was to wear clean clothes every day. I think this should be common sense even when we are not exposed to TV. I am fortunate to have a washer and drier in my apartment, so I also made sure that I washed my towels and only used my towel once before wash. This might be a bit overkill, but I thought why not. Lastly, the bedding!! Remember that we sleep 8 hours every night, so sleeping in clean sheets won’t hurt. I changed mine twice a week, just to be on the safe side. I would personally recommend changing your sheets at least once a week. I also got a horsehair mattress which is extremely breathable and all natural with only horsehair, cotton and wool. \r  \n\r  \nThis was something I’ve been wanting for a very long time, so I pulled the trigger during this time. They are unfortunately quite pricey, but I got a very good help from a gentleman here in NYC to figure this out. I learned that sleeping on latex and foam is extremely toxic for our skin and it traps heat which again makes the TV flare and grow.\r  \n\r  \nAfter 6 weeks, the TV was completely gone and it hasn’t returned since (6 months now). I was in Miami a few weeks ago for 2 weeks and got a tan and the TV didn’t show up at all. I still try to eat healthy 90% of the time and still change my sheets and wear clean clothes and shower every day etc. I don’t know if that helps to keep it away, but this is part of my daily routine anyway.\r  \n\r  \nAgain, I just wanted to share my story since I was able to get rid of it pretty quickly. I was worried that I was going to have to struggle with this for months and months. Fingers crossed that I won’t come back. I will keep you all posted if it does.",

        "body": "Just wanted to leave a comment here that I bought the spray this user mentioned and it was the first thing I've used that has worked for my tinnea! \n\nSome backstory, I've had tinnea bad for the past 3 years (before that I had it on and off for maybe 6 years) mainly by my sternum down my stomach just past my belly button. Also on my back and it has spread pretty badly in patches all over. I've had almost every pill and cream for it and nothing the doctor has prescribed has helped. I've used the spray for 9 days while I've been on a tropical vacation and I was prepared for the skin to not tan. After the second day of spraying 3 times a day I noticed peeling in the spots I was spraying (mainly on my stomach). On the fifth day of vacation I noticed in spots where I was highly concentrating the spray my skin was quite red. Keep in mind I've been in the sun tanning and I've been applying 60spf to the areas without tinnea and 15-30spf with tinnea.   \n\n\nNow I am back from my vacation and the tinnea on my stomach officially tanned however it is still not as dark as the rest of my skin. I am fair skinned but I do tan so I know the tinnea is getting killed off as the tinnea spots are darker than my skin not shown to the sun.   \n\n\nSome tips I wish I did: the areas of tinnea that are almost matching the rest of my skin I sprayed a lot in those areas and then rubbed into others so make sure you concentrate on each spot. I should have had someone spray my back because my stomach looks better but my back doesn't. Also, if you are spraying after being in the sun it will burn as the skin there is quite tender since it hasnt had sun in almost 6 years. Also I did not do the other tips this user recommended I simply just used the spray.  \n\n\nOverall, it was expensive to buy (about $130 CAD) but I would HIGHLY recommend trying because nothing has helped.",

    "body": "Foreword: I'm making this post because I commented in a thread a while ago about how I had low-grade, super stubborn fungal acne for a long time and a lot of users replied that they may have it as well (based on symptoms) and it never before occurred to them that it was a fungal, and not bacterial, infection. So, I'm trying to include as much info as possible to help people that may be in the situation that I was before. I apologize in advance that I don't have before and after pics, but I'll link to a blog that does. Please let me know if I've forgotten anything or made any mistakes, and feel free to share your fungal acne stories!\n\nObviously I'm not a doctor so if your symptoms are getting worse or you're in pain or you have anything else that should be sending you to the doctor JUST GET OFF THE INTERNET AND GO TO THE DOCTOR\n\nFirst of all, having fungus on your skin is totally normal (as gross as it sounds) as it is part of the natural flora of your skin composition. The most common type of skin fungus is of course yeast, and as you know (since I think this sub is mainly women) when it grows out of control it can cause a yeast infection, typically in the vagina, where it is warm and moist. The type of fungus that most commonly results in acne-like pustules on your skin is called *Malassezia* and the resulting infection is known as *Pityrosporum folliculitis*. \n\nThe reason why we get yeast infections is because there is not enough \"good\" bacteria present to use up the resources that both bacteria and yeast utilize, so when yeast out-competes \"good\" bacteria, it takes over and wreaks havoc ranging from low-grade irritation all the way to something as severe as seborrheic dermatitis. Other fungal infections you may be familiar with include athletes foot/jock itch, ringworm and tinea versicolor.  \n\n**How can you tell if you have it?**\n\nIf you're willing to go to the doctor/derm, there are tests they can run using live cultures generated from your skin swab. This is the most sure-fire way to get a diagnosis as well as potent prescription anti-fungals. \n\nIf you are an armchair physician like me and don't care about experimenting with OTC creams on your face, you can grab some at-home treatments (listed below) to see if your skin improves.\n\n**Some of the associated symptoms with *Malassezia* overgrowth include:**\n\n* Small pimple-like bumps that have small whiteheads which small amounts of pus will come out of (AFAIK cystic acne is less common but still possible with this type of infection). They typically occur in your T-zone but can appear on cheeks as well and are usually clustered together and around follicles. i.e. it's damn hard to differentiate it between regular acne, and the differences are quite subtle.\n* Rash/pain/tenderness/itching/burning sensation - can lead to seborrheic dermatitis - these are some symptoms that should be sending you to the doctor anyway.\n* Redness\n* Closed comedomes that don't turn into open comedomes and will just crust over if you pick at them.\n* Pimples that don't respond to traditional acne treatment i.e. benzoyl peroxide, and take a long time to disappear.\n\n**What not to use if you suspect fungal acne**\n\nMalassezia and other strains of fungus typically [feed on oils with a fatty acid chain length of 11-24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1198797/pdf/biochemj00724-0062.pdf). This is also why fungal acne often appears in areas where sebum production is higher than other parts of the body. So, obviously avoid using oils that are in this range - [here is a somewhat reliable chart (the URL kinda sketches me out but it seems accurate, but do some more digging if you're not convinced)](http://www.scientificpsychic.com/fitness/fattyacids.html). FWIW coconut oil has a very long chain length and is considered safe for fungus treatment. \n\nEdit: From /u/SnailsonAcid It helps to look up images of the chemical structures of the ingredients in potential products, and counting the number of carbons in a carbon chain. For example, if an ingredient has a carbon chain length of 7, the chemical structure will have something that looks like this VVV. Skin prone to fungal infections have sebum deficient in ceramides. I can't use most bb creams as they often have ingredients with long carbon chains, but have had some success with Liole triple the solution.\n\nAnother thing to avoid is creating an extremely moist environment on your face (which I know goes against everything this sub stands for, but if you want to get rid of fungus you're going to have to be a bit drier than normal for at least a month). This means no occlusives, mainly. You can use a hydrating toner before treatments, but **avoid toners/essences with ferments in them**. Even though it's a ferment filtrate, it can still activate specific receptors on yeast cells that will trigger the growth of more yeast.\n\nAvoid anything containing any types of sugars since yeast eats sugar. I know honey is a potent anti-microbial but I think the amount of sugar in it would negate those effects. \n\nAntibiotics will also increase your risk of getting fungal acne. I strongly believe these are what caused my bout of fungal acne, but sometimes they are an unavoidable part of life. Just be wary that if you do have to take antibiotics, future fungal infections are more likely. \n\n**What to rub all over your face when you have fungal acne**\n\n(obviously **patch test** these things if you haven't used them before because they can induce an allergic reaction or worse. Also, a lot of this is anecdotal and worked for me during my struggle with fungal acne so obviously YMMV.)

Anything containing zinc is usually good, but check for other fungal triggers in the product)\n* Tea tree oil (general antimicrobial, dilute in a carrier oil)\n* Diluted apple cider vinegar (yeast doesn't do well in an acidic environment, they prefer pH 4-8)\n* Sulphur (I used a zinc/sulphur soap on my face alternately with ketoconazole wash)\n* Ketoconazole (a.k.a.

I also use Selsun Blue alternately with Head and Shoulders as regular shampoos to make sure the yeast infection isn't spreading to my scalp and hanging out there, only to re-infect my face. \n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is to make sure you wash your towels and pillowcases regularly so you don't give the fungus another place to live. Drying your clothing in a dryer on \"high\" and disinfecting as much of your skin care bottles and tools with alcohol is also another way to help prevent re-infection.\n\nHere's a link to a blog where a woman had a pervasive and relatively severe fungal acne infection, she has some before pictures that are similar to what I had (although mine didn't get quite that bad). http://longhairedatheart.blogspot.ca/2013/11/yeast-had-caused-my-bad-skin.html",

        "body": "I definitely have this, diagnosed at the derm, and have a little insight. The carbon chain thing you pointed out is super important in finding suitable skincare products. It helps to look up images of the chemical structures of the ingredients in potential products, and counting the number of carbons in a carbon chain. For example, if an ingredient has a carbon chain length of 7, the chemical structure will have something that looks like this VVV. Skin prone to fungal infections have sebum deficient in ceramides. Some products that I've used successfully (after going through a ton!) include albolene (non-AB), BR P50, shark sauce, snowbang, Benton snail bee high content skin, diluted ACV, and eltamd am (non-AB). I can't use most bb creams as they often have ingredients with long carbon chains, but have had some success with Liole triple the solution. Hope this helps anyone who may be struggling with this as it definitely makes skin care much more challenging! \n\nEdit: forgot to mention, MCT/fractionated coconut oil is outside of the carbon chain range and can be safely used!",

        "body": "This was me just this past September. Mine started on my jawline and temples then moved to my neck, chest and upper back. I don't have terribly reactive or acne-prone skin so it was weird to see (especially my neck). The itchiness was my tip off that something was up and different from the pimples I've had before. I sort of diagnosed myself but did see my derm who wasn't positive what it was and when I told him my suspicion he agreed it could be. He gave me a script for Diflucan and said to keep up with everything I was trying. \nI did quite a bit of research, more than I would have had I not gotten involved in this sub (Thank You!!!) which sparked a desire for knowledge of ingredients and such. I found quite a lot on the internet that I didn't really understand but was able to piece some stuff together & just started trying different products/ingredients. \nHead & Shoulders, Selsun Blue & Nizoral: the H&S seemed to work the best for me. I tried them all on my face but also switched using them as body washes. I switched them up because I read the yeast can build a tolerance to things. \n\nSulphur: I found a bar soap, Sal 3, and also a mask (Dr. Gross Collidal Sulpur). Both of these I still use & they work great! (I think the soap has some salicylic acid in it too)\n\nNeem oil & MCT oil: both of these do not have long chains. What I found suggested staying away from all oils that had long chains which includes coconut oil & tea tree oil. The yeast feeds on it as well as fatty alcohol. I still use a diy mixture of these two as my oil cleanser and sometimes I use a few drops towards the end of my routine if my skin is feeling dry. The smell of neem is very strong and very earthy. I'm used to it now but I had to start with a tiny bit mixed with the MCT and just build up to more. I love these and have a hard time seeing myself not using them. \n\nSalicylic acid: great product that I believe helped quite a bit too. I ended up trying a product of my bf and saw a difference. Bought some for myself to put in a spray bottle for my chest & upper back. That's when those little bastards finally started going away!\n\nOnce I realized it was starting to subside I slowly introduced different products back in, partly to see if I would have a flair up and partly because I desperately needed hydration in my skin! So much of the above is quite drying, which really is what I was going for! Dry out the \"food\" for the yeast and get it back to a normal level. I'm still playing around with actives in my routine because of the over-drying I did. If I use them too often I seem to get extra dry & flaky. I did recently see someone post about buffering actives & that is definitely helping.",

I'm not sure if it was a combination of things, one particular thing, or if it was just mere coincidence, but here's what I did (in chronological order):  \n\n- 50mg doxycycline (antibiotic) 2x a day for 6 months - prescribed first by my Curology derm, then my GP  \n- Curology - 1% clindamycin, 8% Azelaic Acid, **1% Zinc pyrithione** (started on the basic 4/1/4 formula and changed to this)  \n- Head & Shoulders Shampoo (**1% zinc pyrithione**) & Nizoral Shampoo (**1% Ketoconazole**) alternating, follow with regular 2nd cleanser - also use on scalp & hairline in the shower. Do not underestimate these guys - they are actually kind of lovely, non-drying cleansers for the face XD    \n- Deciem The Ordinary 10% Niacinamide, **1% Zinc PCA**  \n- **Tretoin 0.025%** Cream 4x a week (prescribed by my GP) - I believe this was doing the bulk of the work as I started to see drastic improvement immediately  \n- 8 week course of Fluconazole (anti-fungal pills, prescribed by my Curology derm) - not sure if this did anything bc I started it around the same time as the tret, but my acne hasn't come back since I finished the course, even when I didn't use tretinoin or any other acne treatments for a week while traveling  \n\nAnother important thing was that I stopped using all other acne treatments, masks, and sheet masks during this time, aside from the occasional use of a pink powder (sulphur) spot treatment for particularly bad breakouts. My derm recommended I stay away from otc treatments like salicylic acid, retinol, etc. because they may cause more irritation than improvement, which turned out to be the case for me. I cut down to a very minimal routine, aside from the listed above - Re:cipe Slowganic Cleanser > Thayer's Toner > Cerave PM > Cosrx Aloe sunscreen. No oil cleanser, just micellar water to remove makeup. I've also been avoiding oils and alcohol like the plague, as this can aggravate or \"feed\" fungal acne. I've also tried Noble Soap, which was recommended by my Curology derm, but it broke me out in cc's so didn't work for me. I much prefer Head & Shoulders & Nizoral for this.    \n\nAnother important thing that has really been a game changer is to **tie your hair while you sleep** (I do a top bun bc it's more comfortable) - this minimizes the oils from your hair getting on your face during the night, and of course changing/flipping your pillowcases often is important too. This has really helped clear/prevent breakouts on the sides of my face.    \n\nHope this is helpful to somebody!",

My damaged moisture barrier has resulted in me experiencing fungal acne for 4 months now. I find that Nizoral shampoo along with an anti-jock cream like canesten has really helped when I get flare ups, but I don't want to have to rely on these for the rest of my life.  I've also read that resistance can be built up against the active ingredient which would be Ketoconazole and that's worrying to me.\n\nI'm trying to repair my damaged moisture barrier, but I'm really not having luck.  Like you said, ceramides are deficient in the sebum when you're prone to fungal issues so I'm trying to load up on my ceramides. I currently use clinique ddmg, but my skin dries up so quickly after that.  I recently introduced a hyaluronic acid serum that has ceramides from GOW that contains a preservative \"lactobicillus ferment\".  Does anyone know if this will trigger the fungal acne? \n\nI'm also looking at purchasing Meishoku Ceracolla Perfect Gel and ElsaGusa Ceramide Moist Essence.  Anyone with fungal acne used these products before?  It doesn't look like there's ferment in the ingredients, but I could be wrong.  I'll list the ingredients at the bottom of this comment if anyone wants to take a look. It's incredibly frustrating to have to deal with severely dehydrated skin and fungal acne.  One needs a ton of moisture to resolve it and the other one wants none of it.  I have no idea how to approach my problem.  I'm only 23, but my pores look incredibly massive, I have deep wrinkles on my forehead and under my eyes, my skin gets tight and feels like paper immediately after moisturizing, and itches like crazy all due to my dehydration.

    "body": "This isn't the post I wanted to write, but it's what I've got so far. I hope this helps with the current wave of acne questions. \n\nNote: I do not include prescription treatments. I do mention retinoids, but Differin is OTC now.\n\n***\n\n**Antibacterial:** aka kills acne bacteria.\n\n+ Benzoyl Peroxide is the biggie. Kills the bacteria, it won't ever become resistant to BP, reduces inflammation, keeps dead skin cells from building up, and can enter pores. *Usage Suggestion:* 2.5% has been shown to work pretty much as well as stronger formulations and works great in short-contact therapy. So, to make BP as gentle as it'll get: apply 2.5% for a few minutes or so and wash off. Yay!\n\n+ Azelaic Acid is surprisingly cool too. 15% has been shown [equally effective](http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/16281587) as BP, and might have [similar results](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11701404) to 0.05% isotretinoin (both studies linked used AA + antibiotic fyi).\n\n+ Other Great Stuff: Sulphur, neem oil, tea tree oil, salicylic acid, and blue light therapy. \n\n**& Antimicrobial** in case you wanna prevent that kind of colonization. Benzoyl peroxide and maybe tea tree oil will help you.\n\n\n**& Antifungal.** Avoid those nasties with neem oil. And probably stuff I'm forgetting. Edit: zinc pyrithione, thank you /u/mastiii!\n\n\n**& Antiseptic:** Wanna reduce the possibility of infection?\n\n+ Neem oil and tea tree oil as above, plus perilla and karanja oil. Be warned, I'm getting most of that info from Garden of Wisdom and not peer-reviewed science.\n\n+ Zinc. An [underrated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4120804/) little baby. Zinc sulfate that can prevent acne at 5%. There's a not-very-readable list of products [here](http://cosdna.com/eng/stuff_prod.php?in1=62d146399) but I believe you need to log in first.\n\n\n**Anti-inflammatory** stuff to prevent pores from getting *extra* clogged and icky.\n\n+ Salicylic acid, azelaic acid, neem, tea tree and perilla oil, zinc - we went other these already.\n\n+ Retinoids! Differin is the only one available OTC, but it's less irritating than tretinoin. It works extra well with the addiction of antibacterial agents.\n\n+ Niacinamide is something you should be taking a good, long, hard look at. It's [been](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23786503) [shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7657446) to be as effective as 0.1% clindamyacin (prescription antibacterial). It also suppresses [sebum production](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14764170600717704?journalCode=ijcl20) at only two percent and promotes wound healing. Plus a [ton more stuff](https://www.google.com/search?q=A+Review+of+the+Range+of+Effects+of+Niacinamide+in+Human+Skin&oq=A+Review+of+the+Range+of+Effects+of+Niacinamide+in+Human+Skin&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64l3.279j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).\n\n\n\n**Bacteriostatic:** salicylic acid, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide. These prevent bacteria from reproducing so rapidly.\n\n\n**Comedolytic:** benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, retinoids. What it sounds like, prevents comodos from forming.\n\n\n**Keratolytic** stuff prevents dead cell build-up and softens keratin (good for dry skin).\n\n+ Urea has been written about [far better](https://simpleskincarescience.com/urea-for-skin/) than I ever could. The tl;dr is it's hydrating, exfoliating, and helps your skin [be better](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3352965/). It also makes people really, really pretty.\n\n+ Sulphur has keratolytic benefits, antibacterial ones, and antiseptic ones. It works for acne (I have a figure of 2% but no idea from where...) as well as psoriasis and eczema.\n\n+ Plus the good ol' standards, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and retinoids.\nsulphur\n\n\n**Sebostatic** is a really cool category. These good 'uns help regulate and/or reduce sebum production. They include: benzoyl peroxide, niacinamide, retinoids, and zinc. Surprise, surprise. \n\n**Other Stuff I Haven't Sorted:**\n\n+ Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (SAP), a vitamin c derivative, helps acne. I didn't write [this post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/sodium-ascorbyl-phosphate/) either.\n\n+ The sebum of people with acne has been shown to have higher than usual levels of oleic acid, which is kind of goopier. Using oils high in linoleic acid (rosehip, borage, evening primrose, and a tooon more) might help to sort of dilute sebum into a freer-flowing substance. \n\n***\n\n**Super TL;DR**\n\n- Antibacterial: neem oil, tea tree oil, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, sulphur, azelaic acid, blue light therapy\n\n- & Antimicrobial: tea tree oil possibly, benzoyl peroxide\n\n- & Antifungal: neem oil, zinc pyrithione\n\n- & Antiseptic: neem oil, tea tree oil, perilla oil, karanja oil, zinc\n\n- Anti-inflammatory: neem oil, tea tree oil, niacinamide, adapalene/retinoids, salicylic acid, azelaic acid, perilla oil, zinc\n\n- Bacteriostatic: salicylic acid, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide\n\n- Comedolytic: benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, retinoids\n\n- Keratolytic: benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, sulphur, retinoids, urea\n\n- Sebostatic: benzoyl peroxide, niacinamide, retinoids, zinc",

Don't hesitate to ask me anything!\r  \n\r  \nI will begin answering your questions on April 05th, 2024 at 8pm ET.\r  \n\r  \nVisit the r/FungalacneSkincare subreddit (post your story with photos) for more personalized skin care suggestions and skin counseling.\r  \nAsk away! 🍄✨\r  \n\r  \nPS: I wanted to address some of the questions that were asked in the previous post\r  \n\r  \n“How can someone tell if it's fungal acne?”\r  \n\r  \nFungal acne usually  appears as small clusters of bumps and pimples on the face, chest, and back. Some of the common signs are itchiness and inflammation but they are not usually painful. Some individuals do not experience itchiness. That heavily depends on your skin and how your immune system reacts to yeast overgrowth. \r  \n\r  \n“Fungal nail conditions are notoriously hard to treat. Is fungal acne the same?”\r  \nNot really. Once you know you have fungal acne the treatment is fairly easy. An antidandruff shampoo with antifungals such as ketoconazole or zinc pyrithione usually works in getting rid of the fungal breakouts. The only problem is that the antidandruff shampoo treatment tends to be quite drying on the skin, especially if you are trying to treat fungal acne on the face. That is why it is recommended to use a fungal acne-safe skincare.\r  \n\r  \n“Doxycycline was a miracle treatment for me and OTC options.” \r  \n \r  \nDoxycycline is an antibiotic used to treat acne vulgaris, commonly known as topical acne. It will not treat fungal acne, it might actually make it worse. Sadly, there are no substitutions that could be found OTC, at least not in America. The best OTC treatment that might help will be sulfur or tea tree oil. However, the effectiveness of the treatment might be reduced since you will be changing from an oral medication to an over-the-counter topical treatment.  \r  \n\r  \n“Does candida albicans play a role in fungal acne?” \r  \n\r  \nWhen we talk about fungal acne we are talking about a folliculitis (a hair follicle infection) caused by the yeast Malassezia. This tends to look similar to topical acne, hence the name. On the other hand, a candida infection, rather than acne-like bumps, looks more like a rash which can include blisters. We call a candida infection on the skin “cutaneos candidiasis”. Although candida can also be found within the skin microbiome, when we talk about fungal acne or pityrosporum folliculitis we refer to those pimples and breakouts that look like acne but no acne treatment can seem to help, which are caused by an overgrowth of Malassezia. \r  \n\r  \n“What is fungal acne? Is it a ploy of skincare brands to sell more products?”\r  \n\r  \nPityrosporum folliculitis, commonly known as fungal acne, is a yeast infection caused by a yeast called Malassezia. It commonly appears as small clusters of pimples and bumps on the face, chest, and back. Is it a real thing? Sadly, yes and ironically the increment in cases have been attributed to the excessive utilization of ingredients containing fatty acids. \r  \n",

    "body": "Hi all -- I have been  a pretty religious ABer for about 15 months now. I have always been very helped by this sub as well as the Snailcast ladies (SnowWhiteandtheAsianPear, Holy Snails, Fiddy Snails, and Fanservicedb). I wanted to leave some hopefully helpful reviews for people.\n\nMy skin used to be combination, closed comedones on forehead, some of cheeks, hormonal acne on chin every month, redness on cheeks, redness and hyperpigmentation after breakouts, sensitivity to many products. I live in Austin, TX. I'm 28. I'm white/Jewish. I have neutral toned skin.\n\nNow: skin is on the drier side (thank to all my actives) if I don't moisturize properly, no more acne ever, no more redness, learned I am sensitive to silicones! (so almost all problems have gone away)\n\n**First Cleansers**:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBanila Co. Clean It Zero Purity: what is there new to say? It's really good, it's great for sensitive skin. It's nice that it's a balm so you can let it sit on your face for a little while to dissolve makeup or grease or sunscreen. It's kind of hard to use in the shower; it's better to apply it on dry skin with dry hands (I think it's significantly more effective that way). I went through three tubs, but will not be repurchasing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Rituals Namasté Cleansing Oi](https://www.rituals.com/en-us/the-ritual-of-namaste-cleansing-oil-1101155.html)l (not AB): This is a really nice AB-inspired product. It's my first oil cleanser, and it has a nice, relatively weak smell. It's definitely a lot easier to use in the shower, but less comfortable than a balm to let sit on the face. It contains Lotus and Avocado and a number of oils (olive, sesame, sunflower, avocado, moringa, sunflower, macadamia). I have never had an issues with sensitivity to it, but it might be a problem for those who can't use anything with fragrance at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Second Cleansers:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHada Labo Rohto Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Cleansing Foam: for me, it's the best. again, not a lot to add to the conversation, but it's definitely the least drying of everything I've tried. Super basic, does the job. Nice foam, no smell, good price (HG)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHeimish All Clean Green Foam Cleanser (pH 5.5): ick. this is awful! SO DRYING. broke me out. I hate it. One of the only things I've straight up thrown away without finishing or giving to someone else. WNRP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCosRX Low pH Good Morning Cleanser: I...thought I liked this until I tried other things. It's just too drying for me and left my face tight. It now lives in the second bathroom for guests. Probably more appropriate for people with oily skin, but I honestly think it's just too drying for most people to use daily. WNRP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Exfoliating/Misc Cleansers:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water (not AB): for me this is perfect for the morning. I use it on a cotton pad every single morning and it's perfect to take off anything from the night without being remotely drying. I highly recommend it and will repurchase forever (HG).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSon & Park Beauty Water: I actually really like this. I know many people think it's stupid, but I like to use it after my micellar water if I am putting on actives (it's pH balancing), and it just makes my face feel good. It's also really good at removing stubborn makeup. It smells nice. I'm not sure it does anything important but it makes me happy and maybe that's enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTosowoong Enzyme Powder Wash: I bought this as a cheaper alternative to the AmorePacific one. It's.....fine? The granules are pretty big and it doesn't feel very appropriate for sensitive, acneic, or similar types of skin. I usually try to start the foaming process on my hands first so that I don't rub the hard granules directly into my face which helps. Not sure I'd recommend to most people, but it is cheap (\\~$7).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmorePacific Treatment Enzyme Peel: This is honestly really lovely for an enzyme wash (which I wanted to try), but it is also $60 at Sephora, which is just unreasonable to me. I have have it for almost a year to be fair, but I just don't use it all that often since I prefer actives rather than scrubs. If you have the money though, this is great! The granules are small and gentle, and it creates a really nice foam and leaves my face insanely soft. It isn't too drying, although I would avoid using it with a lot of other actives in your routine. If you need just a weekly enzyme treatment, it's a really good option, and it will last you for a LONG time this way. It also dispenses one \"dose\" at a time, which is nice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Masks:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOle Henriksen Hygge HydraClay Detox Mask (not AB): an ok clay mask. It's pretty moisturizing if you need that in a clay mask. I actually like it a lot, but now that I've discovered AB alternatives that are cheaper, I will stick with those. It is really great for dry skin though. Soothing texture, medium thick, won't pull out all the moisture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInnisfree Super Volcanic Pore Clay Mask: my preferred AB alternative due to price. It goes on super thin and dries quickly which is convenient so a tub lasts awhile. It's not too drying. The texture alone though makes it a great buy. I use it for the Fiddy Snails \"pore reducing\" method. RP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSkinfood Black Sugar Strawberry Mask Wash Off: It's nice. It smells good. It's definitely not a great option for very sensitive skin due to the granules, but it leaves your skin SO SOFT. I probably use it once a month (again, I'm super into actives). It's not an HG for me, but I imagine it's nice for people who like smelly things, cute things, or have oilier skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSkinfood Rice Mask Wash Off: Ahh so lovely. It's just soothing and it feels great on  your face. A much better plan for sensitive skin, due to texture and smell. I'll probably repurchase, but it's not an HG or anything like that. Nice for when you want to do something self-care-y, or you want to gently remove dry skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMalin + Goetz Detox Face Mask (not AB): a foaming mask à la Elizavecca. it's nice. It's fine. It's way too expensive. Fun if you have $$ to spend. Leaves skin a little drier than I would prefer, but it's a \"high end\" product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Actives (yay!):**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRohto Melano CC: I wanted to like it so bad. It broke me out so bad. I am sad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDear, Klairs Freshly Juiced Vitamin C Serum: It's just boring and not really effective so I passed it on to my boyfriend (hah). It did not break me out, but nor did it really do anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Ordinary Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate 10% (not AB): This is the first Vitamin C I used that made a HUGE difference (currently testing some stronger stuff). It almost completely eradicated my freckles (which was weird to be honest), but daily usage got rid of tons of brown spots, evened out skin tone. I honestly think this is a great, unsung product! High recommendations! (I used it daily -- AM)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Make Up Artist's Choice BellEvolve Lac-Luronic Serum](https://www.makeupartistschoice.com/BellEvolve-Lac-Luronic-Serum_p_291.html) (not AB): amaaaaaaaazing AHA. HG for sure. I can use it daily (After a little skin training) due to its inclusion of hydrating ingredients. It's an absolutely wonderful strong alternative to Sunday Riley and much cheaper. GO GET IT. seriously. This plus CosRX completely eradicated all my closed comedones. I literally did not believe that could happen. It's beautiful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCosRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid: HG for me. I also use it daily with no issue (again, after a little training). It's just wonderful, not too drying as long as you properly moisturize. I adore it. Also one that has been written about a lot so not going to say much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion (not AB): well...I wanted to try a retinoid and so there was this. It definitely works. I'm hoping it will help with my fine forehead lines and smile lines. It's definitely drying so you need to add a lot of moisture but obviously it's no tret. I use it at night a few days a week. I still love it and will rebuy. Maybe will try something stronger one day, but I'm a little scared.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSunday Riley Good Genes All-in-One Lactic Acid Treatment (not AB): it's honestly an HG magic potion but it's expensive AF so I turned to the above choice which does almost as well. I still will love this forever. My skin was like a radiant sun the morning after. Wish it was cheaper.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution: This is terrifying looking but nice! I use it once a month, and it's hard  to tell how amazing it given that I already have a lot of actives in my routine, but I think it's a good option for people who want an acid punch every so often and their skin can tolerate it. Skin is left suuuuuuper smooth and plump after. WRP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurology (zinc pyrithione 0.25%, niacinamide 4%, azelaic acid 4%): I think Curology is super cool. I like my cream a lot. I kind of want to replace it with other products, but I use it when I want an alternative to my cabinet of actives. My formula is definitely not super strong, but if I am lazy and just slab some on before bed, my skin always looks great in the morning. It's also nice for traveling to bring fewer products along.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCosRX Natural BHA Skin Returning Emulsion: I bought it before I knew what I was doing. Worthless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FTEs**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMissha Time Revolution First Treatment Essence Intensive Moist: I thought it was great until I tried other stuff, but it was a nice place to start. Definitely helped products absorb better and had some brightening affects. Meh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecret Key Rose Starting Treatment Essence: same as above, it was fine. Helpful, but not overly so. Meh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNaruko La Creme Face Renewal Miracle Essence: THE BEST. HG. I loove this FTE. It makes everything soak in incredibly. It is SO brightening for me and makes me feel radiant. I pat it on with my hands and one bottle lasts forever. It's also on sale a lot on the Naruko US site, but I have bought it from eBay too. Truly a wonderful product. Not good for those with fungal acne I believe since it has ferments. But seriously, check this out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Hydrating Toners**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDear, Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner:  It's distinctly fine. It hydrates. It does an ok job. It did not break me out. I find it deeply boring and not especially great, but also not harmful. Meh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIsntree Hyaluronic Acid Toner: A little bit of an improvement over Klairs. I sometimes put two layers on and I like the viscous texture. It's also not magical but it does the job of hydrating fine. I will not repurchase. I know some people really like it so if you like trying out new hydrating toners, this is worth trying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHada Labo Gokujyun Premium Lotion (Hyaluronic Acid): HG. I know I know everyone and their mother loves it, but it is perfect. I only do one layer but it just works SO well. A lot has been said about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Essences/Serums**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Ordinary Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA (not AB): I think this is a good product. I wanted a brightener, I bought this since it was a good price and it did fine. I liked until I discovered ---->\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNaruko Raw Jobs Tears Supercritical CO2 Pore Minimizing & Brightening Essence: this one! Omg, it is absolutely amazing. HG forever. It is seriously magical and makes me glow. I adore this essence and I kind of hoard it. It has a nice slightly viscous texture and soaks in well. I wish the glass bottle was larger because it doesn't last as long as I would prefer, but it is a GREAT product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCosRX Advanced Snail Mucin 96 Power Essence: also HG for me. It really soothes my redness and is a great thing whenever I am feeling dry at all. A lot has been said about it. I like it very much\n\n&#x200B;\n\nScinic Honey All-In-One Ampoule: another HG for me. I'm not sure if it's being discontinued though because I can't seem to find it most places and just ordered a new bottle off eBay. It is SO hydrating and delicious. It smells good, it feels great, and leaves my skin deeply hydrated and plump. Really a wonderful product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHoly Snail Shark Sauce: broke me out A TON. nope.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Moisturizers/Occlusives**:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFresh Lotus Youth Preserve Face Cream with Super 7 Complex (not AB): so this was my HG for many years before I got int AB. It does have silicone low down on the ingredient list and it never bothered me. I still think it's my favorite non-AB moisturizer, but it's a bit $$.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDr. Jart +: Cicapair Tiger Grass Cream: This honestly is a greasy mess but it's wonderful if you have difficult angry red skin. It saved me during allergy season last year and it's great for repairing. I would not wear it outside though due to grease factor. Great for red people!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRosette Ceramide Gel: it broke me out and I'm sad. Will probably retest in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBenton Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel: Also broke me out and I'm not sure why.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDear, Klairs Rich Moist Soothing Cream: I really like this stuff. It has a great texture, it dries down well. I like to try new creams, but I think this is very solid product and I have repurchased. I would highly recommend giving it a try if you're silicone-sensitive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInnisfree Green Tea Fresh Cream: Oh dear. So this is a tub of gel. It smells. It's shiny...but at least it doesn't break me out! So there's that. Definitely never again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInnisfree Jeju Sparkling Moisture Cream: Also broke me out and I'm not sure why. I wanted to like it. It smells nice. It feels nice. Too bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEtude House Soon Jun 2x Barrier Intensive Cream: This is just thick and goopy. It doesn't feel good and if I use it too much it starts making closed comedones. Not a fan. WNRP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEtude House Soon Jung 5-Panthensoside Cica Balm: Another one that is just WAY too thick, does not absorb and starts creating CCs. Nope.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA'Pieu Sea Buckthorn Cream: this is such a solid product. I'm not sure it's magical but it's a really lovely cream without silicones that dries well and is cheap. That's a lot going for it. I am currently trying out some new stuff, but this is a solid choice for those of us who can't use silicones.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEtude House Soon Kune 5-Panthensoside Sleeping Pack: This just...gives me acne if I use it nightly which sucks. It's perfectly fine if I use it once every few days, but not optimal. I can't use most sleeping packs so I'm still looking for a better option. WNRP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSulwhasoo Overnight Vitalizing Mask: dear god broke me out SO BAD. Now it belongs to my mom. It makes her happy. Probably for the best since it's $$\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStratia Liquid Gold: also so much breaking out. Definitely never again. No.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGarden of Wisdom Black Current Seed Oil: really great! Seriously. perfect in winter. No breakouts. Check it out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sunscreen**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNivea Sun Protect Super Water Gel SPF 50/PA+++: drying and acne. Trying to pawn it off on other people in my life at the moment who don't wear enough sunscreen\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCanmake Mermaid UV Gel: HG forever the end. I should probably wear it more often.....>.>\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Foundation (so difficult if you can't wear silicones!!)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHera UV Mist Cushion: HAHAHA I didn't know about my silicone problem and it was acne hell. HELL.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMilk Makeup Sunshine Skin Tint (not AB): it's really nice. light. feels good. doesn't break me out. I don't makeup very often but I like this one a lot!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBareMinerals Complexion Rescue Tinted Hydrating Gel Cream (not AB): another solid choice. my skin is so nice now after this year that I don't ever want thick foundation and this can still be used with a beauty blender and gives a nice clean glow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToo Faced Hangover Replenishing Face Primer (not AB): a great primer for silicone-free people! It's not like profoundly mattifying or anything but it works and we have so few options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMilk Makeup Blur Stick (not AB): pilling. pilling. did I mention pilling? No silicones though and mattifying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sheet Masks I Like:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnnie's Way Black Rose Devils Moisturizing Secret\n\nBNBG Vita Genic Relaxing Jelly Mask\n\nElizavecca Honey Deep Power Ringer\n\nEtude House Ceramide\n\nEvercos Luxury Bogam Herbal Clinic Mask - Licorice\n\nEvercos Luxury Bogam Herbal Clinic Mask - Ginseng\n\nIlli Camellia Oil Nourishing\n\nL'Herboflore Ceramide Complex Moisturizing Silk\n\nLeaders Amino Clearing\n\nLovemore Loofah & Aloe Vera\n\nLuLuLun Sweet Drop Nature Care\n\nMamonde Rose\n\nMamonde Hibiscus\n\nMaskingdom Chinese Medi Roseroot & Liquorice\n\nMediHeal Vita Lightbeam\n\nMy Beauty Diary Liposome Hyaluronic Acid\n\nMy Beauty Diary Black Pearl\n\nMy Beauty Diary Squalene\n\nMy Scheming L-Ascorbic Acid\n\nMy Scheming Hot Spring Water Moisturizing\n\nMy Scheming 7-in-1 Brightening\n\nNaisture Tea Tree\n\nNaruko Rose and Botanic HA Aqua Cubic Hydrating\n\nNaruko Snail Essence Intense Hydra Repair\n\nNaruko Magnolia Brightening and Firming\n\nNaruko NRK HA Hydro-Lock Moisturizing\n\nNature Republic Aqua Collagen Solution\n\nPapa Recipe Bombee Honey Mask\n\nTosowoong Pure Green Tea\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sheet Masks I Don't Like:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCosRX Holy Moly Snail Mask\n\nEtude House Hyaluronic Acid\n\nIlli Mugwort Calming Mask\n\nJayJun Rose Blossom\n\nJM Solution Water Luminous S.O.S.

        "body": "Whoa those are a lot of products for 15 months! Thanks for the reviews :)\n\nI feel like it's hard for me to tell when or if I break out from a product since I would sometimes get a random breakout that isn't confined to a specific part of my facr anyway. I've also read that it can take up to a few weeks to see results from a product – be it an amazing glow or crazy bumps or horrible breakouts, which again adds to the whole dilemma of like, how do I know if this is just the regular breakout, or if it's from that product, or if it's maybe from that cake I ate or sth :/ \n\nI actually have been using the same products for almost a year now because of this. Like I would try adding new stuff but I would get a breakout, usually not straight away, and I would get paranoid about it being from that new product and cut that out again.\n\nAll is to say.. *how* are you able to use so many products and tell if one is breaking you out??

        "body": "Very helpful! Thanks for the list! I am restocking a lot of my routine and your skin seems pretty similar to mine so I am going to try a number of the products that you said worked for you.\n\nI agree that balm style cleansers are hard to use in the shower for sure! I usually don't shower at the same time I oil cleanse (I only oil cleanse 1x day, at night) but when I do, what I do is turn on the shower, then standing at the sink with dry hands I rub my balm cleanser on my face first & massage my eyes a little to release waterproof mascara. Then I blindly step into the now-warmed-up shower to rinse it off & wash my face with 2nd cleanser. I haven't fallen and hurt myself yet!!\n\nAnyways .... since you found balms a little less convenient, it might be that liquid oil cleansers just fit your habits better-- but if you ever want to re-try balms I'd make 2 more recommendations for you: either Aromatica Orange Sherbert or Farmacy Green Clean.\n\nAromatica is a #1 amazing product, the 180 mL jar is humongous and aggressively priced (even w/the Banila \"large\" 180mL, or \\~20% cheaper).  I find it gets mascara off 100x better than Banila and rinses more easily. I like Farmacy Green Clean even better -- small jars are available for $$$ at Sephora so it's quite easy to try/access -- but I haven't decided whether it's really worth 2-3x the price.... sigh.\n\nAs for Curology, I love mine too!! It's well priced imo and nice to get all the stuff they will put in there for you. I personally started on the formulation you have! I always recommend it to my family. Getting on their cream subscription solved like a 2 yrs straight acne breakout issue for me.\n\nThanks for listing all the sheet masks you've tried rq in such an organized format!!!! As a person who rarely sheet masks, whenever I try a new one, I always feel like I'm picking at random because so many exist and it's so hard to find opinions.  Great post :)\n\n&#x200B;",

I know this topic has been discussed many times before, but my problem showed up after a YEAR of constant use, it wasn't an immediate reaction. The Hada Labo products were my HGs! I used the Premium, Moist and Light lotions depending on the climate and my skin needs. I also used the Premium and Moist Milks and the Perfect Gel. I loved all of the products as they were giving me the best skin I ever had! One day, out of the blue I started breaking out in small pimples all over, which is the reaction other users have reported as well. Tried cutting out other products from my routine, but the breakout didn't stop until I cut out the Hada Labo products. I waited a week for my skin to calm down to reintroduce the lotions and got the same breakout, this time an immediate reaction overnight! The breakout was all over my face, eyes, neck, chest area, everywhere the product has been applied to. Tried introducing the products a third time with the same outcome and gave up. I am now trying to use them up on my legs as this is the only area of my body that doesn't break out from them. To this day I cannot pinpoint what caused this delayed reaction. Some say it's the alcohol, but it can't be as I use other lotions containing it and don't get that reaction, plus I would expect for my skin to react to it straight away, not wait a year! Also, the Light lotion doesn't contain alcohol and I still breakout from it. Some say it's the hyaluronic acid, but again, I use other products containing it without issues. Now, I am trying to find a lotion that comes even close to the Hada Labo's effect, but no luck so far.",

    "body": "A lot of people seem to have trouble with dandruff and fungal acne that don't improve significantly even with treatment, and I find (like with a lot of skin-related issues) TECHNIQUE counts for a lot more than we realize. So, this is the method that showed results for me, regardless of whether I used Head & Shoulders or Ketoconazole shampoo or whatever. It's the TECHNIQUE 😤 \n\n⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** please, do not use anti-fungal ingredients like ketoconazole without doctor's orders and supervision. Those ingredients are to be used for a specific duration, and you will meed medical guidance to use them safely, or risk anti-fungal resistance, aka it stops working and now that ingredient itself doesn't work for you at all. OR stick to OTC products with ingredients like zinc pyrithione, like Heads and shoulders, etc.\n\n\nSimply washing your scalp or face once with the shampoo will show almost zero improvement in most cases. A \"double cleanse\" is NECESSARY, because the fungus creates a coating, or \"biofilm\", to protect itself and stay on the skin. We have to chemically dissolve that biofilm first, for the active ingredient to actually penetrate and treat the infected skin 🧐\n\n\nThe \"method\" is simple, and I call it a double cleanse, because it's the same principle as a double cleanse for your face. The first wash is to remove dirt, oils, buildup, sweat, etc. The first step is cleaning. The second wash is to LEAVE ON, so the skin is saturated with the active antifungal ingredient. This is the actual treatment. \n\n\n#1. Cleanse\n\nWash your scalp thoroughly. You can use ANYTHING for this. Any shampoo will do. Even soap works, arguably better, because the alkalinity really breaks up the biofilm of the fungus. I used a tiny bit of soap for my fungal acne (face and chest) initially, just to make sure my skin was \"stripped\". I now use Head and Shoulders (the silky black variant, which is their \"plain\" option). \n\n\nThis is sort of like when dermatologists \"degrease\" your face with alcohol or acetone before a chemical peel. It removes any oils that can block the treatment, and dehydrates the skin slightly, so it absorbs it even deeper. \n\n\n#2. Treat\n\nTake a 50 paisa coin-sized amount (if you remember how big that was 😂 Half the size of a rupee coin!) of your dandruff shampoo and lather it up well, between your palms. Spread it on your scalp (or face) thoroughly. If you have longer hair, you may have to section it a bit to access your scalp properly. Remember, you're only treating your SCALP, not your hair. \n\n\nOnce it's applied all over, wet your fingers if you need to, or put a little water on your scalp, and MASSAGE thoroughly. You have to keep the skin WET. If it dries out, it's not penetrating properly. Once the lather is massaged in well, leave it on for however long the bottle suggests. I did ten minutes initially, now I do five. Depends on the severity of your condition. \n\nWash it off with cold water for best results. This way the treatment, which penetrates the top layer of the skin, STAYS on the skin. Hot water would wash it out somewhat. And heat in general really encourages the fungus, so avoid hot showers, if possible. Keep it coool! 😌❤\n\n\n#3. Condition\n\n+ **Using conditioner** - If you have dandruff, it's easiest to skip conditioner entirely. Almost all of them have ingredients that will feed the fungus. If your hair is long, and you have to condition it, only do the ENDS. Whatever you apply to the ends WILL TRAVEL up the wet hair shaft through capillary action, and it shouldn't touch the roots and scalp. So do the ends of your hair, up to chin level and no further. If you have frizzy hair higher than that, use a bit of gel (aloe gel works, so do hair gels) when your hair is dry, but AVOID THE SCALP 😡\n\n+ **The totally fungal-safe option** that has worked very well for my curly, frizz-prone hair for over two years now, is to take a few drops of fungal-safe oil (MCT oil, C8 oil, or mineral oil, like Johnson's Baby Oil), rub between the palms, and apply to WET hair, right after washing. Start from the roots, go up the lengths, avoid the scalp. The wetness allows the oil to spread evenly in a thin layer... instead of just creating oily patches in your hair 😅 It leaves the hair soft and smooth, since it seals in moisture, and the emollience of the oils works to smooth down the cuticle. \n\nI prefer this method over using conditioner, and would recommend even those who don't have dandruff to give it a try 🤷🏽‍♀️ It's simple and very effective. \n\n\n+ If you have fungal acne on your face, follow up with a fungal-safe skincare routine ([my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) here was about this) and be careful not to over-moisturize your skin. If your skin gets dehydrated, it needs more water, not oil - try a hydrating step, like serum, toner or mist. \n\n\n# My experience\n\nIt took about a month for this technique to show significant results for me, but you might see faster improvement. \n\nSCALP: The first week, I washed my hair alternate days, then afterwards settled into a maintenance of twice weekly washes, that still continues to be my routine to this day 😌\n\nFACE: I used this technique every day for three or four days (at night) then did alternate nights for a week or two. Then did once a week, or as needed through observing my skin. Following a fungal-safe routine was key to resolve and maintain my skin health. At this point, I don't have to use this treatment on my face anymore, I just stick to fungal-safe products and have no issues ☺ \n\nI hope this clarified things! It's worked really well for me, and I hope it's useful to y'all, too. \n\nEDIT: Super happy to share [this post by u/owlet09](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/j2q4rr/appreciation_post/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) who cleared up her chronic dandruff using this method! 😆\n\n2022 EDIT: Having gotten my dandruff under control to my derm's satisfaction, I still felt that my scalp health was iffy, and came to the conclusion that my scalp was being repeatedly dehydrated and therefore overproducing oil. Like my own teenage self with acne! 😂\n\nWhat I do now is - after every wash, I mix a generous amount of aloe gel with a dash of glycerin and five or six drops of MCT oil. I apply it on my scalp for the most part, using a comb bottle, and put the excess on my lengths (all on very damp, unfortunately stripped and squeaky hair). I let it sit under a shower cap (so it won't dy out) for at least ten minutes, then rinse. \n\nKind of a gel scalp and hair pack ☺ It's reduced the oiliness of my scalp, and I don't get itchy around my next wash day any more! 😆🙏🏽 My lengths are also well conditioned this way, without feeding the fungus.\n\nApril 2022 EDIT: A wonderful addition to my routine - I oil my scalp with MCT oil and hour or so before shampooing. I use a dropper to get it onto my scalp, massage the leftovers on my ends (short hair) and shampoo as described above. \n\n... I think the oiling also works to dislodge dead skin and loosen everything up. Basically like oil cleansing, a deeper cleanse 🤔 Afterwards, I use the aloe gel and five drops MCT oil on wet scalp and ends. I don't feel the need to add glycerine or rinse it out, so it's like, a leave in conditioner with very light hold. Nice soft results, and I'm very happy ☺\n\n⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** Since making this post, I've learned some new information that has changed my perception and usage of the term \"fungal-safe\". I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️",

TWO HOURS. when the other seems spent a max 10 minutes after waiting for an hour just to give me the standard. \nListening to everything. Asking details about everything. Analyzing all the pictures and all the timeline. Analyzing my face and my scalp.\nOne thing that I thought was interesting is she scratched my arm and my skin reacted a lot and raised a lot, which turned out to be a part of the problem. \nWithout me even saying my prior diagnosis she said that I have:\n\n1. Pityrusporum folliculitis\n2. Sensitive dermatitis\n3. Periorbital dermatitis \n4. Seb derm on my scalp  \n5. Histaminosis \n6. Maybe a minor minor case of pp rosacea\n\nShe then spent an extra 30 minutes completely looking through all my current products and reading all the ingredients, asking me to discontinue anything that could lead to the problem, asking me if I was sensitive to any ingredients, which I am, and substituting current products for others that fit my skin needs. \n\nI had completely lost hope that maybe I had an incurable rosacea but this is the first time in a year that I feel hopeful that I might get a handle on this. \nThis is what she prescribed:\n\n1. Stop my current moisturizer, switch to maleszia (which she had at her office and gave to me for free)\n2. Ketoconazole shampoo/facewash and zinc pyrithione shampoo/face wash to use AM mon/wed/fri, 2x the zinc and 1x the keto \n3. A mixture of ivermectin, metronidazole and niacinimide for AM\n4. A mixture of azelaic acid and niacinimide for PM\n5. This foam thing to put along my hairline and eyebrows to help with inflammation and yeast overgrowth \n6. A new sunscreen \n7. A round of itriconazole (anti fungal), 100mg 2x a day for 2 weeks\n8. Levocetirizine 5mg to take daily for 3 months to make sure my histamine doesn’t act up and create inflammation while we’re treating this\n\nShe said my case was very complex and had many moving parts and that she is treating me while making sure the diagnosis is correct. \n\nAnyway moral here is, trust your gut. I knew it wasn’t just rosacea but was accepting it because so many dermatologists had told me. I am so incredibly happy I found my new dermatologist. Here’s to hoping I finally get this under control! ",

I've had an oily, itchy scalp that starts to smell bad 12 hours after washing and always thought this was normal. I tried all sorts of things - tea tree oil shampoos, apple cider vinegar rinses, making sure my hair was dry before going to bed, and while I was living in the UK, Head and Shoulders. Nothing worked, scalp was always problematic.\n\nI moved to the US, and bought Head and Shoulders because it was the only shampoo available at my grocery store at the time. After about a week of use, I noticed my scalp wasn't as itchy and my hair didn't smell bad even after 24 hours and felt more voluminous. Turns out the US version of Head and Shoulders contains zinc pyrithione, and ingredient which is banned in the EU and UK. This ingredient is an antifungal and antimicrobial, perhaps that explains why my scalp doesn't smell anywhere near as bad now. I'm happy I've finally found something that works, is cheap and is easily available at most stores. I haven't tried other options like ketoconazole or coal tar and perhaps they would have worked. Also I'm not a H&S salesperson, just want to share what's worked for me.\n\nTldr: If you have an itchy smelly scalp, try a shampoo that contains zinc pyrithione. Head and Shoulders in the US contains this ingredient.",

    "body": "This whole post is YMMV.\n\nI have extremely oily skin making it so that my sebaceous filaments (SFs) will pretty much never actually go away. This may or may not be related to Seborrheic Dermatitis and having a generally fungal prone skin biome which leads to a gunky buildup.\n\nUnlike some posts on here that nitpick every imperfection down to barely visible SFs, what I've personally dealt with are SFs that *hang out* of the pore. They look like little white flakes and can be plucked out with tweezers, leaving a small, empty pore. I have them on my nose, cheeks, chin, upper lip, and eyebrows. Basically, my whole t-zone except my forehead.\n\nYou can see examples and the whole B&A process in pictures here (TL;DR): [https://imgur.com/a/8LqiWlJ](https://imgur.com/a/8LqiWlJ)\n\nI've discovered a method for removing these that's quite different than the 50-shades-of-snail whatever. I don't know if this method will work for anyone else, as oily skin behaves differently when it comes to gunk buildup and clogged pores.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nThe core of this method is *disrupting* what Tom Busby, a frequent poster on [Rosacea.org](https://Rosacea.org) forums before Reddit was around, calls the \"biofilm,\" which is a yeast-y fungal buildup related to Seb Derm. This is the guy FC from [simpleskincarescience.com](https://simpleskincarescience.com) took his inspiration from. Tom Busby was way ahead in synthesizing his own fungal-safe moisturizers.\n\n**Step 1**\\-Exercise\n\n\\-I don't know why, but my SFs are extremely visible after exercise, especially if I sweated heavily. I'm guessing the salt content breaks down the biofilm once it dries, and then is washed off in the shower.\n\n**Step 2**\\-Wash with 2% Zinc Pyrithione soap\n\n\\-You can get these from Amazon. I personally use the Dermaharmony bar, but most of them are formulated the same, using oils. While these oils aren't fungal safe and will feed the Malasezzia yeast, I don't find the soap problematic at all. I leave it on for 1-2 min. This further disrupts and clears out the biofilm to make the gunk more visible.\n\n**Step 3**\\-Dry face and exfoliate with fingers\n\n\\-After my shower, I dry my face and hands on a clean towel. Then, I take my fingers, and start swiping over all the visible gunk. All the buildup starts to form and clump together, very similar to when a product \"pills.\" Again, all I'm using is my fingers, usually swiping downward lightly, to pull the gunk from my pores. I do this for around 1-2 min.\n\n**Step 4**\\-Hydrate\n\n\\-This method is not irritating to my skin at all, which is pretty sensitive. You can see in the pictures how immediately clear my pores are on my nose compared to before exfoliating. I don't think it removes the gunk completely, because I'm not left with the same empty pore as if I'd plucked the SF, but it removes the *visible* part, and that's all I care about (I'll never get rid of them fully, my skin is too oily).\n\nMy skin is *so* smooth after doing this, but it's a little tight. Not red or damaged, just tight, so I use a hydrting toner and moisturizer. I will be gentle with it all day and use no actives that night.\n\n**Step 5**\\-Repeat weekly\n\n\\-There are probably additional preventative steps you could take, but I'm fine doing this once a week. SFs are natural, I just hated how visible and acneic mine were. I do this every Sunday after exercising in the morning, and find that by the next Sunday, my gunk has reappeared enough for removal.\n\nWith this method, **my pores stay gunk and flake free for about 3-4 days.** It might last longer for you, or it might not work at all, but the soap is $12 w/ shipping so it's pretty cheap. If you SFs aren't \"hanging out\" like mine, I'm not sure they'll be malleable enough to be \"pilled\" on your skin.",

    "body": "I picked this up from Landers for P749.95 after seeing that it's a Japan-exclusive variant of Head & Shoulders. What really caught my attention was the piroctone olamine in the ingredients instead of the usual zinc pyrithione. Piroctone olamine is a gentle anti-dandruff ingredient that's much milder than zinc pyrithione, making it a great option if you want something effective but less harsh on the scalp. \n\nFor context, I don't get dandruff anymore, but I still use Head & Shoulders a few times a week to control oil production. My go-to is the Old Spice variant because of its scent. I also wash my hair daily since I hit the gym often and sweat a lot. \n\nMy Thoughts: \n\n● Less Drying - Compared to my usual H&S, this one doesn't leave my hair feeling as dry. \n\n● Smooth and moisturized - It makes my hair feel soft and refreshed but not heavy. \n\n● Great scent - It has a spa-like fragrance that I really like. \n\n● Gentler formula - Since it uses piroctone olamine, it's less harsh than other Head & Shoulders shampoos but still keeps my scalp fresh. \n\n● Helps control oil - Even though it's milder, it still does a great job at keeping my scalp from geting greasy without over-drying. \n\nI honestly just bought this to try, but I love it! If you're looking for a milder anti-dandruff shampoo that still works and helps with oil control, this is worth checking out :) \n\nP.S. They also have a treatment that pairs with this",

Types of Hair Problems (3 Main Areas)\n\nAll common hair problems fall into one of these:\n\n1. **Hair Roots (Hair Below the Scalp)** – Hair fall, thinning, reduced density\n2. **Hair Strands (Hair Above the Scalp)** – Dryness, breakage, roughness\n3. **Scalp Issues** – Dandruff, oiliness, itching, inflammation\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 🧠 2. Hair Root Care – Stop Hair Fall & Grow Stronger Hair\n\nHair fall starts when hair roots weaken or hair becomes thinner. If ignored, it leads to visible scalp and low density.\n\n🛑 **Step 1: Block DHT**\n\n* **Finasteride 1 mg/day** (tablet or topical): Blocks DHT (main reason for male hair loss).\n* Recommended if hair loss is **Stage 2 or more** on Norwood scale.\n\n**💉 Step 2: Improve Blood Flow to Hair Roots**\n\n* **Minoxidil 5%**: Increases blood supply to hair follicles, delivering more nutrients.\n* Apply once or twice daily.\n* For very early hair fall (Stage 1–2), some doctors prefer starting with **caffeine-based or peptide serums** first.\n\n**💊 Step 3: Provide Proper Nutrients**\n\nEven if blood supply increases, without the right nutrients, hair won’t grow strong. Include:\n\n|Supplement|Benefit|\n|:-|:-|\n|**Biotin**|Strengthens hair strands|\n|**Multivitamin (with Zinc, Vitamin D, and B-complex)**|Fixes hidden deficiencies|\n|**Omega-3 or Fish Oil**|Reduces inflammation, nourishes follicles|\n\n**🧪 Step 4: Peptide-Based Serums (for Root Stimulation)**\n\nThese serums contain **plant-based peptides and natural growth factors** that help activate weak or resting follicles without the side effects of stronger medications.\n\n|Serum|Key Ingredients|Benefits|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Redensyl**|DHQG + EGCG2|Activates hair stem cells, reduces hair fall|\n|**Capixyl**|Biomimetic peptide + red clover|Strengthens follicles, reduces inflammation|\n|**Anagain**|Pea sprout extract|Extends hair growth phase (anagen)|\n|**The Ordinary Multi-Peptide Hair Serum**|Blend of multiple peptides|Boosts density, nourishes scalp|\n\n✅ Best used **once daily** on a dry scalp. Can be combined with microneedling (1–2x/week) for better absorption.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 💇‍♀️ 3. Hair Strand Care – Improve Hair Texture, Strength & Shine\n\nThis is the visible part of hair above the scalp. You need to:\n\n**🧴 Use Hair Oil (Carefully)**\n\n* Oil gives moisture and reduces breakage.\n* But **avoid putting oil on the scalp** too often — it can cause dandruff or feed fungus.\n* Apply oil **only on the hair length**, 1–2 times a week, and **wash off properly**.\n\n**🧼 Use Conditioner (Not on Scalp)**\n\n* After shampoo, apply conditioner **only on hair strands** to reduce dryness and tangles.\n\n**💆 Use Hair Mask (Deep Conditioning Treatment)**\n\nHair masks are like super-conditioners. Use them 1–2 times a week to:\n\n* Deeply moisturize dry hair\n* Make hair soft, smooth, and shiny\n* Reduce frizz and split ends\n\n🧴 Choose masks with ingredients like coconut oil, argan oil, shea butter, keratin, or aloe vera.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 🧴 4.

Hard Water vs Soft Water\n\n# 🔹 Hard Water (contains high levels of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals):\n\n* **Effects on Hair:**\n   * Leaves behind mineral deposits on hair strands.\n   * Causes **dry, rough, dull, and brittle hair**.\n   * Can lead to **more hair breakage and tangling**.\n* **Effects on Scalp:**\n   * **Clogs scalp pores**, leading to dandruff or scalp acne.\n   * May cause **itching or irritation**.\n   * Reduces the effectiveness of shampoo and conditioner (hair doesn’t feel clean).\n\n# 🔹 Soft Water (low mineral content):\n\n* **Effects on Hair:**\n   * Makes hair feel **softer and smoother**.\n   * Helps shampoos and conditioners work better.\n   * Prevents mineral buildup, making hair **shinier and more manageable**.\n* **Effects on Scalp:**\n   * Gentle on the scalp.\n   * Helps maintain **natural oil balance**.\n\n# 🌡️ 2. Water Temperature\n\n* **Hot Water:**\n   * Strips natural oils from hair and scalp.\n   * Can cause **dryness, itching, and frizz**.\n   * May weaken hair roots over time.\n* **Cold or Lukewarm Water:**\n   * Retains natural oils.\n   * Helps **seal the hair cuticle**, making hair shinier and smoother.\n   * Best for the final rinse.\n\n# 🧪 3. Chlorinated Water (Swimming Pools)\n\n* Damages the hair shaft.\n* Causes **dryness, discoloration (especially in colored hair), and split ends**.\n* Irritates the scalp and worsens **scalp sensitivity or dandruff**.\n\n# ✅ Solutions if You Have Hard Water\n\n* Install a **shower filter** that removes minerals and chlorine. (or use filtered water from water purifier only for hair wash)\n* Use **chelating or clarifying shampoos** once a week (they remove mineral buildup).\n* Rinse with **apple cider vinegar + water (1:4 ratio)** to remove residue.\n* Apply **deep conditioning masks** to restore moisture.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# # Is Finasteride Safe? Can You Take It Without Doctor Consultation?\n\n**Finasteride** (commonly used for male pattern baldness at **1 mg/day**) is generally **effective and relatively safe** when taken correctly - but **it should NOT be taken without a doctor’s consultation**, especially for long-term use.\n\n# 🔍 Why You Need Doctor Consultation\n\nFinasteride changes your **hormone levels** by reducing DHT (dihydrotestosterone), the hormone responsible for hair loss. Since it alters your body's chemistry, a doctor should:\n\n* Assess if it’s safe based on your medical history\n* Decide the right **dose** and **form** (oral vs. topical)\n* Monitor side effects and hormone balance\n\n# ✅ Is Low-Dose Finasteride (1 mg/day) Safe?\n\nYes, **low-dose Finasteride (1 mg/day)** is considered **relatively safe for most healthy adult men**, especially under medical guidance. In fact, this is the **standard dose** used to treat androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness).\n\nBut even low doses **can have side effects**—though not everyone experiences them.\n\n# ⚠️ Common Side Effects (in 1–10% of users)\n\n* Low libido (reduced sexual desire)\n* Erectile dysfunction\n* Reduced semen volume\n* Breast tenderness or enlargement\n* Depression or mood changes\n\nThese are often **mild and reversible** if the drug is stopped.\n\n# ⚠️ Rare but Serious Risks\n\n* **Post-Finasteride Syndrome (PFS)** – Persistent sexual, neurological, or psychological symptoms after stopping (very rare, still debated)\n* Gynecomastia (male breast growth)\n* Severe depression or anxiety (in rare cases)\n\n# 👨‍⚕️ Who Should Avoid Finasteride Without Supervision\n\n* People with **liver issues**\n* History of **depression or sexual dysfunction**\n* **Those planning to conceive soon** (Finasteride may affect sperm in rare cases)\n* **Women and children** (especially pregnant women)\n\n# 🔍 Monitoring Required If You Take It\n\n* **DHT levels** (optional, but helpful)\n* **Liver function tests**\n* **Prostate exam** (PSA levels can be falsely lowered)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n#

Hair growth takes time — it can take **3–6 months** to see noticeable changes. Stick to your routine consistently and monitor with photos every month.\n2. If hair fall continues despite trying these steps for 6+ months, consult a dermatologist or trichologist to rule out underlying causes like autoimmune conditions, alopecia areata, or scalp disorders.\n\n(After seeing how many people struggle with hair problems and lack clear information, I took the time to research deeply, consult doctors, and gather everything I could. This comprehensive guide is the result of that effort. I hope it helps you in your hair care journey.)\n\n(used gpt for help)\n\n(let me know if I have missed anything, I am trying to make a complete guide for hair care)",

Allow me to correct it from using what is proven and in accordance with my knowledge. \n\nA) In section 1. Types of Hair problems. The root cause of both hairloss, hair thinning, breakage and Density is all causes by DHT. DHT is a useless harmone in adults which is converted from testosterone (good harmone) with an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase (5AR). So all those problems are solved by Finasteride which is 5AR1 inhibitor.\nRegarding scalp with dandruff and flaking problem - 1% ketoconazole is enough. \nAnd that is all \n\nReferences:\n\n1) Shin J, Chung E, Kim M, Kim T, Kim W, Huh C.

This is all you need to solve all the problems mentioned in section 1. \n\nB) Bloodflow Theory - This theory stated a century ago that bludflow restriction caused by wearing tight hats and creating tension in scalp is the reason for male pattern baldness. this theory has been overused till this day to sell Nonsense products. This theory has been debunked over century ago (1916) by Dorothy Osborn. \n\nReferences : \n1) Osborn D. INHERITANCE OF BALDNESS. Journal of Heredity. 1916;7(8):347-355. doi:10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a110746\n\n2) Nor does wearing Hats or Helmets cause any damage to hair. Here is the study : \nTellez-Segura R.

When it is not FDA approved, companies can put anything in it without having to disclose the proper composition. So it's best to avoid them or take FDA approved vitamins. Imo just finasteride is enough to solve all hairloss problems. \n\nD) Microneedling does not work as a standalone treatment nor is it safe as a long term usage. it is observed in 3 studies that Microneedling combined with  topical 5%minoxidil has more efficacy than just standalone microneedling and topical minoxidil. This is because the efficacy of minoxidil increases due to channels in epidermis caused by microneedling. \nThere is no standardized protocol for microneedling, so anyone can just dismiss the ineffectiveness of microneedling using No-true Scotsman falacy even when there is compelling evidence to prove otherwise. \nBasically Microneedling is causing inflammation in the scalp and in long term it will become chronic inflammation. Ultimately creating Scar tissue in scalp resulting in a similar situation to what androgenetic alopecia does to scalp. \nI.e back to square one.\nApplying Tretinoin is better than microneedling along with minoxidil to give maximum benefits to hair growth.\n\nReferences: \n1) Chronic inflammation in the etiology of disease across the life span\nDavid Furman et al.

        "body": "Please for the love of Hairs, stop asking GPT and Reddit on hair care routine. It never ends well. Consult a proper Dermat (not someone who says to rub oil) and monitor your scalp condition. \n\nWhat has worked for me : \n1. 1mg finasteride orally per day keeps the hair transplant doctor away. ( Only Finasteride/Dutasteride will cure your hairfall issue which is caused by DHT- a useless harmone in adults (useful until puberty passes). \n\n2. Ketoconazole %1 shampoo (%1 is already most effective and strong. Using 2% is overkill unless you suffer from severe case of seborrheic dermatitis. I use it once or twice a week.\n\n3. Never needed topical Minoxidil but it helps only in compliment with Finasteride. Never used minoxidil alone as it does not solve the hairloss issue.\n\n4. I use Tresemme sulphate free shampoo + conditioner for regular use. \n\n5. When I don't use conditioner, I use Kraves wax for styling along with a cold air blower.(Only occasionally)\n\n6. I don't use any oils because my scalp is oily. Applying more will worsen the dandruff problem. \n\n\nThings to Note : \n1. No other serum works unless it does have proper clinical trials and meta analysis studies on it.\n\n2. Never fall for all natural and organic scams. They do not work. be skeptical. Never be blinded by a brand and Fake doctors who claim ridiculous 'CURES'. They do so because people fear drugs and they don't have any evidence or proof of the efficacy. \n\n3. Depending on food and diet as your only way to fight the Slap head curse is a bad idea. Food is food not a medicine. Just because our ancestors used it, does not mean it's good. Our ancestors did not have knowledge nor the protocols for developing cures and conducting clinical trials. \nThe most heinous diseases like TB black death, Hairloss etc have been cured by Pharmaceuticals. So don't fear drugs.\n\n4. DON'T use microneedling. It will cause scar tissue in your scalp which will permanently remove any chance of you growing new hair in that area.\n\n5. Exercise is a must. Never skip a leg day.",

    "body": "Making this post as there hasn't been a lot of information about oral gonorrhea. This post is just for public information\n\n **TL:DR** \\- Please get tested and include a throat swab if you do oral. I have oral gonorrhea and it's wreaking havoc on my mental health as it has been hard to cure.\n\n**Background:**\n\nI'm a single, heterosexual male. I met someone in October 2021 and this is everything that happened after. In November, she reached out around 12:30 one night and wanted to come over for a \"nightcap.\" We had sex, I performed oral, and 2 days later I felt rundown, my throat was hurting. Went to CVS minute care and they told me I had strep throat. They gave me some antibiotics, and I felt better within a day. Finished my course of antibiotics and was good to go. After that one time, we stopped talking regularly and I later found out that she got back with her boyfriend. I liked her so I was a little upset about it. I figured I would take some time for self improvement and not see / be with anyone else for a little while.\n\nIn mid-March, I saw her at a local bar and we started talking again. A few days later, she came over and we picked up where we left off. About 2-3 weeks later, I have some discomfort in my throat. Not pain, but more like I have something in there. Similar to the feeling you would have if you had a small bit of food stuck in your throat. I don't pay it any mind. We continue this for a few weeks, then she tells me she wants to be together in mid-May. I tell her that I'm not looking to be in a relationship right now, so she leaves my house. The next day, I'm leaving to go the gym in the morning and she's just getting home from being somewhere all night. This is around mid-May. Btw, she literally lives across the street from me. \n\n**The signs that something was wrong:**\n\nFrom the moment we started, there was an off smell to her vagina. I attributed it to her coming over after work and not being fresh out of the shower. It was pungent enough that I stopped doing oral after about 3 weeks. We were not using protection. I could also smell her on my penis even after showering. It was not pleasant. A quick Google search told me that it's normal for your scent to change with a new partner because of different bacteria. I was a regular Dove user, so I added an antibacterial soap with 2% zinc pyrithione in mid-April. The scent was gone in a few days. Around beginning of May, 2 weeks before we end things, I'm waking up and there's a faint smell of her vagina in my mouth. There is a slight burning (not even sure if it's fair to call it that, just heat) in the back of my throat. \n\n**STD Testing:** \n\nIn the last week of May (2 weeks after we end things), I do an STD panel consisting of urine and blood, everything is negative. Awesome! Something is still wrong with my throat, so I go to urgent care. They do a throat culture and 3 days later (still in the 1st week of June), the doctor calls and tells me I've tested positive for Strep and Gonorrhea.\n\n**The Treatments:**\n\nI go in the same day and receive a 500mg shot of Ceftriaxone. A week later, the symptoms have not improved at all. I go back in, they do another throat swab...still positive. I go in again for a 1000mg shot of Ceftriaxone. They tell me that if symptoms don't improve I'd have to go Infectious Disease or and Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) doctor. I try to get an appointment at the ENT but they tell me that the closest appointment is in 6 weeks. Another week and a half passes and symptoms haven't improved, foul taste still in my mouth in the mornings. I call Planned Parenthood and figure they have more experience dealing with STDs. They tell me that I have to get retested in 3 months (CDC guideline is test of cure in 7-14 days after treatment for oral gonorrhea). I then found \"CallonDoc.\" I put in my info, explain the issue, what treatments I've already received, and they gave me a prescription for Metronidazole (2000mg at once), Cefpodoxime (200mg 2x a day for 3 days), and Doxycycline (100mg 2x a day for 7 days). I have 3 days of the doxycycline left. As of today, throat is still red, my tonsils still enlarged. \n\n**Impacts to my health:**\n\nBy all measures, I have a great life. I'm 32, no kids, great job making more money than I could need. I'm in decent shape and I powerlift. Since suspecting an STD in mid-May, my physical fitness level has gone down. Since starting medication, I've stopped taking my joint supplements, afraid that it will have some interaction with the drugs. Now my joints don't feel great anymore. I'm nearing depression at this point and I'm deathly afraid that I have an incurable case of Gonorrhea. I'm afraid that I'll never be able to date again, afraid that I'll inadvertently pass this curse to someone else. Mad at myself for ignoring the signs, bitter that this has happened to me. These 5 weeks have been the worst and I have no idea what's going to happen from here if I test positive again.\n\nOnce I finish my antibiotics and do another test of cure a week later, I'll post an update. In the meantime, please feel free to AMA\n\n7/9/2022 update - it has been a week since I finished antibiotics. Tonsils still enlarged, smell has returned. Waiting for a test of cure (which I'm sure will come back positive) then will do one more treatment. If that doesn't work, I'll be going to an infectious disease doctor.\n\n8/4/2022 update - got 2 negative tests. I think this saga is done. Still have the smell in my throat/mouth, but will manage that with frequent Listerine usage for a few weeks. Hopefully, that will take care of it. But no presence of N. Gonorrhoeae\n\n5/29/2024 update - I don't use this account and have not seen all the engagement on this post. Apologies to everyone who reached out. The smell was completely gone within a few weeks of my last update. There are no additional steps that I have taken, back to normal life. This post was always meant to be informational. I wish everyone the best of luck. Finally, if you feel that something is wrong, get it checked out and don't take no for an answer.",

    "body": "\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis article presents a comprehensive, patient-driven investigation into the efficacy of various topical agents in managing scalp psoriasis symptoms over a three-year period. Unlike traditional brand comparisons, the analysis isolates specific active ingredients found in over-the-counter and clinical treatments, assessing their impact through systematic self-experimentation. Key compounds evaluated include salicylic acid, zinc pyrithione, coal tar, selenium sulfide, piroctone olamine, tea tree oil, pine tar, bisabolol, and ketoconazole. The findings suggest that while many mainstream treatments offer limited or purely symptomatic relief, a combination of 1% salicylic acid and 1% selenium sulfide provided a near-complete remission without adverse effects. The study also highlights the efficacy of zinc pyrithione and salicylic acid—despite their underrepresentation in psoriasis-specific treatment literature—and raises questions about overlooked ingredients that may offer genuine therapeutic benefit.\n\n\n\nIntroduction:\n\nI am a guy who has suffered from scalp psoriasis since my teenage years. For most of that time, I relied on coal tar shampoo, but in the past two to three years, I’ve conducted extensive self-experimentation driven by personal frustration and informed by scientific literature. I undertook this journey with a goal: to isolate which specific chemicals—not brands—actually alleviate symptoms of psoriasis. Having read many peer-reviewed articles and product studies over the years, I focused strictly on ingredients featured in scientific research, avoiding anecdotal claims and brand biases. This self-experimentation was documented carefully to avoid confounding variables, aiming to provide clarity for others who may feel unheard or misinformed about their treatment options.\n\n\n\nMethodology:\n\nEach treatment was tested in chronological order. I maintained consistent hair care routines and avoided introducing multiple new ingredients simultaneously, ensuring any effects could be attributed to the active compound in question. Products were selected based on scientific literature or suggested efficacy in treating similar dermatological conditions like seborrheic dermatitis. Observations were made over a period of several weeks per compound, and effects were noted regarding itch relief, flake reduction, hair/scalp health, and need for adjunctive care like conditioner.\n\n\n\nFindings and Analysis:\n\n-2% Ketoconazole: Provided no noticeable improvement in symptoms.\n\n-0.5% to 1% Coal Tar: Relieved painful itching and significantly reduced dandruff and flaking, but some remained.\n\n-3% Salicylic Acid: Eliminated flakes and fully cleared symptoms.\n\n-1% Zinc Pyrithione: Cleared all symptoms and left hair smooth, but caused hair thinning.\n\n-Tea Tree Oil (approx. % unknown): Reduced flakes and psoriasis, but damaged follicles and increased itch without conditioner.\n\n-1% Selenium Sulfide: Marginally reduced symptoms but did not eliminate pain, itch, or flaking.\n\n-1% Piroctone Olamine: Slightly more effective than selenium sulfide but also mostly symptomatic.\n\n-1% Salicylic Acid + 1% Selenium Sulfide Combo: Fully effective; no symptoms, no hair damage, and no need for conditioner. This combination was found specifically in the Vichy Dercos Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, which also contains several other compounds that may have contributed to its superior effectiveness. Among them is tocopheryl acetate (Vitamin E), a known antioxidant which may also contribute anti-inflammatory effects. Additionally, menthol is included, which I also noted helps prevent itchiness. The synergy of these ingredients may enhance its therapeutic profile.\n\n-Pine Tar (with Tea Tree Oil): Moderately effective, slightly better than tea tree oil alone, but difficult to isolate effects.\n\nSpecial Mentions:\n\n-Menthol: Provides significant itch relief and improves comfort.\n\n-Conditioner: Helps prevent scalp dryness, which can reduce flaking and itching when used with active treatments.\n\n-Vitamin E (Tocopheryl Acetate): Acts as an antioxidant that protects scalp cells from oxidative stress and may offer additional anti-inflammatory support, potentially enhancing treatment effectiveness.\n\nPromising Untested Compounds:\n\n-Bisabolol: Not formally tested in this self-experimentation, but theorized to have potential due to its anti-inflammatory properties and scientific support in dermatological contexts.\n\n-Urea: Also untested directly in this study, but research shows highly promising effects in reducing scaling and inflammation in psoriasis, making it a strong candidate for future trials.\n\n\n\nDiscussion:\n\nThe results show a pattern of strong efficacy from salicylic acid and zinc pyrithione—both of which are rarely promoted as psoriasis treatments compared to coal tar. Coal tar and pine tar, although effective for itch, were less helpful in controlling flaking. Selenium sulfide and piroctone olamine offered symptomatic relief but no long-term benefit, suggesting their mechanism is more palliative than curative. Tea tree oil offered temporary improvements but presented drawbacks in hair follicle health. The combination of 1% salicylic acid with 1% selenium sulfide emerged as the most balanced and complete solution. Interestingly, ketoconazole, though widely recommended for scalp issues, had no effect on psoriasis, aligning with clinical skepticism about its use beyond fungal conditions. This study underscores the need for more ingredient-focused guidance in over-the-counter psoriasis treatments and suggests that compounds like salicylic acid, zinc pyrithione, and possibly bisabolol, urea, and pine tar deserve more clinical attention.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThrough persistent, controlled self-experimentation over three years, I found that the most effective treatments for scalp psoriasis were not always the ones most commonly advertised. The best results came from 3% salicylic acid and 1% zinc pyrithione individually, and even more so from a combined 1% salicylic acid and 1% selenium sulfide formula. This formula, found in Vichy Dercos, also contained tocopheryl acetate (Vitamin E) and menthol, which likely contributed to its effectiveness by reducing inflammation and itchiness. These findings could serve as the basis for future controlled studies and provide a roadmap for other sufferers navigating treatment options.\n\n\n\nScientific References:\n\nSalicylic Acid: Lebwohl, 1999\n\nZinc Pyrithione: Kruglova et al., 2024\n\nCoal Tar: Slutsky et al., 2010\n\nSelenium Sulfide: van de Kerkhof & Franssen, 2001\n\nPiroctone Olamine: Lodén & Wessman, 2000\n\nTea Tree Oil: Summary\n\nPine Tar: Rachev et al., 2003\n\nBisabolol: Search\n\nUrea: Rachev et al., 2003\n\nMenthol: Prunel et al., 2012\n\nVitamin E: Cruz, 2013\n\nKetoconazole: Alford et al., 1986",

The whole hairloss community has been a pretty shitty place but it's understandable since hairloss makes you feel shitty and has emotions all over the place.\n\n **Current Regime:**  \n **Derma Roller 1.5mm** \\- weekly  \n **Nizoral -** weekly  \n **Zinc Pyrithione** \\- daily  \n **Scalp Massage** \\- daily (I try to aim for 5 minutes daily, this could probably use a thread of its own though)  \n **Scalp Exercise** \\- whenever I remember to do it, based on Tom Hagerty  \n **Fish Oil** Daily (although I read an article recently that fatty  acids such as Omega-3s and 6s can have a negative impact on inflammation  in the scalp, which is the opposite of what you'd expect. I'm still  using fish oil because it had cognitive benefits.) \n\nThe two biggest benefits to my hair growth was likely the 1.5mm derma roller, I've been seeing hair growth by the week since I started using it on the 11th of July. Aside from that scalp massages would be second, they got rid of the last of dermatitis before even using Nizoral, stopped my scalp itch and made my hair dramatically less greasy. It also gave my hair more life and I think improved overall follicle health improving all my existing hair but it did literally nothing for my hairline. I started consistent daily scalp massages around the end of May.\n\nThere are **some things to consider before considering my regime** especially over minoxidil or finasteride, the former in most cases would be better. Primarily my regime is more for if you are on the fence about treatments with side effects, I do think mechanical stimulation would be beneficial in addition to those though. My hairloss journey isn't over and I plan to make a bigger post in regards to this at a later date since there are a lot of things to consider in regards to what treatment you chose. \n\nIf you are deciding between min or fin I'd probably go for fin as min inhibits collagen production which will age your skin at an accelerated rate, fin has more internal side effects but from a pure aesthetic standpoint min is more destructive. If you are using either of those I'd def add a 1.5mm derma roller into the mix to increase results. ",

    "body": "Hi! I tried these three online prescription services over the past two years and thought a comparison review might be helpful. \n\nMy skin: dry, extra sensitive, eczema prone \n\nConcerns I wanted to address: redness, slight texture\n\n[Packaging of all three (pumps) ](https://imgur.com/a/tZZx3vP)\n\n**Rory**\n\nCost: $5 trial, then $75 per quarter (for my specific formula) \n\nPrescriptions: first 10% azelaic acid, 2% tranexamic acid, 1% magnesium ascorbyl phosphate. Second 0.015% tretinoin, niacinamide 2.5% \n\nFormulation: this formulation also includes ceramides, which I really liked for my dry skin. It was the creamiest and thickest out of all three brands. However, it also had gritty bits in it that made it less enjoyable and more irritating to apply. \n\nResults: Slight redness reduction after 4 months of using every other night \n\nPersonal Opinion: I felt the entire experience was very generic and that my provider was not personalizing my formulas. After experiencing irritation with azaleic acid, they switched me to tretinoin, which did not make sense to me. I did not purchase or try my second formula with the tretinoin.  \n\n**Curology** \n\nCost: $5 trial, then $19 + shipping every month or $40 with free shipping every two months \n\nPrescription: 4% azelaic acid, 4% niacinamide, 0.25% zinc pyrithione \n\nFormulation: this formulation was the smoothest and felt most like a normal moisturizer to apply. Mine had no scent and layered well with the products I used underneath it. It caused no irritation. \n\nResults: Significant redness and texture improvement after 3 months of nightly use \n\nPersonal Opinion: My Curology provider was the most responsive and informative of the three. Curology is known for their low-strength formulas, so I wasn’t surprised that this was the mildest of my prescriptions. My provider has been clear that I can increase strength when I feel ready, though. For now, I appreciate that this causes no sensitivity, and I don’t feel like my skin concerns need anything stronger. Also, the zinc pyrithione in this one really helped flakiness around my eyes and mouth. I usually use a zinc pyrithione cleanser, so it was nice to be able to skip that step with this. \n\n**Apostrophe**\n\nCost: $90 without auto refill, $75 with auto refill every three months \n\nPrescription: 15% azelaic acid, 4% niacinamide \n\nFormulation: This was the thinnest of the creams. It disappeared almost immediately after spreading it on my face. It also had gritty pieces similar to Rory, but these ones were much finer. \n\nResults: Unable to tell because it was too irritating to use more than twice a week \n\nPersonal Opinion: The 15% azelaic was too strong for me to start out with. When I asked my provider if I could have something milder or a different ingredient, they replied that I should just use an over the counter azelaic acid. I did not appreciate this, because I have tried the over the counter products and do not like the consistency or the other ingredients they contain. Apostrophe was by far the least helpful and least informative of the three. \n\n**Overall favorite: Curology** \n\nCurious to hear others’ experiences!\n\nEdit: i also forgot to mention these all use the same base formula containing: \n\naloe barbadensis leaf juice, C13-14 isoparaffin, caprylic/capric triglyceride, water, laureth-7, maltodextrin, phenoxyethanol, polyacrylamide, tocopheryl acetate, triethylene glycol",

When they announced in 2021 that they were decreasing their product amount but still keeping the same cost, I changed to Curology. The Curology provider was way more informative and each response seemed more personal than Apostrophe. However, the Curology provider only prescribed me 0.035% to start off and using it every night made me peel like crazy when fall/winter hit. It might have been a combination of the formulation and weather change, but my skin didn’t peel this badly at all with Apostrophe. Curology just bumped me up to 0.05% this month. I’ll most likely stick to Curology unless peeling becomes a constant issue, which then I’ll try out Agency or go back to Apostrophe.",

    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nAfter seeing countless product recommendations and people experimenting with different brands, I realized that not everyone fully understands the logic behind a skincare routine for SD. Some people still think that they’ll buy a new cream and will forget about SD. This is not the case.\nBelow you can find the explanation of the routine so you can make your own based on the products available in your country. \nThe below list is a summary of Reddit info put into perspective.\n\n1. Malassezia Biofilm Disruption\n\nSD is caused by Malassezia overgrowth. It’s not a bacteria but fungi. This fungi is able to protect itself by creating a biofilm preventing from skin care products reaching it.\nBecause it’s not bacteria, there’s no point to use antibiotics for body and scalp.\n\n\t•\tXylitol: Disrupts biofilms and reduces microbial adhesion.\n\t•\tSalt Water/Dead Sea Salt: Osmotic effect helps break down biofilms and soothes inflammation.\n\t•\tVinegar: Acidity breaks biofilm layers and limits fungal growth.\n\t•\tBoric Acid: Acidic agent that disrupts biofilms and curbs Malassezia.\n\t•\tAzelaic Acid: Breaks biofilm, regulates oil, and reduces inflammation.\n\t•\tSalicylic Acid: Exfoliates and helps break biofilm layers while reducing oil buildup.\n\t•\tGlycolic Acid: Reduces buildup and enhances biofilm penetration.\n\n2. Anti-Inflammatory Agents\n\nIf your skin is swollen and red, you must stop inflammation and calm symptoms. If it’s not red, you can skip this step and go to the step 3.\nUse steroids only for short-term flare management. Always taper off gradually to avoid side effects.\n\n\t1.\tMild Potency (for sensitive areas):\n\t•\tHydrocortisone: Apply 1–2x daily for up to 2 weeks. Safe for face and sensitive areas.\n\n\t2.\tMedium Potency (for moderate inflammation):\n\t•\tLocoid (Hydrocortisone Butyrate): Apply 1–2x daily for 1–2 weeks. Ideal for thicker skin (scalp, trunk).\n\t•\tAlpicort: Apply 1x daily for 1 week.\n\n\t3.\tHigh Potency (for severe inflammation):\n\t•\tBelosalic: Combines betamethasone (anti-inflammatory) with salicylic acid (keratolytic). Use 1x daily for 1 week, then taper.\n\t•\tClobetasol: Reserved for severe cases. Apply 1x daily for a maximum of 1 week, then taper.\n\nNon-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents\n\n\t•\tTacrolimus: Modulates the immune response. Ideal for long-term use in sensitive areas like the face. Apply 1–2x daily as needed.\n\n3. Antifungal Agents (Killing Malassezia)\n\nThese target the fungal overgrowth directly and are essential after managing inflammation.\n\n\t•\tKetoconazole (Nizoral): Broad-spectrum antifungal that specifically targets Malassezia.\n\t•\tCiclopirox: Antifungal and anti-inflammatory, disrupting fungal cell membranes.\n\t•\tSelenium Sulfide: Reduces Malassezia activity and controls scalp oiliness.\n\t•\tDucray Kelual: Combines antifungal agents with soothing ingredients to reduce scaling and redness.\n\t•\tZinc pyrithione shampoos (skin cap, neutrogena, sebamed): Combine antifungal agents with soothing ingredients to reduce scaling and redness.\n\t•\tTea Tree Oil (diluted): Antifungal and antimicrobial, helps control Malassezia. Use with caution to avoid irritation.\n\t•\tSulfur Soap: Both antifungal and antibacterial; helps reduce oil production and flaking.\n\n4. Sebum Regulation and Skin Barrier Support\n\n\t•\tMCT Oil 8 (without lauric acid): Non-comedogenic moisturizer that doesn’t feed Malassezia.\n\t•\tSqualane Oil: Lightweight, non-comedogenic, and safe for Malassezia.\n\t•\tCeraVe PM Lotion: Contains ceramides and niacinamide; non-comedogenic and fungus-safe.\n\t•\tAvene Tolerance Emulsion: Minimal ingredients and suitable for sensitive, fungal-prone skin.\n\t•\tLa Roche-Posay Toleriane Ultra: Lightweight, soothing, and free of oils that feed Malassezia.\n\n5. Vitamin and Mineral Support\n\nMake sure you are not vitamin deficient.\n\t•\tVitamin D3/K2 + Magnesium: Boosts skin immunity and reduces inflammation.\n•\tZinc: Helps regulate sebum production and provides anti-inflammatory benefits.\n\nConclusion:\n\nSD is not a condition like cold that disappears permanently with the help of one product. Malassezia is a natural part of your skin flora, and when your immunity drops, the fungi start to grow and SD returns. Therefore, your mistake is allowing it to grow. If you maintain an oil-free, slightly acidic environment on your scalp and skin, Malassezia won’t be able to thrive there.\n\nHope it helps",

    "body": "[Shelfie](https://imgur.com/a/oLge8Bq.jpg)\n\nHairType: 1A/1B leaning towards 1A. Fine hair, High Porosity, Waist length. Virgin hair, never been chemically treated, I don't do any heat styling, no blow-drying. Only Air-drying\n\n[Pic 1, Im turning away from camera](https://imgur.com/a/3YQDuew.jpg). Hair is so hard so photograph properly, If I get more accurate pictures, I'll edit to add.\n\nSo life's pretty bad right now, so I'm not able to do the elaborate hair care routine I used to. Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This is an anti-dandruff shampoo and the best I've used so far.\n\nOther than the usual supermarket brands I've used Bioderma Node Ds (Excellent but pricey. Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles. Bottle looks super tiny and the plastic waste bothers me.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Re'equil Anti-Hairfall Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:   [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-c14-16-olefin-sulfonate), [Cocamidopropyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-hydroxysultaine), [Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-cocoyl-isethionate), [Decyl Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/decyl-glucoside), [Coco-Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/coco-glucoside), [Dexpanthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Glyceryl Oleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-oleate), [Biotin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/biotin), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Nasturtium Officinale Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/nasturtium-officinale-extract), [Tropaeolum Majus Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tropaeolum-majus-extract), [Polyquaternium-22](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-22), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Glycol Monostearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycol-stearate), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Methylchloroisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylchloroisothiazolinone), [Methylisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylisothiazolinone), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Ci 45100](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-45100), [Ci 42090](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-42090)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.450 for 250 ml.

I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: Oh my god, you guys. Best find of this year. This gives super shiny, sleek looking hair. I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember. I used up the entire bottle. I think 9ish months?? or more.\n\nConsistency: Normal shampoo consistency, HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above. Forever Repurchase. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Oriental Botanics Red Onion Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients: This has an ingredients list a mile long. Will update soon.\n\nPrice: MRP 449 for 300 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years and I'm only done with half the bottle\n\nConsistency: Normal Shampoo\n\nUsage: I take a lot and apply it from shoulders to ends, if I've not oiled my hair.\n\nReview: I literally had to go and check what the name of this product was to type this review and I've been using it for 2+ years. I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

    "body": "**DISCLAIMER**: I am not a dermatologist or skincare professional, none of this constitutes medical advice. I have consulted dermatologists for myself when required - for my own skin. I talk about my personal experiences below, but YOUR CASE AND MY CASE ARE DIFFERENT. Please use your own judgement and thinking when it comes to making choices for your own skin. Do not uncritically accept any advice from people online, myself included.\n\nSome of you may know me for the posts I've made on the sub about fungal acne, starting three years ago with this one about [how I treated mine](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/O93bTjblV1) and the list of \"fungal-safe\" skincare products available in India. A recent video by YouTuber and dermatologist Dr. Dray ([\"Fungal acne \"safe\" skincare explained\"](https://youtu.be/PABcL9eKHqg?si=4PMXAaiW8Uy40xEg)) motivated me to question my understanding of the subject. I thought it might be relevant to those of you who, like me, frequently deal with the condition. \n\n#The science\n\nHere's a simplified recounting of Dr Dray's latest video, which was my motivation behind making this post:\n\n♦️ Malassezia/pityrosporum folliculitis is the technical term for \"fungal acne\". Malassezia is a yeast that naturally occurs in the skin, but under certain conditions it can cause issues like dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, etc. \n\n♦️ It happens within the hair follicle aka the pore, hence the term \"folliculitis\". It isn't a problem with pore clogging but with inflammation related to malassezia within the pore.\n\n♦️ Malassezia thrives in oily areas by breaking down sebum. This can generate inflammation, which can lead to a negative immune response in some people, causing them to develop folliculitis.\n\n♦️ It can occur along with acne because people are often put on prolgonged courses of antibiotics to control their acne. \n\n♦️ Self-diagnosis is not a good idea, its best to visit a derm.\n\n♦️ There are no ingredients that \"feed\" malassezia. It thrives in our sebum, in a moist and humid environment. So it's common in tropical countries.\n\n♦️ It is aggravated by excessive oiliness and oil production from sebaceous glands, and skincare ingredients or products do not increase that - hormones and genetics drive oil production.\n\n♦️ However, heavy products that have a thicker consistency do slow down the evaporation of sweat, which creates warmth and leads to more sweating. This does aggravate malassezia. She suggests being mindful of the texture of products.\n\n♦️ She suggests using gels since they absorb fast, don't make you feel overheated or greasy, and allow for evaporation of sweat.\n\n♦️ Treatment. She recommends topical anti-fungal treatments (dandruff shampoos as a face mask) every night for a couple of weeks and then weekly for maintenance. And suggests a gentle baby shampoo brand with zinc pyrithione which may not clear up malassezia, but may work as a gentle, non-drying option for maintenance. Further treatment would require derm-precribed medication or other treatments. \n\n♦️ In summer months, you may need to increase frequency of using anti-dandruff products to manage malassezia-related conditions. \n\n♦️ Malassezia folliculitis very often recurs, requiring continued maintenance treatments with anti-dandruff shampoos etc.\n\nDr. Dray also wrapped up a previous video of hers from 2 years ago ([top 5 fungal acne products that work](https://youtu.be/y38D2ZMLhy8?si=MS55ChtI6v9vEyDx)), timestamp 10:07, by saying the idea that certain ingredients \"feed\" malassezia is complete \"anecdote bunk\", and says the websites that go through each one are totally bogus (*cough* SimpleSkincareScience *cough*). She likened the term \"fungal acne safe\" to \"non-comedogenic\", as a vague and meaningless term, although that's a marketing term while \"fungal-safe\" is more \"internet hype\".\n\nShe says the pathophysiology of \"fungal acne\" only relates to predisposition to oiliness within the pores, an immune response, and climatic conditions like humidity. She would like that \"fungal acne safe\" be eradicated as a term, lest companies begin to include it on their products for marketing purposes, similar to other meaningless terms like \"clean\", \"green\", etc. \n\n#Where's the confusion then?\n\nO-KAY. Now, I received a comment months ago on a \"fungal-safe\" post stating that it was all BS, referencing the Dr. Dray video, ([top 5 fungal acne products that work](https://youtu.be/y38D2ZMLhy8?si=MS55ChtI6v9vEyDx)). And congratulating me on my long post full of misinformation and fearmongering 😂 I'm thankful to that person, because though their delivery was far from ideal, they did set me on the track of trying to reconcile the information I'd learned from [SimpleSkincareScience.com](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) (apparently the epicentre of the BS), dermatologists like Dr. Dray, dermatologists I personally consulted, and my own first-hand experiences. \n\nBecause, dear reader. As much as the concept has been of practical value to me (as well as other people, if the internet can be trusted)... it's not \"backed by science\". \n\n#Why is it \"unscientific\"?\n\nThere's a big difference between in-vivo testing (on actual people/animals), vs in-vitro testing (in a lab petridish). Just because something happens in a petridish doesnt mean the same thing will happen on human skin. This is why the SimpleSkincareScience blog approach is unscientific - it equates petridish stuff to what would happen if you applied those ingredients to the skin. There is no actual research showing that topically applying these ingredients worsens malassezia-related conditions. Therefore to claim that is, by definition, unscientific. It has not been proven in a scientific way. \n\nDoes that mean they guaranteed have zero impact on malassezia-related conditions... also no 🙃 It just means the research hasn't been done. It will likely never be done, because I don't see who has incentive to do it. To my knowledge, research is conducted on the basis of funding. \n\nI'm not out here trying to refute Dr Dray (I don't have a death wish) or claim I know better than a dermatologist, I'm simply a layperson trying to make sense of things. The accurate interpretation of research papers is beyond my understanding, and even this explanation is likely off in some ways. \n\nIn fact... Dr Dray herself mentions avoiding plant oils and unsaturated fatty acids in [this video](https://youtu.be/bhVESPApM-0) at around the 2:45 mark. And she applies the same logic - if plant oil is used to grow malassezia in the lab, it logically must do the same on the skin, right? .... right?? This video was made in 2013. Ten years ago. She likely has gotten new imformation since then, since she now states ingredients cannot \"feed\" malassezia, but if so, she hasn't shared it or clarified if the in-vitro studies are irrelevant. I wish she would 😂\n\nAs it turns out, there is also a difference between \"feeds\" and \"thrives in/growth observed in the presence of\". The term \"feeds\" is unscientific, and in that sense, might be one of the reasons a dermatologist takes issue with it. To laypeople it sounds like the same thing, but scientifically it is not.\n\n#My personal experience\n\nThe one thing that confused me the most about all this is just... reality. I had seen multiple dermatologists from over a decade, snd religiously used all my prescribed acne medications, but my skin simply didn't respond.  It only improved and worsened depending on my stress levels. Thats why I started doing my own research in the first place, and using anti-inflammatory face packs (which did help).\n\nI found the SimpleSkincareScience blog and considered the possibility of \"fungal acne\". So I  tried anti-dandruff shampoos. My skin responded to that almost immediately, so I concluded it was fungal. It was a huge relief, and I realized I'd been dealing with it since I was a teenager, not realizing it wasn't acne. I went to a dermatologist after that, just to relay my experience and get confirmation. Plus, now maybe the routine they gave me would be effective!\n\nBut the folliculitis kept coming back, even when I was using a carefully chosen \"oil-free\" routine (approved by, and in some cases prescribed by, my derm). The continued cycle of flaring up and having to use anti-dandruff shampoos was basically keeping my skin in a limbo state of never calming down or healing. \n\nI had layers of stubborn PIH from always being in some stage of folliculitis, more dark spots forming all the time, and was not able to address that. It was all I could do to keep it the folliculitis under control. My skin heals super slow, so I was at my wit's end.\n\nThen I found the SimpleSkincareScience blog and was like - hope! Something I can do to make things better! Nothing to lose, everything to gain. Got my derm's blessing. And it worked 🤷🏽‍♀️ Once I switched out my already basic routine for \"fungal-safe\" products, I stopped having flareups, and didn't even need to use anti-dandruff shampoos for maintenance. In summer, I sometimes had little flareups when using occlusive silicone sunscreens, but they resolved themselves and rarely got worse. \n\nProbably what convinced me the most to buy into the concept was that when I did try to use products that weren't \"fungal-safe\", it would cause a breakout of folliculitis. I was using azelaic acid and BHAs at the time, and was like, maybe that will keep it from being an issue. But nope. Unfortunately, emulsifiers like polysorbates do cause my skin to react... whether this is due to them affecting malassezia, or because they irritate my skin for some other reason and THAT inflammation triggers malassezia?? I don't know. So I resigned myself to buying only \"fungal-safe\", and settled into having mildly acne-prone skin, quite content ☺️\n\nSkin is complex 🤷🏽‍♀️ The more I learn about it, the more I realize how little I know, and how everything is case by case. As with dietary issues, it seems elimination is sometimes to only way to find out how your skin responds to certain ingredients.\n\nIt was at this point that I received the comment linking Dr. Dray's video ([top 5 fungal acne products that work](https://youtu.be/y38D2ZMLhy8?si=MS55ChtI6v9vEyDx)). NGL, if the commenter had been more civil, and explained WHY it was misinformation and \"fearmongering\", it would've made a lot more sense. As it was, the video was more about not encouraging vague marketing terms or getting hyperfixated on avoiding specific ingredients. Both valid topics, but not addressing whether or not these ingredients can or do contribute to the worsening of malassezia folliculitis. \n\nStill, it was enough for me to consider... was I depriving myself of the shiny world of products that aren't \"fungal-safe\" for NO reason? If it wasn't true, why were they the only type of product that worked for me?? So I took myself to the dermatologist to see if they could shed some light. \n\nMy previous dermatologist had shifted offices, so I saw a new one. And I was like - what am I supposed to do here? I'd been dealing with malassezia folliculitis for years and years by this point, tried cutting out sugar, the whole candida diet, ALL of that. And I still couldn't use anything but a \"fungal-safe\" routine without folliculitis. I asked her if I needed anti-fungals, if I should stop using a \"fungal-safe\" routine, or what?? And she said... stick to what works 😐 That if I'd found a way to not require anti-fungal treatment, I should just stick to it, because it was working for me. That some people's skin just has these tendencies, and I should appreciate myself for having figured out what works for me.\n\nCut through all my mental gymnastics very neatly 😂 \n\nSo I did (and still do) use a \"fungal-safe\" routine, and hopefully this post goes some way to making it clear why. I much prefer not having to deal with folliculitis at all to following the conventional suggestion of regular \"maintenance\" using anti-dandruff shampoo masks. It's simply what works for ME. I am the anecdote, I am not science. Who knows, maybe those of us who get our best results like this have particularly sensitive skin 🤷🏽‍♀️ or some other common factor that is impossible to know. \n\n#Final thoughts\n\nI AM NOT PICKING SIDES. THERE ARE NO TWO SIDES HERE. For the love of God, these false dichotomies on the internet! Skincare users are not the sworn enemies of certified dermatologists or vice versa. It makes sense that the idea of something being \"fungal-safe\" is of no interest to dermatologists, because anecdotal evidence has absolutely no bearing on their practice. The last two dermatologists I spoke to about it were like 🤷🏽‍♀️ Can't hurt. Do it if it works. What mattered was that my skin was doing well. And I've come to that mindset myself. \n\nIt's practically a given for the internet to become alarmist about certain ingredients and start generalizing. Everyone starts picking sides and getting aggressive and that makes other people defensive and by that point are any of us learning jack shit? Is it even about skincare any more? 😂 It's happened with things like \"clean\" beauty and parabens and the Curly Girl method, and I can see how labelling products \"fungal-safe\" is somewhat similar. I see how the term \"fungal-safe\" or \"fungal acne safe\" could scare people from trying products that are perfectly fine for them. It sort of implies that things that aren't \"fungal safe\" have a \"danger of fungal\" 🤔 Which is untrue.\n\nJust as with fragrance, sulphates, silicones in haircare and any number of other ingredients - it's not a problem unless it becomes a problem.\n\nIf you ask me whether you should try a \"fungal-safe\" routine - I cannot make that choice for you, and suggest you consult with a dermatologist. That's how I arrived at a routine that works for me, and I would not have settled on it without taking professional guidance. \n\nIt's only within the last ten months that I learned the difference between layperson terms of speech and scientific terms, why \"unsubstantiated by science\" does not equal \"automatically a total lie\". There are so many similar things I would have taken at face value. Truly, science communicators like YouTuber Lab Muffin Beauty Science are doing us a service by bridging these gaps, and keeping us from the anxieties of half-knowledge. \n\nRather than being a scientifically proven or dermatologically reccomended concept, the term \"fungal-safe\" is like people avoiding fatty alcohols or any other ingredients because they realized by trial and error that it clogs their pores. Only from personal experiences.\n\nSo I do think that I unwittingly perpetutated misinformation with my posts about \"fungal-safe\" skincare and misrepresented the concept as having a scientific basis - rather than being merely anecdotal. For this I apologize. I didn't know any better at the time.\n\nIf anyone has any information that either contradicts or substantiates anything I've said here, feel free to share!\n\n#Changes? \n\nIn light of my new understanding, I feel it's my responsibility to mitigate any misunderstandings or negative impact my posts might have had. I'm not sure how to go ahead with this - I personally still use \"fungal-safe\" skincare. The first list I made was for personal use, before someone requested I share it, and other people contributed to the subsequent lists.\n\nI'm undecided whether to delete the posts and leave it at that, or re-post edited versions with either a disclaimer that it's anecdotally based, or just under the title \"oil-free products\" 🤔 ... IDK. Some of what I stated, especially technique-related tips such as sticking to gels to avoid a \"greenhouse type\" effect, is still accurate. Like is there THAT much difference between being recommended to avoid occlusives and stick to gels vs. calling oil-free, lighweight products \"fungal-safe\"? Maybe not that much in practice. But making the distinction between anecdotal/popular concepts vs things that have a scientific basis IS important, in and of itself.\n\nI'll think on it, and would appreciate your opinions on what makes the most sense. My first change is putting \"fungal-safe\" in skeptical quotation marks all the time 😂  As you see, there's no conclusive statements to be made here, only some rather interesting guesswork.\n\nI hope this sub continues to be a space where people have constructive dialogues, and influence each other for the better in a mutually respectful way ❤️",

Practising derms come across the woes of those suffering from malassezia more often so they're likely to be more sympathetic, whereas Dr Dray is a bit out of touch.\n\nMost derms I know of preach the importance of a regular skincare routine instead of relying on anti fungals or anti bacterial or anti anything really, since maintaining good skincare practises can be preventative & curative.\n\nLike you said, the scientific world doesn't have the impetus to research on human subjects because money & they consider fungal acne to be problem that affects minority. Unless a industry giant tries to make money off of substantiated claims, it's probably not going to happen. But just because scientific literature hasn't caught upto anecdotal practises doesn't mean that what people are doing isn't valid.\n\nFor eg : Tea Tree Oil wasn't proven to have anti microbial properties untill 20th century.

    "body": "Hi there! Everyone seems to appreciate empties reviews as much as I do based on the recent posts, so I thought I'd contribute. All the empties in the box are from the past few months, between Thanksgiving 2016 and now.  \n  \n  For reference, I have combo/oily skin that's enjoys a hydration immensely. I'm living on the east coast of the USA.  \n  \n  [Here's](http://imgur.com/a/NtlaS) the album with photos of everything. Empties first with reviews followed by my current products with reviews. I'm still using up stash items, both sample and full-sized, from Mishibox subscription (cancelled October 2016), from samples I purchased on r/ABE, and from samples given with online purchases.  \n  \n  I'll post the text reviews here as well for those of you who don't care about photos:  \n    \n  \n  \n  **EMPTIES:**  \n  \n - **Kikumasamune Sake Skin High Moist Lotion, 500mL**: A favorite of r/AB. I've been using it since November both AM and PM and I really like it. I recently decanted this giant bottle into 2 misting bottles (1 for friend, 1 for me because we spread our addictions here) that shows up later. I like the smell, personally, and will continue to repurchase it for the ceramides, value, and non-sticky finish as a light moisturizer. But it'll probably take me 6 months to use up half the bottle, 250mL.  \n - **Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Gel SPF50+/PA++++, 90mL**: Because sunscreen. I have combo/oily skin, so after trying the Watery Essence, I planned to move to the Watery Gel and then Perfect Milk to find the right amount of \"matte\" for my face. This was okay. I wanted to love it, but I just didn't love the amount of oil I felt on my face around 1p every day. It wasn't unbearable, but I think that I would prefer more mattification. Not terrible, but I won't repurchase.  \n - **D'ran Aqua Wonder Intensive Renewing Essence, 35mL**: This smells like what I imagine Icelandic water smells like. I quite liked the smell. It sinks in quickly and leaves the skin slightly matter than before. It took me about 3 months of daily use (PM, 2 pumps) to completely use the bottle. Comes packaged in an airless pump, which is nice, but I am 99% sure they've changed the packaging since this version. I received this via Mishibox, and it's out of my price range to repurchase, even if I wanted to. Overall, I wouldn't anyway, because although it felt nice, I didn't notice any extra benefits from using it.  \n - **Skinfood Black Sugar Perfect Cleansing Oil, 200mL**: I swear that's what this was! I wanted to keep the bottle to decant emulsions that come in crappy packaging (looking at you, Innisfree Green Tea Balancing Lotion) since I like the pump and there's a clip for traveling. I loved this cleansing oil! It was my first one, and it's a r/AB favorite for a reason. Slightly lemony scent, 2 pumps daily, bing bang boom, done. It emulsifies really easily, is thin (my preference) and has great \"slip,\" if you're inclined to oil massage. It took me approximately 5-6 months to use this up, so I think it's a great value. I would definitely repurchase, if I hadn't found a less expensive, equally great option (Kose Softymo Speedy cleansing oil - later).  \n - **Skylake Oriental Herb Cool Shampoo, 40mL**: I did NOT like this shampoo. Couldn't even finish it. It had a menthol-like feeling and I'm not a fan of that. Herby-menthol-y smell, and slight tingling when applying to scalp. It was also slightly harsh for my hair, which generally gets cleansing conditioner treatment every few days, and a gentle shampoo+deep conditioner every few weeks. I have think, wavy, dense hair with mid-low porosity if anyone needs to know. Received this from Mishibox, and I would not purchase.  \n - **Skylake Silk Cocoon Hair Conditioner, 25mL**: The companion to the awful Menthol shampoo just prior. I actually enjoyed this. It had a strong... flower-like fragrance, but it conditioned the ends of my hair well and I was able to use this about 3 times before it was as used up as it was going to get without me cutting it open. I prefer my regular deep conditioner (Hask Monoi coconut deep conditioner) since it's less expensive, more readily available, and a more enticing fragrance than this Skylake conditioner. This was from Mishibox, as well. I would not purchase though.  \n - **Curology! 8% Azelaic Acid/1% Clindamycin/0.25% Zinc Pyrithione, 30mL**: We all love Curology here. This is my last formula, 8% Azelaic Acid/1% Clindamycin/0.25% Zinc Pyrithione. I began service in August and cancelled my Curology service in December, since I felt my immediate needs had been satisfied. I have one more bottle I'm using up currently, and purchased The Ordinary 10% Azelaic Acid suspension for use one that last bottle of 8% Azelaic/1% Clin/0.25% Zinc Pyr is finished.  \n - **Re:cipe Slowganic Cleanser Mini 3-set in Green Tea, Adlay, and Lemon**: These were Mishibox samples of a sherbert-type cleanser in a variety of formulas. Each cup had enough for 2 generous uses, so I finished these in 6 (PM) cleanses. Overall, they felt quite stripping, and I didn't really enjoy them. I guess they're kind of easy to use? I worried about them drying out, frankly, although they didn't. I would not purchase, I much prefer a pump-gel-type second cleanser. Plus they seem kind of expensive.  \n - **Benton Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel, 5mL**: I was surprised that this took me 4-5 uses to use up completely. Just 5mL! Anyway, although it felt good, and I know a lot of people love this, I just didn't see any benefits that were different from my good ol' Holika Holika 99% Aloe Gel, which is super cheap. So, overall, good not great. I wouldn't purchase it though, since I do have the HH gel.  \n- **Benton Aloe BHA Skin Toner, BHA 0.5%, 5mL**: This felt really nice, but I didn't notice any difference. I have used CosRx BHA in the past with positive results, so I think if I were going for BHA benefits, I'd go with that over this Benton toner. It was quite thin in consistency, almost watery, and felt good on the skin, sinking in fairly quickly, but I just don't need it in my routine. Would not purchase.  \n - **Kikumasamune Sake Skin High moist Lotion, 30+ mL sample**: reviewed earlier. Shoutout to u/gothickornchic  \n - **Graymelin Double Strength Natural Eye Serum, 10mL**: I had absolutely no expectations for this, because frankly, I feel that most \"eye\" things do just what normal hydrators/moisturizers/serums do, at a higher price. This lasted a really long time, about 3 months of heavy use twice daily. I was honestly trying to use it up after a while. I do like the rollerball application, though I had to store it standing upside down after about 2 weeks, even though there was plenty of product left. No fragrance to speak of, and it sunk in well under the rest of the moisturizers I used. No complaints, but noticed no results from such long use, so I would definitely not purchase. Plus it's expensive. So no, sorry Graymelin.  \n - **Proud Mary Triple Waterzone Moist Ex Eye Cream, 10mL**: Wow this is a weird one. It's not a liquid, but it's definitely not a cream. It has a weird scoopable-but-melts consistency? Viscosity? I'm not even sure how to describe it. It also really felt unappetizing while I was patting-rubbing-patting it into my skin. I really did not enjoy this. It's not my thing. No. No purchasing.  \n - **The Face Shop Myeonghan Miindo Heaven Grade Ginseng Toner, 5mL**: This made me so sad!!!! It has a serum consistency. I loved the feeling, the ginseng smell, everything about it, but it broke me out in closed comedones on my forehead, which is somewhere I never break out. After I finished the sample, it cleared in a day or two, so I'm positive this was the culprit. :'-( Therefore, I can't purchase this RIP my ginseng dreams.  \n - **Heimish All Clean Balm, 7mL**: This one is a recent r/AB favorite. I have to say, I prefer cleansing oils to cleansing balms generally, and after the enlightening microbeads explanation the other day, I'm happy to not use balms at all. This had an overly sterile scent, in my opinion, which turned me off each use. I was able to get about 8 uses out of this, which I feel is quite economical. It cleaned fairly well, and emulsified decently. I have to say, I still prefer cleansing oils, even after using this, though. I find that they emulsify even more quickly/easily. I would not purchase this, but I can understand the hype.  \n - **Holika Holika Soda Pore Cleansing Oil, 30mL**: This was part of my quest to test out cleansing oils before I repurchased the Skinfood Black Sugar Perfect oil. HH Soda Pore is a thicker, almost syrup-y cleansing oil, and the fragrance is distinctly soda-syrup. I have to say, I wasn't a fan. I also noticed zero \"carbonated\" feelings that are advertised. Frankly, I thought that was going to be the case, so I'm okay with that. Overall, it's decent for emulsifying, but I feel that the quantity is used up more quickly than thinner oils, and the smell is a turnoff. I would not repurchase.  \n - **CosRx Oil-Free Ultra Moisturizing Lotion with Birch Sap, 15mL**: Sigh. I wanted to love this. As a combo/oily, I know a lot of oily r/ABers love this for light moisture in the morning. Unfortunately, I found this increased my oil production, so it was counter-productive. The fragrance is distinct, and I think it's a \"love it or hate it\" type. It definitely smells like sap, to me. Not a bad thing, though. Didn't serve its purpose for me, so I won't repurchase.  \n - **Dr. Jart+ Ceramidin Cream, 5mL**: This was absolutely amazing as a night cream, used under an occlusive layer. It's quite thick, but is absorbed readily and feels divine. Also I remember a unique smell, but I could not for the life of me describe it. I almost cried when I saw how expensive it was, though. However, r/AB gave me the idea to order the Holika Holika Skin & Good Cera products to possibly \"dupe\" the Ceramidin cream/liquid. So not all heartbreak! I would absolutely purchase this if I could afford it, but sadly, I can't, so I won't be purchasing.  \n - **Rosette Aqua Ceramide Gel, 10mL**: Sampling out occlusives, I of course wanted to try the r/AB favorite. It was fine. It served its purpose locking in moisture at night and giving an extra layer of ceramides to my Kiku toner earlier in my routine. However, I did notice this did not sink in fully at any point overnight, so I was left with \"sticky-face.\" Not a dealbreaker, but I'll pick a non-sticky occlusive over a sticky one, so this is now a backup in my Amazon cart rather than a front-runner. Would repurchase if I don't have a sleeping pack/occlusive that leaves me not-sticky-faced.  \n - **Innisfree Green Tea Seed Serum, 10mL**: I mainly wanted to try this to sate my curiosity. I find my skin doesn't seem to respond to serums at all, and this was no different. It was heavily fragranced, but that wouldn't have turned me off if it was working well for me. Saw no results, so I see no reason to add to my routine. Aversion complete! Will not purchase.  \n - **Mizon Snail Recovery Gel Cream, 15mL**: I loved this! It sinks in quickly and absorbs fully. Only ever so slightly mattifying, but it moisturizes well. It's an r/AB favorite for a reason! I ordered a 2-for-$8 on Amazon prime during one of their sales over winter break, so I have 2 tubes waiting for me when I get to them! I can see this being a staple in my routine once it's a bit more settled.  \n - **Nivea A Kiss of Smoothness lip balm SPF15 broad spectrum**: These are the only lip balms I purchase and I use everyday. I manage to make it through one tube at a time without losing them quite consistently, and I use a tube about every 3-4 months, so I have a stockpile in my closet that I bought in bulk. The Kiss of Milk & Honey (no SPF) is the only other kind I use, because I think it smells and feels divine, but I like the sun protection of this one and it's slightly richer/creamier.  \n  \n  \n  \n  **CURRENT PRODUCTS:**  \n  \n - non-AB **Bioderma Sebium H20 Micelle, 500mL**: I decanted this into a small spray bottle, which I quite like. I use this as my AM cleanser, since it's gentle, but I need something more than water in the morning. I will not be repurchasing the Bioderma, and particularly I won't purchase any micellar water \"for oily skin\" because I suspect it's been causing a bit more oil than I used to have. This has taken me 9 months to get through so far, but it's expiring, so it'll go at the end of the month. I won't repurchase this, but instead, I'll purchase Garnier micellar water (blue bottle).  \n - **Kiku High Moist Lotion, 250mL decanted**: Reviewed earlier love it, use it AM moisturizer and PM hydrating toner.  \n - **Secret Key Snail Repairing Sun Cream SPF50+/PA+++, 50mL**: I wanted to love this, but I found instead of mattifying my skin, it's contributing to dramatically more oil production during the day than I found when I was using other sunscreens. It has a lemon-y fragrance and feels slippery, though it's a cream. Sinks in well. This was from Mishibox, and I would not purchase, unfortunately. I've been using this for 1+ month now.  \n - **Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil, 230mL**: I love this! It's basically the same as the Skinfood Black Sugar oil, but without fragrance. I find I'm going through it slightly faster, but I don't mind, since it's much less expensive. I also love that I can repurchase only the refill, and save packaging that way. This is definitely a staple in my products now, and I'll be repurchasing once this is finished. I've been using this for 2 months now.  \n - non-AB **Cerave Baby Wash & Shampoo, 237mL**: My favorite second cleanser. It's not stripping, doesn't irritate my eyes, and everything-free basically. It's a staple for me, and I've repurchased on a B2G1 sale, so I have about 4 in my closet. It takes me about 4 months to go through one 8oz bottle, using 1x daily (PM). I've been using this for about 5 months now.  \n - **Holika Holika 99% Aloe Gel**: I love this fragrance. I'm not really convinced it shows any results, but I really enjoy using it, and it dries quickly, so I don't feel inconvenienced by keeping it in my routine. Plus, it's really inexpensive, so I don't feel bad having bought it, even if it doesn't do anything. I'm undecided if I'll repurchase, but I very well might just keep one on hand for aftershave/sun care once this is finished instead of repurchasing for my skincare routine.  \n - Current and last **Curology bottle, same formula** (8% Azelaic/1% Clin/0.25% Zinc Pyrithione)  \n - **Current sample: Proud Mary Triple Waterzone HydroBooster Serum, 10mL**: This is a thin serum, but definitely a serum consistency. It smells like glacial water. I've used this for about a week now and have noticed no difference. Again, I think my skin is indifferent to serums. Would not purchase for this reason.  \n - **Mizon Good Night White Sleeping Mask, 50mL**: Mizon Good Night White Sleeping Mask, 50mL\nAnother r/AB classic! This is my first time using it, and it's been a few weeks now. I really like it! It dries non-sticky, and I like the large amount of niacinamide in it. That and the price was the main draw, honestly. I feel it could be more occlusive, but I'm not convinced that I need to add a separate occlusive at this point. I'm open to repurchasing, but I have some other sleeping packs to work through that I might like better, so no commitment yet.",

    "body": "# Microbiology\n\nThe microflora of human skin is diverse and full of interesting microbes, but I’m only going to hit on the few that I felt like were most relevant here. Please feel free to let me know if you would like to know about others!\n\n**Staphylococci**\n\nTwo species of Staphylococci are of particular interest when it comes to human skin: *Staphylococcus epidermidis* and *Staphylococcus aureus*. Staphylococci thrive in areas with extra moisture and are found in the highest density near sweat glands (1).\n\n*S. aureus*\n\nWhile it has a (warranted) formidable reputation, 20% of the population permanently carries *S. aureus* without any negative effects, and it may even give them an advantage: a relationship between *S. aureus* carriers and decreased likelihood of complications from infection after the skin barrier has been breached (2).\n\n*S. epidermidis*\n\n*S. epidermidis* is a friendly, or commensal, bacterium that is always found on skin. It can’t cause any harm unless the host individual becomes immunocompromised or wounded. *S. epidermidis* actually produces a group of pheromones known as *agr* (accessory gene regulator) pheromones, which decrease the virulence potential of *S. aureus*. Pheromones are chemical messengers released into the environment by an organism to communicate with other organisms around them. The *agr* pheromones from *S. epidermidis* have a primary purpose of telling other *S. epidermidis* bacteria to produce their *agr* pheromones, but show a second function by silencing the virulence genes of *S. aureus* bacteria in the area (1).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Propionibacterium acnes***\n\nNow for the infamous *Propionibacterium acnes*. *P. acnes* can comprise anywhere from 20-70% of the permanent community found on human skin. Sebum serves as a plentiful food source for this bacterium, so it is commonly found on sebaceous regions of the skin and inside of the hair follicle. *P. acnes* produces lipases (fat-digesting enzymes) that break down sebum into free fatty acids, which serve as its food source but also seem to invoke inflammation in the skin surrounding areas in which this reaction occurs. *P. acnes* colonization does not necessarily equate to acne, however; the species has recently been categorized into five biotypes that all vary greatly in their acnegenic potential. Depended upon presence and abundance of the biotypes, the host may have completely healthy skin or severe acne. Type *P. acnes* B3 has been found to predominate in bacterial isolates taken from individuals with severe acne (3). It has been proposed that the name of *P. acnes* be changed to *Cutibacterium acnes (4),* and many have already changed to this classification, but some haven’t and disagree with it’s name being changed (5); microbiology is ever-changing as advances in technology allow closer looks at the genomes and phenotypes of microbes, so I wanted to include this after u/punctum pointed it out to me. Many have heard of *P. acnes* and most textbooks you cross will still use *P. acnes*, so I’m leaving this subheading as *P. acnes* for now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Malassezia***\n\nFinally, I wanted to discuss a non-bacterial microbial group: fungi of the genus *Malassezia*. *Malassezia* species have been associated with numerous skin disorders such as dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, and psoriasis. While the details surrounding its life on the skin are lacking compared to other microbes due to difficulties with culturing them, research into this fungal group has increased over the past 10 years and will continue to expand. It is known that they thrive on the complex lipids found in sebum and that zinc pyrithione is one of the most successful ways to fight is because of its anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory activities (6). Maybe *Malassezia* and fungi in general can be a future post! Since I’m sure a lot of you were hoping to see a bit about it, though, here’s what I know about fungal acne. The current medical classification of is *Malassezia* folliculitis, a type of fungal folliculitis, which is a subset of infectious folliculitis (7). In the paper just cited, 264 folliculitis patients were examined to determine the type of folliculitis they had, and 49 of them (18.5%) were diagnosed with *Malassezia* folliculitis. *Malassezia globosa* was the most common species found, followed by *Malassezia sympodialis, Malassezia restricta,* and *Malassezia* *furfur*. The closer I looked, the more I found on this topic, and it was just too much to all be in this post, but I’m definitely willing to do an entire post on this if y’all are interested!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Immunology\n\nThe skin prevents invasion by microbes through physical, chemical, and biological means.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Physical Defenses**\n\nThe layers of dead keratinocytes in the stratum corneum physically block microbial invasion because they cannot readily degrade keratin. As soon as microbes that choose to set up house on these cells secrete adhesion proteins and begin to settle in, the cells are sloughed off and replaced with new ones (8).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chemical Defenses**\n\nIn addition to acting as a cooling mechanism, our sweat is inherently antimicrobial; lysozyme, an enzyme that is excreted in sweat, cuts through bacterial cell membranes. Other antimicrobial proteins, known as defensins and cathelicidins, are produced by epithelial cells. These also break bacterial cell membranes to fight off invasion. The high salt concentrations on skin also contribute to making it inhospitable to your run-of-the-mill microbial organism. And then, as most of us know around here, the pH of skin is acidic; it falls on the pH scale at about 5-6. This acidity also makes the skin more difficult to use as a habitat for certain microbes(9).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Biological Defenses**\n\nThe commensal microbiota and immune cells make up the skin’s biological defenses. The microbiota outcompetes most pathogens for nutrients and colonization sites; they fight a battle to keep their territory from the other microbes, which has the (pretty sweet) side effect of benefitting the host (8).\n\nImmune cells beneath the skin surface attack anything that breaches the physical/chemical barrier. Dendritic Cells, immune cells that snatch up foreign protein particles to snitch on them to our lymphocytes, wait below the surface with spider-like arms that are ready and willing to fight (9).  If you’ve made it this far, I applaud you, and here’s a link to a picture of the dendritic cells, they’re really neat: [http://www.micronaut.ch/shop/the-dendritic-cell-h-sapiens-adaptive-immune-response/](http://www.micronaut.ch/shop/the-dendritic-cell-h-sapiens-adaptive-immune-response/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# References\n\n1. **Christensen, G.

    "body": "I have struggled for 15 years with acne, 29F. The list of topicals cover pretty much the big guys - Retin-A, Tazorac, Differin, Epiduo, clindamyacin, benzoyl peroxide, AHA, BHA, azelaic acid...EVERYTHING. Finally resorted to Accutane, but after a six month course, I still wasn’t completely clear. There was something going on that I couldn’t figure out.\n\nI thought perhaps I was allergic to an ingredient - and I did discover (after one year of being addicted to Cosdna) that I was sensitive to coconut oil. I had been cleansing with a coconut oil cleanser and infested my face with closed comedones - so out went that ingredient.\n\nSTILL I was struggling with cc’s and bumpy texture, a few blackheads. Tried repairing my moisture barrier, did the slug life thing for a bit, it did help to an extent but I was still breaking out and feeling dehydrated.\n\nThen...I read about fungal acne, and I did notice that my skin itched at times. I went the anti-fungal route, topically and internally. Zinc pyrithione soap, Nizoral, eliminated esters, started taking raw garlic and probiotics (and cleaned out my system), eliminated dairy, and drank kefir. And my dandruff, eczema and my itchiness stopped! HOWEVER...I was still breaking out, but definitely much less. And I struggled with mild rosacea and PIE (the red marks, not brown). (NOTE: I started craving alcohol a LOT less after an anti-fungal diet, and my tolerance has gotten very low. Only one drink for me!)\n\nIt got me thinking about acne and diet...if acne is an inflammation of the skin, and there is a link to gut health/stress/diet to acne, then...perhaps there is also a link to inflammation inside the body that is showing up on the outside?\n\nSO...then began an anti-inflammatory diet. Turmeric, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, cod liver oil/omega 3’s. Leafy greens, tomatoes, quality extra virgin olive oil, fatty fish (I live overseas so I stock up on bottles at duty-free shops, Italian/Greek/Spanish are the best). And lots and lots of water. In a few days, my appetite changed - I didn’t feel the need to stuff myself during meals, and I started craving bread and sugar less. And lo and behold - my skin is the glowiest its been (without any oils or Vitamin C), and my redness and rosacea vanished. I still have a few small pimples but it’s INCREDIBLE how much of a difference it’s made in my overall redness and complexion.\n\n**DIET**\n\nPROBIOTICS: Organic kefir with flaxseeds, or plain Greek yogurt.\n\nTURMERIC: Turmeric is a potent anti-inflammatory ingredient. Fresh squeezed orange juice with turmeric powder (sounds strange, but the only way I can drink it...plus some Vitamin C), turmeric-honey tea (I add a tsp of turmeric to boiled water, stir with a drizzle of honey), add turmeric to chicken or curries, also turmeric/curcumin supplements.\n\nOMEGA-3’s: Cod liver oil supplements every day (check really carefully the mg of EPA/DHA on the back, they’re all different!), fatty fish, extra virgin olive oil, flaxseeds.\n\nLots of leafy greens (put them into smoothies as well); kiwi, orange, pineapple are high in Vitamin C, tomatoes (vitamin C, lycopene for anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant), blueberries (anti-oxidants).\n\nOnce a week I take extra probiotic and Vitamin D supplements, but prefer to get my nutrition from food. Generally I already eat pretty clean but I focus more on the anti-inflammatory, immmune-boosting, healthy gut foods.\n\n**ROUTINE**\n\nAM\n\nAvene Gentle Cleanser\n\nInstitut Esthederm Propolis Serum\n\nTimeless Squalane Serum\n\nCerave Cream\n\nPM\n\nNoble 2% Zinc Pyrithione soap 3x/week\n\nAvene Gentle Cleanser\n\nPC 2% BHA 1x/week\n\nInstitut Esthederm Propolis Serum\n\nTimeless Squalane Serum\n\nCerave Cream\n\nAvene Cicalfate (if needed for extra moisture)\n\nCheck your diet, people. Skin health is a direct relation to our internal system. So YES, “judge a book by its cover” - the quality of skin on the outside will tell you what’s on the inside.",

It took some trial and error, but I found what worked for me.\n\nEdit :- What worked for me was controlling my stress, anxiety, and panic attacks. I went out a lot, specifically in the mornings, to get as much sunlight as I could. For supplements, I only took vitamin D. Check your tap water to see if it’s hard water. Even though I have soft tap water, I still bought some tap filters to make it cleaner.\n\nI was masturbating a lot, eating unhealthy food, and staying in one place for long periods of time with almost no sunlight exposure, which affected my hair.\n\nFix your diet, go outside more, start working out, and, most importantly, find ways to reduce your stress as much as possible.\n\nFor medications I used Ketoconazole and zinc pyrithione but I didn’t use it continuously \n\nWhat didn’t help me :- Was Using medicated shampoos and lotions ,eating shit tons of supplements, washing my scalp everyday and last getting depressed about it \n\nEdit 2 :- Please check if you have hard water running in you tap and visit a dermatologist and see what will come to your way . The things I mentioned above worked for me but I can’t guarantee same to others \n\nI visited tons of dermatologists and nothing really worked for me . The shampoos, creams , lotions ointments etc \n\n\nIf you’re dealing with it and have questions, feel free to ask happy to share what helped!",

    "body": "# What is seborrheic dermatitis?\n\nIt is a red, itchy, scaly, flaky rash that I commonly found on the scalp, or nose and surrounds. It looks similar to eczema or other dermatitis conditions. [Here](https://usercontent2.hubstatic.com/8387285_f260.jpg) is an image of what a mild-serious case may look like.\n\n# What causes seborrheic dermatitis?\n\nNobody really knows, however it is believed to be an inflammatory reaction to high amounts of Malassezia yeast. As with many skin conditions lots of factors can inflame this condition; alcohol, stress, drug use, poor hygiene, cold/dry weather, and other medication.\n\n# Treatments\n\nI'm going to list what I tried and how it worked for me - please note that this doesn't mean they will/won't work for you, different things work for different people.\n\n**Clotrimazole**\n\nWhen I was told it was a fungal issue I used this OTC anti-fungal. It did nothing. Might have made it worse. I've since learned that ketocanozole is typically recommended but I did not try this. Zinc pyrithione and selenium sulfide may also be used.\n\n\n**Keratolytics**\n\nI used clearasil pads that have salicylic acid (2.0%) in them. This helped remove the scaly skin but did not solve the issue at all. Tried the pimple cream too but that's also just salicylic acid so same results.\n\n**Benzoyl Peroxide**\n\nThis is an acne treatment cream. I thought it might work. It made the skin more dry but did reduce the redness. So yeah don't do this.\n\n**Salt baths**\n\nThis worked surprisingly well. By washing my face thoroughly with warm water, than mixing in a tablespoon of salt into warm water and washing my face with that for a couple minutes, and then washing with cold to close the pores I saw a reduction in redness and less scaly skin. However, it's salt. Shit dries out your entire face and makes it feel tight.\n\n**Hydrocortisone**\n\nWorked magic. Applied in the morning, applied at night. Woke up with a clear face. Legitimately the best treatment I tried. A 1% cream is OTC so you do not need to see a doctor. This is my recommended treatment.\n\n# Moisturizers\n\nOne issue with this type of skin condition is that it causes dry skin, so you want to moisturize, however a lot of moisturizers contain oils that will cause the condition to flare up, leaving you with even more dry skin.\n\nYou need to look for a moisturizer without oil if possible. Glycol, glycerine, mineral oils, and vegtable oils (sometimes listed as an acid) are all very common in moisturizers, even the 'all natural' ones because these are natural ingredients. Avoid them. \n\nDimethicone will not do well with your skin as it traps moisture in, but accelerated fungus growth. On the other hand parabens can help your skin, despite being quite harsh.\n\nShop around and find what works.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis is just my experience, and is not a conclusive guide by any stretch. Hopefully this can help someone out there fix their skin!",

The flaky skin appeared between my eyebrows and research led me to believe it was weird dandruff. I tried so many things before seeing a doctor. VERY aggressive BHA usage (OTC salicylic acid) since it seemed to work for a moment, dandruff shampoo, exfoliation, more moisturizer, no moisturizer. None of them did anything for me, at least nothing that would last all day.\n\nI finally went to a dermatologist and was diagnosed because the skin between my eyebrows was visibly damaged. I got brown spots from all of my poor skincare habits trying to treat it and was getting wrinkles before I was 20. He gave me a prescription for Xolegel, an anti-fungal and told me he'd give me a stronger bottle if it didn't work after a few weeks. The doctor also gave me a very, very small hydrocortisone cream and said to use it only if I really had something important coming and it flared up. You can't use it too much or it will damage your skin further. Naturally, went home and used the cortisone so I could remember my face without this problem, and then started the Xolegel once it was clear.\n\nI never finished the whole bottle of Xolegel I got after diligently using it for 3 months or so, but a few years later it hasn't returned. If it does flare up again one day, I will go get a fresh bottle from the derm rather than bothering to self-treat because it was just so much easier.\n\nI would recommend anyone else who reads this and believes they might have Seb derm go to a dermatologist if they are able. Hydrocortisone can be an \"out of the frying pan and into the fire\" experience for some people by thinning the skin, causing premature aging, etc.",

I treated it with everything I could, even prescribed 2% ketoconazole shampoo leaving it on for 10 minutes every day or second day but nothing seemed to help or get rid of it. \n\nWhat eventually got it to calm down significantly was 2% zinc pyrithione shampoo. But I still had itching that would not go away no matter what, though not as bad as before. I continued using the 2% shampoo and just continuing along, but I still noticed some days my scalp, face and neck felt very hot and inflamed. \n\nI ended up mentioning this at dinner to my buddy who is a biologist, and he told me about something called demodex. I initially thought it was some shampoo or something, but he told me it was a mite that lives in follicles and lives on sebum and mallasezia. He said everyone has them, but an overgrowth can result in irritation and itch and that he had it once. He treated it with a demodex shampoo (not going to mention the name of which one since this is not an ad but it had tea tree oil and sulphur in it.) I used this for 2-3 days in a row and felt a major relief and realized that most of the issue was no longer sebderm but actually an overgrowth of these mites that you can’t even see. \n\nYou can also take ivermectin to kill them off if the shampoo doesn’t work, but it made a very significant difference for me. \n\nI still use a clean ketoconazole/salicylic acid shampoo but my issues have mostly gone away. My scalp and hair seem to be healing and I no longer have the constant itch. \n\nI hope this is able to help some of you, it was one of the most frustrating things to deal with and I was treating the wrong thing for quite a while.

        "body": "Glad to know I'm not alone in this. I have been struggling with red, itchy patches all over my face for the past 2 years. You can track my posts on this sub to see how desperate I have been to solve this problem. Went to two different dermatologists who diagnosed me with eczema and sebderm, gave me steroids, and sent me on my way. The steroids gave me perioral dermatitis and would only provide short relief. Here were my symptoms that convinced me to find another dermatologist:\n\n1. The rashes did not get better with various antifungals (clotrimazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole), oral and topical\n\n2. They started on the center of my forehead, eyebrows, and both cheeks, but over the months spread to other parts of my face, including temples, jawline, and chin\n\n3. My skin felt rough, like sandpaper. It would be very itchy when I just got out of the shower, or when I was stressed or didn't sleep enough, but the itchiness would randomly get worse every two weeks or so. My face would get red and hot, too, during these flares\n\n4. Every pore seemed clogged with white stuff, which looked like keratin plugs. I would be able to stretch out my skin and see these plugs protrude out of the skin, and the itchiness would normally subside once I've picked at all the plugs in a given area and gotten them out\n\n5. My face became so sensitive to everything. I couldn't be out in the sun too long, makeup didn't stick and made me itchier, and I would be dry no matter how much I moisturized\n\n6. My face became darker than my neck\n\n7. I would feel random crawling sensations\n\n8. The itchiness calmed with 10% sulfur, but this didn't solve the redness and irritation.\n\nAfter recently finding another derm, I finally got a diagnosis: it had been **demodicosis** or an overpopulation of demodex face mites all along. I was told to stop moisturizing and all steroids. I have been prescribed a month of oral metronidazole and doxycycline. I saw results but not fast enough. I was finally put on permethrin 5%, an anti-parasitic, in addition to the antibiotics, and **BAM**, it has made such a dramatic difference. I almost forgot my skin could be this smooth. I still have redness and itchiness occasionally, so it's not 100% solved yet. My doctor has told me it'll be weeks before the mites get under control because of their life cycle. To everyone who could relate to my condition and has been diagnosed with sebderm, I cannot stress this enough: **get a second, or even a third, fourth opinion if you have to,** it really could be something else entirely. Most importantly, don't lose hope. Once a proper diagnosis has been made, the recovery process could be faster than you'd expect.",

Hope this helps people.)\n\nThis is Day 1 of Treatment - I will be sharing my journey on this subreddit for those inclined.  \n\nI am a 22 years old male - living in very cold weather.  I like spicy foods - I have a high body fat percentage - sue me. \n\n**Background**\n\nI have suffered SebDerm for roughly 5-6 years now.  I was prescribed **Mometasone Fuorate** by my GP, and to my horror, I used this steroidal ointment for longer than prescribed.  Eventually, I decided to stop using the ointment as I was scared this would cause permanent damage to my skin, which it seems to have already done - but I'm really not sure about this - may visit a derm to assess. \n\nAnyways, down to the good stuff.  \n\n**My SebDerm locations (redness scale 1 - 10):** \n\n\\- nasal folds (10) \n\n\\- front of nose itself (10)\n\n\\- a small circular patch just to right of the bridge of my nose (10)\n\n\\- a big circular patch on the right side of my face (10)\n\n\\- under both my ears (5)\n\n\\- a thin linear patch on my hairline (which I'm ignoring for now - don't feel like experimenting with new products on my hairline for risk of hair-loss, which I have definitely had quite a lot of these past 2 years) (3)\n\n\\- (possibly) under my left armpit (10)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Treatment Journey Day 1 (will continuously edit)**\n\nLast night I ran a quick test, nothing full-blown:\n\nI diluted white vinegar (**acetic acid** is supposed to disrupt the **biofilm** that is created by the Malassezia yeast, resulting in a rough like texture of the skin) with a ratio of 1:4 and applied it to my red nose and side of my face using a Q-Tip (and not using my fingers).  After 30-60 seconds, I rinsed off - applied Squalane oil as a moisturiser and went to bed.  The next morning (today), I woke up and the redness had gone down to a 6 (from 10) but not entirely.  The skin still felt rough.  \n\nBefore my shower, I repeated the Vinegar routine, waited 30-60 seconds, and then hopped into the shower.  I cleansed my face with water -> rubbed **Vanicream Zinc Pyrithione 2% barsoap** all over my face and under my armpits and rinsed -> followed with **Clinical Strength H&S Selenium Sulfide** shampoo on both my face and my scalp -> followed with the a biotin conditioner, so as to not completely dry out my hair.  \n\n(**Observation 1:** after my shower, I noticed there was a lot of flaking around my nose, which I gently rubbed off - never scratch).  The redness was same as before the shower - do not expect this to subside until after a week of treatment at the very least.  I followed this with a thin layer of **Squalane** Oil on my facial problem areas.  \n\n**After my shower, I realised that I forgot to do the Nizoral anti-fungal because I'm dumb - if I don't make any progress today, I'll remember to apply Nizoral tomorrow.  In other words, I did not follow the treatment steps:**\n\n1. Vinegar\n2. Vanicream Zinc Soap\n3. Selenium Sulfide Shampoo\n4. (**skipped**) Anti-fungal - **Nizoral** (could also use Azelaic Acid 10% or Fanacea's gel which has an azelaic acid concentration of 15%)\n5. Any Moistruiser that does not feed the Malassezia = I used Squalane oil - can also use MCT oil",

Just bought shampoo with ZP without any problems in Czechia - [https://www.bioderma-cz.com/nase-produkty/node/ds-sampon](https://www.bioderma-cz.com/nase-produkty/node/ds-sampon) .  \n  \nI've tried so many different substances to cure my Sebderm in my scalp but nothing works. Vinegar, common anti-dandruff shampoos, Nizoral, Ketoconazole, Uriage shampoos, Uriage cleansing water, Vichy shampoo, Ducray DS shampoo, Ambiderman but nothing works. There is always itchy, burning red skin with dandruffs. I've visited various skin-care specialists. Each prescribed something else from the products above and said it is not curable and he/she can't do anything about it apart from corticosteroids. It is the only substance that takes away the problems. But they are not suitable for long usage. So after 2 weeks of using I got no red marks in my scalp and no itchy skin. But 1-2 weeks after not using corticosteroids it's everything as it was before. Recently I bought shampoo with zinc pyrithione that I linked above and I believe it helps but I don't want to get ahead of myself. I guess it is a long term process. Nevertheless I don't like seeing that it could have such negative effects for health.\n\nIngredients:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8uvvymzirzb1.png?width=667&format=png&auto=webp&s=62dd3bdf3dc874125a02fce24af9878828a5ec0a",

It's a great emergency protocol though.\n\n**The summary (focusing on external factors only)**\n\nIn order to manage/treat sebderm (whether on scalp or face) in the most effective way possible, there are five things we need to do:\n\n1. tackle the biofilm\n2. kill the fungus/yeast\n3. replenish our skin barrier\n4. use mild surfactant\n5. reduce/lower the inflammation\n\nHowever, most dermatologists are getting getting 1/5 or 2/5 of the story by prescribing different anti fungal shampoos e.g. zinc pyrithione, selenium sulfide, and ketoconazole. Some will prescribe clobetasol for treating the inflammation. In order to solve the problem at its root, all five components must be tackled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**More on 1. biofilm**\n\nBiofilms are formed when malassezia, the overgrowth of which causes sebderm, adhere to surfaces and excrete a glue-like substance to protect themselves from antifungals. The biofilm can make them up to 1000 times more resistant to antifungals. This is why the antifungals prescribed by derms only work for a while. Without tacking the biofilm problem, upping the concentration of harsh chemical will only further destroy our skin barrier, which is the root cause of our sebderm.\n\nTo disrupt the biofilm, xylitol at 5% has been clinically proven to be effective, so is selenium sulfide. However, the problem with selenium sulfide is that it's a harsh chemical that may further destroy our skin barrier. I've ordered a biofilm shampoo from the biotech company listed below (disclaimer: not affiliated). It came up when I was searching for sebderm biofilm shampoo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**More on 2. killing the fungus**\n\nAvoid any products that may feed malassezia. And use an anti fungal. Many things will do, e.g. MCT oil without lauric acid, ciclopirox, and ketoconazole. I think garlic and sea salt would also work. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**More on 3. replenishing our skin barrier**\n\nThere is actually a study that shows that a glycerol-containing leave-on scalp treatment reduces dandruff ([https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264904431\\_A\\_high\\_glycerol-containing\\_leave-on\\_scalp\\_care\\_treatment\\_to\\_improve\\_dandruff](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264904431_A_high_glycerol-containing_leave-on_scalp_care_treatment_to_improve_dandruff)).\n\nTherefore, adding a scalp treatment as a moisturizer may be beneficial. Be aware of the other ingredients in the formula that may feed malassezia though. I'm going to experiment with a DIY glycerin/niacinamide/panthenol scalp treatment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**More on 4. mild surfactants**\n\nMany of the anti-dandruff shampoos in the market use very harsh surfactants that may further disrupt our skin barrier. Although many dermatologists claim that these surfactants, e.g. sodium lauryl sulfates, are fine at a lower concentration, I've experimented this personally. I used a medicated selsun blue shampoo with harsh surfactants on my hand. Then my skin immediately felt rough and bumpy. This is healthy skin with an intact skin barrier. Imagine what our poor scalp, which is already suffering from sebderm, has to go through every time we shampoo. And we usually don't apply a moisturizer to our scalp.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, this is not to say we have to avoid harsh surfactants at all costs. A good place to start is probably to use more potent surfactants for a short period of time to remove any buildup, then switch to no-silicone hair products with mild surfactants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**More on 5. reducing/lowering the inflammation**\n\nInflammation is a product of the overgrowth of malassezia. Once we have tackled problems 1-4 above, this should not be a problem. However, while we are still suffering from sebderm, some ingredients such as panthenol, niacinamide, licorice extract, colloidal oatmeal help calm down the inflammation and sooth the skin. Look for shampoos and/or scalp treatments that contain these ingredients. They can also help us rebuild our skin barrier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhen dermatologists only focus on instructing us to use harsh chemical shampoos for a prolonged period, this probably worsens the problem as it furthers damage our skin barrier and does not give our skin the opportunity to heal itself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**References (disclaimer: I'm not affiliated with any of the following sources)**\n\n[https://kanebiotech.com/biofilms/](https://kanebiotech.com/biofilms/)\n\n[http://www.ringierevents.com/eve\\_files/files/e86a92be8063408e98b37f5cb1b4565b.pdf](http://www.ringierevents.com/eve_files/files/e86a92be8063408e98b37f5cb1b4565b.pdf)\n\n[https://www.dandruffdeconstructed.com/biofilms-seborrheic-dermatitis/](https://www.dandruffdeconstructed.com/biofilms-seborrheic-dermatitis/)",

The bacteria in your gut compete with fungi. If you don’t have enough healthy bacteria, the fungi will over colonize the gut. A simple way to increase good bacteria is through eating more fiber/probiotic. \n\nI have also seen other redditors mentioning stress as a cause for their flares. \n\nBakers p & s liquid broke down my bio films fast.\n\nI also believe that the body needs nutrients. In other words, it is important to take a multivitamin. The immune system will struggle to function correctly without vitamin d, zinc, vitamin c, and so on. Studies have shown that histamine is 2.5 times greater in SD patients. I’m starting to think about ordering a food allergy/sensitivity test. Maybe food isn’t the direct cause of my SD but it may help. Sometimes children develop eczema due to sensitivities to certain ingredients.",

It has gone away both times when I was pregnant and then came back with a vengeance both times after. I have had the worst flare of my life for the past like 6 months or so, horrible plaques, so itchy, seemingly everywhere on my scalp, getting stuck in my hair, etc. i have spent hours scouring Reddit, reading research articles, trying steroids, seeing multiple doctors, and all the things to no avail. I FINALLY have gotten it under control. Here is what has worked for me (finally, sob):\n\n1. Vitamin D supplementation. got a million blood labs done and it looked like I am low in vitamin D. According to the research, it seems like a fair amount of people who suffer from seb derm have vitamin D insufficiency, so worth looking into.\n\n2. Scalp oiling/ moisturizing. I honestly think this is the biggest one that has made a difference. I thought it wasn’t an option for me because my hair was getting greasy approximately like 8-10 hours after showering and shampooing. But then I decided to try it, and just after one day it made a huge difference. My understanding is that the anti-dandruff shampoos we are all told to use are hugely drying. My scalp was getting so dry that the oil production went into insane overdrive trying to rectify the issue, so it became like a terrible cycle. So now I oil my hair (it seems like MCT oil works well for people, I use a scalp tea tree oil mixture; I don’t think it matters all that much.) every other shampoo. On my really bad dry patches I also use Aveeno salicylic acid moisturizing cream and really rub it in. I really massage my scalp with both the cream and the oil, and leave it for an hour+. I think replenishing moisture is a vital and overlooked step, even (ESPECIALLY) if your hair is really greasy.\n\n3. Seb Derm shampoo. For me, the only one that seems to do anything is zinc pyrithione. I think this is a YMMV moment because it seems it works differently for different people. I have tried every other kind and this is what works for me, better than even 2% ketoconazole. I do a double shampoo with this after my scalp/oiling moisturizing. \n\n4. Don’t let hair stay wet! Dry it after a shower as quickly as you can. \n\nThe tl;dr here is basically check your vitamin D levels and supplement if low, oil and moisturize your scalp frequently even if / especially if your hair is greasy; use the shampoos they tell you to, but try all the different kinds if you aren’t having success; dry your hair after showering.\n\nGood luck, I hope this helps even one person!",

    "body": "Hi Fellow Addicts! I've been here working on my routine for a few years. I've tried every variant on the sidebar routine, mostly different combinations of CeraVe and Cetaphil products and OCM. All of this dramatically improved my skin (with a few tragic setbacks) but I was having trouble getting over that last \"hump.\" You know the hump. When your skin looks way better than when you first started, but instead of being completely clear you're down to one or two manageable pimples at all times? It's those last few that are sometimes the hardest to get rid of. Something about decreasing marginal returns, I guess. In any event, this is what finally worked for me to get me over the hump.\n\nI was using Stridex in the red box for a few years, knowing that it was probably too drying and that the menthol wasn't doing me any favors. Being the cheapass that I am, I was unwilling to shell out for Paula's Choice. Then, a year or so ago, Stridex came out with this new product called T-zone gel. It's basically just salicylic acid suspended in aloe vera gel. I hate the packaging, which is a stupid little blue plastic ball that is a complete waste of plastic for the 1 oz of product you get, but it only takes a little bit of this stuff to cover your whole face. I replaced my Stridex redbox with this stuff, morning and night. Some improvement, but no dice on getting over the hump.\n\nAt the time, I was using Cetaphil in the tub as my moisturizer because it's a lower pH than regular CeraVe in the tub. Realizing that my skin is very sensitive to pH, I wondered -- *can I go even lower?* That's where CeraVe Renewing SA cream in the tub enters the picture. (NOT the lotion! I've read that the tub version is lower pH than the lotion version.) It's non-greasy, and beneficial ingredients include SA (duh), glycerine, niacinamide, and hyaluronic acid. It markets itself for \"extremely dry rough bumpy skin\" which made me worried that it was really for KP, not acne. Was I going to exfoliate my whole face off? So I quit my normal exfoliant, figuring the SA renewing cream would double as both exfoliant and moisturizer. THIS WAS A MISTAKE. After a few weeks of using no exfoliant and only SA cream, I broke out bad. So I reintroduced the Stridex T-zone gel, and went back through the purge all over again.   \n\nNow that I'm on the other side of the purge, using both the Stridex T-zone gel and the Renewing Cream morning and night, my skin is completely clear and glowing. Although that sounds like a lot of SA, I find keeping my skin at a *consistent but gentle* low pH is what works for me. I have to admit that another major player in this is probably my sunscreen, which contains a high zinc content and which I've raved about in other posts.\n\nAll this being said, I admit that for Christmas I've asked for Paula's Choice 2% BHA liquid, so if anyone gets it for me I will see how that compares to the stridex come January. I've also asked for DermaZinc pyrithione zinc cream to see how that works as a spot treatment. \n\nThis was long, but reading other people's anecdotes on here has really helped me. I hope you find something in here to help you!\n\nFor reference, here is current full routine:\n\nMorning:\n\n* Wash with CeraVe foaming cleanser\n\n* Thayer's rose toner (wait a min for it to dry)\n\n* Stridex T-zone gel (wait a couple of minutes for it to dry)\n\n* CeraVe Renewing SA Cream (wait few minutes for it to dry)\n\n* Replenix Sheer Physical Sunscreen SPF 50 (13.75% zinc oxide, no titanium dioxide, no white cast!!)\n\nNight:\n\n* OCM with KOSE Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil (pink bottle -- mineral-oil based, contains emulsifier, so I just rinse off and do not follow with another cleanser)\n\n* Thayer's rose toner (wait a min for it to dry)\n\n* Stridex T-zone gel (wait a couple of minutes for it to dry)\n\n* CeraVe Renewing SA Cream (wait few minutes for it to dry)\n\nAnd I spot treat as necessary with CVS brand 20% zinc oxide cream.",

I'm still hoping that I'll get around to do the actually writing.\n\nNote: I do not include prescription treatments. I do mention retinoids, but Differin is OTC now.\n\n***\n\n**Antibacterial:** aka kills acne bacteria.\n\n+ Benzoyl Peroxide is the biggie. Kills the bacteria, it won't ever become resistant to BP, reduces inflammation, keeps dead skin cells from building up, and can enter pores. *Usage Suggestion:* 2.5% has been shown to work pretty much as well as stronger formulations and works great in short-contact therapy. So, to make BP as gentle as it'll get: apply 2.5% for a few minutes or so and wash off. Yay!\n\n+ Azelaic Acid is surprisingly cool too. 15% has been shown [equally effective](http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/16281587) as BP, and might have [similar results](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11701404) to 0.05% isotretinoin (both studies linked used AA + antibiotic fyi).\n\n+ Other Great Stuff: Sulphur, neem oil, tea tree oil, salicylic acid, and blue light therapy. \n\n**& Antimicrobial** in case you wanna prevent that kind of colonization. Benzoyl peroxide and maybe tea tree oil will help you.\n\n\n**& Antifungal.** Avoid those nasties with neem oil. And probably stuff I'm forgetting. Edit: zinc pyrithione, thank you /u/mastiii!\n\n\n**& Antiseptic:** Wanna reduce the possibility of infection?\n\n+ Neem oil and tea tree oil as above, plus perilla and karanja oil. Be warned, I'm getting most of that info from Garden of Wisdom and not peer-reviewed science.\n\n+ Zinc. An [underrated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4120804/) little baby. Zinc sulfate that can prevent acne at 5%. There's a not-very-readable list of products [here](http://cosdna.com/eng/stuff_prod.php?in1=62d146399) but I believe you need to log in first.\n\n\n**Anti-inflammatory** stuff to prevent pores from getting *extra* clogged and icky.\n\n+ Salicylic acid, azelaic acid, neem, tea tree and perilla oil, zinc - we went other these already.\n\n+ Retinoids! Differin is the only one available OTC, but it's less irritating than tretinoin. It works extra well with the addiction of antibacterial agents.\n\n+ Niacinamide is something you should be taking a good, long, hard look at. It's [been](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23786503) [shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7657446) to be as effective as 0.1% clindamyacin (prescription antibacterial). It also suppresses [sebum production](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14764170600717704?journalCode=ijcl20) at only two percent and promotes wound healing. Plus a [ton more stuff](https://www.google.com/search?q=A+Review+of+the+Range+of+Effects+of+Niacinamide+in+Human+Skin&oq=A+Review+of+the+Range+of+Effects+of+Niacinamide+in+Human+Skin&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64l3.279j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).\n\n\n\n**Bacteriostatic:** salicylic acid, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide. These prevent bacteria from reproducing so rapidly.\n\n\n**Comedolytic:** benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, retinoids. What it sounds like, prevents comodos from forming.\n\n\n**Keratolytic** stuff prevents dead cell build-up and softens keratin (good for dry skin).\n\n+ Urea has been written about [far better](https://simpleskincarescience.com/urea-for-skin/) than I ever could. The tl;dr is it's hydrating, exfoliating, and helps your skin [be better](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3352965/). It also makes people really, really pretty.\n\n+ Sulphur has keratolytic benefits, antibacterial ones, and antiseptic ones. It works for acne (I have a figure of 2% but no idea from where...) as well as psoriasis and eczema.\n\n+ Plus the good ol' standards, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and retinoids.\nsulphur\n\n\n**Sebostatic** is a really cool category. These good 'uns help regulate and/or reduce sebum production. They include: benzoyl peroxide, niacinamide, retinoids, and zinc. Surprise, surprise. \n\n**Other Stuff I Haven't Sorted:**\n\n+ Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (SAP), a vitamin c derivative, helps acne. I didn't write [this post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/sodium-ascorbyl-phosphate/) either.\n\n+ The sebum of people with acne has been shown to have higher than usual levels of oleic acid, which is kind of goopier. Using oils high in linoleic acid (rosehip, borage, evening primrose, and a tooon more) might help to sort of dilute sebum into a freer-flowing substance. \n\n***\n\n**Super TL;DR**\n\n- Antibacterial: neem oil, tea tree oil, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, sulphur, azelaic acid, blue light therapy\n\n- & Antimicrobial: tea tree oil possibly, benzoyl peroxide\n\n- & Antifungal: neem oil, zinc pyrithione\n\n- & Antiseptic: neem oil, tea tree oil, perilla oil, karanja oil, zinc\n\n- Anti-inflammatory: neem oil, tea tree oil, niacinamide, adapalene/retinoids, salicylic acid, azelaic acid, perilla oil, zinc\n\n- Bacteriostatic: salicylic acid, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide\n\n- Comedolytic: benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, retinoids\n\n- Keratolytic: benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, sulphur, retinoids, urea\n\n- Sebostatic: benzoyl peroxide, niacinamide, retinoids, zinc",

    "body": "Hey all! I'm a long time lurker with this being my first post here so I hope the formatting of this post turns out alright. This past year I've become a lot more attentive and mindful of my skin's condition and what it reacts to, so I wanted to share my experiences with some products! Learning that I'm sensitive to the chemical UV filter octinoxate was a bummer as most sunscreen and makeup products contain it, but I have found a few products that have worked for me and hopefully they may work with anyone else with similar sensitivity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSkin type: Oily, acne-prone, sensitive\n\nFoundation shade: NC15-NC20\n\nCurrent AM routine:\n\n* Ceracolla Moisture Lotion\n* Holika Holika Good Cera Super Ceramide Cream (optional, depends on what sunscreen I apply)\n* Sunscreen\n\nCurrent PM routine:\n\n* Bifesta Eye Makeup Remover\n* Bioderma Micellar Water\n* IOPE Ideal Cleansing Foam Whipping Brightener EX\n* Curology (.017% tretinoin, 4% azelaic acid, .25% zinc pyrithione)\n* Holika Holika Good Cera Super Ceramide Cream\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSKINCARE\n\n**IOPE Ideal Cleansing Foam Whipping Brightener EX**\n\nI'm on my second bottle of this and I don't know why my skin liked it in the past. It feels stripping, it is heavily fragranced, and I think claiming that a cleansing foam can be brightening is bogus as it doesn't sit on my face long. However, it hasn't irritated or broken out my skin and that's more than I can say for Krave Beauty's Matcha Hemp Cleanser or LRP's Toleriane Hydrating Cleanser. Off to search for a new no-frills cleanser! **WNRP.**\n\n**IOPE Bio Essence Intensive Conditioning**\n\nI love this and cannot justify even trying out another FTE because this fulfills the criteria of everything I want-- evens my skintone, brightens my skin, and gives the appearance of smaller pores all in a relatively short time (I feel a difference after even an initial one application) without irritating my skin. I have temporarily stopped using it as I simplified my routine to focus on hydration (due to upping my tret % two months ago), but am excited to start using it again soon! **WRP.**\n\n**Ceracolla Moisture Lotion**\n\nI purchased this in preparation of starting tret 5 months ago, and love it! It has a relatively clean and simple ingredient list, and did not feel overly tacky or thick on my oily skin. Using only one layer a day, I don't think it provides a dramatic or instant plumping effect, but I feel that it is reliably hydrating for me. I can definitely tell a difference in how parched my skin feels when I apply a drying sunscreen over this and without this. I'm sure this also goes for a lot of hydrating toners, but I have stopped using chapstick after this because I realized my lips stay more hydrated with this. **WRP.**\n\n**Holika Holika Good Cera Super Ceramide Cream**\n\nI'm on my third jar of this and cannot live without it. Thank you to someone on this subreddit who introduced it to me when I was facing a damaged moisture barrier in the past! This is a bit embarrassing, but as a 27 year old I can't recall anytime in my adulthood where my skin has been as soft as when I started applying this. Unfortunately, it doesn't have the cleanest ingredient list (essential oils, silicones, and not fungal acne safe), so as with all skincare YMMV. I heard this can be a dupe for Dr. Jart's Ceramidin Cream, but I haven't tried that one so unfortunately can't speak on that. **WRP.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSUN CARE\n\n**ACSEINE Super Sunshield EX SPF50+ PA++++**\n\nThis product is very overpriced with very little product. While there is a light peachy beige tint, this waterproof mineral sunscreen still leaves a white cast on my NC15-NC20 skin when an adequate 1/4 is applied. I wish it came with darker tints, because I did enjoy that it was very mattifying and filled in my pores quite a bit. While I'd likely use this under full coverage makeup days, I can't justify the price and small quantity! **WNRP.**\n\n**ANESSA Perfect UV Sunscreen Aqua Booster Mild SPF50+ PA++++ (2017)**\n\nGiven the plentiful UV filters (with chemical filters that I'm not reactive to!!!!), I really wanted to love this waterproof mild sunscreen as my everyday sunscreen. However, as an oily skin girl it's difficult for me to make this work on a daily basis. On first application, it gives a powdery satin finish which I love as it feels very smoothing. However, I feel pools of grease by the 3-4 hour mark. I still would prefer to wear this when I'm outdoors for a long period of time though. **WRP.**\n\n**Shiseido d program Allerbarrier Essence SPF40 PA+++**\n\nI believe this mineral sunscreen is marketed as being a good protection against dust pollution, all while remaining paraben free, alcohol free, and mineral oil free. I really enjoyed that it felt light and milky, and gives a semi-matte finish with minimal white cast. It does ineveitable start becoming oily on my skin after a few hours of wear, but nothing close to the ANESSA mild. I think it's comparable to the Etude House Mild Airy Sunprise, but just a little bit less mattifying given the lack of alcohol. It surprisingly has a very different texture to its BB version that I've reviewed below. All in all, it feels elegant on the skin but I'm unlikely to repurchase since Etude House is half the price. I also am wary of how light it feels on the skin and don't feel confident in how well it protects against UV rays. **WNRP.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMAKEUP\n\n**Shiseido d program Allerbarrier Essence BB SPF 40 PA+++ (Natural)**\n\nBeing a sister product of the untinted one I reviewed above, I had thought the texture would be similar, but this one feels much thicker to wear. It provided me up to medium coverage pretty easily. I always wear this on top of a sunscreen, and found this to be more on the mattifying side. I don't think it wears well with it's sister sunscreen underneath, as it got greasy pretty quickly. However, I wore this over top Etude House Sunrprise Mild Airy and loved the matte finish! I found the color to be quite yellow, and it oxidizes a bit an hour or so after application, so I definitely want to try the Light shade next time. **WRP.**\n\n**Ettusais BB Mineral Gel SPF 25 PA++ (Natural Beige)**\n\nTrue to the brand, I found that this product did not clog my pores. The color leans slightly on the yellow side, and provided sheer light coverage. It gives a satin finish on my skin that looked nice for about the first hour and then it got really greasy really quickly. Given the lack of coverage, the short wearability, and the lack of uv protection, I would not repurchase this. **WNRP.**\n\n**Cezanne UV Clear Face Powder SPF28 PA+++ (01 Light)**\n\nWhile the mattifying strength on this pressed setting powder is nothing amazing or close to any other mattifying powders I've tried, I enjoy the way it sets my undereye concealer. It stays in place without creasing or looking cakey. Although there is very little coverage, I also liked using this powder when touching up my makeup throughout the day,as that little bit of coverage did help. It's affordable, blurs my pores well, and is great for touch ups. **WRP.**\n\n**Canmake Quick Lash Curler (Clear and Black)**\n\nA bit about my eyes-- I have oily hooded monolids with straight lashes that point downward. This product is marketed as a quick topcoat to use over your mascara to keep your eyelashes curled. However, I've only seen people use this as a base coat like a primer and that's the way I prefer to use the clear original version. The lasting power of the curl is amazing and really lasts all day. I then tried the black version, and felt that it sufficed as an all in one primer + mascara. It separated, curled, and provided a more volume than the Kiss Me Heroine Make Volume & Curl Mascara\n\n(all while smudging less than that mascara). The black one is definitely my holy grail. **WRP.**\n\n**Flowfushi MOTE Mascara IMPACT 01 Volume (Black)**\n\nOn the opposite side of the mascara spectrum, I really disliked this mascara even after priming my lashes with the Canmake Quick Lash Curler. It's a tubing mascara which I've heard great things about, but the heavy formula would weigh my lashes down. Using this product alone was unthinkable because my lashes will definitely not stay curled. Due to the heavy formula, I also feel like my lashes would clump together in an unflattering way making it look like I had three sticks pointing out of my eyes. Removing this was even more difficult than removing Kiss Me Heroine Make or Canmake mascaras, even with oil cleansers or the Bifesta eye makeup remover. **WNRP.**\n\n**Flowfushi MOTELINER Liquid Eyeliner (Black)**\n\nWhat can I say about this eyeliner that hasn't been said already! It has a very lovely brush that makes drawing a cat eye almost fool proof. Lines draw on so smooth. It's not the most waterproof eyeliner I've used, but found that with an eye primer and some powder over my eyelids, this eyeliner does not budge. I'm very sad this brand is possibly being discontinued? but hopefully they are only rebranding. **WRP.**\n\n**Flowfushi The Matsuge Biyou-eki Eyelash Serum**\n\nLast year I had eye lash extensions for most of the year followed by a few months of having permed lashes. Needless to say, I had severely abused my lashes and as a result they were sparse and fell out quickly. I used this every night for about 15 nights, and saw my lashes grow back into their regular state prior to all the abuse. I now use it more as a preventative measure to keep my lashes from falling out prematurely as I still curl and use mascara on a daily basis, knowing that it's not going to provide any dramatic lengthening such as using something like Latisee. **WRP.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are the next products I'd like to try-- If anyone has tried them please let me know what you think!\n\n* Kuramoto Bijin Hakumai Ferment Milk (Looking forward to brightening effects!)\n* IPSA - The Time Reset Aqua (I heard this is good for controlling oily skin)\n* Mychelle Sun Shield SPF50 (non-AB but like that it has 20% zinc oxide)\n* Paula's Choice RESIST Super-Light Daily Wrinkle Defense SPF 30 (non-AB but also like that it has 13% zinc oxide)\n\nLastly, oxtinoxate-free/sensitive skin redditors, what are your faves?",

        "body": "To give you some background on my skin: I have oily, acne/dehydration/clog prone skin with facial redness, PIH, PIE and starting at the beginning of this year, eczema! I live in Arizona, which is finally shifting into an arid heaven temp wise. The UV index is always on the higher side, so I have to take my sunscreens seriously. My mac shade range is NW10 - NW15. \n\nMy favorite sensitive skin sunscreen is the &Free Sensitive UV Cream. It is rated SPF50+/PA++++, physical only filters (zinc oxide and titanium dioxide), alcohol free and fragrance free. It has squalane and ceramides to help combat the typically drying effects physical filter only sunscreens give. [Ratzilla](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/and-free-sensitive-uv-cream/) has the full ingredients list. The biggest downside is the price and the amount you get in the tube. It's about $20 for a 30 gram tube at Kirei-Station or ebay.\n\nThe sunscreen is not a cream, despite it being present in the name. It is a thick, viscous milk/thin-ish western lotion consistency. It is on the silicone heavy side and does better when you pat it in instead of trying to rub it in. Despite all of the silicones, it is rather light weight, feels like you're wearing a light weight liquid foundation on the face. I stop feeling it on my skin a few seconds after application, but if you are not used to wearing a liquid foundation, it may take longer for the feeling to disappear. To me, it doesn't have a film consistency and feels a little occlusive. It dries down to a satin matte finish and does help control my oil throughout the day. Like all physical only sunscreens, it will collect and emphasize any dry flaky patches. However, this doesn't do it as badly as other ones I have tried. It does leave a slight white-cast on my NW10-NW15 skin, but that nearly vanishes after 10 minutes. I don't mind the slight white-cast since it helps tone down my facial redness. It has not balled up from my skin care routine, and doesn't affect my make-up application with either powder foundation or liquid foundation.\n\nThe biggest cons for me is that it does dehydrate and dry out my skin by the end of the day. Good skin care prep and some facial mist in the middle of the day does help, but I have yet to actually prevent this from happening.\n\nThere is a gel version of this sunscreen, which I tried at hated upon first application. Dried the hell out of my skin while giving me a plastic shininess. It clung to every flaky patch and looked incredibly patchy by the end of the day. The only good thing was how light it felt, practically weightless.\n\nThe Make P:rem UV Defense Blue Ray Sun Cream is on my list to try again. I remember liking how it felt on my skin, but I'm not sure if it was the culprit in causing an eczema flare. I recently discovered that the Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Lotion was causing my excessive oiliness, extra clogs and some skin irritation, so the flare may have been due to the sunscreen, the hada labo or just a mixture of the two.\n\nHope this helps in your quest to find a HG sunscreen!",

    "body": "I've been trying to get rid of my dandruff for over a decade. No matter what it always comes back. Zinc pyrithione was underwhelming, but thankfully Nizoral (ketoconazole) worked well. Still, I wanted a more permanent solution and after two weeks the dandruff would come back exponentially. Unacceptable. I even shaved my head which is a testament to how fed up I was. At my worst point I could tousle my hair and see the inside of a snow globe.\n\nMy working theory for how and why this works is as follows. A dirty, oily scalp creates the right conditions for malassezia to outcompete other life on your scalp. After removing the biofilm, frequent and excessive amounts of Nizoral are used to make the scalp uninhabitable for a period of time. The scalp is colonized by life on other parts of the body which prevents the fungus from taking root again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 1: Prelude**\n\nUse Nizoral as directed until your symptoms subside. This reduces the amount of fungus, wears away at the biofilm, and prevents the fungus from maintaining the biofilm. Buy a scalp massager with firm silicone bristles. 1 - 2 weeks. I did not do this, but then again I also shaved my head. Pick your poison.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 2: Scorched Earth**\n\nIf you can, trim your hair. Buy a 7 FL OZ bottle of Nizoral. Use 25% more, twice, at the beginning and end of your shower. On the second pass, AFTER you've let it sit, apply a small amount to your   \n whole head. Eyebrows, face, forehead, in/out ears, etc. These are all places the fungus could use to migrate back to your scalp. Let it sit for a moment and rinse. If you have to shower again water + finger friction is preferable.\n\nWhat's happening on your head is now a fungal apocalypse. Add insult to injury by making them starve. Nizoral, in addition to being antifungal, removes excess oils from the scalp and reduces the amount of oil produced by the scalp. For the first week do not put anything in your hair. Shower at least once per day. Your hair should be dry (lacking natural oils) most of the time to starve any lingering fungus.\n\nYou should be moisturizing your hands and face after each shower! When 80% of the Nizoral is gone continue to step 3.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 3: Balance**\n\nStep into the shower. Scrub all the sweat and dirt from your hair using your fingers. Quickly do the same for any sweat on your body. Now run your hands up and down your body and massage your scalp. Repeat 2 more times. Rinse your hair with water again and wash your body like normal. The natural bacteria on your body are going to (re)colonize your scalp. Do this for 5 days.\n\nEach day alternate between a quick scrub and rinse or a thorough scrub and light conditioner. Once a week use a small amount of Nizoral and rinse after 2-3 minutes. After a month you can stop using Nizoral.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 4: Maintenance**\n\n1. Learn how to take care of your hair. If you feel your hair is becoming dry only give it a light scrub and rinse the next 2 or 3 days. Dry hair will cause the scalp to produce excess oil which is a fungal buffet. The point of all this is to balance your scalp so that when the malassezia fungus returns it must compete with other bacteria on a limited supply of food.\n2. Use Nizoral on an as needed basis. I do twice a month just in case. Sometimes less, sometimes more. I've gone 3 months without it and experienced nothing. Some days I would just run my hair under water. Before this would have been unthinkable.",

I wash my hair every day with Head & Shoulders and rarely have flakes. I do have some clinical strength head and shoulders (selenium sulphide) and an anti-fungal steroid cream on hand for when my scalp biome experiences a dramatic change like a new climate or a heatwave/cold snap  - environmental factors do also play a role and should not be ignored.",

Sea water seems to always have positive effects and this had all fungal safe ingredients. I’m hoping I can rotate it with my zinc pyrithione cleanser bar that’s a bit harsh. I’ve been using vanicream but it doesn’t really do anything for my skin. \n\n-  Breath of Fresh Air Toner. I was between this & the tea tree one but didn’t want something too astringent with my skin being more dry & sensitive than normal with the accutane. I was thinking this might also be something nice to carry in my bag for a refresh throughout the day. \n\n- Grease Lightning. This is supposed to be for acne but these ingredients look great for seb derm as well. \n\n- Chelsea Morning solid perfume. I’ve been wanting a solid perfume for a while but hadn’t found many in person and didn’t want to blind buy one online. This one smells so yummy! The packaging is confusing to me though lol. \n\n- the square tin. I got the round one last time and packed a (non lush) cleansing bar in it for a trip and it worked nicely so I grabbed another. What else does everyone use these for?\n\nNow to decide which try out first 😄\n\n\n ",

    "body": "I have 4b hair and since I've grown out my hair from a buzz cut I've dealt with persistent dandruff which is very dry and itchy. My scalp would be on fire after the 2nd day of washing my hair it was a nightmare. I've tried all of the dandruff fighting shampoos and treatments available which barely worked. Nizoral left my hair feeling like hay, Alpecin dandruff killer worked for 3 days before my scalp started itching, neutrogena t-gel/ head & shoulders only worked for 48 hours. I could cope with washing my hair so frequently when I had a mini afro but as it \ngrew it became unbearable, my hair was chronically dry and I often decided to have a buzz cut and just leave it short if I couldn't find a solution. \n\nAfter 3 years of trial & error and too much damn money I can now go 2 weeks before I need to wash my hair. I'm not a dermatologist or doctor but I thought I would share my routine for anyone else also suffering from this. My hair is currently collar bone length and is thick, hydrated and happy !!!\n\n1. Stop oiling your scalp, \n\ni discovered that the fungus causing my scalp issues where feeding of the oils and dead skin. Me adding oils directly to my scalp just made my scalp so much worse. I don't use raw oils or butters at all anymore, if its in a rinse out conditioner then its fine.\n\n2. Use As I Am dry & itchy scalp care shampoo, \n\nthe key ingredient in killing the yeast/fungus is zinc pyrithione. \n\nMany shampoos with this ingredient left my hair stripped or the dosage isn't high enough or even disclosed (it needs to be minimum 1%). This shampoo balances cleansing and moisture balance perfectly. When i shampoo my hair i leave this on my scalp for 10min while I'm in the shower so it can work its magic. I take my time and gently scrub and massage my entire scalp. I've used this shampoo for 2 years and it always works, it's also decently priced. this is my goldilocks shampoo for now. \n\nWash your scalp as often as your hair type allows, your scalp is alive and breathing it needs oxygen and functions best when there isn't a layer of dirt, products, sweat or dead skin. If you wear wigs or headscarfs find time in the day where you can take it of so your scalp can breathe.\n\n\n3. Check the ingredients in your leave in conditioner, gel ect for triggering ingredients. Avoid products with oils or butters as the first or second ingredient. water based products work best. Personally I like to use kinky curly knot today, camille rose curl maker or as I am leave in conditioner. \n\n\n4. Dry your scalp, \n\nI used to be a heat avoidant natural but I discovered my symptoms improved when I blow dryed my hair in winter when it was too cold to have wet hair all day. Fungus dies during heat so make sure you scalp is completely dry after conditioning to prevent regrowth. if you don't want to blow dry your entire hair or afraid of heat just aim the blow dryer to your scalp on low heat to dry the roots until you can no longer feel dampness.\n\n\nPhew I hope this helps 😅 🙏",

Since they are moisturizing you should leave it for 5-10 mins before rinsing out. Also using scalp massager brush with multiple bristles instead of your fingers to help get the flakes out.",

May enhance sulfotransferase enzymes to convert minoxidil to minoxidil sulphate in scalp\n\niii. Can be commonly compounded into topical minoxidil preparations by pharmacies\n\n  e. Con’s:\n\ni. Can be irritating to the skin, but usually the irritation goes away with continued use\n\nii. Daytime use could cause scalp redness because of increased sensitivity to the sun\n\niii. Does this cause long term fibrosis of hair follicles, or could it cause hair loss in some people?\n\n7.) Latanoprost\n\n  a. Prostaglandin F2 alpha upregulator\n\n  b.

Xalatan (0.005%) grows eyelashes in most glaucoma patients\n\niii. Personal experience shows it works on scalp when concentrated at 0.1% (20 times Xalatan). I had   \na major “dread shed”.\n\niv.

Bimatoprost\n\n  a. Prostaglandin F2 alpha upregulator (similar to latanoprost)\n\n  b. Latisse FDA approved for eyelash growth (also works on eyebrows off label)\n\n  c. Some compounding pharmacies may be able to concentrate it enough where it works on the scalp,   \n  however there may be still some patents on the drug, prohibiting generic manufacturers from   \n  making the drug more affordable.\n\n  d. I used this personally on my hair line (0.03% generic Vistitan) for 3 months and it made no   \n  difference.

Some generic brands may be available\n\niv. May be similar to Liposomal ATP, which is used by some well regarded hair transplant surgeons to   \nspeed up grafts growth post surgery\n\n  d. Cons:\n\ni. May be difficult to source outside Japan\n\nii. Relatively expensive\n\niii. Shiseido product has a mint type fragrance that may be unappealing to some people\n\niv. Shiseido product has a large bottle which makes application challenging\n\nv. I have tried getting pharmacies to compound this into minoxidil preparations without success.\n\n10.) Phenylephrine\n\n  a. Traction alopecia treatment; causes “goose bumps” (activates erector pili muscles) to prevent hair   \n  loss during washing, brushing or other traction\n\n  b.

Pro’s:\n\ni. Good research behind it, with multiple studies; quality of researchers is excellent (i.e. hair loss dermatologists Dr. Jerry Shapiro and Dr. Rodney Sinclair)\n\nii. Only needs to be applied to scalp for ½ hour before activation occurs (can be washed out soon   \nafter)\n\niii. Reasonable cost\n\niv. Derived from natural ingredient (Seville orange extract); probably safe for long term use\n\nv. I have personally used this before getting a haircut and it definitely works as stated.\n\n  e. Con’s:\n\ni. May inhibit penetration of other topicals to the hair follicle so maybe only a good treatment before   \nhair cuts or styling (e.g. before hair piece application).\n\nii. Has propanediol (natural version of propylene glycol) so leaves hair with greasy texture\n\n11.) Methyl Vanillate\n\n  a. WNT pathway activator\n\n  b.

I am now also growing my beard which was previously a no-no because of flakiness, no issues at all!\n\nNight Routine:\n1 Shower\n2 Face wash in shower with Neutrogena Clear and Defend 2% Salicylic Acid Face Wash (only using this at night as fairly irritating if used twice in a day but fine if night only)\n3 Hyaluronic Acid from the Ordinary on a damp face after shower\n4 Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturising Gel about 10 min after Hyaluronic\n5 1 pipette-full of MCT oil (see above) gently layered over entire face. Another pipette-full onto the skin under my beard. \n6 Every other night some MCT on my scalp as well\n7 Wash in the morning with a gentle cleanser (I use Korres Greek Yoghurt Face Cleanser) and re-apply Hyaluronic + Clinique, no MCT\n\nHave done this nightly for two months, I am COMPLETELY clear. Like literally no redness or a single flake. Incredible. \n\nSee comments for links!",

Well I went overboard and added a bunch of products and then a 2% bha toner. The next day my forehead literally looked like a burn victim. My pores were huge and my skin was absolutely raw. I cut out actives for a few days and then washed my face with a zinc pyrithione bar hoping it would kill bacteria. NOPE. My face peeled and was super dry. Now I'm just washing with vanicream and using a simple moisturizer.\n\nMy issue is, my forehead literally has like 500 closed comedones ever since I used that toner. Exfoliating makes it so much worse. It doesn't make sense. When I wash my face, my forehead and the areas on my jaw and around my mouth have a weird texture..almost like sandpaper. I'm wondering if this isn't acne? I've never experienced this weird texture. Any ideas??",

DO NOT exfoliate anymore until your skin is healed and introduce exfoliants slowly, like once every two weeks and work up to more. But not until your skin is healed.\n\nReally, the best thing you can do is have a moisturizer with no active ingredients and a gentle cleanser. Usually, sulfate free, oil free, and fragrance free are a safe bet. \n\nI’d avoid makeup too if you can, but I get that’s not easy with work and events etc. if it gets any worse I would go to a dermatologist.",

It was the only thing that helped defeat my scalp eczema until the EU stupidly forbid its usage in March 2022, even though not long before that they had deemed the it still safe for shampoo useage. For decades zinc pyrithione was used in shampoos that combat scalp eczema / seborrheic dermatitis / dandruff. After the ban, pretty much every manufacturer switched to Piroctone Olamine.\n\nPierre Fabre Ducray Kelual DS in its original formulation (white creamy version) was about the only thing that *instantly* helped and usually within three washes the scalp eczema was gone for weeks. But with the  switch to Piroctone Olamine instead of zinc pyrithione (clear formula) it completely stopped working, and in fact creates a thick layer of flaking instead, aggravating the scalp further.\n\nMy life quality is down the tubes as my scalp itches and flakes again.

I recall I was in the bathroom having a shower and was staring at the bottle of H&S and saw a small print on the front of the bottle label that said \"new improved formula\" and was like 'hang on a minute, could this be why I'm going through itchy scalp hell right now!'\n\nAfter a lot of reading around I found out about the EU zinc P regulation malarky and figured it all out. Back in 2020, the big UK supermarkets own brand anti-dandruff shampoos still had the Zinc P in them, so I bought those instead for a way cheaper price than H&S, and they worked just as good as the old formula H&S! (I recall cursing myself for wasting so much money on the brand name H&S over the past 2 decades haha)\n\nI then noticed that the supermarkets were also gradually changing their formula over to the Piroctone Olamine (which is worse than useless for seborrheic dermatitis, no matter what the so called studies claim).\n\nLuckily I found out that the Boots own brand version was still for sale with zinc P in it, and bought about 50 bottles of it from their website (no joke), as that's how bad it feels when you have seborrheic dermatitis but don't have the zinc P shampoo in play. As you said with your remark about reduced quality of life, seborrheic dermatitis left un-treated will very quickly make you wish that you were never born.\n\nI hope you found some ZP shampoo and have resolved that miserable, sleep stealing itch.",

I only used it occasionally but it would work on clearing out acne around the nose. Not this time. \n\nAfter using the charcoal cleanser, my entire T-zone was inflamed bright red, and the texture of my skin was destroyed. \n\nIt didn’t calm down in the next few weeks. It got worse. My skin peeled off, the texture stayed bad, and people told me my nose was really red. \n\nI saw a well reviewed dermatologist at a respected hospital. They said it’s seb derm almost immediately and after inspecting it. They said I also had rosacea, but it was minor and we needed to deal with the seb derm first.\n\nFast forward through months of anti fungal treatments that according to studies are effective against seb derm. I’m talking ketoconazole, clotrimazole, daily cleansing (which prevented any healing), zinc pyrithione, oral anti fungal medication, salicylic acid, selenium sulfide. Guess what- they didn’t do SHIT. In fact, that constant cleaning of my sensitive skin and destroyed skin barrier was making it worse. \n\nSpoke to another couple dermatologists. We decide that since it’s not responding to anti fungal treatments at all it’s time to change course. I stop using anti fungal treatments and cleansers entirely, not even cetaphil gentle cleanser. Not even a week in, it was calmer. Turns out when you don’t nuke your sensitive skin every day it might actually have a chance to heal. \n\nFor context I’ve always had some cheek flushing but it would go away fast, and I NEVER had redness around my nose or forehead until this year. \n\nThe derm prescribed rosacea treatments, and holy fuck real progress is being made. \n\nDoing the same thing over and over again while expecting a different result is the definition of insanity. Applying ketoconazole 2x day isn’t gonna start doing something in month 6 if it didn’t do anything in month 4. If you aren’t seeing results after months and months of treatment, get a second or third opinion by a professional. ",

Usually Aveeno Ultra Calming Moisturizer. I don't have a sensitivity to any that i've discovered yet, so I just go with whatever I grab first.\n\n\n\nNight: \n\n*Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily Cleanser \n\n*TO Hyaluronic Acid \n\n*Curology - 8% Azelaic Acid/1% Clindamycin/0.25% Zinc Pyrithione \n\n*A sheet mask of some variety once or twice a month, usually moisturizing\n\nI discovered a lot of my problems was moisture. I had dry skin and didn't know it. It's so much softer now and getting it to this point led to a lot less picking. I am on my second Curolgy formula. The first one cleared up my skin, and this one was more to help keep it clear and lighten dark spots from scarring. I also started birth control around the time I started Curology because we thought it may have been a bit hormonal. It all seems to have worked well.\n\nAnd I hope to be a bit better now that I burned the crap out of my skin last weekend. I get paid on Friday and plan on restocking all my products plus getting plenty of sunblock for my summer adventures.\n\nEdit: formatting",

(downsides: sulfur smells like rotten eggs, + zinc pyrithione is banned in the eu over fertility concerns)\n\nfun fact 4: if you have dry skin around your eyes, occlusives like vaseline help seal in moisture. however, while petrolatum doesn’t clog pores itself, it can trap debris + bacteria underneath, creating an acne-prone environment. that is why you should always apply it to clean skin!\n\nalso feel free to ask about anything if you want, i like talking about dermatology :\\]",

He was so punctual that locals would set their watches according to his walk. (Granted, this is more of a rumor than a fact.) He also never left his hometown and said that one does not need to ever visit a place to write about it. (I technically agree, but never leaving your hometown?)\n\n- Descartes’s solution to how the mind and body interact in his dualistic philosophy was some weird shit to do with the pineal gland. It’s been a long time since I read any proper philosophy, but I remember never understanding how he reconciled this, considering that the pineal gland is just another meat part of the brain. (As a physicalist I disagree with mind-body dualism anyway, but thought his pineal gland thing was kind of funny.)\n\n- Diogenes would shit in the streets to challenge societal norms. I like to think of him as the first shitposter, if you will. He’s the guy who said, “behold, a man!” while holding a plucked chicken in response to Plato’s definition of man being a featherless biped. Alexander the Great fanboyed over him when they met and Diogenes just asked him to move because he was blocking his sunlight. He lived in a sort of barrel.\n\n- The troodon is considered one of the most intelligent dinosaurs due to its brain size relative to its body.\n\n- Most undergrad physics students are taught the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics as though it is true, despite the fact that there are multiple alternative theories and there is no consensus.\n\n- Russell and Whitehead wrote *Principia Mathematica*, a 2,000-page work, wherein they tried to derive all mathematics from logic, and Gödel came along and sort of shat on it in like 30 pages with his *Incompleteness Theorems*. (I have not read the former and only bits of the latter and sadly cannot even pretend to fully comprehend it due to unused and undeveloped math skills.)\n\n- In 1996, Alan Sokal wrote a bullshit paper full of postmodern jargon and got it published in a respected journal to prove that a lot of postmodernism is full of shit. It’s called the Sokal Affair and it’s hilarious. He also co-authored a book called *Fashionable Nonsense* in which there is a direct quote by famous postmodern-style psychoanalyst Lacan stating that “the erectile organ is equal to the square root of -1.” Talk about rigor.\n\n- IQ, general intelligence, or *g*, is about 80% heritable, meaning that around 80% of variation in IQ is explained by genetic differences, shown in part by adoption and twin studies.\n\n- Infant males pay more attention to objects, patterns, and movement, and infant females pay more attention to faces and voices, on average. (I believe that this biological predisposition broadly accounts for things like females being more likely to choose psychology or nursing as career paths and males to choose engineering and computer science.)\n\n- The late Warrel Dane, vocalist of the band Nevermore, was formally trained in operatic singing and had a vocal range of five octaves.\n\n- Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, or N24, is an extremely rare circadian rhythm disorder predominantly seen in fully blind people, though there is a tiny number of sighted people who have it. N24 causes one to progressively sleep later each day/night such that one cycles through nocturnal and diurnal phases over time, since it exceeds the 24-hour cycle. (I have this and suspect that, while rare, it is not nearly as rare as currently thought. ASD and ADHD are both overrepresented in delayed sleep-phase disorder (DSPD) and N24, and some literature states that the former can eventually lead to the development of the latter.)",

It reminds me of ice cream companies that remove their chocolate chips and then dye the ice cream green to try to distract the customers. Hey everybody, new “improved” formula and now it’s green, due to “customer demand”*\n\n*’customer demand’ is a relative term that is defined by our corporation. It does not reference actual customers or demands in any way.\n\n\nInStuff like this would not happen if out markets weren’t filled with monopolies and oligopolies. These corporations have learned over the past 15 years that they no longer have to compete and that there is no more regulation in industry. And they don’t have to worry about news stories or the public comparing notes, because the first monopolies that were legalized were the media back in 1996 in the very creatively named Telecommunications Act of 1996. Or as I call it, the Monopoly Act of 1996. And since they’ve finally done the same to the internet, it’s almost impossible to find any trace of honest discussion online.

Perhaps these products might also be worth considering if someone is trying to avoid a hair transplant at all costs.\n\n\\*Only products which were clinically tested on humans were included (e.g. RU58841 not here because there are no human in-vivo studies available).\n\n## 1.) Alfatradiol\n\n  a. Weak 5 alpha reductase enzyme inhibitor\n\n  b. Approved (or cleared?) in Germany, Latin American countries and Korea, mostly for female androgenetic alopecia (AGA), although it can be used in men as well\n\n  c. Brand name Ell-Cranell produced by Galderma, a major pharmaceutical company:    [https://www.galderma.com/de/ell-cranell](https://www.galderma.com/de/ell-cranell)\n\n  d. Sold in generics such as Pantostin\n\n  e. Research:\n\ni. [https://anndermatol.org/DOIx.php?id=10.5021/ad.2012.24.3.295](https://anndermatol.org/DOIx.php?id=10.5021/ad.2012.24.3.295)\n\nii.

Appears safe for both women and men\n\nii. Alcohol based solution dries quickly\n\niii. Over the counter product in Germany, sold at a reasonable cost, so relatively easy to import through sites like eBay without hassle from customs and border protection\n\niv. Can be used once every 2 or 3 days according to instructions once hair loss stabilizes, further reducing costs and potential scalp irritation\n\nv. Apparently this product is approved by the (South) Korean Food and Drug Administration for Female AGA\n\n  g. Con’s:\n\ni. Studies mostly done on women\n\nii. The best study showing efficacy must be translated from German\n\niii. Possibly only slows down hair loss when compared to 2% minoxidil; so most likely will not receive a cosmetically noticeable benefit\n\niv. Ell Cranell applicator has an odd shape with two droppers\n\nv. Germany has a lot of “homeopathic medicine”, so this product may fall into that category\n\n## 2.) Fluridil\n\n  a. Topical anti-androgen\n\n  b. Approved/Cleared for “cosmetic” hair loss treatment in Czech Republic and Slovakia\n\n  c. Eucapil brand name: [http://www.eucapil.com/index.shtml](http://www.eucapil.com/index.shtml)\n\n  d. Research:\n\ni.

Has several small studies done on men and women; study in 43 men was small but appears good and shows safety with some efficacy\n\nii. Over the counter so it can be sourced from the Czech Republic and imported without hassle from customs\n\n  f. Con’s:\n\ni. Can be difficult to source at times\n\nii. Relatively expensive\n\niii. Even if it works, it probably will not produce a cosmetically significant result\n\niv. Each 2 ml dose is contained in a glass ampule that must be broken; application can be   \nchallenging\n\n## 3.) Zinc Pyrithione Shampoo (e.g. Head and Shoulders)\n\n  a. There is some weak evidence that these shampoos can help with hair loss. At worst, it is an inexpensive product that will probably not damage your hair and scalp, and may prevent dandruff. At best it could provide some minor benefit to hair loss, but not at a qualitatively noticeable level.\n\n  b. Research\n\ni.

Pro’s:\n\ni. Over the counter in most countries so easily sourced\n\nii. Can often be found on sale online\n\niii. Potentially works differently than minoxidil, so the two treatments could be stacked\n\niv. Sinclair Dermatology (Professor Rodney Sinclair’s clinic) has reported success with the Kerastase Densifique brand of this product:\n\n[https://www.sinclairdermatology.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Brochure-Male-Pattern-Hair-  Loss.pdf](https://www.sinclairdermatology.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Brochure-Male-Pattern-Hair-Loss.pdf)\n\n[https://www.sbs.com.au/language/english/audio/professor-rodney-sinclair-hair-loss-costs-us-economically-physically-and-emotionally](https://www.sbs.com.au/language/english/audio/professor-rodney-sinclair-hair-loss-costs-us-economically-physically-and-emotionally)\n\n  f. Con’s:\n\ni. Not the best choice if you live or work with people sensitive to fragrances; there is no unscented version\n\nii. Relatively expensive compared to minoxidil\n\n## 5.) Ketoconazole\n\n  a. Anti-inflammatory and weak anti-androgen\n\n  b. Notes here are on topical liquid, foam or cream, not the shampoo. The shampoo has some studies showing benefit.\n\n  c. Some limited evidence that topical ketoconazole in a 1% or 2% liquid/gel/foam/cream can provide some benefit\n\n  d. Research:\n\ni.

Tretinion (a.k.a. trans retinoic acid)\n\n  a. Commonly known as Retin-A; exfoliant treatment for acne and anti-aging\n\n  b. Weak evidence that it can work as a standalone; however better evidence that it can work to enhance response to topical minoxidil.\n\n  c. Research:\n\ni.

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3771854/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3771854/)\n\n  d. Pro’s:\n\ni. Relatively inexpensive and safe prescription product commonly prescribed by doctors\n\nii. May enhance sulfotransferase enzymes to convert minoxidil to minoxidil sulphate in scalp\n\niii. Can be commonly compounded into topical minoxidil preparations by pharmacies\n\n  e. Con’s:\n\ni. Can be irritating to the skin, but usually the irritation goes away with continued use\n\nii. Daytime use could cause scalp redness because of increased sensitivity to the sun\n\niii. Does this cause long term fibrosis of hair follicles, or could it cause hair loss in some people?\n\n## 7.) Latanoprost\n\n  a. Prostaglandin F2 alpha upregulator\n\n  b. Glaucoma medication that can be concentrated to higher concentrations by compounding pharmacies in the U.S.\n\n  c. Research:\n\ni. [https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(11)00601-3/fulltext](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(11)00601-3/fulltext)\n\nii. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20028444/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20028444/)\n\n  d. Pro’s:\n\ni. FDA approved drug (Xalatan) for glaucoma; off label use for hair loss\n\nii. Xalatan (0.005%) grows eyelashes in most glaucoma patients\n\niii. Personal experience shows it works on scalp when concentrated at 0.1% (20 times Xalatan). I had a major “dread shed”.\n\niv. Patents have expired so some compounding pharmacies will make it\n\n  e. Con’s:\n\ni. Expensive\n\nii. Most pharmacies will not compound it\n\niii. No long term studies on safety and efficacy\n\n## 8.) Bimatoprost\n\n  a. Prostaglandin F2 alpha upregulator (similar to latanoprost)\n\n  b. Latisse FDA approved for eyelash growth (also works on eyebrows off label)\n\n  c. Some compounding pharmacies may be able to concentrate it enough where it works on the scalp, however there may be still some patents on the drug, prohibiting generic manufacturers from making the drug more affordable.\n\n  d. I used this personally on my hair line (0.03% generic Vistitan) for 3 months and it made no   \ndifference. Allergan’s studies showed that concentrations 10x – 30x were needed to get significant scalp hair growth.\n\n## 9.)  Adenosine\n\n  a. Brand name Adenogen by Shiseido sold (over the counter?) in Japan: [https://www.shiseido.co.jp/sw/c/products/SWFG070410.seam?shohin\\_pl\\_c\\_cd=681501&amp;amp;online\\_shohin\\_ctlg\\_kbn=1](https://www.shiseido.co.jp/sw/c/products/SWFG070410.seam?shohin_pl_c_cd=681501&amp;amp;online_shohin_ctlg_kbn=1)\n\n  b. Research:\n\ni. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19239555/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19239555/)\n\nii.

Pro’s:\n\ni. Multiple studies show efficacy in AGA for men and women; studies appear to be decent\n\nii. Alcohol based solution that dries quickly (based on personal use)\n\niii. Some generic brands may be available\n\niv. May be similar to Liposomal ATP, which is used by some well regarded hair transplant surgeons to speed up grafts growth post surgery\n\n  d. Cons:\n\ni. May be difficult to source outside Japan\n\nii. Relatively expensive\n\niii. Shiseido product has a mint type fragrance that may be unappealing to some people\n\niv. Shiseido product has a large bottle which makes application challenging\n\nv. I have tried getting pharmacies to compound this into minoxidil preparations without success.\n\n## 10.) Phenylephrine\n\n  a. Traction alopecia treatment; causes “goose bumps” (activates erector pili muscles) to prevent hair loss during washing, brushing or other traction\n\n  b. Sold as “INTACT” brand by Daniel Alain company: [https://www.danielalain.com/pages/retain](https://www.danielalain.com/pages/retain)\n\n  c. Research studies:\n\ni. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29193553/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29193553/)\n\nii. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26678522/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26678522/)\n\n  d. Pro’s:\n\ni. Good research behind it, with multiple studies; quality of researchers is excellent (i.e. hair loss dermatologists Dr. Jerry Shapiro and Dr. Rodney Sinclair)\n\nii. Only needs to be applied to scalp for ½ hour before activation occurs (can be washed out soon after)\n\niii. Reasonable cost\n\niv. Derived from natural ingredient (Seville orange extract); probably safe for long term use\n\nv. I have personally used this before getting a haircut and it definitely works as stated.\n\n  e. Con’s:\n\ni. May inhibit penetration of other topicals to the hair follicle so maybe only a good treatment before hair cuts or styling (e.g. before hair piece application).\n\nii. Has propanediol (natural version of propylene glycol) so leaves hair with greasy texture\n\n## 11.) Methyl Vanillate\n\n  a. WNT pathway activator\n\n  b. Sold as WNT/Act and Deltacrin WNT brands\n\n  c. Research:\n\ni. Only one small study shows benefit in Female AGA: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27121450/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27121450/)\n\n  d. Potentially used by Dr. John Cole’s hair restoration clinic (Forhair). Dr. Cole is one of the pioneers in follicular unit excision (FUE) surgery: [https://www.forhair.com/news/wnt-act-forhair-s-new-patented-cell-activator-hair-spray/](https://www.forhair.com/news/wnt-act-forhair-s-new-patented-cell-activator-hair-spray/)\n\n  e. Pro’s:\n\ni. Derived from natural ingredients\n\nii. Potentially up to 7% increase in hair density\n\niii. Works differently than minoxidil and finasteride, so theoretically can be stacked with those treatments\n\n  f. Con’s:\n\ni. Relatively expensive\n\nii. May contain propylene glycol\n\n## 12.) Redensyl\n\n  a. Obscure Growth stimulant\n\n  b. Research is biased: [https://www.redenhair.com/en/content/15-redensyl?adtoken=f7d28ab47a96dd99a3aca6fcd3cff64b&amp;amp;ad=administra&amp;amp;id\\_employee=2](https://www.redenhair.com/en/content/15-redensyl?adtoken=f7d28ab47a96dd99a3aca6fcd3cff64b&amp;amp;ad=administra&amp;amp;id_employee=2)\n\n  c. I found an inexpensive version from The Ordinary for around $10 a bottle. The product is greasy.   \n  \nEven if it does not work, you will not be out of pocket much money.\n\n## 13.) GroMD Follicle Activator Spray\n\n  a. Appears to be a combination of natural ingredients formulated by Dr. Amir Yazdan, who is a legitimate hair restoration doctor in the U.S. [https://gro.md/collections/all/products/gromd-minoxidil-boost](https://gro.md/collections/all/products/gromd-minoxidil-boost)\n\n  b. “Endorsed” by Spencer Stevenson (Spexhair), one of few credible consumer information resources in androgenetic alopecia. [https://www.spexhair.com/products-for-hair-loss/](https://www.spexhair.com/products-for-hair-loss/)\n\n  c. Relatively expensive, contains propylene glycol\n\n  d. Some anecdotal claims, may help reduce grey hair\n\n  e. Not sure how much shampoo and conditioner would help, if at all\n\n## 14.)

    "body": "Hi guys, hope all is well. I have been reading this thread for a while and decided it was time for me to sign up and get involved as I know 1st hand how mentally scarring this disease can be. I'll try not to babble on too much but I'll give a brief description of my experience with seb derm, followed by what I feel works & what you should/shouldn't do.\n\nI am a 32 year old male that lives in Manchester, England. Ive never had the best skin but first started having an issue with Seb Derm when I was about 28. I put this down to 1 of 2 things - I had my 1st tattoo when I was 28 & was due to get married later that year. I dont see any reason why having a tattoo would bring on seb derm but find it strange that it seemed to occur at approximately the same time. Probably just purely a coincidence but I dont know. I'd imagine the stress of arranging a wedding was a more mitigating factor. \n\nI have been diagnosed off 3 separate doctors & dermatologists that I have Seb Derm & having done my own research I am 100% certain this is the condition I have. I have a few small patches on my scalp and on my ears/around my nose, but the worst is on my forehead/t zone.\n\nIve tried all the shampoos and creams you can think of. You name it I've tried it. It's been that bad at times that I've actually cried. In my case, the condition seems to flare up alot worse in winter. Why, I have no idea but this seems to be the case for most people. However for the last 6 weeks or so I would describe myself as having this condition completely under control - for the 1st time in a long time - whether this is because of the routine I am about to go through with you, or because of the slightly warmer weather we are now having remains to be seen.\n\nThe 1st piece of advice I will give is this :- HOT WATER IS AN ABSOLUTE NO GO. I still have hot showers but do not touch my face or head with hot water. To wash my hair/face I only use cold water. In my experience it doesnt have to be freezing, just as long as it is \"cold\". Also do not spend too long in a hot shower as steam will go on your face & have a similar effect to hot water! I am not a doctor so I dont know exactly why this makes things 10 times worse, but for me it does, so dont do it.\n\nWhile in the shower, i use 2 antifungal shampoos together, literally - i squirt a small amount from 2 separate bottles of shampoo, lather up & leave on for 5/10 minutes. The shampoos I use are Tesco's own brand containing Zinc Pyrithione, and the other is Bioderma Node P shampoo, which contains Climbazole (1 of the only shampoos that contain this active ingredient). It is possible 1 of the shampoos could be working on its own but together they seem to be doing the job so dont want to tempt fate & risk a flare up! The Bioderma also contains Piroctone Olamine & Salylictic acid which is only a positive in my eyes. The more active ingredients the better. I do this EVERY MORNING. The reason behind me mixing these 2 shampoos is because I read an article on dandruff deconstructed that stated zinc & climbazole had proved to be highly successful when used together. And thus far I havnt been able to find a shampoo that contains both together so i literally just use 2 separate shampoos with those ingredients. I would also like to add that Ketaconazole and and a few other antifungal shampoos made my condition worse.\n\nAfter getting out the shower I try to dry my face & hair (I have normal length hair for a bloke) relatively quickly, mostly with a towel but also with a hairdryer because as we all know fungus loves moist environments. I do not scrub or rub hard, just gently but efficiently (this pressure also applies to how I apply the shampoo).\n\nHere in the UK I managed to get a bottle of Apple Cider Vinegar that contains raw honey (2 things people have had reasonable success with). I bought a squirty bottle & mixed the ACV & honey with water with a ratio of about 2:5. I also added abit of salt to the water which isnt going to do any harm. I squirt a tiny bit of the mixture onto my finger and rub in gently to the affected areas and let it dry. My face feels a little bit sticky due to the honey but in general its barely noticable. I do this 3 times a day - once just after the morning shower, once mid afternoon/tea time & once before bed. Might sound like a pain in the arse but it really isnt, literally takes me 10 seconds a time to do.\n\nMay I also just take this moment to stress that it's important not to use ingredients that are too strong for your skin. I understand it can be tempting to buy super strong shampoos or use ACV neat to try & \"kill\" the fungus, but unless you have skin like a rhino this is more likely to do more harm than good. \n\nThen finally, 1 more thing I admit I need to use in my routine - steroid cream. Yeah I know what you're thinking, but bare with me. It appears everyone is scared to death (myself included) of using these creams on the face in fear of thinning skin. If you actually read up on steroid creams you will find it is highly unlikely to suffer thinning skin unless you go absolutely over the top with it. What I have found is that my routine seems to work for about 4/5 days (depending on the weather or if I've been on the piss), and then I feel certain areas of my face/scalp are starting to become a little bit itchy, or the ACV starts to sting abit more than usual. This is when I use steroid cream to \"keep it at bay\". I use eumovate on my face once (yes you can use this on your face) and a slightly stronger 1 (betacap) on my scalp. The way I see it, you're better off using steroid cream once a week to keep it at bay, than not at all and have a horrendous flare up and have to use it twice a day for a week/10 days straight. If you are currently going through a bad flare up, just use the damn steroid cream to get it down. I have accepted that this is a lifelong condition that will not go away and I simply have to manage it. If using steroid cream once a week enables me to do so then so be it.\n\nI also recommend sun exposure. I feel going on the sunbed once every 10 days - 2 weeks has benefitted me. I wouldnt go on anymore than that due to fears of skin cancer/ageing but I am completely comfortable going on 2/3 times a month. Everything in moderation & all that. Having a slight tan will also make any unwanted redness less noticable. \n\nI do not use any moisturizers of any sort. I feel moisturizers along with oils made my skin 10 times worse. It completely baffles me when people appear/claim to have had success with oils in particular.\n\nI have tried changing my diet with no success. As a lad who likes my grub I personally found it unrealistic trying to cut out dairy/gluten as some have suggested.\n\nI also take an anti-histamine everyday - this should definitely help with any itchiness. I also take a zinc & vitamin D tablet every morning - I'm not convinced they do much to be honest, but they are certainly not going to do any harm. \n\nQuick word on Vitamin D - i am of the opinion that Vitamin D does have some part to play in this horrible condition - otherwise why would it flare up worse in the colder months? Interesting topic of debate that i think has been discussed in here before.\n\nSo to sum up :-\n\nNO HOT WATER\n\nShampoo with zinc & climbazole\n\nDry well\n\nACV/honey/salt water mix\n\nSteroid cream once a week or so\n\nSunbed\n\nAnti-histamine/zinc/vit D tablets\n\nAvoid moisturizers & oils \n\nI'm sure this routine won't work for some. Im not entirely convinced myself yet that it isn't just a change in the weather that's helped my seb derm. But since I started doing it 6 weeks ago I've been practically seb derm free for the 1st time in God knows how long so I'm going to stick with it. I know how badly this horrible disease can affect your self esteem so if just 1 person can take a few positives from this post and be in a better position to deal with it then job done. \n\nHappy to answer any questions\n\nPeace out guys, cheers for reading",

You are aware that sebderm is lifelong, but at the same time you are still endorsing steroid? Lifelong, steroid. It is just not sustainable for something that is already lifelong and has so many variables to bring it back into inflammation. And before you accuse me of mere fearmongering, i do end up with thin skin just by using steroid the way my dr prescribed it to me (only one month and never again, but thin skin still haunts me until about a year later). I could live with only thin skin, but that came with the package of itchy atopic dermatitis and weeping episodes to the point i had to quit my job since life is impossible when your face and neck wont stop oozing smelly shit. And that is just topical aspect of the side effect. The least important effect. Unless you cover all the variables, you cant guarantee your use of steroid wont be \"that much\". Lifelong, again. Yes the search can be draining, but choosing steroid over your organs is like cutting off your nose to spite the face. As you said, you know you have to maintain a routine since this lifelong, so why not choose a routine that is sustainable? \n\nOn the rest of your lifestyle change, you seemed to have a vague idea of what's working, so if you are interested to read more, please have a look on Dr. Jack Kruse on leaky gut syndrome. Or just Dr Kruse 's view on sun and vitamin d alone. It's easy to relate the cause and effect just from your background story to Dr Kruse's guide. Basically he endorsed people to fix such problem by fixing our diet and embracing the sun (an obvious caveat is not to get sunburn). We are more prone to fungus attack (like itchiness and sebderm) when we have poor gut health and low vitamin d level. He also suggested the use of antioxidants such as glutathione and vitamin c for such problem, but i honestly didnt read that part since i end up already following eczema publications that also suggested the very same thing.",

I bought a tub of coal tar ointment and it basically cleared up my whole face overnight...it was nothing short of amazing!  I was scared to use it at first bc it is an ointment and looks similar to Vaseline. Any oils I had attempted to use in the past only made things worse. I was worried I would wake up with a very angry face, but I was thrilled!  It took 20 years, but I finally found something that works. I know everyone is different and what works for one may not work for another, but if you haven’t tried coal tar yet I would suggest it. I bought a tub of this:\n     *MG217 Psoriasis extra strength 2% coal tar formula. It’s a 4oz tub and costs about $5 at any drug store. There are coal tar shampoos, lotions, and ointments. I have the ointment bc I get my sebderm on my face...looks like an angry goatee when I have a flare up. The only downside is the smell...it doesn’t smell great. I think it smells like a mechanic’s shop, or an “industrial” smell. However, it is not so bad that it makes me gag or anything...and I don’t notice the smell after having it on for a bit. My husband doesn’t smell it when laying next to me either, so it’s not overwhelming by any means. Plus, if it means clear skin with no itch, pain, flaking, or oozing, I’m all in!  I hope this helps someone...sebderm is the absolute worst! Especially when you can’t find anything that helps. There were times when I didn’t want to leave the house bc it was so bad. I was so happy to finally find something that worked...just wish I could have found it sooner!",

Especially ladies my age still experiencing hormonal acne. \n\nI’ve had problem hormonal acne since I was 13. Combination skin. Mostly small postules and tons of closed comedones. Now 34. \n\nThe acne waned a lot when I went on the pill, but for a lot of reasons, I had to get off it when I was 32. Been fighting hormonal blemishes ever since then. (But holy shit, I dropped 13 pounds without trying and you can see my abs now. I’m the trimmest I’ve been since high school. Sex drive came roaring back too.)\n\nBlemishes are bad enough that it’s sometimes minorly embarrassing, but generally fine enough that I can get by using make up. Tried different formulations of Curology, and it certainly did help, but I still have blemishes twice a month. Right before ovulation, and right before shark week. Classic cheek and jawline area. \n\nI used to use micellar water, neutrogena hydro boost with sunscreen in the AM, and vanicream pump face wash, Curology, and vanicream lotion at night. Still minor breakouts during hormone shifts. \n\nFinally, five months after the increased curology formula, I bought the vanicream face bar with zinc and used it in the mornings.\n\nHOLY SHIT guys - it’s only been three weeks and WOW. My skin is so much smoother, my closed come dones are rapidly dropping in number, and instead of the usual 2-3 small pustules I get, just ended up with a couple blackheads. \n\nMy skin is SO much smoother!! And all with this small addition to my routine. \n\nMy current Curology formula is as follows: \nTret: .009%\nClindamycin: 1%\nAzelaic Acid: 9%\n\nMorning: wash with vanicream zinc bar. some Korean snail gel that nixes inflammation and redness, followed by neutrogena hydro boost and some philosophy miracle worker eye. \n\n\nEvening: makeup remover with garnier miceller water, followed by rinse with normal vanicream (non-zinc) face wash, Curology, then vanicream lotion for hydration.  \n\nNew pillow case nightly. \n\nAlso, always remember to re-wash your back and shoulders after rinsing conditioner from your hair. \n\nIf this can help even one other person, I’d be super happy.",

On top of that, I’ve struggled with other chronic fungal skin conditions like jock itch and athlete’s foot. Over the years, I’ve tried everything—steroids, prescription-strength ketoconazole shampoo (and plenty of other azole medications), salicylic acid, coal tar—you name it.\n\nRecently, I decided to give topical niacinamide a shot. To my surprise, the seb derm on my face disappeared almost overnight. At first, I thought it was the niacinamide working its magic and even shared my success here. But after some trial and error, I realized it was the Zinc PCA in the solution. \n\nOnce I figured that out, I went out and got a shampoo with Zinc PCA (avoided Zinc pyrithione, just to be cautious). Within 48 hours, I saw a 90% reduction in dandruff. My scalp, which used to be red and flaky, is now almost totally clear. \n\nI’m beyond thrilled. The best part? Zinc PCA is incredibly safe and doesn’t carry the same risks of endocrine disruption that come with ketoconazole creams and shampoos. It’s not smelly and it’s really good for your skin! \n\nEver since I started using Zinc PCA, I don’t have to stress about my skin anymore. My seb derm, athlete’s foot, jock itch, dandruff are all very manageable now. If you haven’t tried it, I highly recommend giving it a shot. Personally, I use The Ordinary’s Niacinamide solution, which contains 1% Zinc PCA. There are also creams, moisturizers, and shampoos with it available.\n\nIf you’re wondering how it works, from what I can gather zinc reduces sebum production on your skin which malassezia yeast needs to grow. Zinc also has antimicrobial and antifungal properties, along with being anti-inflammatory. \n\nNOTE: This is not medical advice. I am not a doctor, I’m just sharing my personal experience. Always consult a healthcare professional before trying new treatments.\n\nBest of luck to you all! ",

Reading about it, it is a weak androgen receptor antagonist and it doesn't really hit high enough levels in the blood to reduce the production of testosterone. I tried it a few times and didn't like how drying it was. After reading this article, I decided to give it another go:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6369642/\n\nThe authors argue that \"the scalp commensal organism, Malassezia, has been recognized to be a source of oxidative damage. Therefore, hair care products, specifically shampoos, with active Malassezia inhibitory agents, such as zinc pyrithione, tend to reduce premature hair loss, besides the known benefits in treating specific dermatologic scalp pathologies, and therefore **should represent an integral part of every treatment regimen for hair loss, even in individuals not showing symptoms of scalp pathologies**.\"\n\nI've been using it consistantly for 2 months (twice a week, left on for 5 minutes and washed off) and it has made a big difference in the quality and thickness of my hair, and it has helped reduce my scalp irritation from the topical I am using (only on topical fin and microneedling). Will post pictures in a few months. \n\nIf you can't tolerate Nizoral, at least get on a zinc pyrithione shampoo (eg. Head & Shoulders) as it will also kill off any yeast, reduce oxidative damage to the hairs and make the scalp healthier and more hospitable to growing hair.",

While his claims that he has found the cure for psoriasis are superfluous and clickbaity, I did become curious about what the medical literature has to say about zinc preparations, both via topical preparations and through oral preparations. Here's what I found:\n\n**Disclaimer, I am NOT a physician. Consult your dermatologist before making any changes to your medications. I am just reporting what I found from the literature.**\n______________________________________\n**Regarding Topical Preparation of Zinc:**\nThere are two studies - one is a case report and the other is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial - in which topical preparations of zinc (in the form of zinc pyrithione) were tested for efficacy. \n\n\n1) This study divided the patients into 2 groups, one receiving a cream with 0.25% zinc pyrithione and the other group receiving plain moisturizer. Both used the creams twice daily. **The zinc pythrione group has a significant improvement in their psoriasis lesions compared to placebo (p < 0.01).** While the results are very significant, it is important to note that the sample size was only 60 patients total, with 30 being assigned to each group. While this P value is very low (meaning that the chance of this result being due to randomness being less than 1%), the study would be more powerful with a larger patient population.  \n\n[Sadeghian G, Ziaei H, Nilforoushzadeh MA. Treatment of localized psoriasis with a topical formulation of zinc pyrithione. Acta Dermatovenerol Alp Pannonica Adriat. 2011;20(4):187–90.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22367374) \n\n2) This study demonstrated efficacy, but it was found later that this preparation known as SkinCap actually had clobetasol in the formula, thus voiding the study. This product is no longer available in the United States. [Crutchfield, Charles E. III MMB MD; Lewis, Eric J. MB PhD; & Zelickson, Brian D. MD. (1997). The Highly Effective Use of Topical Zinc Pyrithione in the Treatment of Psoriasis: A Case Report. Dermatology Online Journal, 3(1).] (http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1hr315zj)\n\n**My thoughts on topical zinc:** it appears that it can be efficacious. For those who are not treating their psoriasis with prescriptions, topical preparations of zinc might prove to be helpful. This is supported only by one study though, and more research needs to be done. Topical zinc pyrithione in the form of shampoos and creams is available over the counter and has a long safety record. If anyone tries or has tried any of these topical formulations on their psoriasis, please share your results / thoughts!\n\n_____________\n**Regarding Oral Zinc Supplementation:**\nI have found two studies on Oral Zinc Supplementation. One was for Psoriatic Arthritis, and one was for Plaque Psoriasis. \n\n\n1) This Psoriatic Arthritis trial was a double-blind crossover study where 12 patients were given oral zinc 3x/day (220mg each time = 660mg/day) over the course of 12 weeks while the other 12 were recieved placebo (trial I). Some continued for an additional 24 weeks (trial II). The patients recieving zinc had an improvement of their joint pain in trial 1 (p < 0.02), but no improvements elsewhere. In the extension trial, **an improvement in pain (p < 0.02) and morning stiffness (p < 0.05) were noted**; however, **No skin improvement or improvement in overal joint functional capacity were noted.** Also, side effects were minimal, with no statistically significant increased risk associated. \n[CLEMMENSEN, SIGGAARD-ANDERSEN, WORM, STAHL, FROST, BLOCH. Psoriatic arthritis treated with oral zinc sulphate. British Journal of Dermatology 1980;103(4):411–5.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7002197)\n\n2) This second study attempted to treat plaque psoriasis using oral zinc sulphate. There was no significant improvement in the group treated with zinc when compared to the placebo controlled group. [Burrows NP, Turnbull AJ, Punchard NA, Thompson RP. A trial of oral zinc supplementation in psoriasis. Cutis. 1994.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/7956335)\n\n**Thoughts on Oral Zinc Supplementation:** Simply put, the evidence just isn't there to support its usage for plaque psoriasis. In both the psoriatic arthritis trial and the plaque psoriasis trial, skin did not improve with zinc. Also, the amounts of of zinc used were way higher than the [amount found to be toxic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2407097). **In the long term, zinc poisoning can lead to inhibition of iron absorption, thus leading to Anemia. The amounts used studying psoriatic arthritis were extremely high, near the points of toxicity.** I believe your doctor **would not recommend taking large amounts of oral zinc to treat these conditions.** \n\n______________________________\nTL;DR:\nA) Topical Zinc pyrithione has been shown to work on psoriasis plaques. This might be a relatively benign way to improve your skin and scalp. I have some scalp psoriasis and I personally might buy some zinc pyrithione shampoo after writing this article. \n\nB) Oral zinc supplementation has been shown to reduce pain and joint stiffness in psoriatic arthritis, but at levels that can be considered dangerous. There is also no evidence supporting the use of oral zinc supplementation to improve skin either.\n\n\nEdit: The voided study documenting \"Skincap\" was a case report, and not a double-blind placebo controlled trial. I corrected this accordingly.\n\nEdit 2: added values for oral zinc. **Do not follow this protocol for taking zinc. It's too much and can lead to long-term problems such as Anemia.**\n",

It hadn’t looked like this since high school. It was dull, red, ruddy, and had a bunch of little white bumps that seemed to keep spreading. I had just started gua sha as a self care thing, but I think what it really did was spread around what I now believe was fungal acne. The info on Simple Skincare Science helped me so much. I found his list of fungal acne safe products and adjusted my routine. \n\nMy BEFORE was: \nAM:\n•Paulas Choice Clear salicylic acid cleanser  \n•Clarisonic Mia brush\nPM:\n•Paulas Choice Clear salicylic acid cleanser\n•Neutrogena On The Spot benzoyl peroxide spot treatment (2.5%)\n\nNothing was helping. Thanks to SSS I decided to use Nizoral shampoo as my initial fungal acne treatment. It improved my skin within a matter of DAYS. I was shocked. But I was using it a bit more than I should have, which caused some tightness/dryness. So for a more sustainable product I got Happy Cappy Zinc pyrithione baby shampoo which also combats fungal acne without the worry of the fungus becoming resistant the way it does with the Ketaconazole in Nizoral. After a months use of this, the tiny white bumps were completely gone. I did, however, still have some discoloration and dullness. So I finally decided to take the leap and incorporate some chemical exfoliants into my routine which I had only done unsuccessfully once before. But this time they were tremendously helpful and have improved my skin more than anything I have ever used. Anyways, enough talking. \nHere is my CURRENT routine:\nAM: \n•Rinse face with water, sometimes raw honey\n• Gently rub face with ice cubes\n•COSRX Snail Mucin\n\nPM: \n•Happy Cappy wash (Pyrithione Zinc 0.95%)\n•Alternate between TO Lactic acid 5% AHA and COSRX Blackhead Power Liquid BHA with a rest day in between. \n•COSRX Snail Mucin\n\nThanks so much for all of your help and knowledge, you guys are amazing!\n\nEdit: sorry for the way the routines look, I’m still sort of new to posting long texts on Reddit and I’m not sure how to get the bullet points to go in a vertical row :(",

I have dry, sensitive and acne-prone skin that has made finding a routine that works a nightmare. Even worse, it seemed like the acne on my face was a different type every few months.\n\nI've been off and on curology, and it's done absolute wonders, but within the past few months I started getting weird little bumps, flesh colored with no head/inflammation ALL over my face and hairline. They were incredibly stubborn, not responding to AHAs, BHAs, double cleansing, diet, etc. I wasn't about to go back on differin because it destroyed my skin before improving it. \n\nSo, I contacted my Curology derm, who added Zinc Pyrithione to my formula. I had done some research on the type of acne Zinc is effective for and I had a hunch for a while that it would help my case, so I ran out and grabbed a trial-size Head and Shoulders shampoo and used it in my hair, applying a small amount to my face every other night for a week or so. I also want to say I don't condone this because there's all sorts of irritating ingredients and I was using shampoo on my face for goodness sake, but I was SO desperate.\n\nAnd...*it worked!*\n\n**TLDR: If you're seeing a similar type of acne to mine, give Zinc a shot. There's OTC medication, supplements, and soap bars it comes in so you don't have to go for the Head and Shoulders like I did.** \n\nCurrent Routine:\n\nMorning:\n\n* Splash cold water on face, pat dry\n* Biore Watery Gel Sunscreen\n\nNight:\n\n* Garnier Micellar Water on a cotton round to remove city grime/makeup \n* Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser (non-foaming) \n* Pat dry with clean towel\n* Splash Thayers Rose Witch Hazel on face\n* Apply Rosehip Oil\n* After oil has \"sunk in,\" apply curology (8% Azelaic Acid, 1% Clindamycin, 0.25% Zinc Pyrithione)\n\nI'm also on oral birth control, wash my glasses with cleanser or anti-bacterial soap/makeup brushes often, and change pillow cases not infrequently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "It’s likely that the [basic haircare regimen provided on this sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1km6dx/basic_haircare_guide/) will improve the health of your hair. To get it looking its absolute best however may require some additional care depending on your hair type and preferred hairstyle.      \nYour hair type, which is largely genetic, includes the shaft thickness, level of curl, shaft shape, moisture tendency/porosity, and number of hairs per unit area of your scalp (Robbins). Shaft thickness is what it sounds like, the diameter of your hair shaft. Thicker hair will tend to stand up to breakage better. Level of curl depends on the amino acid chain structure in your hair's cortex. Straight hair comes from straight chains, while curly hair has kinks and bends in the chains. Shaft shape determines how much light is reflected off the surface of the shaft and thus how shiny the hair looks naturally. East Asian hair is the roundest and reflects the most light, while black hair is naturally flatter and reflects the least. Moisture tendency is how well your hair maintains moisture and resists damage, which is impacted by your level of oil production and the thickness of your cuticle. Related, porosity is the degree to which water and product molecules can penetrate the cuticle layer, thereby making it easier to gain/lose moisture. Finally, number of hairs is the density of hair follicles on your scalp. The following are common problems that are due to a combination of unhealthy hair and hair type, along with our recommendations to start your pursuit of solving these problems:\n\n**Flat and thin** – volume has to do with your shaft thickness and follicle density. Dry hair shrinks in size, so giving your hair plenty of moisture will help plump up the shaft a little bit (Mainkar and Jolly). There isn’t much you can do about the density of follicles on your head, but some people do experience significant hair loss. In this case, refer to our [article on hair growth](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1km6la/growing_healthy_hair/) or speak with your doctor if the loss is significant. And while this doesn't affect the *actual* volume of your hair, root boosters stimulate the follicle or use product to make the hair stand up more, giving the illusion of more volume. Just watch out for products with ingredients with high bacisity/pH above about 8. Bases swell the hair by weakening the protein bond strength in your cortex, so while this gives you more volume it also weakens your hair. \n\n**Breaking** – Breakage happens when shaft strength is compromised and damaging agents are able to sever the protein bonds in your cortex. Avoiding [sources of damage](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1km6fx/hair_damage_sources_and_how_to_prevent_it/) reduces the chance of breakage, and conditioning will protect the hair and limit moisture loss. Silicone products can help bind together split ends (Sandhu, Ramachandran, and Robbins), but the use of these products should be paired with a clarifying shampoo. Regular shampoo doesn’t unbind silicone from the hair, and a buildup of this product at the follicle can reduce hair growth. The best way to prevent split ends from splitting all the way up the length of your hair is to get regular trims. Protein treatments can also make the hair stronger if it stretches a lot or feels mushy while wet.\n\n**Frizzy** - Frizz is primarily attributed to cuticle uplift, which causes breakage, moisture loss, and friction (Bellare, Iyer, Mainkar, and Jolly). Treat breakage as explained above. To address the cuticles, smoothing products that include fatty alcohols and silicones can help smooth the cuticle and make it look less frayed. Avoiding sources of damage, especially heat and sulfates, is also very helpful. Other causes of uplift are hard water, shampoos that are more basic than a pH of 6.5, and our hair's natural structure (porosity). \n\n**No shine** – To improve upon our natural tendency for shine, we can encourage the cuticle to lay flat (Bellare, Iyer, Mainkar, and Jolly). Heat makes it rise, which can be helpful when you want oil and water to penetrate to the cortex, but frequent blow drying and showering in very hot water can leave these cuticles standing up all day, as well as excessive brushing. Conditioning products address this issue (Rebenfeld, Weighmann, and Dansizer). Silicone products will also reflect more light. \n\n**Rough or brittle feel** – This is also an issue of raised cuticles or uneven cuticle surfaces due to breakage. Again, conditioning and reducing breakage agents are a good starting place to improving softness. \n\n**Won't hold a curl** - Ability to hold a curl (whether through heat or no heat styling), is a function of hair's elasticity (Beyak, Kass, and Meyer). Healthy, stronger hair will hold a curl better than damaged and dry hair. Some people's hair is just naturally more resistant to curl, however, depending on the shape and density of the cortex cells. Many people report that no-heat curls hold better than heated curls, especially if prepped with a styling spray beforehand and/or sprayed with hairspray afterwards. \n\n**Dandruff** - Some people are naturally predisposed to dandruff, which is the flaking of scalp skin. For others it is a reaction to skin irritation. To combat this problem, make sure there are no products you are using or food that you're eating that may cause irritation. Beyond that, shampoos that are designed for dandruff control are largely effective, especially ones containing piroctone olamine, salicylic acid, and/or zinc pyrithone (Lodén). Adding essential oils to your hair like chamomile, cedarwood, sage, eucalyptus, patchouli, rosemary, or ylang ylang to your shampoo and condition can also calm the scalp (*Essential Oils*). \n\n**Oily hair** - Oily hair is most often a symptom of over-washing, when the scalp produces excess oil to keep up with what is lost. If you are washing every day or every other day, try cutting down on your frequency (this requires an adjustment period of a couple weeks). Check also other sources that may be drying out your hair and scalp and causing the sebaceous glands to work in overdrive - things like hard water, products with alcohol, heat styling, etc. If oily hair continues, then this is a function of abnormal activity in the sebaceous glands. Some people report that adding lemon, lemongrass, patchouli, rosemary, tea tree, or ylang ylang essential oil to their shampoos and conditioners soothes this behavior (*Essential Oils*). As a latch ditch effort, excess oil in hair can be absorbed by dry shampoo. \n\n**Static** - Staticy hair is the result of electron transfer from the hair strand to some other object, making the hair more positively charged. This charged hair is attracted to the negatively charged object at the same time it repels other positively charged strands, making it stand up and annoyingly stick to things. Friction is the main perpetrator of this electron transfer, so damaged hair will tend to get more static (*Unexpected Properties of Hair*), but use of heat tools also increases the tendency of the hair to lose its electrons (*Pyroelectricity*). One solution to this problem is to apply leave in conditioners. These reduce friction in the hair strand by smoothing the cuticle, as give the hair strand more weight so there is more gravitational force for electrostatic effects to fight against. Another solution is to hydrate the hair and protect it from dryness, as static electricity is lower in the presence of water. \n\n------\n\n*cited sources:*\n\nBellare J, Iyer R, Mainkar A, Jolly C.

Soap scum is real and will build up slowly in your washer and pipes. I never had to wash my washer until I did this. But a soap scum line developed at the high water mark and slowly grew. Modern soap does not do this and so it never occurred to me. I mentioned this to my MIL and she said the same thing will happen in your drain pipes, that was what pipe cleaners were originally for! So be aware you will have to deal with that.\n\n3. Your clothes will wear and fade faster. Modern detergents have brighter in them and are gentle on clothes, borax and the like are not.

    "body": "Hello everyone!\n\nI'll keep this short. I'm a 26-year-old male, and I’ve been dealing with folliculitis for over 10 years. Recently, after a bout of food poisoning, my folliculitis flared up severely, with large, painful red boils. My dermatologist prescribed the following treatment plan:\n\n1. **Clindamycin Lotion**: Apply morning and night on the scalp (Clindamycin Target or Ygielle) every day for 20 days.\n2. **Octenisan Wash Shampoo**: Use daily for one month (I combined this with Head & Shoulders Menthol).\n\nThis protocol cleared up my scalp, but unfortunately, the boils returned after about two weeks. I noticed my folliculitis worsened significantly whenever I consumed certain foods:\n\n* Sugar\n* Wheat\n* Dairy\n\nGiven that my symptoms intensified after food poisoning, I began to suspect a link to my gut health—possibly an overgrowth of staph bacteria in my GI tract affecting my scalp. So, I decided to cut out sugar, wheat, and dairy. Through extensive research, I found that **Bacillus subtilis** can help restore gut health and reduce staph in the gut, with positive results reported within 4 weeks in published studies. Here’s the updated protocol I followed:\n\n1. **Clindamycin Lotion: Applied morning and night on the scalp for 20 days.**\n2. **Octenisan Wash Shampoo: Used daily for a month, along with Head & Shoulders Menthol (any zinc pyrithione shampoo should work).**\n3. **Bacillus subtilis Supplement: Taken daily for at least 2 months (I used the Ecosh brand).**\n4. **No Sugar, Wheat, or Dairy: Eliminated for at least 2 weeks.**\n\nIt’s been nearly 2 months now, and I’m folliculitis-free, even with occasional indulgences in sugar, wheat, and dairy. The clindamycin lotion initially cleared my scalp, but the **B. subtilis** appears to be what’s kept it that way by addressing the staph at the root.\n\n**Note:** In rare cases, Bacillus subtilis can cause infections, particularly in people with weakened immune systems.\n\nOf course, this may not work for everyone, but it’s worth a try—especially without oral antibiotics.",

I think I started getting it around age 25 which was so annoying because I hardly had acne as a teenager.  I tried many things from gentle to harsh and nothing worked.  \n\nWithin a couple weeks of Curology it was gone!  So I let it run out and didn’t use it for about a month and it’s back.  Bummer but I can absolutely say for sure that Curology worked for me.  I just do the bottle treatment because that’s what they had when I signed up and why fix what’s not broken?  I’d been interested in hearing other people’s experiences with the regiments though.  \n\nI didn’t experience any additional dryness or negative effects.  I’m guessing this formula is pretty gentle but I’m thrilled it’s been so effective. \n\nMy formula in case anyone is interested:\n-zinc pyrithione 0.25%\n-clindamycin 1%\n-niacinamide 4%\n\nThanks to all the people that shared their experiences in the past on here because I had never heard of it before!",

    "body": "Hi everyone, I vowed that if I ever managed to cure myself I would share a post here in the event it helps another who is struggling with this horrible condition.\n\nPrior to April 2022, my skin was great! After a course of antibiotics for an infection, I noticed a lump under my skin by my jaw in my beard area. This soon erupted into a boil, that formed a carbuncle, and all of a sudden around my nose, mouth, chin, jawline and eventually neck I had full on folliculitis.\n\nMy folliculitis was characterised by inflamed hair follicles that would become red, raised whiteheads that would eventually burst, often forming large patches of carbuncles next to one another, spreading around the affected area. I’m sure I don’t need to go into how much it affected me mentally, and I feel for everyone in the same position. \n\nI went to multiple dermatologists, only one of whom really listened, and provided me with something that worked - Lymecycline antibiotics. But after two courses of that, it came back with a vengeance.\n\nThings I tried that did nothing (or very little):\n- Nizoral - derm prescribed - THE WORST - absolutely nuked my skin, was red and raw for over a week.\n- Benzoyl Peroxide\n- Zinc Pyrithione soap\n- Post shave Osma block\n- Doxycycline\n- Fucidic Acid\n- Azealiac Acid\n- Metronidazole\n- Antibiotic soap bar\n- Head and shoulders shampoo\n- Low inflammation diet + various supplements including biofilm defense - this didn’t do anything for my skin but I felt many other positive effects so have kept this up.\n- Staph decolonization protocol in the nostrils with chlorhexadine/triple antibiotic ointment.\n\nThings I found gave some relief/management but we’re not a long term fix, or were detrimental over time:\n\n- I used to get some control over the worst of the outbreaks by using chlorhexadine soap as a face wash in my beard area, followed by an actual face wash containing salicylic acid. Over time I phased the chlorhexadine wash out because it felt too harsh and my skin became so dry and flaky.\n\n- The only moisturiser I managed to find for a while that didn’t inflame things was Neutrogena’s oil free clear and defend with salicylic acid. This actually got me quite clear for a little bit, but it didn’t last. I started to mix some chlorhexadine into it before putting it on as a moisturiser, which also got me clear for a bit but started to be too harsh for my skin, which became red and irritated.\n\n- Eventually in place of chlorhexadine I ordered Triple Antibiotic Ointment - this stuff was a revelation!! - at first… I used it liberally on my beard after a shower and while it formed a kind of annoying, thick, shiny coating it did tackle the problem pretty well. However, after a few months I could tell the folliculitis was starting to fight back, and I became nervous about resistance - especially because TAO contains three very potent antibiotics I didn’t want to the folliculitis to gain resistance to. I also used it in my nose as a disinfection protocol, but with no discernible value.\n\n- I tried a protocol suggested on another post in this sub, using Octneisan as a face wash in the shower, followed by Skinsan scrub, and then after the shower using Prontoderm antibiotic foam. I also bought the Prontoderm nasal disinfectant gel to try. This routine had a bit of a positive effect on the folliculitis, but definitely felt quite harsh on the skin, and overall when the products ran out and it came time to repurchase, I didn’t feel it was worth it for the relatively minor effect it had. I did keep buying the Prontoderm gel for a while as this was quite gentle, but eventually stopped when I realised it wasn’t having much of an effect.\n\n- Weleda’s after shave balm could provide some comfort to the irritation, but didn’t seem to do anything for the actual folliculitis.\n\n- I went on Accutane 20mg then up to 30mg for a full course, which maybe made things a little bit better, but definitely not cleared up, and the side effects (dryness) weren’t worth it for the small amount of impact it had on the folliculitis. \n\n- After the Accutane failed, I got a bit of relief by using rubbing alcohol either as a disinfectant wipe or soaked in a cotton pad on my face after every shower, before applying the Neutrogena moisturiser. This caused some kind of die off but also damaged my skin and led once again to more redness and inflammation. \n\n- I would always disinfect my razors and blades before shaving, and eventually stopped close shaving altogether. I found if I let my beard get too long the folliculitis would worsen, and if I close shaved it would erupt, so the best way to keep the worst of it under control was carefully keeping my beard trimmed short with an electric razor. My lymph nodes under my chin/neck were swollen always - less when the flare up was smaller, and a lot when larger.\n\n- I also tried doing nothing to my skin, and letting it repair itself with just water, or just a gentle sensitive skin friendly face wash, but this always led to a large flare up.\n\n- After facing redness and irritation as well as the folliculitis returning after trying my rubbing alcohol routine, I went to the store desperate for something soothing, and saw a brand with both pure Aloe Vera gel and an Aloe Vera gentle face wash. I got both, tried them, and immediately felt some relief. I generously lathered my beard with the aloe Vera gel after showering, and it felt great. My pustules shrunk and disappeared, and for about a week I had relatively normal skin, which I hadn’t had for so long by this point. I couldn’t believe it, how could it be this easy? How could the treatment have been under my nose this whole time while all the derms couldn’t help me?\n\n- After that week, where I was using only the aloe Vera face wash and pure aloe Vera gel on my beard, I noticed the folliculitis stubbornly trying to re-emerge. Over the next couple of weeks, the aloe Vera fought valiantly but it wasn’t fully enough to vanquish the folliculitis completely. I went back to the store and looked around for some other natural products that could pair well with the aloe, and help repair my skin barrier and keep this thing at bay. Something with antimicrobial and anti inflammatory products.\n\nI found a brand of natural tea tree oil moisturiser, as well as a bottle of pure tea tree oil. My routine then became:\n\n- Aloe Vera face wash in the shower\n- A layer of aloe Vera gel on the beard as a primer. Let it dry.\nThe tea tree oil moisturiser mixed with 2-3 drops of tea tree oil, tapped gently into the beard area. Let it sink in and absorb.\n- A final layer of aloe Vera gel on top.\n\nTwice a day - I shower with warm (not hot) water morning and night.\n\nWhen I tell you how good my skin felt, it was like HEAVEN! A warm, glowing feeling in my beard, and in a matter of three days, I could tell that this was working wonders - all signs of inflamed follicles and pustules had gone, I couldn’t feel any signs of any trying to emerge or forming lumps under the skin. Beard trimming was a breeze. All that remained was residual redness from the previous inflammations, which was also rapidly fading.\n\nOne week in and I was gobsmacked and delighted to see my skin look literally how it did in April 2022, before all this began. \n\nI’ve now phased out the drops of tea tree oil mixed into the moisturiser in the morning, only doing it at night now, just to see how it goes. Skin still going strong, and I feel like myself again. It’s hard to explain the relief I feel right now, and I wish everyone else suffering gets the chance to feel the same!\n\nI can drop brands if anyone is curious as to what products exactly I’m using. And feel free to ask any questions, I tried to keep this quite short but that didn’t quite happen! I’ve tried a lot of things from this sub over the years, and it’s one of the few places that helped keep me hopeful and motivated to keep problem solving and finding a cure when all I felt like doing was giving up and becoming a recluse. So thank you all! 🙏\n",

Then I went back to my old shitty diet of to many carbs, beer and sugar and it slowly came back again. In my experience you have to try to heal your body from within by eating a clean diet then maybe join a gym that has a sauna to help clean out your pours. I try to stay away from antibiotics because the amount of good gut flora they kill isn’t worth it and usually makes it come back worse. Good luck.",

    "body": "What's up r/onebag??\n\nI just made my first overseas trip as an adult! Going in, I had absolutely no idea what I was doing, or even where I was going. I got a scholarship for a 10-day educational tour in England and France, and I figured what the hell, might as well take advantage of being there. So I had my school schedule my flight home for six weeks after the tour ended to give myself some quality backpacking time. I went straight from school to the airport, so I didn't have much time to research what to bring, and I didn't actually plan my trip until the day the tour ended. I was sitting in the hotel after all my classmates left, fiending on kiwi and hostelworld to throw together some cheap spots to visit. Somehow, I made it to over a dozen countries, found myself with everything I needed, and had an amazing time. I just got back and I'll post my afterthoughts at the end of this packing list.\n\n**Clothing**\n\n* 1 x [Uniqlo pocketable parka](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/men-pocketable-parka-413975.html) - this was handy for windy weather and as a pillow on buses/trains/planes, but it never rained on me once the entire time I was there! Not even in England! I couldn't believe it. One time it started to rain in France as my plane left but that's it. A couple of the countries I visited had bad weather up to the day I came, but never when I was actually there. Apparently when I returned to England they'd had miserable weather for the last week and a half, but when I got there, it was blue and clear skies ...I am literally a ray of fucking sunshine.\n\n* 1 x [blue Express linen chinos](https://www.express.com/clothing/men/classic-textured-plaid-linen-dress-pant/pro/04033404C/color/dark%20blue/) - lightweight and smart. These were a good call.\n\n* 1 x [white Old Navy Flex Quick-Dry lightweight chinos](https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=343738022&pcid=999#pdp-page-content). The white surprisingly matched with all my shirts and had a nice tropical look in the Middle East/southern Europe.\n\n* 2 x [Aeropostale 7.5\" beach shorts](https://www.aeropostale.com/classic-stretch-7.5%22-beach-shorts/66124107.html?dwvar_66124107_color=182&dwvar_66124107_size=2700&cgid=#q=mens%2Bshorts&lang=default&start=53) (green and khaki) - Glad I brought these for the Middle East and Central Europe, but never wore them in Western Europe. Would've stood out a bit.\n\n* 2 x [Uniqlo Supima cotton t-shirt](https://www.aeropostale.com/taco-adjustable-hat/76035684.html?dwvar_76035684_color=468&cgid=#q=hat&lang=default&start=43). The ones online don't have front pockets, but the ones I bought in-store do. I didn't notice they had pockets when I bought them and I'm glad they do - the frockets were clutch for holding shades, tickets, and the like.\n\n* 2 x [Uniqlo premium linen button downs](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/men-premium-linen-long-sleeve-shirt-414572.html?dwvar_414572_color=COL54&cgid=) (white and beige) - The linen was great in warm weather and still looked smart enough to go out at night. I cut the collar off the beige one to give it a cool mandarin-collar look. It worked well.\n\n* 1 x H&M floral short sleeve button down. Don't have a link for this - I bought it a few years ago. Glad I brought a short-sleeve button down, and the floral print was well-received.\n\n* 1 x polyester workout shirt - Just a generic poly shirt I got for running a triathlon. Material makes it wash and dry easily\n\n* 1 x workout shorts - Basic pair of polyester shorts. Quick wash an dry.\n\n* 1 x compression shorts - Same as above. Polyester, quick wash and dry.\n\n* 1 x Daniel Cremieux easy-wash swim shorts - They have some coating on them to make them even easier to wash than normal swim shorts. This also makes them last longer. I didn't appreciate this until I covered myself in mud from the Dead Sea. They also don't fade as quickly from hot tubs and chlorine pools. I bought them years ago and can't find anything similar online to link to.\n\n* 1 x PacSun tank top - Used it occasionally as an undershirt or alone when I went to the beach/pool. Old, don't have a link.\n\n* 3 x [Smartwool merino wool socks](https://www.smartwool.com/shop/mens-wool-socks-1) - Wish I'd brought one more pair but the merino wool was fantastic. Easy to wash in the sink and never got too hot or cold.\n\n* 5 x [Smartwool](https://www.smartwool.com/shop/mens-underwear)/Lapasa Homme merino wool underwear - I'll never understand why people skimp on underwear. Taking five instead of two or three pairs used up practically no extra space and saved my gonads from reeking.\n\n* 1 x Cole Haan leather sneakers in blue - Lightweight, durable, and smart-looking. They have a Cole Haan upper and a Nike sole. It's a nice blend of formal and sporty. Bought them at a sample sale. I don't think they sell anything similar anymore.\n\n* 1 x [Rancourt Dirigo handsewn leather boots](https://www.rancourtandcompany.com/men-s/boots/dirigo-handsewn-boot.html) in brown - I made sure to get a pair of well-constructed boots with Vibram soles before going. These are fantastic, tough walking shoes that held up to my 10+ mile days and supported my ankles when I needed it.\n\n* [1 x Old Navy flip flops](https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=394869012&pcid=999#pdp-page-content) - Cheap flip-flops for the hostel showers\n\n* 1 x [hat with a taco on it](https://www.aeropostale.com/taco-adjustable-hat/76035684.html?dwvar_76035684_color=468&cgid=#q=hat&lang=default&start=43)\n\n**Electronics**\n\n* iPhone XR\n\n* [Surface Pro 6](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/microsoft-surface-pro-6-12-3-touch-screen-intel-core-i5-8gb-memory-128gb-solid-state-drive-latest-model-platinum/6298148.p?skuId=6298148) - Awesome laptop. 8GB DDR4 RAM, 8th gen i5, and 128GB SSD plus a sharp display and touch screen. Removable keyboard is clutch - great for watching movies and reading news, eBooks, etc on planes/trains/buses. The touch screen UI needs some work but besides that I like it.\n\n* [Bowers & Wilkins PX noise-canceling headphones](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/bowers-wilkins-px-wireless-noise-cancelling-over-the-ear-headphones-soft-gold/6129016.p?skuId=6129016) - If you're wondering how I have all this nice tech as a college student, it's because I used to work at Best Buy. These headphones are one of the best investments I've made. They look great, the sound quality is clear, and you can't hear a thing with the noise-canceling on.\n\n* 10,000 mAh battery\n\n* [2 TB MyPassport SSD drive](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/wd-my-passport-ssd-2tb-external-usb-3-1-gen-2-portable-solid-state-drive-with-hardware-encryption-black/6253915.p?skuId=6253915) - For movies and photos. SSD holds up to physical damage well. The Surface only has 128GB of internal storage.\n\n* Micro USB, USB-C, and lightning cables. Still waiting for the day everyone goes USB-C.\n\n* Surface Pro charger\n\n* International power converter\n\n\n**Toiletries**\n\nI bought a cheap travel toiletries kit from Walmart [similar to this](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Men-s-Get-Away-10-pc-Travel-Kit/44684600) and added some stuff of my own. The clear bag it came in was surprisingly durable and made going through security easy. \n\n* 1 x 4\" x 4\" microfiber towel - Forgot to buy a travel towel so I grabbed this (unused) car detailing towel from my garage and it exceeded my expectations. Never got too damp and dried in an hour.\n\n* Liquid Soap - I poured my regular soap/shampoo into hotel toiletry containers I'd saved.\n\n* [Nizoral shampoo](https://www.amazon.com/Nizoral-D-Anti-Dandruff-Shampoo-Fl/dp/B0000Y3CRY/ref=sr_1_4?crid=21LA3W9CSUIN3&keywords=nizoral&qid=1562348914&s=gateway&sprefix=panamax+mr%2Caps%2C126&sr=8-4) - Prevented dandruff even in the sunniest, driest conditions. Doesn't dry out hair as much as zinc pyrithione (Head & Shoulders) does.\n\n* **[Travel-sized Gold Bond](https://www.amazon.com/Gold-Bond-Original-Strength-Relief/dp/B012FUYJEA/ref=sr_1_5?crid=21LA3W9CSUIN3&keywords=gold+bond+travel+size&qid=1562349015&s=gateway&sprefix=panamax+mr%2Caps%2C126&sr=8-5)** Can't recommend this one enough, fellas\n\n* Cologne\n\n* 2 x toothbrush \n\n* Travel-size toothpaste\n\n* Floss\n\n* Misc band aids/gauze of various sizes\n\n* Hand sanitizer\n\n* Ibuprofen, generic Zyrtec, phenylephrine hydrochloride, generic Mucinex, and generic Robitussin - I got pretty sick for one week and ended up going through almost all my medicine. Really glad I brought the mucinex and robitussin.\n\n* [Philips Norelco OneBlade electric shaver](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Norelco-OneBlade-QP2520-90/dp/B01D328BG6/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=21LA3W9CSUIN3&keywords=philips+oneblade&qid=1562349077&s=gateway&sprefix=panamax+mr%2Caps%2C126&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1) - I brought the charger but ended up never using it. Shaved about every four days (12 times total). I could've saved space and brought a regular razor but the OneBlade is easy on the skin. If you have sensitive skin I highly recommend it.\n\n* Travel-size Arm & Hammer deodorant - Advertised as \"all natural\" with no aluminum and whatever. Don't think it helped much. Next time I'm just getting the chemical-ridden, doubtlessly-carcinogenic antiperspirant so I don't stink after two hours walking in the sun. \n\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n* Canvas drawstring bag for day trips - This was clutch for carrying food and other misc items on heavy walking days, and took up practically no space in the Osprey.\n\n* [Ray Ban aviators](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ray-Ban-RB3025-Aviator-Classic-Gold-Frame-Green-Classic-G-15-Lens/183866459826?hash=item2acf4b86b2:g:fUkAAOSwRaRc-Z8B) - I wasn't an advocate for high-end sunglasses before this trip, but I am now. These went through the ringer and held up in situations cheap knock-off wouldn't. They were dropped, walked on, and bent grotesquely out of shape - and never failed to return to normal use. You may not need Ray Bans, but don't get those sub-$20 sunglasses from that startup you see in the Facebook ads.\n\n* Wallet - Just a basic Tommy Hilfiger trifold I got for Christmas five years ago. Next time I'll probably buy something slimmer designed for travel.\n\n* Passport\n\n* [2 x Brink's 22mm TSA padlocks](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Brinks-22mm-TSA-Brass-Padlock-2-Count/17126549). I think someone tried to crack them in the luggage room of a hostel once and they held up just fine.\n\n* [Hamilton Khaki Field 38mm mechanical watch](https://shop.hamiltonwatch.com/hamilton-collection/field/khaki-field-officer-mechanical-h69419363.html) - Just a low-key field watch that most people outside of watch enthusiasts wouldn't recognize as a quality piece of timewear.\n\n* Journal\n\n* [Pilot Metropolitan pen](https://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Collection-Fountain-91107/dp/B009X9Z2FW/ref=sr_1_4?crid=21LA3W9CSUIN3&keywords=pilot+metropolitan&qid=1562349399&s=gateway&sprefix=panamax+mr%2Caps%2C126&sr=8-4) + extra ink - Great starter fountain pen.\n\n* Collapsible water bottle - Handy, but I think I had the space for a regular water bottle. Didn't find myself collapsing it much.\n\n* Eye mask + ear plugs - Used the eye mask, never the ear plugs.\n\n* Lighter and a pack of cigarettes - I don't smoke, but this worked exactly as I planned - for starting conversations.\n\n* Trident gum\n\n* Some kind of food, drink, and alcohol - I usually had a bag of nuts, a bottle of water, and a flask of vodka on me.",

I see results but there’s still more to go. The service has been great so far! I pay less than what it costs to go to a dermatologist as I don’t have insurance.\n\nMy Formula:\n\n-Azelaic acid 2%\n\n\n-Clindamycin 1%\n\n\n-Zinc pyrithione 0.25%\n\n\nA.M. routine:\n\n\n-Rinse face w/ cold water(Hot water seems to dry out my skin)\n\n\n-Curology Cleanser\n\n\n-Dry face with clean towel\n\n\n-Curology Moisturizer\n\n\n-(only when I go outside)Neutogena Breakout Free Sunscreen 50spf\n\nP.M. routine:\n\n-Rinse face w/ cold water\n\n\n-Curology Cleanser\n\n\n-Dry face with clean towel\n\n\n-Curology Formula\n\n\n-Curology Moisturizer\n\nOther notes:\n\nI drink maybe 2 liters(about half gallon) of water daily, I try to avoid foods with added or processed sugar, and I change my pillow cases daily(I put 7 clean pillowcases on the pillow and remove 1 layer before I jump in bed).\n\nI use a derma-roller on my face before my normal P.M. routine ONCE a week. If you don’t have an antibiotic to use on your face after the derma roll, I would NOT recommend this. It pokes tiny holes in your skin which promotes scar & texture healing. I can feel my formula sink into my pores more thoroughly when I do it and my skin looks much shinier the next day. However, there are risks with this, risks being infection or unwanted damage to one’s face. If you do this, be sure to wash face before and let the derma-roller sit in 70% or more Isopropyl alcohol for a minute then shake the alcohol off before you touch your face with it so you don’t irritate skin with alcohol. The derma rollers are like $10 on amazon and a gallon of 95.5% isopropyl alcohol(medical grade alcohol) for about $30 — alcohol is flammable, be careful storing it. Also, i buy a new derma-roller after 4 uses as the needles dull after each use and therefore don’t work properly over time. I do it at night before bed because my Curology formula contains an antibiotic to prevent infection and the roller makes my skin reddish for a few hours.\n\n\n-Thoughts-\n\nAfter a month, I’ve decided I will no longer buy Curology’s cleanser nor moisturizer. Also I don’t need to use the moisturizer at night because the formula is already moisturizing and I believe is more effective alone. The cleanser doesn’t need to be used in the morning as it dries out my face easily. The cleanser and moisturizer work well but not any better than what I can buy at the store for half price. The lip balm is nice though, worth the buy. \n\nThe formula is amazing! I plan to add tretinoin to my current formula so I can clear out the texture on my forehead and acne on my cheeks that have already improved a lot. The Azelaic acid 2% and Clindamycin 1% has cleared up most of the red bumps I had as well as verify that I don’t have a fungal infection. \n\nI have nothing bad to say about the formula itself, rather the packaging. Their formula bottle is only meant to be used at ONE pump a day(the container is the same as a small lotion🧴pumping bottle you might see). I didn’t know about the 1 pump deal until today so I was squirting away to cover my entire face. Last month I used all of the formula, moisturizer and cleanser before the next shipment was due and I was out for days. My face began to break out which sucked as I lost all the progress I made. The bottles are deceptively large and you are only meant to use small amounts. \n\n-Pricing-\n\nWith all that said the formula, cleanser, moisturizer, and lip balm come out to $72.28 per shipment($69.80 + tax; shipping is free). They say this is supposed to last 2 months but it truly doesn’t. Even if i use 1 pump of the formula, it doesn’t cover enough of my face. Using the cleanser and moisturizer twice a day as prescribed, I ran out before next shipment(I only do one quarter sized squirt).\n\nSo in my next shipment I will only buy the formula, which I wish I did from the beginning, as the formula alone costs $40 per shipment. the cleanser and moisturizer are $20 per shipment. I can buy cleanser and moisturizer in larger quantities for about $16 altogether at the store. \n\n-Conclusion-\n\nMy acne has improved. No irritation. At $40 per month this still much cheaper than what I’d pay for a dermatologist(around $40 a month for insurance and deductibles + $60 appointments). I get to speak to a licensed PA whenever I want for concerns for free. No need to drive anywhere or schedule appointments. \nIt’s a good deal for my needs. My acne is mild but if I needed more serious help and a stronger prescription like Accutane, I’d definitely go to a dermatologist or other provider. I hope this helps. \nI would post a before and after picture but this is my first reddit post so I have no idea how. Any help is appreciated :)",

When done in-office, treatments are spaced a few weeks to a month apart.\n\n* Done improperly you can end up with hypopigmentation (white or colorless spots in the skin that do not return to a normal color)\n\n* It hurts.\n\n* You can not fully sterilize the needles at home. They can be sanitized at best.\n\n* The needles can become bent over time, or come from the manufacturer already bent. Small bends can be imperceptible to the naked eye and can cause unwanted damage to your skin.\n\n**Because of these risks, ScA does not recommend attempting dermarolling or dermastamping at home. Please be careful with your skin and your health!**\n\n*If you see that I am replying to something out of context (eg. listed in a routine), please report this comment so my handlers can remove it.

        "body": "**It's a Grift! My Honest Experience with Curology's 'Custom' Rosacea Treatment**\n\nAs someone who has long struggled with rosacea, a perplexing and chronic inflammatory skin condition, I was intrigued by Curology's promise of a tailored treatment plan. They advertise a personalized approach, supposedly creating a bespoke formulation after a consultation with a designated \"dermatologist.\" However, my experience has left me feeling misled and disappointed.\n\nTo set the context, rosacea is a condition shrouded in mystery within the dermatological community, and effective treatment remains a significant challenge. The allure of a custom treatment protocol specifically for my unique skin condition was undeniably appealing. Sadly, the reality didn't live up to the promise.\n\nUpon engaging with Curology, I was presented with a treatment that was far from the personalized solution I was led to expect. Instead, what I received was a familiar cocktail of medications – the same duo of topicals (Ivermectin and Metronidazole) that I've encountered time and again in my journey with rosacea. There was nothing novel or custom about it. It was simply a compound of the standard medications, mixed into a single cream at a compounding pharmacy, located, of all places, in Fenton, Missouri.\n\nTo add insult to injury, they threw in Azelaic acid, which just enraged my already inflamed skin. This experience has reinforced a crucial lesson: skepticism is warranted when it comes to bold claims in skincare, especially for conditions as complex as rosacea. While the idea of a tailored treatment is enticing, my experience with Curology was a stark reminder that, at least in my case, it was more of a marketing angle than a medical reality.\n\nI share this in the hope that it might provide valuable insight for others navigating the challenging waters of rosacea treatment. It's important to approach such promises with caution and to maintain realistic expectations, especially when it comes to a condition as elusive and individual as rosacea.",

    "body": "I am writing this post describing my case history in the hope that it may help others. There is a summary at the bottom of this post if you want to jump straight to that.\n\nApril 2020 Accidentally but repeatedly banged forehead several times on a moss covered oak tree branch trying, unsuccessfully, to evict a squirrel from my yard resulting in a small graze to skin which I treated with antibiotic ointment.\n\nJune 2020 Scab located at point of impact still present, wound not healing properly. I picked the scab and treated variously and unsuccessfully with “second skin”, then antibiotic ointment followed by washing forehead with dandruff shampoo which possibly made things worse. New red area appeared at different location coincident with an infected hair follicle subsequently yielding a white pustule following bath.\n\nJune – August 2020 red area on forehead at location of infected hair follicle small but persistent.\n\nNovember 2020- A new raised bump appeared on forehead at a different location from the previous, itchy and scaly. Red area on forehead growing in size, bumps with yellowish silvery scale appeared on forehead and along hairline and left-side of face, treated with 1% hydrocortisone.\n\nDecember 2020 Telemedicine appointment with Dr. who concurred with me that my symptoms appeared to indicate psoriasis but difficult to diagnose via video. Dr. prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream 0.025% which was applied as directed. Subsequently lost a large circular patch of skin on forehead following bath. My forehead became as red as a baboon’s bottom. Persisted with the cream for 2 weeks during which time more raised scaly red itchy bumps appeared primarily along hairline, spreading across forehead, down left-side of face then the right side. \n\nDecember 2020 Second telemedicine appointment with Dr. who prescribed Ketaconazole 2% shampoo thinking that the condition was perhaps caused by a fungal infection. Applied as directed (10 min application, then wash). The shampoo caused a very itchy dry skin reaction. Tried again 2 days later but limited application to 5 mins, then wash. Same reaction. Ceased using. Started using 100% aloe vera gel (alcohol & fragrance free). Skin became very dry and scaly.\n\nJanuary 2nd 2020 Overall condition worsening. Took matters into own hands. Deliberately exposed forehead, left and right-hand side of face to noonday sun for about 1.5 hours, then applied very liberal coating of Eucerin lotion to all affected areas (forehead, left and right-hand side of face). Left Eucerin in place for 24 hours then exfoliated excess skin using a flannel in warm epsom salt bath. Then applied a very liberal dose of aloe vera to all affected areas which by now were very painful and very red. Ingested 220 mg Naproxin Sodium and 30 mg of antihistamine. Ceased drinking alcohol. Although painful, that process seems to have calmed everything down, but red scarring persists.\n\n\nFebruary 2021 Dr. prescribed Ciclopirox cream for seborrheic dermatitis (SD). Used on face twice daily for the past 2.5 weeks. The medication made my face red, and my skin flake and fall off with no noticeable benefit. The medication does not seem to have mitigated the spread of the disease which has now moved to my eyebrows and eyelids and further down my cheeks and towards my nose. Ciclopirox cream seems to be of some benefit to address relatively new and small patches of SD, but seems to be aggravating when used on large areas of my face such as the forehead and the sides of my face.\n\nKetoconazole shampoo and pyrithione zinc shampoo have been used daily, alternating between the two, on my head/hair, face and body. Neither product seem to have mitigated the disease which has now spread to my chest and back. The shampoos have had no noticeable effect on the scaling on my scalp which appears to have increased.\n\nDr. prescribed Prednisone which has had a noticeable effect on reducing the inflammation. Once the Prednisone finished the rash got much worse probably caused by a rebound following cessation of Prednisone.\n\nThe deterioration of my condition has caused me to consult with my family physician, who prescribed Alprazolam to be taken as needed for anxiety.\n\nFebruary, 2021 Dermatologist performed 3 biopsies on right and left shoulder areas. \nBiopsy results are negative for fungal infection, but did provide evidence consistent with an allergic reaction. Dr. diagnosed rash on chest shoulders and back as Gutate Psoriasis\n\nRash spread rapidly from face to neck, torso, arms, groin and legs. Rash is in the form of red bumps that start small in size but grow into large lesions that shed skin and then bleed. Rash covers 80% of body. Dr. diagnosed as Erythrodermic Psoriasis.\n\nMarch, 2021 Dr. prescribed Methotrexate initially 20 mg/week. Lost most of skin from body. Took daily colloidal oatmeal baths using warm water. Applied Triamcinolone Acetonide 0.1% mixed with Cetaphil moisturizer to a all affected areas twice daily.\nMethotrexate is slow acting so Dr. prescribed weekly 300 mg Cosentyx injections, a biologic. Rash slowly subsiding, the biologic really helped. \n\nApril 2021, Health insurance denied Cosentyx, so Dr. prescribed another biologic; 100 mg Tremfya injections which really helped tamp down the symptoms. Rash receded to where it was back in February; face, shoulders, chest and back.\n\nMay 2021, body rash continues to recede, but red inflamed areas on cheeks persist seemingly untouched by the biologic. It has the appearance of seborrheic dermatitis a perception reinforced by persistent dandruff and scaling on scalp. Used Lotrimin Ultra, an over the counter anti-fungal on face for 10 days, with no measurable improvement. Following Dr's advice, I used Selenium Sulfide 2.5% solution on head and face for several hours a day for several days resulting in some improvement. It is a harsh chemical causing inflammation, and itching and dry skin as side effects which are also the symptoms I'm trying to cure. Backed off Selenium Sulfide to every other day, and switched in alternately to wash hair with coal tar shampoo. Zinc Pyrithione did not help at all. Added Sea Salt to Colloidal Oatmeal baths which exfoliates and dries out skin, but helped calm the inflammation on my face for the first time in months. I was also using an anti-fungal moisturizer \"Oregon maintenance cream\" on my face, but I am of the opinion that whereas moisturizers act as emollients they do not actually cure the problem so I use them as little as possible on my face. I am using \"Remedy Soap\" sparingly on my face once per day which also calms the inflammation. My goal is to dry out and kill whatever this thing is on my face.\n\nHere's summary of what I have learned.\n\n1. My dermatologist was at a loss to diagnose and prescribe suitable medications for seborrheic dermatitis, which in my case progressed to Guttate Psoriasis and then full blown Erythrodermic Psoriasis in just a matter of weeks. I narrowly avoided hospitalization. \n\n2. If you read the research literature there appear to be two parallel lines of research that attribute my symptoms to an \"immune disorder\" and separately to a \"fungal infection\". These lines of research do not appear to cross or coincide.\nThe evidence that it may be both is supported by the fact that the Biologic injections and the topical antifungals helped the rash on my body and face, respectively, but not vice versa.\n\n3. Although the Doctors I consulted with dismiss my hypothesis, I believe that my illness is a manifestation of the Koebner phenomenon that was triggered by the initial bump on the head. My Doctor says that my illness was caused by a genetic predisposition and stress. Research suggests that age (60) and sex (male) also predispose me.",

I'll try to make it short and simple and you can ask me for more information if you need to.\n\n  \n\n\nI just shaved my short beard (safety razor) yesterday without too much irritaion and made sure to shave with the grain, light pressure, etc.\n\n  \n\n\nHere's my issue, I get these whiteheads that come and go even if I grow my beard out or shave. When my skin isn't in remission, the whiteheads mainly form under my mouth on my soul patch area, on my chin and under my chin in the upper[ part of the neck](https://vgy.me/fJcvXg.jpg)\n\n  \n\n\nI also get some where the rest of [my beard area](https://vgy.me/qJbSy1.jpg). It is the strangest thing. My skin under my moustache is fine and the rest of my T zone is fine, but oily.\n\n  \n\n\nI have been prescribed Finacea which I have used for over a month and I am not sure how well it is working. I just ran out yesterday and need to go back to see a dermatologist before I can get a refill.\n\n  \n\n\nIn the morning I will sometimes use a treatment if I think I need it, but sometimes I will just rinse with warm and cold water. Then apply Finacea, let it dry and moisturize. Then apply sunscreen. I have been using the Elta Md uv sport for about a month and it seems to work well with my skin so far except it will make me a bit oily.\n\n  \n\n\nI also cycle between Ketaconazole shampoo, sulfur/salasylic acid wash, and zinc pyrithione for dry flaky skin in the same areas. I wash my face after work with Cerave wash for getting sunscreen off and then apply one of those treatments for about five minutes before rinsing them off and applying finacea and letting it dry. Then either Vanicream or Cerave daily moisturizer last.\n\n  \n\n\nI am sorry if this is unorganized and confusing but I am embarrassed with all these whiteheads that keep forming in the same spots. Also I sweat quite a bit while I am at work because it is hot this time of year.\n\n\nTHANK YOU to everyone who commented on this post! You all are awesome. I am going to try and treat this like folliculitis with using the Ketoconazole every day for at least two weeks and hopefully my next shave doesn't aggrivate it as much as this one did.\n  \n",

Also, my chest or face whenever I got stressed, had a slight skin injury, you name it.  Had middling success with ketoconazole, the zinc soap etc.  \n\nWhat has really worked is changing how I shave, plus putting one or two drops of 100% tea tree oil in my lotion whenever I put it on (I use Cerave PM Ultralightweight with ceramides, niacinamicide, etc.) AHA's like salcylic acid definitely help in between shaving. \n\nWhen I shave, I use the same method as if I'm derma-rolling. First off, avoid old, blunt razors. Get your sharp razor and set it in isopropyl alcohol to disinfect. Wash your skin thoroughly with an anti-fungal soap (I prefer sulphur over p. zinc these days.)  If you have toner with alcohol or your skin won't freak with using a lower isopropyl % to swipe your beard area, do it. Lower that bacteria count. Then shave. Afterwards, apply some moisturizer with a drop or two of tea tree oil mixed in again. Then, disinfect your razor again. \n\nMake sure the tea tree oil is really 100% essential oil. It should smell strongly of medicine, like menthol and camphor had an illigitimate, spicy love baby. If your nostrils aren't immediately offended and don't demand cessation of all olfactory actions, take a pass on the bottle. I've had good luck with NOW brand, but counterfeits are always a problem when it comes to oils.  \n\n&#x200B;",

I used to have thick, shiny, voluminous hair. Now it’s dry, brittle, and lifeless. I’ve been prescribed every medicated shampoo imaginable. I’ve tried ketoconazole, Selsun Blue, zinc pyrithione, clarifying shampoos, and nothing has worked. I honestly believe all of it has wrecked my scalp’s microbiome.\n\nMy scalp gets greasy just a few hours after washing, but my hair still feels like straw. It has no shine, no body, and no softness. I’ve lost so much volume that it looks like I haven’t showered, even when I have. My hair is thinning near the front of my hairline, and I don’t even have a hairstyle that makes me feel presentable anymore. It’s completely killing my confidence.\n\nAt this point, I truly believe the problem goes deeper than my scalp. I think my gut is inflamed and my immune system is struggling. I get cold sores often, my scalp stays flared and scabby, and I honestly think I have a Candida overgrowth or leaky gut. But every dermatologist I’ve seen has just handed me another shampoo and sent me on my way.\n\nTo make things worse, I grew up with an eating disorder. Changing my diet isn’t just hard, it’s emotionally exhausting. Eating healthy feels like a privilege right now. It’s expensive and overwhelming. But I know something inside of me needs to change. My body is clearly asking for help, and I can’t keep ignoring it.\n\nI’m so insecure. I don’t feel like myself anymore. My hair has become a constant reminder that something is wrong,",

A moisturizer like Mediheal makes sure you let scalp doesn’t think it’s dry . Once it thinks so it will drown you in sebum (grease ). \n\nI had a similar condition and got rid of it.

I did tons of internet research after multiple dermatologists told me the same, tired and useless advice.   \n  \nI strictly only use Dermazen's products, including their anti-redness/inflammation and facial maintenance products. It all works WONDERS. Their shampoo is PHENOMENAL and I recommend it to everyone with seb derm/dandruff. Its the ONLY shampoo that completely clears up my scalp for days, and it only requires 3-4 uses/week. On the off days you can use their calming serum and other products so it doesn't make things that expensive at the end of the day. I say give their peaceful skin system a shot. It is expensive but lasts about 6 months if used frugally. \n\nRegarding scalp health and immunity, their products work wonders because they're infused with a great combination of essential oils, vitamins and other things which moisturize and nourish your skin, while not feeding the Malassezia. I highly recommend looking into malasezzia because everyone talks about gut health being the main driver behind their seb-derm, without there being any actual evidence for this. 80-90% of the worse seb- derm instances are caused by the fungus on your scalp being overfed by oils, which is all 100% treatable.",

Simply wash your face with a moisturizing gel for sensitive skin (I use Toleriane by La Roche-Posey). Then use an anti-redness moisturizer and sunscreen. I use Bioderma's anti-redness creams, but I also get along very well with CeraVe SPF 50.\n\n CeraVe's moisturizing and protective cream is much cheaper, so if you get along with it, it will be great. You can also use a moisturizing serum before applying the moisturizer and sunscreen. I now use Skin Resist Sensage serum by Cantabria Labs, but I've also used Bioderma's serum and it's also very good. Here's a special tip that helped me a lot. \n\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................\n\nWhen your skin is really bad, apply a little moisturizer to the areas where your skin is very red and then apply saline solution. This will cool and super moisturize your skin. Instead of this, you can also apply a little serum as it is also super moisturizing, but for me what gives the best results is the moisturizing cream and saline solution. Most of the time, to make this mixture between moisturizer and saline solution, I also use CeraVe moisturizing lotion for face and body because it comes in a big bottle and is therefore much cheaper than using Bioderma's anti-redness facial cream (I usually only use this one at night).\n\nBy the way, saline solution is great for refreshing the skin (put it in the fridge to keep it cooler) and it is cheap, so you can use it even without moisturizer. It is better to apply saline solution than to wash your face too often with running water.",

    "body": "As per another [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/4pvq9n/review_my_extremely_bad_dandruff_went_away_after/), I decided to get a tube of the Lotrimin Ultra cream for myself to try. It's been a week since first applying it, here are the results so far.\n      \n\nFor starters, I never had skin problems as a teen, or through the first half of my 20s, but then one day I had bad dandruff and severe scaling on my scalp. My ex used to go through my hair, picking off the yellowish scales and it just kept progressing. My hair is extremely thick, which only helps harbor the moisture and bacteria.\n\nThe issue comes and goes in waves, which provides moments of extreme confidence and general well being, and then periods of absolute fear and anxiety, physical pain and piss poor self esteem. It is hard to make eye contact, or even face people. \n\nI've tried the classic OTC medications ie. coal tar, salicylic acid, zinc pyrithione, and prescription Ketoconazole 2%. Some of these work for a day or two, and then my head and face return to the unbearably itchy and burning red pile of shit that they are.\n\nSo, here are some photos of the progress using Lotrimin Ultra (Butenafine hydrochloride 1% - you can find this in Lamisil, too.)\n\n*To be fair, the redness/scaliness on my face was already at a tame level. It was not a shameful no eye contact kind of week, so the before photos don't make my problem seem as bad as it can and has been.*\n\n* Day 1. Red nose, red, scaly eyebrow, scaly hairline, and severe dandruff.\n\n     [Dandruff](http://i.imgur.com/eVuhB2l.jpg)\n     [Redness](http://i.imgur.com/PQ8or3d.jpg)\n     [Chin](http://i.imgur.com/KueWiU1.jpg)\n     [Sideburns](http://i.imgur.com/Zd31VCx.jpg)\n     [Red Scalp](http://i.imgur.com/FCBvDkG.jpg)\n     [Scaly Hairline](http://i.imgur.com/ji2O50f.jpg)\n\n\n\n* Day 2. Already showing signs of improvement. Photos usually taken post shower, so the redness goes down even more than it shows here.\n\n     [Sideburns](http://i.imgur.com/kcz9pP7.jpg)\n     [Other Side](http://i.imgur.com/obLBkME.jpg)\n     [Nose](http://i.imgur.com/4GiOifh.jpg)\n     [Chin](http://i.imgur.com/ahwclFa.jpg)\n\n* Day 3/4. The scaling on my eyebrow came back. Starting to lose hope..that this is a fluke. But my face *does* look better, overall.\n     \n     [Eyebrow](http://i.imgur.com/TlTpqdM.jpg)\n     [Nose](http://i.imgur.com/27Jvgrk.jpg)\n     [Sideburn](http://i.imgur.com/Tx6ceDT.jpg)\n     [Other Side](http://i.imgur.com/ncMoGgT.jpg)     \n\n* Today. Looks and feels better. The tingling and itching has subsided, and dandruff is nearly gone, but it still snows when I take my motorcycle helmet off!\n\n     [Sideburn](http://i.imgur.com/Xw1SplY.jpg)\n     [Nose/Eyebrow](http://i.imgur.com/sK5Hv6b.jpg)\n\n\n\nI have also been taking once daily a mix of [black walnut, wormwood oil, and garlic](http://i.imgur.com/Gna81wg.jpg). The psyllium husk is hard to deal with, so any suggestions on how to ingest that stuff, let me know. I've found these to be common natural remedies using other forums, and they all help with digestive health, and rid the body of bacteria. Stay hydrated, drink a lot of water!! It's so easy to forget, but set alarms, write it down on all of your stuff/places, and keep reminding yourself that it is probabaly the most beneficial thing we can do for our skin. \n\n\nI use the ph booster, alkalyzer and liquid chlorophyll based on the results of a guy on youtube who documented his transformation. (he was pretty much entirely red, and cleared it up using those 3 things in water with lime/lemon)",

I've been spending the last few days reading rosacea forums about Butenafine HCL (lotrimin ultra's active ingredient), and there seems to be a general consensus that around the first week mark the results taper off and remission begins. From all that I've read there have only been two people so far to completely cure their SD and both those people used Lotrimin Ultra for about a week, got to 90% clearance then used steroid desonide cream (this is very important) for about a week and viola, it's been 5 years now and their SD hasn't returned. The original thread is [here](https://rosaceagroup.org/The_Rosacea_Forum/showthread.php?21593-How-I-am-controlling-my-Seborrheic-Dermatitis-so-far). A few others have tried using lotrimin ultra, but it seems like they fail eventually without the addition of the steriod cream, so do please keep us updated because you're right around the mark where regression starts happening (HOPEFULLY NOT, though). \n&nbsp;\n\nAnd just in case you're interrested, the effects of Butenafine against the yeast responsible for SD (Malassezia furfur) has been researched (though not extensively). In one [study](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09546630050517450#/doi/abs/10.1080/09546630050517450), M. furfur was almost completely surpressed by week one, and by week two virtually absent in every subject. \n&nbsp;\n\nI'm currently also trying Lotrimin Ultra, but for Malassezia Folliculitis not SD (it's also caused by M. furfur though). I'm on day 4, and so far so good. Anyway, keep us updated!!",

Ketoconazole hasn't cleared the dark splotches on my neck and jawline and dry patches around my mouth and between my eyebrows.

I googled can I put butenafine on my scalp, and I read that it could lighten my hair and face so I used clotrimazole instead.

(Will last awhile, as you don't use much of the shampoos as a little bit after a pre wash will lavour up a lot. \n\nHead and shoulders standard shampoo,\nKetoscalp ketoconazole and zinc pyrithione shampoo,\nSelsun selenium sulfide shampoo,\nAveeno conditioner oat milk blend (fungal safe)\n\nPre wash you hair using head and shoulders, rinse then apply either ketoscalp or selsun (all over scalp and hair) leave for 5 minutes and rinse, then use Aveeno conditioner and leave on for 2-3 minutes (only the ends) rinse and your done! \n\nWhen rinsing after the anti fungal always use fresh water! Don't use the bath water, if you use a shower it doesn't matter lol.\n\nBathing every two days you will alternate between selsun and ketoscalp. \n\nBy following this I find you will nuke the fungus by three different anti fungals properties (zinc, selenium and ketoconazole), alternating them every wash not allowing the fungus to build a resistance to either one. Use them every wash until the first month or two is up (two better)  then starting using them every other wash (washing just using head and shoulders and conditioner)\n\nYou want to use it every wash at the start to nuke/speed up the recovery process.\n\nThe reason you pre wash is because it rids most  of the oils allowing the anti fungal shampoos to lavour up much easier. \n\nMake sure to dry your hair (hair dryer) and not allow it to sit wet for extended periods \n\nAlways make sure to lavour your scalp AND all your hair. On the bottle it says to only use it on your scalp. But using it on all your hair kills all the fungus. ( I have used it like this and experienced no hair damage or dryness ) If yours does just use the conditioner once every so often on all your hair to replenish it. \n\nKeep this routine up and after 4 months or so I tried using normal washes and using the anti fungals now only every week or two. Since starting this treatment I haven't had a recurrence for 6 months! \n\nRemember to use this with other things like changing pillow case every few days (at the start I used old t shirts as pillow cases and changed it everyday) \n\nI also tried cutting out dairy and gluten as much as possible for a month at the beginning (I may have helped as dairy is bad for Seb Derm) Gluten could also be a issue causing it to come back often. (You don't have to do these) I believe the routine I have written will help regardless. \n\nI have had no symptoms since after the first month and I hope won't see it return again. (With regular maintenance) I believe it has got rid of it altogether ! But we shall see. I used to get it every other week so. Going well!! \n\n\nI hope you all do well and have patience and love for yourself when dealing with hard times, especially with Seb Derm! \n\n",

About 2 months ago, when I first suspected it was fungal, I tried basically everything. I got nizoral, selsun gold, zinc pyrithione soap bar and fluconazole tablets.\n\nEverything helped, only not sure about fluconazole because no way to measure that. I was taking 300mg every week for the last 5 weeks now I think. But the issue was that sometimes my skin would look okay and sometimes horrible. \n\nWhat made the most improvement was a post I read on reddit that mentioned just leaving nizoral overnight. Previously I was leaving everything on for about 5-10 mins or so. So I tried leaving nizoral on my face for about 2 hours and the rest of my body for 5-6 hours or so. Sorry forgot to mention I also have stubborn tinea over many parts of my body. \n\nAt first I regretted it because my face became very red and some parts of my face experienced severe peeling. I thought I wrecked my skin barrier but putting on moisturizer did not sting, so I soldiered on and continue doing the same thing over the next 2 days. Yesterday I gently rubbed the peeling skin off and already noticed a dramatic improvement. Today it's day 3 and my skin is 95% clear. I don't know what to say, I've been dealing with this for so long. Hope this helps someone",

    "body": "Hey everyone, I am a *21yo female (South Asian-American)* and I started the AIP (Autoimmune Protocol) Diet today (after a 24-hour fast) for the purpose of healing my scalp SD, and I'm determined to stick to the elimination phase of the diet for AT LEAST 3 months so I can get rid of all (or most) of my scalp SD. I've had SD on my scalp & consequent increased hair fall for around 5 years (ever since puberty, so prob due to hormones, but I also have been a chronically-stressed child \\[LOL\\] which could have harmed my gut, which definitely could have contributed to the SD).\n\nI've benefited (partially) from topical treatments like **medicated shampoos** (e.g. Selenium sulfide, 2% ketoconazole, Happy Cappy 1% zinc pyrithione) daily, **MCT oil** (this really DOES work, *wow*, but it clogs my hair follicles and makes me lose more hair, so I use it only during bad flare-ups - It would probably be perfect for facial SD...), the **keto diet** (slightly reduced SD but not as significant as I would like. Although, I would def recommend trying it as a lot of people had success with it), and letting a **sea salt spray** sit on my scalp for 15 mins before rinsing it out -- However, both ended up drying my scalp out too much & causing more hair fall. Unfortunately, I lost more than half of my thick, curly black hair during that period of time. :(\n\nAs I also have mild anxiety/depression (to alleviate this I take 400mg Mg Glycinate, B1, B12, fish oil, L-theanine powder \\[for anxiety\\], sleeping well, intermittent fasting (16:8), eating a Mediterranean diet, exercising daily, and taking cold showers in the mornings), I figured I must have **leaky gut**/gut health issues that could be contributing to the SD. After all, *SD is an autoimmune condition* which means it ultimately results from a disturbance in the gut from what I'm learning. (I will be getting a GI map done soon, but I think the AIP diet is the way to go to identify those food-based triggers to my SD. The way I know it's food that's affecting my SD is bc when I eat dairy, gluten, and added sugars, my hair falls out a LOT more- 200ish per day, vs. 70-80 per day.)\n\nI'm hoping to bring my hair fall count from 80/day to a much lower number - Then I can start to grow my hair back (A very slow process).\n\n**It'll be a difficult feat, but I wholeheartedly believe I can do it. And if I can, you can.** But that's for later :)\n\nI will keep you guys updated on any symptom reduction I experience as I stick to this diet over the next few months. Feel free to let me know if you have any advice or have questions for me about anything SD or gut health-related!\n\nMy credentials: A pharmacy student and SD warrior who's done a lot of research & experimenting :)\n\n**TLDR: Starting AIP Diet for scalp SD, will update if any changes over next few months**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit:** It has been an incredibly long journey and I have made many discoveries over the past few months. First of all, starting the AIP Diet (including cassava/meat/organs/bone broth) caused the following: Diarrhea, fatigue, toxin build-up, egg odor in stools, anxiety -- All with no change in SD or hair fall. I continued  the elimination period for 2 months to see if things would get better, but they only got worse. I  thought, *hey, AIP isn't working, maybe it's time I try reintroducing foods, what do I have to lose*. So one day, I tried an almond, and instantly experienced stomach/intestinal gurgling, slight dizziness, and muscle weakness in various areas throughout my body. *Oh, I must have an almond sensitivity*, I thought. I then tried a walnut- Even worse reaction to that. I went back to strict AIP for a few days, then tried a whole bowl of quinoa at a restaurant (it used to be one of my staples a year ago), and had some increased SD instantly (oil oozed out of my scalp, instant hair fall), some anxiety/low mood, and general joint pain/muscle weakness. *Odd*. I thought, *enough is enough, I'm going to see a naturopath and get help ASAP*, because clearly I need it...\n\n\\--> Fast forward 2 months and I am seeing a functional medicine doctor to figure out the underlying cause of my gut issues. Over the past 2 months (after trying the quinoa & having that reaction), I started having a mix of diarrhea & constipation, odor in stools, weight loss (lost 15 pounds from January-May 2022), fatigue, malabsorption (iron deficiency despite iron-rich diet), and worsened food intolerances (histamine & oxalate intolerance). I can now only eat a VERY LOW histamine/oxalate diet of fresh meat (full cuts of beef, lamb, chicken, shrimp, organs) & some low FODMAP veggies (zucchini, squash). My SIBO Breath Test results were negative for Hydrogen & Methane SIBO, and I'm currently waiting for my GI MAP test results (checks for gut dysbiosis, SIBO, parasites, etc. aka ANYTHING that could be causing my leaky gut). If the GI MAP comes out negative and there is no bacteria or anything causing the leaky gut, I assume it will just be a matter of healing my leaky gut. The histamine intolerance is caused by the fact that my DAO (an enzyme on the gut lining that breaks down histamines in food) levels are so low so my body isn't able to tolerate additional histamine-containing foods. Taking a DAO supplement before meals higher in histamine if ever has been helping. But guys, ultimately, the cause for my HAIR LOSS is the SEB DERM, and the SEB DERM is caused by the histamine intolerance. I have finally figured it out. And the histamine intolerance is caused by the fact that my gut is damaged, and the reason for THAT is what I'm going to figure out using the GI MAP test. The reason I realized it's the histamine intolerance is that when I'm having those histamine reactions, I lose a bunch more hair and I can feel my scalp flaking much more and my scalp oozes with oil. It's not the shampoos, it's not the MCT oil, nothing. Sure, those things will help with the SYMPTOMS of the seb derm. But to get to the end of this problem, to get rid of the seb derm once and for all, you must figure out what the internal problem is. When I take supplements like Quercetin that help stabilize my mast cells and reduce that histamine reaction (a histamine reaction happening at a very small, unnoticeable level with no outright symptoms could still cause seb derm, so addressing your gut issues is crucial), my scalp calms down completely and I shed like a normal person.\n\n**TLDR**: Figure out what is going on in your gut and heal your gut to heal your seb derm!\n\n:) Get a GI MAP test/SIBO Breath test/other relevant testing done through a functional medicine doctor (only costs a few hundred, which seems like a lot but I promise it's better than spending even more $ on treating the symptoms only to probably have the seb derm pop up again lol). My plan moving forward is to stick to a non-dairy carnivore diet (Thousands have cured ALL of their health issues by going with this ancestral way of eating. See the YouTube channels of Paul Saladino/CarnivoreMD, Steak and Butter Gal, etc. for more on this highly nutritious way of eating). I've been on a beef, salt, and water diet for the past two weeks and I already feel so much more energetic, my depression/anxiety has lifted loads, and I am sure that if I use this as one method to heal my gut, in a few months to a year or so, I will be free of all my health problems including seb derm. I've also been taking goat colostrum powder to help heal my leaky gut, but I need to see if there is an underlying cause for the leaky gut. And with all the nutrients in red meat/organs, I will easily be able to grow back all the hair I lost. I believe that wholeheartedly. Good luck, everyone! I will keep you updated about my GI MAP results and how I am going to proceed with my treatment if anything comes up on it.",

I don't know if this can help you and everyone is different but if your sd is linked to your diet it could well be the same cause as me: candidiasis (abnormal/massive growth of yeast in the intestines which  turn into mushrooms).  Otherwise I have SD in the scalp and face and I manage to manage my hair (I was losing it massively and now I no longer lose my hair and dandruff is rare).  What I do is first wash my hair with a very mild shampoo (dercos dermatological anti-itch shampoo for normal to oily hair) and then I coat my entire scalp with a lotion that I prepare (take a  one liter bottle of mineral or spring water, remove a quarter of it and put unpasteurized apple cider vinegar and then add 5 drops of tee trea, 8 of palmarosa + 8 of rose geranium) leave everything on for 30 minutes  then rinse and voila the scalp could no longer and the scalp becomes healthier again.  For my face unfortunately I can't yet master it as well as I would like but TCM oil works wonders as you say so well!",

Unfortunately, I had a comprehensive stool test done, which showed nothing...not even dysbiosis...but a previous stool test from my conventional gp just a month earlier noted that I had \"many yeasts present.\" From my readings, it seems that many with seb derm really do have an overgrowth of Candida. Even though malassezia and candida are two different yeasts, it seems that there is some immune cross-reactivity there. \n\nI also have noticed the relationship between histamine and hair loss. It is directly linked for me. I am taking it a step further and am wondering if this condition is a symptom of mast cell activation for some. It gets really, really complicated, but like you said, the goal is to find out what the root problem is. Are you having any luck?\n\nAlso, do you know if you have a hormonal imbalance?",

    "body": "Dear reddit, I wanted to say thank you for the advice that this subreddit has given me by giving an overview on the approach, cheap easily accessible products and solutions I found worked for me after struggling with sebderm for 8 years. I thought this would also be extra helpful for Europeans and people in Germany in particular since a lot of the guides and products are based in the US, but less guides exists in the EU context.\n\nSo I've now been free of seb derm issues for the last 8 months after having struggled with it since teenage years. I would start out with saying that for me personally, and from what ive read, the biggest culprit to my condition was eating too much quick carbs, mostly sugar - which triggered the Seb Derm more than any other factor. However, nobody really likes to hear that they have to give up eating sweets forever, and neither did I. So, I can now safely say that I have been able to find an approach that allows me to eat the occasional sweets and be a bit lazy with my diet without having to worry about seb derm attacks. So, this is my routine:\n\nFor checking ingredients in products that feed the malassezia, check: folliculitisscout, it is more updated than sezia.\n\nFor Hair:\n\n1. Use one 'normal' schampoo that you can use regularly, that is gentle but that also does not have any ingredients that feed the malassezia. I currently use:\n\nAlkmene My Tea Tree Oil Anti Dandruff Shampoo (6 euros at Kaufland)\n\nAveda rosemary mint shampoo (8 euros amazon)\n\n2. ROTATE between different Seb Derm active ingredients schampoos whenever you start feeling the beginnings of an outbreak, or whenever you feel just a hinch of an sebderm itch. It is very important to alternate between the different products like zinc pyrithione, salicilyc acid, Ketoconazole, ciclopirox, selenium sulfide etc... for your SD to avoid resistance building up. At the same time, since these chemical ingredients are not fantastic for your hair in general, you want to avoid using them too regularly since it will dry your hair out most likely. I use three different products and rotate them:\n\nSelsun Blue Naturals Dandruff Shampoo Moisturising (Selenium sulfide) (24 euros amazon 325ml)\n\nKETOconazol Klinge (ketoconazole) (8-15 euros apotheke)\n\nStieprox Intensive Shampoo (ciclopirox) (11 euros amazon 100ml)\n\n3. Conditioner: in case you wanna use a conditioner: I found only two conditioners available in germany without ingredients feeding malassezia:\n\nPantene Pro-V, Repair & Care Pflegespülung (5 euros rossmann)\n\nBasler Tea Tree Oil Conditioner Bottle 200 ml (7 euros amazon)\n\n4. Styling, ideally you wanna avoid styling products if possible, but if you are like me and you are a curly freak and self conscious without some hair styling then I can recommend:\n\ngot2be Schaumfestiger Lockmittel Locken Mousse (5 euros rossmann) - does not have any active ingredients feeding the malassezia.\n\nFor facial skin:\n\nSkin routine (face): I reccomend using one cleanser, and then a moisturizer and potentially some beneficial serums but this is not necessary. These cerave products that i use are free from malassezia feeding ingredients:\n\nCeraVe Moisturising Hydrating Facial Cleanser (15 euros amazon 240 ml)\n\nCerave - Moisturizer for dry to very dry skin (11 euros 180 ml amazon) (theres also the morning version of this that has an SPF too)\n\nFor other pure suncreens, this one is SD safe:\n\nsunozon Classic Sonnenmilch LSF 50 (rossmann 3 euros)\n\nFoods and supplements:\n\nIn terms of foods i found that eating lots of probiotics, helps greatly (plus generally very good for you!). Stuff like: greek fat yoghurt, kimchi, tempeh, miso, sauerkraut, oats, cottage cheese, olives etc. Otherwise general healthy diet improves your Seb Derm drastically (reduce sugar and quick carbs)\n\nIt might be beneficial to take some extra supplements if you are like me sometimes a bit bad with your diet. I dont take these super regularly, just ocassionally when I feel like I have been a bit lazy or when I noticed that my diet was missing out on something - or after excessive berlin partying :D or festivals.\n\nD3, k2, magnesium, fish oil, B12, ocassional zink.\n\nAnd at last, change your pillow cases regularly! This in order to avoid seb derm flakes that might stick to your pillow to reinfect your hair again.\n\nThat is it! Feel free to add products available in Germany that fits this bill, always happy for more suggestions, especially cheaper ones too.\n\nHave a nice day and fuck sebderm",

It started out just on my nose so I didn't think it was a big deal, but over the years it has progressively gotten worse (spreading to my chin, side burns, ears, hairline and scalp). I've gone to a number of dermatologists who have prescribed all kinds of creams and ointments but none of them seemed to do anything. In my own experience, I've found that hydrocortisone cream and zinc pyrithione work, however not for very long, plus the zinc pyrithione really dried my skin out. I've also gone to a number of gastroenterologist's and finally found one recently that helped me out with my IBD, however not for long. She prescribed something called Budesonide (a steroid) which not only fixed my IBD immediately, but also cleared my Seb Derm right up! I was so happy until about 3 weeks into taking it I started to break out into horrible cystic acne, due to the steroid making my skin super oily. I came to the conclusion that I hated cystic acne more that my IBD and Seb Derm, so I stopped taking the steroid. Now my Seb Derm and IBD are worse than ever and was wondering if anyone in here who also has IBD has any advice on how I can fix this. I'm now convinced that if I can solve my IBD, my Seb Derm will follow suit. Thanks!",

This is primarily a financial motivation, but I’m also interested in more powerful treatment of hyperpigmentation. My Curology formula doesn’t quite keep up with hormonal breakouts, so spots are constant.\n\n**Skin Type:** Oily, Fitzpatrick 3-4, prone to hyperpigmentation\n\n# Routine [\\[Review\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/am5w8h/review_simple_and_mostly_affordable_routine_review/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\n|AM|Cleanse w/ water|Stratia C+C Serum|CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion|Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|PM|CeraVe Foaming|CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion|Wait until dry|Curology or Differin|\n\nMy Curology formula was 8% azelaic acid / 1% clindamycin / 0.25% zinc pyrithione. This was essential in getting my constant breakouts *under control*, and I recommend trying it if you’ve struggled with moderate acne. However, I was interested in removing the antibiotic, and wanted something gentler than tretinoin. (It’s also expensive!)\n\n# The Approach\n\nI started by applying Differin on an every-third-night schedule with Curology on the off days. So it looked like:\n\n|Sun|Mon|Tues|Wed|Thurs|Fri|Sat|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Differin|Curology|Differin|Curology|Differin|Curology|Differin|\n\nand so on. I intentionally began buffering both medications with moisturizer to reduce potential irritation from Differin. I chose this approach based on the experiences of others on the sub, and I think it’s important to note that I did wait until my face felt “dry,” or as though the moisturizer had sunken in, and there was no excess water still left on my skin. I maintained this schedule for 3 weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Weeks 1-3** Following this slow, buffered schedule, I experienced virtually no irritation. I did notice more acne; it tended to appear along my chin/jaw and hairline. Jawline acne is common for me anyway (and likely triggered by life stress), so I wasn’t alarmed. Acne near my brows could also be ingrown hairs. I didn’t attempt to spot treat these. I felt very very slight dryness on my cheeks—just a rougher texture. I also experienced some itchiness that comes with dry skin. I like to exfoliate with a little silicone scrubby from time to time, and I noticed my skin can’t handle it for as long right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Weeks 4-11.5** At this point I upped the Differin frequency to every other day. I did experience more dryness, so I increased how much moisturizer I use. (As an oily-skinned person, I never thought I’d look forward to putting lotion all over my face, lol.) I still broke out, but only slightly. These pimples also didn’t get super inflamed and angry—they mostly sat beneath my skin and behaved themselves (!). I speculate that the anti-inflammatories in my Curology formula worked in tandem with the speedy cell turnover. I perceived somewhat smoother skin texture at this point. I adopted the use of a facial scrub a couple times a week to help clear the flakes. Curology finally ran out at the 11.5-week mark! My 0.5oz tube of Differin also about ran out at this time (!).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Weeks 11.5-20** I increased the Differin frequency to once daily. The real test! My vitamin C serum ran out around shortly before this, so my morning routine became even shorter.\n\n|AM|Cleanse w/ water|Stratia C+C Serum|CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion||\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|PM|CeraVe Foaming|CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion|Wait until dry|Differin|\n\n\\+ Facial scrub 1x a week.\n\nToward the end of this stretch, I experienced some pretty persistent breakouts, but I chalk this up to some intense stress in my personal life. I did notice that the acne I had was more inflamed than it was when I used Curology.\n\n# Overall Thoughts\n\nI think the transition was a success. I ultimately achieved the goal of switching to a cheaper medication to manage my acne, however I did not seem to overcome breakouts that lead to PIH. Since my acne tends to be hormonal in nature, this isn’t completely unexpected. I suspect that if I want to outrun PIH, I’ll need to incorporate another treatment specifically for that (e.g. hydroquinone). While I enjoyed the Stratia vitamin C serum, I didn’t notice a difference in the speed at which PIH faded.\n\nGoing forward, I’m planning to experiment with cream cleansers to see if they play more nicely with my sensitized skin, as well as higher-quality moisturizers. Once this tube of Differin runs out, I might drop it altogether and see what happens.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nTL;DR: I swapped from Curology to Differin and didn’t experience a difference in acne appearance, just less of a hit for my wallet.",

It worked wonders on my skin especially on my PIH and controlling breakouts that was concentrated on my cheeks after 4-5 months. \n\nNow the havoc of cystic acne has migrated to my forehead with fungal acne this time (after some wrong choices in introducing new products that I now know cause FA) and I've yet to see if Curology is still doing its job. I thought of trying to transition to Differin though because I might get a better deal with it, and might work better for my new forehead babies. \n\nIt's good to know the transition worked well for you! Save for the PIH. I've yet to see which ingredients work the best for PIH other than tretinoin + exfoliants, like vit C, snail mucin, tea tree oil, niacinamide, etc.",

There are little scalp focused products (although there are more lately in the form of scalp acids).\n\nThis line also has a shampoo but the treatment/conditioner is what I would really like to discuss. What's different, from just a glance, is that it's more \"dermatologically\" proven. It claims that the ingredients used are \"certified by Korean ministry of food and drug safety\" and it is also \"certified as low irritation through a rigorous skin patch test by Korean dermatology research institute.\"\n\nThis product REALLY caught my eye because I am constantly looking for more scalp-care products. It is my understanding that conditioner shouldn't touch the scalp, (especially if you are acne prone). I have a sensitive scalp prone to inflammation which is why I am very interested in scalp care. If this product is everything the marketing for it claims then this might just be a holy grail for scalp-focused skin-carers.\n\nPY's approach is interesting because most conditioner seem to be formulated as a hair conditioner first and skin conditioner second. In my experience, products formulated like this tends to leave an irritating residue as the consideration for the scalp is secondary.

    "body": "Hey all, \n\nIve struggled with dandruff all my life, and recently (last 5 years) with seb derm. I wanted to share some of the information I learned in an immunology class at Stanford that really helped my understanding of whats going on. This is a moderate amount of science and maybe without a background on it, it might be difficult to follow. Though, if you have questions please leave a comment. Im going to wrap the science into a conclusion that supports the hypothesis that mushroom consumption can greatly impact your skin conditions.\n\n\nIts important to mention that Malassezia microbes vary in their pathogenicity based on which type and where. For most people these organisms are commensal (This genus of microbes/fungi accounts for over 90% of the organisms on your skin).\n\nThough, in some people(3-5%) of the population, these microbes are pathogenic. This is especially true for immunocompromised people. So, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, HIV/AIDs, stroke and TBI survivors... (to name a few common ones)\n\nAs lipophilic microbes, they’re going to cluster in your sebaceous glands. Though, this is not the interesting part. Typically, fungi have incredible means to evade the immune system and produce superficial and systemic infections. This may explain why your seb derm literally never goes away. \n\n Malassezia produces a biofilm through cell surface hydrophobicity and precludes the yeast cell from being phagocytosed. This is a complicated battle between your immune system and the bacterias that live on you. A neurotypical human with a fully functioning immune system is usually capable of defending the integument and this conversation is of no concern. \n\n(This next part is extremely trunchated) \nThe immune system deals with microbial overgrowth with direct cellular contact (nk cells/macrophages/etc) where these cells display dectin 2/mincle proteins as well as other members of the c-lectin family. These proteins are associated with lymphocyte activity and induce the adaptive immune system. \n\nConsequently, our immune system interacts with these pathogens through indirect cellular contact as well (cytokines/interleukins)\n\nInterleukins, stimulate the proliferation of T cells and lymphokine activated killer cells. Some closely associated Interleukins (IL1,2,4,13,14,15,33) Essentially these signaling molecules regulate the inflammatory response and recruit the immune cells that are responsible for maintaining the integrity of your skin and fighting pathogens.\n\nFor someone with a compromised immune system, this becomes the central issue in treatment and why seb derm is often recalcitrant. \n\nWhen I first saw a doctor for this, it was because a barber told me that I have ringworm, in reality it was my first real flare up of seb derm after a serious head injury. The doctor told me to put head and shoulders on on my face. Nice. \n\nFor someone with standard dandruff which is essentially just standard cell sloughing and can be easily maintained with specific proper hygiene. \n\nSEB DERM IS NOT SUPERFICIAL. This is a result of a dysfunctional immune system. Constant use of head and shoulders drys the fuck out of your hair but doesn’t really treat the seb derm. Though, the topical approach is immensely helpful for mitigation and control of symptoms. It really isnt addressing the problem. A combined approach is better.\n\nIf your seb derm is not responding well to shampoo on your face, and you are here looking for answers. There isnt an easy one. Though, whats worked for me, I think is universally applicable and beneficial. Ive also not met any doctors or read any posts that talk about the true role of diet in seb derm. I dont mean just cutting out dairy and processed fats.\n\nDisclaimer, if you are taking warfarin or other immunosuppressants. You should speak with your doctor first. Also, Im not a doctor. So, do your research and come to your own decisions. The advice I have here is advice that I made for myself and what has significantly helped to treat my own persistent AD.\n\nBut, mushrooms yo. Mushrooms are the single greatest food you can eat to support your immune system because of their role as adaptogens. There have been an incredible amount of studies done on mushrooms and their role in regulating various atopic dermatitis conditions. One reason for this is that they regulate helper T cells. \n\nIf you have neurological dysfunction, you can probably bet that there is a component of dysfunctional T cell activation. \n\nHere are a few of the many types of mushrooms that help\n\nReishi supplements (reishi tastes fucking inedible so typically its sold as an extract) provide benefits to T cell activation, mitigate itching, reduction of excoriations and lichenification on the skin.\n\nRieshi mushrooms also stimulate the mTOR pathway that is the primary regulator of cell survival and growth. They did a study on rats with cancer and the rats that were treated with reishi had ~50% reduction in tumor size\n\nTree oyster mushrooms stimulate Interferon Gamma, and INF‐γ is the primary activator of macrophages but also stimulates NK cell and neutrophils. \n\nLions mane mushroom it fosters the production of the bioprotein nerve growth factor and the myelination on axons. The NGF is one of the major molecules that regulates cholinergic receptors that are responsible for Alzheimer’s disease when they degrade\n\nWhite button mushrooms bind to monocytes that would normally bind to molecules in our arteries causing elevated triglyceride/glucose  levels in the blood leading to diabetes. \n\nAlso, mushrooms contain ergothioneine, a compound that contains sulfur.\n\n“In addition to keratolytic activity, sulfur has mild antifungal and antibacterial activity. However, its precise mechanism of action is unknown. When applied to skin, sulfur is thought to interact with cysteine, present in the stratum corneum, to form hydrogen sulfide (2). Hydrogen sulfide can break down keratin, thus demonstrating sulfur's keratolytic activity. Pentathionic acid, which is toxic to fungi, is also formed by cutaneous bacteria as well as keratinocytes from topically applied sulfur (2). In addition, the keratolytic effects may promote fungal shedding from the stratum corneum (1). Sulfur has an inhibitory effect on the growth of Propionibacterium acnes as well as Sarcoptes scabiei, some Streptococci, and Staphylococcus aureus (3-5). This suggested antibacterial activity purportedly results from the inactivation of sulfhydryl groups contained in bacterial enzyme systems (5). Although data is sparse, sulfur may have an effect on Demodex mites”\n\n\nLiterally the list goes on. Id recommend googling a list of mushrooms, and then googling that mushroom + dermatitis, or mushrooms + cancer, or mushrooms + immune system. Then mix in a variety of these mushrooms into your diet daily\n\nAlso, some other things more effective than head and shoulders (selenium sulfide,  Zinc pyrithione/ salicylic acid) is sulfur. Sulfur shampoos are fucking magical for symptom relief and as well. \n\ntheres a brand called psoriasin that makes awesome stuff and their sulfur skin ointment keeps my face under control. Though, take a look at your diet and all of the other factors that boost your immune system. Get those T cells up, and get your life back",

I’ve had acne ever since I hit puberty, I’ve used endless creams and treatments and no matter what I probably only have 5 days with acne free skin per year. I decided enough was enough and consulted with apostrophe early November 2021. I was prescribed a bottle of 0.025% tret with 15% azelaic acid for PM and also a bottle of  5% topical spironolactone with 1% clindamycin for AM. I use the tret 1-2x a week and the spiro/clindamycin every morning. Besides that I only use vanicream cleanser and malezia moisturizer and Elta md sunscreen. Basically up until the 6th week I’ve been purging badly. Last week I was annoyed with how red my nose creases always are(even before starting tret) and looked up why that could be. I read that it could possibly be fixed with zinc pyrithione and I had an old bar of that soap laying around from one of my countless purchases to fix my acne. Well low and behold, this time around it actually helped my skin! My purge ended literally the next day and continues to improve with the soap and my apostrophe prescription. Everyday I wake up and touch my skin and I can’t believe it’s getting smoother and clearer. Has anyone else tried this soap in addition to using tretinoin?",

No stores were open that late, but some rummaging through my bathroom cabinet turned up my son's can of Lotrimin AF athelete's foot powder spray.\n\nI sprayed a bit on my fingertip, and rubbed the powder on the patches of seb derm on my cheeks.\n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, I could hardly believe what I saw in the mirror - for the first time in years, my skin looked clear. The redness was completely gone, and all that was left of the seb derm was some residual flaky skin. The next day, even that was gone, and my skin looked totally normal.\n\nThis carried on for some time. Whenever I got the telltale itch or noticed a little red bump, I would apply a dab of the Lotrimin powder with my fingertip, and it would disappear in a few hours. I would only need to use a tiny amount, because the condition would never get a chance to spread as long as I caught it early.\n\nAfter some time, my can of Lotrimin ran out, so I bought the store brand. This seemed to work ok, but the nozzle would get clogged with powder, so I would often only get to use half a can before I had to throw it away.\n\nI did a bit of research. I discovered that I could buy powder with the same Miconazole Nitrate active ingredient, but just loose rather than in an aerosol. It was a much better value than the spray, so I bought that instead.\n\nUnfortunately, as is often the case with seb derm, my strategy stopped working so well.\n\nI then discovered that Miconazole Nitrate could also be had in the form of a cream. I thought this might be a more convenient delivery method, plus I wouldn't have to have white powder on my face so I could apply it any time of the day.\n\nAgain, I saw a drop in effectiveness, but again I attributed this to seb derm's notorious habit of stopping responding to established treatments.\n\nWhat followed was a months-long trial of just about every antifungal cream available. None really worked, and they just tended to aggravate the inflamed skin. I had noticed this even when I used plain moisturizing creams when I had mistakenly believed I had eczema.\n\nI went back to Miconazole Nitrate cream, and just tried to keep on top of washing my scalp and face with Head & Shoulders (zinc pyrithione) every day, and then applying the cream. I did this at night, because the resulting redness would seem to calm down a bit while I slept.\n\nIt never fully worked though. It took care of the worst of the flakiness, but I always had red patches on my cheeks and near my eyebrows.\n\nLast week, I had an epiphany of sorts. I went out and bought a can of Lotrimin AF powder spray; the original product I tried.\n\nI didn't see why it would work when other Miconazole Nitrate products had gradually become less and less effective, but I was getting desperate, so I decided to go back to basics.\n\nI put some on that night, and holy shit, I woke up the next morning to a completely normal face, just like when I first used it years ago! It has been a week now, and it's still fine.\n\nThe Miconazole Nitrate hadn't become less effective over time after all - the problem was that I had been buying it in less and less effective forms.\n\nJust to be clear, this is not a case of  tachyphylaxis; I have been using Miconazole Nitrate (in cream form) daily for at least two years. The only difference is that I switched from a cream to an aerosol powder.\n\nI have no idea why this one particular Miconazole Nitrate product works where others have failed, but I have some theories:\n\nI think the loose (non aerosol) powder might have been less effective because it was noticeably coarser than the aerosol stuff. Perhaps didn't cling to the skin so well. Certainly, the aerosol spray powder seems to become ingrained in the skin, and is difficult to remove except by washing it off.\n\nI think the cream didn't work well because the cream base itself aggravates the condition. Even non-medicated creams and ointments such as aqueous cream, Aquaphor, E45 etc would inflame the affected skin, sometimes making it instantly flare up.\n\nI guess the cream contained the right active ingredient, but this was offset by effect of the cream itself.\n\nAnyway, I sincerely hope this helps someone else. Maybe you are using the right antifungal, but in the wrong format. Maybe Lotrimin AF powder spray will work for you like it does for me.",

I think it was because I didn’t rinse my hair out properly after washing it, cuz I was running late for work. \n\nWhat makes me think it’s a yeast/fungus is that it used to smell only when it was wet, but now it smells 24/7 no matter what I do, I’m afraid I’ve breeded some sort of super fungus on my hair?? Because I’ve tried many things but the stink never goes away, like it smells as soon as I wash it. \n\nI shampoo every other day, shampooing twice each time. I’ve tried zinc pyrithione shampoo, tea tree shampoo, nizoral shampoo, glycolic acid on the scalp as a pre shampoo treatment, diluted vinegar rinse both before and after shampooing, boric acid solution… and I always blow dry my hair after washing it, I never let it sit wet. \n\nAnd still, immediately after blow drying it, that smell is still there, and it’s very much noticeable to others, like the smell could fill a small room honestly. I think whatever fungus this is also spread to other parts of my body that my hair touches like my arms and back, because I notice the smell on my skin too. \n\nDoes anyone have advice on what I can do?\n\nEdit: I have 1b hair, goes to my waist, 18f",

Prob eczema or psoriasis exacerbated by opportunistic strains of bacteria or fungus. If there is a rotten necrotic smell to it it’s likely bacterial. Either way you’ll likely need a course of medication. In the mean time cut out all sugar from your diet. It’s what both bacteria and fungus thrive off of. Rinse your hair out with apple cider vinegar as it is a natural antibacterial and microbial and the  acidic pH will make a less hospitable environment for what you have going on.\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8369171/",

You name it I have tried it. \n\nSo, December last year I started experimenting with steroid creams, at first they would clear the seb but it would come back redder and worse each time, not only effecting how I felt about my face but also I would say most probably my mental health. I wouldn’t say I’m the type of guy who even writes posts like this I’m 28m I’ve always had relatively good skin on my face I have never used any routines and to suddenly wake up one day with the progressively worse problem on my face was a really big issue abs to be honest for me it still is but the one thing I say to you all is you have to learn to live with it and to accept it is part of your life, which I believe is a big part of this journey that everyone on here is on. I’ve probably been diagnosed with seb on my face for just over 2 years and only recently have I found success with a ‘routine’ that works for me. \n\nWhen I say works for me, because I know everyone is different and what works for one may not work for the other but if it’s helped I want to share. \n\nAll it requires is Dead Sea salt about £17 a 25kg bag in the UK. Free and clear Zinc Pyrithione Shampoo and some childs farm baby shampoo.\n\nWhenever I bath I put 1kg of Dead Sea salt in the bath once it’s finished running. Whilst doing This I wet my fingers and hands and I get the salt granules and dab onto my face gently rubbing onto the areas that are affected, I’ll then sit and soak in the bath with this on my face for 30 mins or more. At first it will sting, badly, for me it was almost to much but I lay there and persevered. Once soaked wash off delicately with the bath water.\n\nNext add a 50p sized baby shampoo to your palm and then a 5p of zinc shampoo and mix together. Lather into your hair and then rinse in the bath water thoroughly. If you wish to then wash with fresh water once this process is done then you can do but I find that my skin is sensitive to hard water in my area so the salt rinse is enough. \n\nI have also been experimenting with a salt spray in a bottle to mist on areas on my face for daily use and have found this to help with any small flares. \n\nI am happy I now have it under control with a significant decrease in redness on my face and flakes etc pretty much gone. \n\nI hope everyone finds an answer. I really would be careful with steroid creams.",

    "body": "Hi all,\n\nI know MCT oil is very beneficial for some, but I cannot use it as it breaks me out and burns my skin. Additionally, for the longest time I was not finding much success at all with various medicated products (zinc pyrithione, salicylic acid, ketoconazole, etc.). However, after following a more set guide that I will detail below, I have seen much improvement in my hair and skin. It is still not symptom-free (and likely never will be due to the chronic nature of sebderm), but it is magnitudes better when I follow the steps below.\n\n>**(1) Break the biofilm**  \n>  \n>Fungus like the Malasezzia fungus that causes sebderm have the capacity to form biofilms, which are essentially protective walls that help protect the fungus from attack. Because there is a biofilm on top of the fungus protecting it, anti-fungal agents like zinc pyrithione and ketoconazole have a harder time getting to and destroying the fungus that produces sebderm. Without breaking the biofilm, you will see much less success in reducing your sebderm symptoms.  \n>  \n>To break the biofilm, I use erythritol, which is a sugar alcohol similar to xylitol. Xylitol, erythritol, and other sugar alcohols have biofilm-breaking qualities. You can purchase these at health food grocery stores. I personally bought the bag of erythritol at Whole Foods. *I use a ratio of 1 teaspoon of erythritol to a 1/2 cup of water, mix it up so the granules dissolve in the water, apply it to my face & hair, and let is sit on there for at least 1 hour, and then shower to wash it off.*  \n>  \n>Try to do the biofilm step every other day to keep the biofilm away, or as you see fit once you try the sugar alcohol solution out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**(2) Check the ingredients of your products**  \n>  \n>Your shampoos, conditioners, face cleansers, moisturizers, make-up, sunscreen, etc. need to have no (or close to none) ingredients that promote the growth of Malasezzia, the fungus that causes sebderm.  \n>  \n>You can check the ingredients of your products on [https://www.sezia.co/](https://www.sezia.co/) and/or [https://folliculitisscout.com/](https://folliculitisscout.com/).  \n>  \n>\\*\\*The only product in my routine that has a Malessezia-unsafe ingredient is the 2% ketoconazole shampoo prescribed by my doctor. Alas, I have been unable to find a totally 100% Malessezia-safe shampoo that contains ketoconazole, the best anti-fungal agent for sebderm\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**(3) Rotate your anti-fungal shampoos**  \n>  \n>Don't use the same anti-fungal shampoo every single time you wash your hair. For example, use a zinc pyrithione one Monday, a salycylic acid one Tuesday, ketoconazole wednesday, etc.  \n>  \n>Some of my favorite anti-fungal shampoos are:  \n  \n>  \n>[Happy Cappy Dr. Eddie’s Medicated Shampoo](https://www.amazon.com/Happy-Cappy-Seborrheic-Dermatitis-Clinically/dp/B07857W8MS?th=1) (zinc pyrithione)  \n>  \n>[Neutrogena T-sal](https://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Therapeutic-Salicylic-Seborrheic-Dermatitis/dp/B094W8YZQ4/ref=sxts_rp_s_a_1_0?content-id=amzn1.sym.3432eb1a-1558-4445-9430-9bb3e7f7b9b7%3Aamzn1.sym.3432eb1a-1558-4445-9430-9bb3e7f7b9b7&crid=O5VSFFDEUE38&cv_ct_cx=neutrogena%2Bt-sal%2Bshampoo&keywords=neutrogena%2Bt-sal%2Bshampoo&pd_rd_i=B00UOL93CG&pd_rd_r=bc02fa85-26d6-48a4-81ee-e790e7a1c38d&pd_rd_w=z9dZj&pd_rd_wg=wA98S&pf_rd_p=3432eb1a-1558-4445-9430-9bb3e7f7b9b7&pf_rd_r=JCHSCXCGCRVQPKZ081RM&qid=1684534006&sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&sprefix=neutrogena%2Bt-sal%2Caps%2C586&sr=1-1-5985efba-8948-4f09-9122-d605505c9d1e&th=1) (Salicylic acid) (recently discontinued so here is [another salicylic acid Malesezzia-safe shampoo](https://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Anti-Dandruff-Strength-salicylic-Fragrance/dp/B0B2LT24MB/ref=sr_1_8?crid=2XOX0WCB54L5D&keywords=neutrogena+salicylic+acid+shampoo&qid=1684534115&sprefix=neutrogena+sal%2Caps%2C132&sr=8-8#customerReviews) that I have not tried yet)  \n>  \n>[Trader Joe's Tea Tree Tingle Shampoo](https://www.amazon.com/Trader-Joes-Peppermint-Eucalyptus-Botanicals/dp/B002LMBLTY) (tea tree)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**(4) Wet your hair, shampoo it once, rinse, then shampoo again (leaving it on for 5 minutes)**  \n>  \n>It is important that you first shampoo and rinse once to help wash away oils, sweat, sebum, dirt, etc. on your scalp so the anti-fungal shampoo can get down to the fungus during the second shampoo.  \n>  \n>However, the ***most important part of shampooing is leaving the anti-fungal shampoo on for at least 5 minutes.*** Without having adequate contact time with your scalp and hair, the anti-fungal agent will not have enough exposure to kill the Malasezzia fungus.  \n>  \n>\\*\\*I purchased a [waterproof timer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FDRQDM2?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) for my shower that I set for 5 mins. after I get my hair suds-ed up this second time.\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese four steps above should help improve your hair. Below are additional things you can do along with some of my favorite products.\n\n* Because anti-fungal shampoos can be harsh on hair (their goal is to kill the fungus and remove the sebum that feeds it), consider a conditioner (but make sure its Malasezzia-safe!!) to help replenish your hair. Use it every few days or whenever your hair is feeling dry. My favorite Malasezzia-safe hair conditioner is [hims Thick Fix Conditioner](https://www.target.com/p/hims-thick-fix-conditioner-thickening-38-moisturizing-6-4-fl-oz/-/A-79392746).\n* Just like your scalp, your face also likely needs to have the biofilm broken. Leave the sugar alcohol/water mixture on your face for an hour just like you do for your scalp.\n* Additionally, just like your scalp, your face also needs Malasezzia-safe antifungal treatments and products.\n   * I use the [Happy Cappy Dr. Eddie’s Medicated Shampoo](https://www.amazon.com/Happy-Cappy-Seborrheic-Dermatitis-Clinically/dp/B07857W8MS?th=1) (zinc pyrithione) as a face wash every couple days (leaving it on for 1 minute) to help the sebderm on my face.\n   * I also use [Vanicream Gentle Cleanser](https://www.amazon.com/Vanicream-Gentle-Cleanser-sensitive-Dispenser/dp/B00QY1XZ4W/ref=sxts_rp_s_a_1_0?content-id=amzn1.sym.3432eb1a-1558-4445-9430-9bb3e7f7b9b7%3Aamzn1.sym.3432eb1a-1558-4445-9430-9bb3e7f7b9b7&cv_ct_cx=vanicream+gentle&keywords=vanicream+gentle&pd_rd_i=B00QY1XZ4W&pd_rd_r=bf6afb24-6443-4290-bacc-238809666fb6&pd_rd_w=4TSqh&pd_rd_wg=Zui7t&pf_rd_p=3432eb1a-1558-4445-9430-9bb3e7f7b9b7&pf_rd_r=PR60VKNA82J5X4A6GMF9&qid=1684535559&rdc=1&sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&sr=1-1-5985efba-8948-4f09-9122-d605505c9d1e) and [SEBAMED Clear Face Care](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016OXL1D6?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1).\n* I also bought water filters for my [shower head](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Sprite-Shower-Pure-Chrome-7-Spray-Shower-Head/4779563) and [bathroom faucet](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GABXWCK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), as I read that chlorine and other chemicals found in water can exacerbate sebderm and other eczema-like conditions and take medium temperature showers instead of blazing hot showers.\n\nI hope this long post does not overwhelm--my advice would be not to try every single step at once as it can be overwhelming to make sure you follow everything immediately (it took me a longgg time to get all of this information and knowledge) but gradually incorporate these steps and similar products.",

And this one isn't something that I came up myself but was advised by the last dermatologist I spoke with. The previous ones only prescribed one antifungal+steroid cream after another, and even knowing my history of using such creams, they never advised me of their longterm effects.\n\nAnyway, my routine is simple. I wash my face with a mixture of a zinc pyrithione shampoo (Head and Shoulders) and a ketoconazole shampoo (Nizoral). There are shampoos containing both but buying them separately is cheaper per volume. I would put a few drops, lather them onto my face then leave them on for 5 min before rinsing. This dries out my skin so I put a Cetaphil moisturizer afterwards. It is important not to put too much as it will irritate your skin. I use just enough to create a sort of watery foam.\n\nIf I have a sebderm breakout (usually when I'm really stressed out), I would do this everyday. Once the flaking improves, I would gradually wean off, from once every other day to once a week. Working under quarantine is particularly stressful for me so I am currently down to once every three days.",

    "body": "Sharing for accountability and to connect with others who have dealt with SD *inside* their ear canals (a fate I'd wish only on my worst enemy; it feels like fire ants crawling inside my ears every day/night 😭 ). \n\nIn 2021 I developed a confounding (both to me and to many doctors) condition inside my ears. Since then it has never abated, and it's excruciating. Brutally itchy, at times flaky, often weepy. I've had to stop using airpods/earplugs altogether and sometimes even excuse myself while in public or at work just to get to a bathroom to fight off the debilitating itch inside my ears. I haven't slept a single night all the way through in four years due to the pain/itch. The first few MDs thought it was an ear infection though they admitted it was curious that there was no puss. I refused to take antibiotics because I just had a feeling it wasn't an infection. Then an old school ENT diagnosed me with eczema and prescribed rather strong steroid oil drops, which actually gave me some relief (never for longer than a day, but, that was better than 24-hour misery). When I asked the ENT how long I'd have to use the drops, he said, \"Forever.\" I didn't love that. Eventually, the symptoms came back full force and, frankly, I haven't been symptom-free a day since then. Another year passed, and I eventually saw a dermatologist who said it wasn't eczema but, rather, seb derm, and that the steroid oil I'd been given was way too strong. She prescribed a much milder steroid cream. During this time I tried cutting out different things from my diet (sugar, dairy, wheat) to zero success. For a moment I wondered if I was dealing with steroid withdrawal, but my derm (who believes it's real, unlike many derms) didn't think so. \n\nOf note, at the exact same time that I developed the seb derm in 2021, I had also developed horrible SIBO/leaky gut with a citrobacter overgrowth. I assumed the two conditions were related and [I spent 1.5yr fixing my gut](https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/qblns8/day_1_of_the_rotation_diet_my_protocols_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), praying it would fix my ears. Mercifully, my gut is now fixed... but my ears are worse than ever. \n\n**Things I've tried along the way (including when I thought it was eczema):**   \nNizoral shampoo  \nSelsun  \nSteroid drops and creams  \nEmu oil  \nBorage oil  \nAquaphor  \nEczacalm  \nDead sea salt   \nTea tree oil shampoo\nTacromilus*\n\nAnd while I'd feel some occasional relief, it never lasted more than a few hours. \n\nThanks to [finding this article](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) last night I've learned about malassezia, and I'm motivated to try a new approach. \n\n**So, as of today I've started:**  \n1. MCT Oil + eucalyptus oil wash  \n2. Lotrimin Ultra (butenafine)\n[3. Added Squalane\n4. Morning kefir]\n\nIn a couple of days, I'll start taking L. Reuteri-dense yogurt (I have to make said yogurt first; otherwise, I'd also start it today). \n\nI may add occasional Sulfur masks and Zinc Pyrithione washes as well. \n\nBecause the SD is *inside* my ears, it makes access/cleaning complicated. So I'm very keen to hear from anyone who has successfully dealt with this exact condition/placement.\n\nWishing you all relief and good health. \n\nEDIT: *To include Tacromilus to the list above \n\nEDIT: The first 5 days on this protocol actually saw some improvement/relief. While I still had nightly itch-fests, they paled in comparison to what I'd been experiencing the past 4 years. But last night I had a full-on attack/regression. Feeling pretty demotivated, but going to stick with this regimen for at least another week before I shift. ",

I am a woman and so my nails are a bit longer but I had to keep them short so I wouldn't scrape my ear canals causing stinging, bleeding...\n\nI tried drops, tea tree oil, mineral oil, coconut oil, hydrocortisone cream, the whole time believing the itch was due to dry skin.  At night, partially asleep, I would dig and scrape and then would have sores that would scab over.  I don't want to sound dramatic, but I feel like it really affected my quality of life.\n\nSeveral months ago, while going down the rabbit hole yet again looking for answers, I came across an article that said that the itching may be due to a fungus or yeast and NOT dry skin.  They recommended a couple of drops of isopropyl alcohol in each ear when just out of the shower (I remembered that OTC 'swimmers ear' drops were almost entirely alcohol) since the alcohol will dry up any moisture.\n\nI've been GENTLY swabbing my ear canal with a cotton swab dipped in isopropyl alcohol every day since I read that article.  My itching is virtually GONE.  I will occasionally get a little tickle but my ears are 99% itch-free! And the best thing is that it went away pretty quickly - within a few days of starting the alcohol swabbing.\n\n  \nI sincerely hope that anyone dealing with this problem will give this a try.  Again, not to be dramatic, but it has been life-changing for me.",

I managed to get it under control by changing between 3 different actives,the order here represents their effectiveness,\"ketoconazol of course, selenium sulfide and zinc pyrithione\", the occasional use of steroid lotion on my scalp during attacks and use of salicylic acid scalp cleanser before shower to loosen up the flakes.\nOf course i had the same troubles as everyone with shampoos, losing efficacy after a while, dryiny my hair, thinning, shedding and even changing my hair texture i went from having loose waves to tight waves in the last 2 years.\nI was very unhappy about my hair health, it looked like i have to bargain between my hair health and scalp health all the time which was frustrating.\n\nAt the same time i had seb dem as well on my face in the typical zones- eyebrows, the sides of my nose, the sides under my moth and ear- and i was using steroid cream for that as well.\nOne day i decided to have a skin care routine as i am a female in my 30s , started moisturizing my face daily with urea cream + using some actives for aging skin and my seb dem vanished completely! My face is seb dem free for 9 months! So i thought what if i used a similar strategy for scalp moisturization as well and see?\nI started using the same urea and salicylic acid cream on my scalp, i would dilute it a bit with few drops of water to make it more lotion-y and massage it on my scalp in the morning and wash my hair with a REGULAR shampoo every 3 days and with seb dem shampoo once every 2 weeks.\n\nResults? I am seb dem free for almost 6 weeks! I had a one minor attack, scalp flaked a little but the flakes were loose to the point i can remove them by just combing through my hair. No big flakes stuck to my scalp, no redness, no crazy itching. During the attack i used scalpicin lotion as usual and the itching reliefed next day that i didn't have to use it for a course of 4 days like before.\n\nI won't tell the name of my product since i live in the middle east and probably you won't have it anyway, but Eucerin has a new urea lotion directed towards scalp moisturization that o can't have in my country but i guess it's available in Europe and the US. I would recommend this since it's designed specifically to use on scalp so i hope it doesn't make hair roots sticky.\n\nThis is my experience and i loved to share it as a new strategy to help us all!",

This is what we do and it effects such patients.\n\nNow everywhere allopathic treatment is there so nobody cares this and thinks that this is rubbish but as you wish. Ask or consult aryuvedic doctor he who recommend any other. \n\nAllopathic is not good in most of treatments until now. As far I saw as compared to aryuvedic or unani treatment.\n\nChk For jaundice in allopathic it takes 70k even also no results, \n\nBut in aryuvedic it cost 50-100 rupees to cure. And for the women that excess blood loss and white discharge, still it's loading in allopathic, but in aryuvedic that can be cured within 6-7 days just by single herb.

    "body": "I thought this might be helpful. I've provided sources for all information. \n    \n     \nDandruff is typically associated with an overgrowth of *Malassezia*. Not always, but it is highly correlated (so not causal). This can run rampant when the stratum corneum experiences transepidermal water loss (TEWL). \n    \nMost anti-dandruff shampoos are HARSH ON THE SCALP! They can *potentially* kill the overgrowth of fungi, however, they strip away natural moisturizing factors from the scalp causing a whole other magic bag of skin irritations to appear... typically alleviate symptoms during use.\n\nSo a breakdown of helpful ingredients in no particular order.     \n\n1. Zinc pyrithione 1% was preferable over ketoconazole 2% (nizoral) for 75% of women in one [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X15525888) of 40 participants.    \n\"[Males show a greater response than females to 1% ZnPT shampoo, while females show a greater response than males to non‐AD shampoo. These findings may in part be explained by the sex‐related differences observed in stratum corneum properties, which may make males more prone to dandruff than females](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ics.12501).\"     \nThis is from a meta-analysis so it's comprehensive, over many participants. \n    \n2. Coal tar wasn't as advocated because of possible carcinogenic effects. However, this 13k+ [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X15347710) confirms there are no cancer risks. It is EXTREMELY beneficial for psoriasis and eczema.\n\n3. Salicylic acid this is great. If you use these on your face without problem and it helps your skin, give it a go.\n\n4. Sulfide/sulfur and ketoconazole (nizoral) are also remedies. This [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2887514/) covers a bit more detail.\n\n5. Not for treatment but shampoo/conditioner with hyaluronic acid is extremely helpful for dry scalps. [Hyaluronic Acid has the potential to hold 1000x it's weight in water.](https://advanceddermatologymd.com/blog/the-science-behind-hyaluronic-acid)\n\n\n[This](https://www.healthline.com/health/best-dandruff-shampoo#conditioners) website has some options and great tips, they also quoted some of the same studies I found down my rabbit hole of research.\n\n**Ingredients in the shampoo matter! Fatty acids usually help repair a dry scalp but with *Malassezia* it can actually be food. So if it's high up in the ingredients list that product may not be beneficial.** \n\nMy recommendation is to see a dermatologist but I realize that's not feasible for everyone. So look at differential diagnosis like this [paper's](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4852869/#!po=15.8824) table 2 and the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dandruff/)' info. Which one sounds familiar to your situation? Try to isolate, so you can research more specifically. Because dandruff is a wild beast that manifests in many different ways and is a bitch to get rid of for almost everyone. And just in case, here is a list of fungal-safe products:     https://simpleskincarescience.com/fungal-acne-products-malassezia-pityrosporum-folliculitis/\n\nMore about *Malassezia*: [here](https://hellojupiter.com/learn/scalp-health-101/malassezia-scalp-fungus-dandruff-science/) and [here](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/).\n    \n    \n         \n          \n        \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \nSources:    \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3494381/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4852869/#!po=15.8824\n\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ics.12501\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X15525888\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC118058/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2887514/\n\nhttps://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \nEdit: format and added hyaluronic acid",

    "body": "Hello!So I recently (2 days ago) realized I seem to have low porosity hair, and for YEARS I have not used conditioner. Now I wanted to start to use it as my hair is very frizzy and seems to lack moisture or protein. But when I used my conditioner and washed it out, after my hair dried it felt sticky?? and very stiff?? like it was still dirty, my hair pieces were sticking together, as if the product didn't wash out or it left something on it? I later realized the conditioner has shea butter, coconut oil and castor oil so I just assumed it was the heavy oils. Now last time I used my sisters Olaplex shampoo and conditioner and I had no issues, but I used the SAME shampoo and conditioner of Olaplex yesterday, the same amount of conditioner (less then a finger tip), but out the shower when it dried it again became stiff, feels dirty, also kind of sticky as the hairs stick together? This conditioner doesn't have that heavy oils but it does have silicones, but I'm a bit confused as to what the reason could be?\n\nIs it normal for low porosity hair to react this way to conditioners? Or could this be too much protein as I heard your hair can get stiff? Or is this just because my low porosity hair didn't take it in well and it left a layer on my hair? I'm planning to buy a CG shampoo and conditioner soon, but I'm a bit worried now as so many conditioners seem to do this no matter how little I use and brush it out. I'd appreciate any information on this. It could be buildup but that would confuse me as my normal shampoo I used until a week ago has no oil, salicylical acid and zinc pyrithione so I have no idea what could cause the buildup, and this effect was already there the 1st time I used conditioner. And not there the 2nd time, and there again the third??\n\nThank you very much!  \n\n\nEdit -   \nOkay, I am just editing this as people are calling me out for ''lashing out'', when I never lashed out and only responded to someone who was talking as if I was using DIY treatments right now, which I wanted to clarify, I was not. My post was only asking if it is possible that the protein in the conditioner is the cause of this hair effect, OR if it is normal for low porosity hair to have this stiffness which most conditioners.   \n\n\nSo ofcourse, I had no idea this would mean that I would have to mention using 1 medicated shampoo 8 months ago, flaxseed gel 6 months ago, and hair rinses 6 months ago. It was confusion, not lashing out. Now most comments are saying my hair must be high porosity or bleached, but for clarification, my hair is 100% virgin, never dyed, never had treatments and I never use a hairdryer. I have no issues regarding my scalp, which is why I did not mention my scalp in this post, as I've been able to fix that on my own from the past half year.   \n\n\nSorry for anyone who felt I came off as rude, but nowhere in the rules did I, as a newcomer, see that you had to mention the past 6 months of hair products, even with a question that was only regarding a conditioner.

        "body": "You have a lot of personal health history and hair care attempts you’ve left out of your post so people who haven’t taken the time to look through your post history won’t be able to give fully informed opinions. \n\nIn your history you mention both eczema and dermatitis, you mention having curly hair (which would typically not be low porosity) and doing both vinegar and lemon rinses. \n\nIf I had to wager what your problem is, you’re probably aggravating your scalp with all the various self treatment attempts. You’re stripping natural oils away, you’re drying the scalp and causing itch with the acid based rinses. Then, to compensate for your hair feeling dry, you’re adding all sorts of oils and your hair is getting greasy. \n\n None of this even touches on how the various treatments you’re attempting are impacted by the treatments prescribed by your dermatologist for your scalp. \n\nGenerally speaking, curly hair needs moisture. If you’re using curly girl method as your sister suggested, it will take time for your scalp to adjust to the conditioner only washing. Silicones may or may not be a problem, that’s individual specific. \n\nWhat you don’t mention in your history I could easily see was: do you have color treated hair and how often are you washing? Do you know if you have hard or soft water?",

I'm picturing those bleach fail videos, when, after they wash their hair, it becomes clumpy and sticks together and kind of never dries. If that's the case, it needs to be treated very differently than low-porosity hair. \n\nIt could also just be as simple as you not fully rinsing the conditioner out of your hair. Since you're not used to using conditioner, there's a chance you're just not used to the feeling of it in your hair and the feeling of fully rinsed, conditioned hair. I've accidentally done that before, especially on the back of my head where the hair is naturally coarser, and it does dry kind of crusty and weird.",

        "body": "Hi there! Just came here to say that I can completely relate...you're not alone! Conditioner has made my hair feel \"hard\" for as long as I can remember, even when I was a kid and knew nothing about hair dyes, protein, or silicones. ;) I also use Olaplex 3 currently, and unfortunately it does nothing for my hair.\n\nIn my case, I don't think the \"hardness\" is due to buildup, since I'm now following the curly girl method, but my CG-friendly products haven't really helped my hair in this specific regard (aka the \"hardness\").\n\nI don't know my hair's porosity. I believe I'm high-porosity due to the texture and roughness of each strand of my hair. However, it does take forever to become fully-saturated, which is common for *low*\\-porosity hair.\n\nI haven't found the answers or the solution yet, but I'm starting to think that my hair is just REALLY sensitive to certain ingredients. For example, my hair HATES the beloved CG-friendly GVP/Matrix Biolage Conditioning Balm that many, many people use to soften their hair. It makes my hair feel like straw even when it's wet (aka wet straw...not a nice feeling at all lol). So I'm keeping a spreadsheet to try to figure out which ingredients are causing this to happen. Once I figure out the ingredient(s), I'll avoid them at all cost.\n\nI wish you the best of luck!",

My hair hates any product with keratin protein in it, it reacts the same way, turns to straw. It also does this with coconut oil in products too, so if your conditioner has no keratin, check for this as well. I don't think it's a rule for everyone, but for me, my hair treats coconut oil the same way it does keratin.\n\nSo far my hair seems to tolerate lesser proteins like hydrolyzed rice and vegetable. It may be a bit of trial and error for what works for your hair. I'm still searching for a lo-po conditioner that I love, but avoiding keratin and coconut oil has helped. I hope this helps you!\n\nEdit: a word.",

    "body": "Howdy! I've been a long-time lurker on the sub and thought it was time to contribute after all my skincare travels. o/\n\nMy skincare routine has strong emphasis on **simplicity** and **affordability**. While I enjoy taking care of my facial skin and using it as a self-care tool, I also enjoy overall body care, so keeping the time commitment lean helps keep my schedule under control :’). My skin is generally pretty clear except for occasional hormonal breakouts. I don’t wear makeup.\n\n**Skin Type:** Oily, Fitzpatrick 3-4, prone to hyperpigmentation\n\n# The Routine\n\n|AM|Cleanse w/ water|Stratia C+C Serum|CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion|Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|PM|CeraVe Foaming|CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion|Wait 15-20 min (until dry)|Curology or Differin|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Breakdown\n\nRatings are out of 5, and I consider the quality, cost, and ease-of-use of the product in determining the score and whether I’d repurchase (RP) or not. Since these are all basically staples in my routine, the ratings will be pretty high!\n\n## The Core\n\n**CeraVe Foaming Cleanser ($12): ⭑⭑⭑ | RP**\n\nNot much to say, which is good. Most basic foaming cleansers agree with my skin, I just have to avoid using hot water. I prefer not to spend too much on a product that gets rinsed away. I docked some stars since there are comparable alternatives (Equate, etc) at lower price points. Because this is a short-contact product, I don’t mind experimenting with new alternatives. (I'm thinking of trying out Neutrogena's Ultra Gentle or Cetaphil foaming cleanser next!)\n\n \n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion ($9): ⭑⭑⭑⭑⭑ | RP**\n\nBland, lightweight, & cheap! Since I’m already oily, just a smidge of this lightweight lotion is perfect after a cleanse (or in dry weather). It helps combat some of the drying aspects of my SPF and actives—I might not use this if I never used actives. Using bland products for the core of my routine lets me have better control of my actives and their interactions.\n\n \n\n**Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish ($10): ⭑⭑⭑⭑ | RP**\n\nNow this is a product I like to tell friends about! There are some irritating ingredients (alcohol, citrus oils), but my skin tolerates them well. Has a mild ^((finger guns)) powdery finish. I still appear a little greasy by the end of the day, but it’s a *vast* improvement over all other (drugstore) sunscreens I’ve tried. I actually look forward to using SPF in the mornings now! Took off a star because it's still a smidge drying at times.\n\n## Actives\n\n**Stratia C+C ($22): ⭑⭑⭑ | RP?**\n\nThis was my first indie skincare product (and a bit of a treat-yo-self)! Per the website, I placed this after my cleanse in the AM. 1 pump does the trick. It did tingle for me at first. I actually don’t mind the silicone formula, and I intentionally chose it for its stability (needing to refrigerate a serum severely takes away from ease-of-use for me). I wait until I can’t feel any residue on my skin, then move on. It's a good boost for my SPF. The *only* reasons I wouldn’t consider repurchasing are because it adds another step in my routine and it’s something else I have to purchase.\n\n \n\n**Curology ($40): ⭑⭑⭑⭑ |** **~~RP~~**\n\nMy Curology formula is/was 8% azelaic acid / 1% clindamycin / 0.25% zinc pyrithione. This was essential in getting my constant breakouts under control, and I recommend trying it if you’ve struggled with moderate acne. I use only 1 pump, focusing on the most problematic areas. 1 pump covers most of my face. I can stretch a bottle to 2.5-3 months this way. I've even gone every other day instead of daily and still kept pretty clear skin. The convenience of 3 actives in 1 application is hard to beat! However, the costliness of this led me to explore alternatives.\n\n \n\n**Differin Gel 0.1% ($29): Pending review**\n\nI am actually in the process of transitioning to Differin, so I don’t have much to report right now! Full review and experience to follow in the coming months. I chose to try incorporating this product as a more effective acne and hyperpigmentation treatment (Curology does not seem to be able to \"keep up\" with what my skin does—there's always hyperpigmentation or a lingering pimple). It’s also the reason I began buffering my actives.",

Indeed, the proximate structural arrangement of the scalp and hair leads to an interdependent relationship between the two. \n\nWhile protective benefits of the hair to the scalp are obvious, the role of the scalp as an incubatory environment for the preemergent hair fiber has largely been ignored. \n\nIn fact, there is a wealth of observational data on specific dermatological conditions of the scalp providing evidence for the role of the scalp condition in supporting the production of healthy hair. \n\nOxidative stress, the inability of the body to sufficiently counteract the sources of oxidation, is prevalent in many skin conditions, including normal skin aging. \n\nOn the scalp, the hair appears to be impacted prior to emergence, and oxidative stress appears to play a role in premature hair loss. \n\nThe scalp commensal organism, Malassezia, has been recognized to be a source of oxidative damage. \n\nTherefore, hair care products, specifically shampoos, with active Malassezia inhibitory agents, such as zinc pyrithione, tend to reduce premature hair loss, besides the known benefits in treating specific dermatologic scalp pathologies, and therefore should represent an integral part of every treatment regimen for hair loss, even in individuals not showing symptoms of scalp pathologies.\n\n[Link to Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6369642/)",

And even when it is, there's still almost no understanding about what makes person X have more sensitive androgen receptors than person Y. The current explanation is \"meh it's just genetics.\" To me, that's a lazy and unacceptable explanation. I'm getting very close to the bottom of all of this, but for now I'll just explain the malassezia connection.\n\nMalassezia causes inflammation (e.g., acne, dandruff, red/itchy scalp, dermatitis), and inflammation and hair thinning, and eventual hair loss are all related.\n\nI made a video covering the inflammation issue and how it's the most overlooked element of hair loss: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PexjQ5oieTw&t=1s&ab\\_channel=TalnoHair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PexjQ5oieTw&t=1s&ab_channel=TalnoHair)\n\nTLDR: poor gut microbiome > poor management of insulin production / insulin sensitivity > systemic inflammation, which will visibly show in areas with large concentrations of androgen receptors (e.g., skin, scalp) > hypersensitivity to DHT > miniaturization.\n\nIn other words, think of inflammation like a force multiplier. It doesn't cause hair loss directly but if you're predisposed to hair loss already, it will significantly exacerbate your hair loss.",

After 15-30 min of contact between 1.5% ciclopirox olamine and Malassezia strains, a 2-log reduction of Malassezia counts was observed. \n\nThe 1.5% ciclopirox olamine/1% zinc pyrithione association was characterized by a steady fungicidal efficacy whereas the 2% ketoconazole solution did not express any fungicidal effect. \n\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrates the in vitro inhibitory and fungicidal efficacy of the ciclopirox olamine/zinc pyrithione association against Malassezia species and underscores its potential interest in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis.\n\n[Link to Study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17146583/)",

Afterwards, I used K18 Peptide Prep Detox shampoo (fungal acne safe, contains salicylic acid) to wash out all the oil and other product buildup, as well as to chemically exfoliate the dead skin cells on my scalp. Used any conditioner I had. Repeated this routine for 2 weeks until the flakes and itchiness disappeared. THATS IT!  \n\nFor maintenance I apply MCT oil once every 2 weeks, and alternate between K18 and drugstore shampoo. I’m always trying new conditioners and am just careful not to apply them directly on my scalp. \n\n",

I tried switching types of dandruff shampoo, and that helped for a while sometimes, but it always came back.\n\nI heard this somewhere and it solved my problem completely. Lots of fluffy lather means that the medication is not reaching your scalp. \n\nI use zinc pyrithione type shampoo (Head and Shoulders or generic). I get in the shower, and before getting my hair wet I apply dandruff shampoo to my head and massage it in for 20-30 seconds. There's enough water on my hands and head that it makes a very dense lather. Then I shower 5-10 minutes without rinsing my hair. I wash my face last and then rub the shampoo into my scalp for 20-30 seconds. Rinse. Done. \n\nTL:DR use shampoo without water. ",

    "body": "Had SebDerm for more than 10 years, mainly on my forehead, eyebrows and chin area (red inflamed & flaky). Over the years it sort of progressed to my back too.\n\nMedicated with Nizoral (Ketoconazole) & Fucicort (Steriod) cream all these years as per recommended by my dermatologist. The cream worked well in the beginning, but as time went by, the flare up became worst and it came to a point where the cream don't seem to work anymore.\n\nAfter researching and experimenting on my own last year. I'm glad to share that I have not had a flare up since Oct 2023. The 2 products I have been using are,\n\n* Dermaharmony 2% Pyrithione Zinc Face & Body Cleansing Bar\n   * Started off using twice daily (day and night) to wash my face, hair and whole body. Took about 1\\~2 week before seeing some result. When I first started using the soap, it caused my face to be very red and dry/flaky. So after applying the BHA Liquid Exfoliant, during day time I applied the Vanicream sun screen / moisturizer. While for the night, I applied Cetaphil Redness Reliving Night Moisturizer. I no longer apply those after I ran out of them as my skin condition got better and mainly because I'm too lazy.\n   * Currently using twice daily (day and night) to wash my face and back only (instead of whole body). Occasionally, I use it on my hair if I feel my scalp itching. Otherwise, I'm mainly using Clear Men Shampoo twice daily for my hair which also contains Zinc Pyrithione.\n* Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant\n   * Started off using once daily (day) with additional layer of sun screen/moisturizer (Vanicream)\n   * Currently using once every 2 days (night) without sun screen\n\nCreated a Reddit account just to share this. Hopefully my experience will help someone out there :)\n\nUpdate: List of other products I tried which I think did not really made a difference for me\n\n* MCT Oil (C8 & C10)\n* LA ROCHE-POSAY Lipikar Baume AP+M\n* MooGoo Scalp Cream\n* MooGoo MSM Moisturizer",

    "body": "I signed up for Skin + Me because it's a few quid cheaper per month than Dermatica and I was pretty excited to see some competition on the market for a teledermatology service as I've been waiting for this for years (like, I found Dermatica's site when it was still under construction because I've googled 'Teledermatology UK' so many times).\n\nThe information form during sign up doesn't have a box to request specific treatments, which was annoying, so I tried to answer the questions in a way that would get me the prescription I wanted (azelaic 15% and niacinamide 5%). I was already using Finacea gel and a 5% niacinamide serum but was willing to pay a bit more to have that bundled all into one product because I've been trying to minimise my routine. Dermatica only go up to 4% niacinamide for some reason so that was another reason I wanted to try a different provider. I sent an email over after I'd filled in the form to request that treatment specifically, and my prescriber got in touch about a day later to ask me whether 14% aZa, 4% niacinamide and 0.025 (I think?) zinc pyrithione was OK. I said I'd rather not use the zinc as I've tried it before and found it pretty drying, and that 15% aZa worked well for me alone so it was needless. I asked if 4% was their maximum concentration of niacinamide (actually I asked this twice!)\n\nThey didn't respond to my question about the niacinamide but said they won't do a 15% azelaic cream, even in conjunction with niacinamide, because there's already a 15% aZa on the market. I just said thank you and that I'd like to cancel my trial, as my skin is pretty sensitive and I didn't want to use any more actives than was necessary. From what they said, they only formulate products containing three actives, so even if you only want two you just have to choose a third. I don't think they make them customised to order, they must just have lots of pre-mixed stuff I guess.\n\nThey're a super new company so I imagine it's just growing pains and not really having communication down just yet. Communication was slow, usually taking about 24 hours between messages even when I replied at like 9AM. It took about four days to try to negotiate a treatment. (It took about an hour with Dermatica). I know Dermatica have temporarily stopped offering aZa serums while they reformulate different combos, but they're transparent about that process. Skin + Me came off really inflexible and didn't answer any questions I asked or offer any real explanation as to why they prescribe the way they do, which I guess rubbed me up the wrong way because I was happy to be a paying customer.\n\nThey said when I signed up that I was one of the founding members, so I'm happy to give them time to get it together so to speak, and would be willing to try them again further down the line. Like I say, they're cheaper than Dermatica so if you're wanting one of the combos they do mix (they don't list these anywhere so I'd just ask - I don't know for instance if they prescribe 14% aZa and 0.025% tret), then they might be an option for you. It seems like we don't as yet have a service that rivals Curology (for some reason neither Dermatica or Skin + Me offer tranexamic acid yet, despite it being safer and almost as effective as hydroquinone).",

I was hoping they'd give advice, talk to me, or change the medication strength. Instead I got nothing and they renewed it with same ingredients. I think with the NHS code / postage only discount they did, they took on too many people and are still adjusting to it. Just a guess though\n\nEdit: I realise I started at the end of March so I've been on it less time than I thought, so they're probably keeping me on the mix for a bit longer which is understandable.

I had eczema as a teenager, and it went away when I moved countries, and last year I had a bad flareup for the first time in 15 years.\nI started using a steroid cream out of desperation, and of course it came back with a vengeance and spread. I couldn’t even shower without tears. I would wake up at night from the itch. \nIt dawned on me that it might be infected because it was wetter than usual. I used to get tiny itchy bumps but this time they were a lot bigger and wept like crazy. At first zinc pyrithione wash helped but it would come back. Sulfur soap started clearing it beautifully but I would still get weepy and itchy at times (I suspect aveeno). I ditched aveeno oat lotion as I might be allergic to oats and it helped.\n\nA couple of days ago, I tried chlorhexidine and felt immediate relief. It is all flat today and the wet bumps and scales are gone. I had it in my house all the time and never thought to try. It is very common in my country as an antiseptic, I’ve been using it to clean my Invisalign trays. It comes in 0.05% liquid solution and costs like 20 cents here. Chlorhexidine kills both fungi and bacteria across all domains of life! It even kills freaking gonorrhoea. Please give it a go!!!",

The only things that worked to actually make it go away and heal the skin was to stop using any toothpaste that had fluoride, sulfates, or whitening agents in the ingredients. I currently use the David's brand and haven't had any breakouts. Look for toothpastes made with Hydroxyapatite, as it’s a safe and effective alternative to fluoride. David’s toothpaste: [https://amzn.to/4cgbVn8](https://amzn.to/4cgbVn8)\n\nIn addition.. Stop using any heavy ointments or balms around your mouth or on your lips (no Vaseline, beeswax, lip oils, lipgloss, lip masks, etc). The only one I use is La roche posay’s cicaplast lip balm. Exact product: [https://amzn.to/4l9th99](https://amzn.to/4l9th99)\n\nStop using too many layers of active skincare products in the area esp overnight and reduce usage of chemical exfoliants AHAs, BHAs, etc.\n\nWash your face gently, every other night with 2% Zinc Pyrithione soap and warm water. I alternate with a gentle cleanser like the squalane cleanser from The Ordinary. I bought a bar from a clean brand named Noble Formulas and got it on Amazon. Exact product: [https://a.co/d/hc2Nx1M](https://a.co/d/hc2Nx1M)\n\nZinc Pyrithione is the active ingredient in dandruff shampoo which may also have the same root issue linked to yeast/candida or fungal related. Note that this is a different kind of zinc than zinc oxide commonly in spf.\n\nDon’t use the zinc soap excessively..just try washing every other night and not leaving it on too long before washing off because it can be too drying if used too often. Don't get it in your eyes because it STINGS!\n\nI don’t use the zinc soap on my face in the morning. I just use a gentle oil cleansing balm like the one from [JunoSkin](https://amzn.to/3QR8wkS) \\+ warm water to rinse off my skincare products from overnight. Your skin may be able to handle the soap just fine on a daily basis, but mine is a bit more sensitive. Stick to this routine for at least 2 weeks, stay hydrated, and  try to sleep on your back or make sure that your pillowcase is washed if you tend to sleep on your side or stomach. i recommend using a  [pillowcase made with 100% mulberry silk](https://amzn.to/42272L7).\n\nLet me know if this helps you too!🫶",

My routine is this:\n\nMorning\n-Cerave hydrating face wash\n-Kikumasamune lotion\n- Hada Labo Gokujyun (hyaluronic acid, just started this a few weeks ago)\n- First Aid Beauty moisturizer\n- Biore Watery Essence sunscreen\n\nEvening\n- Same 4 steps, but no sunscreen\n- sometimes I'll use Etude House Collagen sleeping pack.\n- Vasaline on the smile lines\n\nI was using Stridex, Corsx AHA power liquid, and Curology with Azeliacc acid, Clindamycin, and Zinc pyrithione, but stoped about a week ago.\n\nI figure it's dryness and irritation so I've been trying to moisturize the most I can but it doesn't seem to help. I also use sheet masks about once a week.\n\nAny suggestions, help, or personal experience would be very helpful!!",

    "body": "**Background**: Got diagnosed with Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) when I was still very little; got it from my Dad. Doctor told me I got severe SD, got forced to take strong Corticosteroids (topical and oral) due to how bad it got. When I was younger I described my hair as \"snow world\" due to how much hair fall and damaged (inflamed, itchy, and *very* scaly) scalp.\n\nRight now, I haven't gotten severe dandruff in 2 years--probably some flakes here and there, but not that annoying or severe. My entire face and ears still gets scaly (due to weather and environmental conditions), but not to the point of bleeding or peeling.\n\n**Symptoms:** I get fungal acne (Malassezia folliculitis), (closed and opened) comedo, and all types of acne on the face and body, dandruff, very inflamed skin, with occasional bleeding.\n\n**Products:** I use different products for the hair, face, body, and the symptom that area is affected by.\n\nFor medications, I will put the generic name with its strength, then its brand name.\n\n# Fungal Acne, Comedo, and Acne\n\n**Face**\n\n1. **Differin 0.1% (Adapalene) or Tretinoin 0.05% (Retacnyl)**. *This is a retinoin.* Used five times a week at night (M, T, Th, F, St). Tretinoin is a prescription medication.\n2. **Ketoconazole 1% (Nizoral).** *This is an anti-fungal*. Used once a week at night (W).\n3. **Benzoyl Peroxide 2.6%** **(Cetaphil Gentle Clear Complexion-Clearing BPO Acne Cleanser)**. *This is an anti-acne*. Used once a week at night (St).\n4. **Salicylic Acid 2% (Cetaphil Gentle Clear Clarifying Acne Cream Cleanser).** *This is a chemical exfoliant.* Used once a week at night (Sn)\n5. **Sunscreen.**\n\n**Body**\n\n1. **Benzoyl Peroxide 5% (Differin Acne Face Wash).** *This is an anti-acne*. Used twice a week (M, F) for 2 minutes. After the bath, liberally moisturize the areas where BPO was used.\n2. **Ketoconazole 1% (Nizoral).** *This is an anti-fungal*. Used once a week at night (W, St) for 3 minutes.\n\n# Dandruff and Flaking\n\n**Scalp and Hair**\n\n1. **Ketoconazole 1% (Nizoral).** *This is an anti-fungal*. Used twice a week (T, F) for 3 minutes.\n2. **Zinc Pyrithione 1% (Head & Shoulders Bare).** *This is an anti-fungal*. For everyday (excluding Nizoral days) hair shampooing for 1 to 2 minutes.\n\n**Face**\n\n1. See (2) for *Fungal Acne, Comedo, and Acne: Face.*\n2. **Clotrimazole 10 mg and Beclometasone Dipropionate 250 μg (Candibec)**. *This is an anti-fungal and corticosteroid*. Apply only when needed on affected areas, not to be used for more than a week.\n3. **Miconazole nitrate 20 mg (Daktarin).** *This is an anti-fungal*.\n4. **Betamethasone Valerate 1 mg (Betnovate).**  *This is a corticosteroid*. Used with Daktarin as a last resort medication, for severe symptoms. Used only when Nizoral and Candibec don't work. Topically applied as a 1:1 pea sized mixture.\n\n# Skin Care, Shaving, Toothpaste, and Supplements\n\nThese are the following products I use as my skin care (excluding the medications I listed above).\n\n1. **Moisturizer (with Hyaluronic Acid and Niacinamide)**: Cetaphil Deep Hydration Skin Restoring Water Gel.\n2. **Oat Serum**: Aveeno Calm + Restore Triple Oat Hydrating Face Serum.\n3. **Mild Facial Cleanser:** Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser.\n\nShaving really irritates my skin, and it really makes my skin get inflamed and start scaling very heavily.\n\n1. **Electric Razor**: Philips Norelco One Blade. A close shaving electric razor that doesn't have blades that physically touch my skin.\n2. **Shaving Cream**: Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser. I use my mild facial cleanser as my shaving cream to avoid using other products on my face that might cause irritation or scaling.\n3. **Aftershave**: Differin Pore-Minimizing Toner with Witch Hazel. This has Witch Hazel, Aloe, and Chamomile to calm my skin down. I don't like using aftershave or splashes since it has strong scents and alcohol.\n\nUsing toothpaste also triggers scaling and (fungal and non-fungal) acne on my face. I found these toothpastes to work on me (I found mint-free toothpaste work). I use **Sensodyne Pronamel**.\n\nFor conditioner I use the **Nizoral Non-Medicated Deep Moisturizing Conditioner**.\n\nI also take a **One A Day Men’s Complete Multivitamin** every morning.\n\n# Routine\n\n**Face**\n\nSince I use a have a lot of products (I have but not *use* a lot of products). I want to determine what I want to attack for the day or week and use the specific routine for that symptom. Usually I'll prioritize flaking, bleeding, and inflammation; then, fungal, non-fungal acne, and comedo.\n\nIn the morning:\n\n* I wash my face with the gentle cleanser.\n* Shave (if needed)\n* Moisturizer\n* Sunscreen.\n\n>If I am not shaving, then I usually skip the moisturizer. If I have some flaking and/or inflammation, then I will put a *VERY* thin layer of Candibec.\n\nAt night, this is where the medications come in to play.\n\n* A usual day would be gentle cleanser, then oat serum, then Differin or Tretinoin, then moisturize.\n* If it's Saturday. I'd be using my BPO cleanser, then Differin, then moisturize.\n* If it's a Wednesday. I'd be using Nizoral as a cleanser, then moisturizing.\n* If it's a Sunday. I'd be using an SA cleanser, then oat serum then moisturize.\n* Regardless of the day, if there are flaking and/or inflammation. I'd be using my gentle cleanser, Candibec, then moisturize. The next day would a Nizoral day.\n\n# Sticking to things that work, leaving things that don't\n\nHaven't tried MCT Oil because I have already found products and medications that work well for me, and adding another step or product to my routine may change the \"stability\" of my SD.\n\nSelenium Sulfide (Selsun Blue) works well for me, but due to the side effects of hair loss (I already got hair loss as a symptom of my SD), Selenium Sulfide would just go in tandem with SD and make my hair loss severe.\n\nNow what your body needs, talk to other people with SD and to a dermatologist, and work your way to finding a routine that works for you. Doesn't mean something works for me or your dermatologist gave you a specific medication means that it will work for you.\n\nGone through 3 dermatologists, numerous treatments and operators. None of them worked, and that's not a bad thing.\n\n",

After covid, I will request to continue working remotely until I can regrow my hair, or find a convincing hair replacement system. \n\nMy seborrheic dermatitis is on my scalp only with relatively minimal flaking. The only real problem for me is the hair shedding. Based on [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/jfp6et/fixed_my_sd_by_repairing_moisture_barrier/), I'm thinking about about shaving my head temporarily in order to concentrate on repairing my scalp's moisture barrier. Having a shaved head seems necessary as I'm not sure how else you could realistically apply these thicker moisturizing lotions.\n\nHas anyone else tried this approach? Is the moisture barrier likely to remain fixed even after the direct application of these lotions stops? Are there other realistic ways to repair the moisture barrier that don't require a shaved head?\n\nAnd an unrelated question: Has anyone been able to find doctors in the US that actually understand this condition well enough to try long term solutions? \n\nThanks!",

Use oil free sunscreen massaged into your scalp, but try and minimize use.\nWithin 2-4 days you will see your inflammation disappear and the crusts will harden, flake, and fall off.  Within a week you will be mostly clear.\nAfter years of avoiding the sun at the direction of my useless dermatologist, I discovered this by accident while on a beach vacation.  Now I take at least 3 beach vacations per year to buy me reprieves from this curse. During the summer months, I mix up natural sea salt in water (Israeli Dead Sea Salt), soak my hair, and take the sun— works almost as well. Give it a try... Also works amazing for acne.  Sun alone doesn't do it nearly as effective based on my testing, so it's some combined action between the sea water and sun.\n\nEDIT:  Btw, my sebderm also has little dandruff, though I thankfully haven't experienced hair loss.  None of the shampoos worked much for me either, with the exception of DHS Zinc shampoo which helped a bit, and nightly ACV/Honey overnight hair wraps.",

If i wore black you would literally see flakes everywhere. I kept trying the usuals anti dandruff shampoos but nothing worked. It got to a point were the hair which i paid money for started falling out and after a while it didnt even look as if I ever had a hair transplant. I was 26 and I deffo wasnt ready to rock the bald look as no one in my family is bald. I researched so much, literally spent hours. Theres 2 things that have helped me clear my scalp that I was able to get a 2nd Hair transplant.  \n\n1. Mct oil 20 mins 3 times a week . Rinse with lukewarm water. I rarely shampoo my hair and if i do it will be an argan oil shampoo. But once again very rarely. \n\n2. Caprylic acid pills - sometimes the problem is not on the outside but from inside our body. I got mine from amazon and for me seb derm is a rare occurence. \n\nI hope this helps",

Hopefully it will help anyone who is unsure what to do.\n\nFirst, read t[his comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/guineapigs/comments/a8ou2q/persistent_ringworm_that_wont_go_away/eccgps2?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) by u/piggymomma86 for clear instructions.\n\nSecond, these videos are great for more information:\n\n* Scotty’s Animals: [Guinea Pig Ringworm Identification and Home Treatment](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=2ahUKEwjO7NCz1-DnAhVkyqYKHb5UCrYQwqsBMAB6BAgIEAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DS-XlS44-Kxk&usg=AOvVaw2eUCLS0D3IcsC_R2pd0pvD)\n* Saskia from Los Angeles Guinea Pig Rescue: [How to Treat Ringworm in Guinea Pigs](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=11&ved=2ahUKEwiwp_7G1-DnAhW1zMQBHQyeDkIQtwIwCnoECAsQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DCjk3InC8VZY&usg=AOvVaw3QgTWlzETPmuzeyNBgANZt)\n\nThird, go to the vet and get an oral medication! Treating ringworm from both the inside & the outside will drastically shorten the recovery time and lower the risk of a more serious infection happening. If symptoms persist for more than a week, you absolutely need to see the vet.\n\nFourth, here are some tips that made treatment easier for me:\n\n**Topical spot treatment:**\n\n* Spot clean the infected skin with saline on a cotton ball. This will remove any dead skin and soften scabs for removal. Don’t rip scabs off! Instead, let the saline sit and dab gently until they soften and come off easily. This can take a while, so be patient.\n* Use a simple athlete’s foot cream or yeast infection cream (just make sure it has Clotrimazole). You don’t need something specifically for guinea pigs.\n* Mix a little bit of vaseline with the cream. Reasons:\n\n1. It reduces dry skin and scabs, and makes them much easier to remove when they do form\n2. Wounds heal best when they are well-moisturized\n3. Scabs and dry skin act as a barrier to the medication, which prevents it from working They can also trap fungus and bacteria underneath, causing the infection to worsen\n\n* Use a paintbrush to apply the cream. I squeezed out the athlete’s foot cream and vaseline onto a saucer to make it easier to pick up on the brush\n* If your pig is squirmy or scared, hold them against your body and use a desk mirror to view their skin for treatment. I also used a desk lamp for better visibility.\n* Trim the hair around affected areas. It will make the area much easier to see, treat, and keep clean. (\\*I actually don’t know if this is a good idea, but it made spot treatment a lot easier)\n\n**Baths:**\n\n* Use basic anti-dandruff shampoo; no need for something fancy (just make sure it has zinc pyrithione. Head & Shoulders and Garnier Fructis are two relatively cheap and easy to find options)\n* Use a container, like a cooking pot, for their tub. The taller the walls, the better. This will prevent them from jumping out and scratching  your arms, as well as conserve water & shampoo.\n* Use a toothbrush to gently brush at their scabs and dead skin after they’ve soaked for 5-10 minutes.\n* Use a spaghetti strainer to easily rinse them after their bath\n* Use microfiber towels to dry them off (I used 3 washcloths per pig). They absorb water much better than regular towels, and are also great for gently wiping off any remaining scabs & dry skin.\n* Blow dry the pigs in a container (you can use the same one from their bath). This will keep the hot air around them longer so that they dry faster\n* If you have a space heater, run it in your bathroom with the door closed so your pigs are as warm as possible\n* If you have a heating pad, put them on it after their bath. I have a ledge above my radiator, so I set them there (still inside container) and they stopped shivering about five minutes later.\n\n**Your own safety:**\n\n* Wash your hands and arms with anti-dandruff shampoo after you handle the pigs or clean their cage. You can also wear disposable gloves for extra protection.\n* Wear an apron or an old shirt that you remove after you handle them, especially if you hold them against your body.\n* If you do infect yourself, put some of the athlete's foot cream on the spot and cover it up with a bandaid. You can also ask your doctor for oral fluconazole.",

Subjects also completed self-assessment questionnaires.\n\nResults: Statistically significant effects for functional ingredient-containing treatment regimen versus a placebo control shampoo formulation were observed for reduced hair shedding, increased total hair count, reduced TEWL and improvement in scalp biomarker values. Subjects also noticed these improvements assessed via self-assessment questionnaires.\n\nConclusions: These results establish that the use of functional antioxidant and barrier-enhancing agents to further improve scalp condition can enable a reduction in hair shedding and thus an increase in perceived hair fullness. The underlying improvements in scalp condition suggest the hair benefits were achieved as a result of improved scalp skin barrier and scalp condition leading to a viable preventative approach for hair thinning.\n\n[Link to Study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34424558)",

    "body": "I've always struggled with extending my wash days past 3 days purely because my scalp begins to itch. My scalp gets a bit oily, but because my hair is so coarse and dense, it looks perfectly clean, and the ends are always far too dry to shampoo again by Day 3. Sometimes if I do shampoo after 3 days, my scalp looks dry and scaly. Cowashing always seemed like a bad idea to me considering my scalp because I thought it would make my scalp even itchier but I decided I want to try it out anyway.\n\nOn my search for a cowash I found the **As I Am Itchy Scalp Cowash**, and since I heard good things about the Coconut Cowash I decided to try it. This cowash has zinc pyrithione which is what sets it apart from any other cowash I've seen. Zinc pyrithione is an antifungal, the same antifungal in Head and Shoulders, only its in a gentle cowash that won't strip your hair the way Head and Shoulders will. \n\n**How zinc pyrithione works:** you rub the cowash into your scalp and leave it on for a few minutes (say 5). This is important because in this time zinc pyrithione deposits as crystals into your scalp to prevent malassezia growth that leads to dandruff. This might sound scary but it's not toxic and is not absorbed into your body. The deposited zinc pyrithione will stay there and prevent fungal growth and itching over the next few days so you can extend your wash day for much, much longer - I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE A DREAM. (Sorry, the little pharmacist in me thought others would care how it worked)\n\nOn top of treating your dry, itchy scalp, it's also an amazing cowash!! It tingles which is so damn satisfying, and smells nice and herbal. It has pretty good slip, but you will probably need to condition after cowashing if you have dry hair like me. Now I can go 2 weeks without shampooing if I cowash every 3-4 days without itching. There's also a shampoo that I've started using, but if you had to choose one, definitely go with the cowash because you can leave it on your scalp for a couple minutes without worrying about drying out your hair!! \n\nWARNING - This will work if your itchy scalp is due to seborrheic dermatitis/dandruff (which in many cases is the cause). If you have very sensitive skin, please note that this cowash contains essential oils (tea tree, peppermint), as do MOST curly girl friendly products, unfortunately. People seem to think essential oils don't trigger allergic reactions in people with eczema because they are \"natural\", but that's not the case. So if you have eczema, be weary of this product, and most CGF products because fragrance may be making it worse.",

Not intended to be a professional guide or something but just a sharing of my personal experiences in the last several months of successfully controlling sebderm.\n\nNow my scalp is quite healthy: no itch, no soreness, normal shedding, no dandruff, very very mild redness after combatting shampoo for several months.\n\nEverything that I shared here is a result of extensive research looking into scientific evidence. But for convenience's sake, I will leave out the references in this post. I would post detailed references if asked on any specific point in the comment session.\n\n**Recap**\n\nSebderm is both internal and external. The following discussion is limited to external factors only. My routine/theory is based on the three/four-part components proposed earlier: (1) disrupt biofilm, (2) kill the yeast, (3) repair skin barrier, and (4) use gentler surfactants.\n\n**Hair Loss and Products**\n\nSince I also suffered from hair loss and scalp buildup, I prefer silicone-free shampoos and those with a shorter ingredient list.\n\n**Shampooing Frequency**\n\nMore frequent shampooing, even daily shampooing, does not cause hair loss or increased hair shedding. It is the irritation that causes increased hair shedding or hair loss, for example, by using a shampoo that is not suitable for your skin type, or allergy caused by certain ingredients in the shampoo.\n\nAfter trial and error, I found out that shampooing every other day (so about 4 times a week) works the best for me. If you have a dry scalp, you can shampoo less. But shampooing every 3-4 days when one has an oily and itchy scalp for fear of hair loss is not promoting good scalp health.\n\n**How I Built my Routine**\n\nMy current routine: (a) Neutrogena T/Sal Shampoo, (b) Sachajuan Scalp Shampoo, (c) Phillip Adam Apple Cider Vinegar Shampoo, and (d) Ciclopirox Shampoo.\n\nWhen washing my hair, I use a silicone scalp scrubber (available on amazon and is quite affordable) to apply the shampoo evenly to my scalp and to massage my scalp. This serves three purposes: loosen the scales, apply the active ingredient to every inch of the scalp, stimulate blood flow for healthy hair growth.\n\nAfter blow drying my hair, I apply (e) a hydrating scalp spray.\n\n**Rationale for (a) T/Sal Shampoo and Alternatives**\n\nT/Sal contains salicylic acid. It's an ingredient recommended and used by dermatologist in treating sebderm. It serves the following purposes in this routine: reduces sebum production, removes product buildup, loosen the flakes, calms down inflammation, and unclogs pores for healthy hair growth.\n\nIf T/Sal is not available, there are some alternatives: Psoriasin 3% Salicylic Acid Shampoo, Selsun Blue 3% Salicylic Shampoo, and DHS Sal Shampoo.\n\nI think applying liquid salicylic acid to the scalp 10-15 minutes before shampooing and then using a shampoo that doesn't contain the acid would also work. Paula's Choice 2% BHA Exfoliant seems a good choice, though I've never tried it myself. I've conducted research into each ingredient and it would seem that it is safe to be used on the scalp.\n\n**Rationale for (b) Sachajuan Shampoo and Alternatives**\n\n(b) Sachajuan Scalp Shampoo is a shampoo that contains a gentler or second-line antifungal. Another rationale is that it's good to use multiple antifungals in one routine. Alternatives are Philip Kingsley Shampoo for Flaky Scalp, Happy Cappy 1% Zinc Pyrithione Shampoo, Free and Clear Medicated Zinc Pyrithione Shampoo, Kamedis Zinc Pyrithione Shampoo. I personally don't use zinc pyrithione shampoos because they are often formulated with microplastics, which I avoid because of concern of plastic pollution. But feel free to choose what suits your needs and values.\n\n**Rationale for (c) Apple Cider Vinegar Shampoo and Alternatives**\n\nThe Apple Cider Vinegar is for disrupting the biofilm of the yeast that causes sebderm. It also uses gentler surfactants and is silicone-free. This shampoo is also great for maintaining a healthy PH balance of the scalp. Spraying diluted ACV directly on the scalp before shampooing would also help but I just think using this shampoo is more convenient. Some other alternatives are homemade 5% xylitol spray and dermaKB scalp Detoxifier.\n\n**Rationale for (d) Ciclopirox Shampoo and Alternatives**\n\n(d) here is about using a first-line stronger antifungal at least once a week. Alternatives are ketoconazole shampoo and selenium sulfide shampoos.\n\n**Rationale for (e) Hydrating Scalp Spray and Alternatives**\n\nThe scalp spray serves multiple purposes: repairing skin barrier, calming down inflammation, regulates sebum production, and encouraging skin healing. I'm using a DIY spray containing 2% panthenol, 2% glycerin, and 4% niacinamide in distilled water. For more information on making skincare yourself, check out the DIYBeauty subreddit.\n\nWhile I'm using one that I made myself, there are ready-to-use products on the market. I stumbled across this a few days ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/qrc53i/how\\_i\\_got\\_severe\\_sebderm\\_and\\_hair\\_loss\\_under/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/qrc53i/how_i_got_severe_sebderm_and_hair_loss_under/) (disclaimer: not affiliated).\n\nAloe vera? I tried using aloe vera gel but it causes some white stuff residue on my scalp so I'm sticking with my spray.\n\nWhen choosing toner for use on the scalp, it's best to choose a toner with a minimal ingredient list. The more ingredients, the higher the possibility of irritation to the skin.\n\n**MCT Oil?**\n\nMCT oil worked for me but I'm no longer using it because I don't like how it felt on my scalp. And since I have an oily scalp already prone to sebum buildup, I'm worried that frequent use of MCT oil may clog my scalp further.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have any questions! And I welcome a good, friendly, and productive discussion.",
